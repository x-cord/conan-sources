1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.100
We went skiing at a snowy mountain in winter

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
and helped a car that was stuck on the road.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.700
The driver of the car, Kengo Ishibashi,

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.000
later stabbed his passenger, Dr. Yokoyama to death with a knife.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.200
Ayumi happened to witness the crime being committed

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.300
while on a ski lift,

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
so The Youth Detective Squad

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.700
ended up being chased by the murderer Kengo Ishibashi.

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.100
What's that?

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.900
It's a cabin.

11
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.400
Thank goodness!

12
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.000
They've done it.

13
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.200
Come on, let's go!

14
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800
Yes.

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Just you wait, you brats.

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200
The love for deduction and the exhilaration of

17
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
unravelling mysteries that comes before sleep!

18
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.400
The culprit approaches within a blizzard and there is no escape!

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.900
"Whiteout (Part 2)"

23
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.100
We are looking for missing children.

24
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.900
Conan Edogawa, Genta Kojima,

25
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.900
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya and Ayumi Yoshida from Beika-cho,

26
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.200
please come to the main information centre.

27
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.800
Your guardian is waiting for you.

28
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
It doesn't look like they are coming.

29
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.400
Goodness, where on earth have those children gone?

30
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.900
Should I make the announcement again?

31
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.500
Please do. If they happen to come by here later...

32
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.100
Of course, we will contact you immediately by phone.

33
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.600
Please don't worry.

34
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.300
I will leave the matter to you, then.

35
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000
The number you have dialled...

36
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.800
Where on earth have they gone?

37
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.600
In the end, they're only kids.

38
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.200
They aren't careful enough to hide their footprints.

39
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.800
Excuse me, boss.

40
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.000
Are you sure you want those kids dead?

41
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.400
Are you saying you want me to turn back now?

42
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.300
After all, I've already killed another man.

43
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000
Are we killing every one of them?

44
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.900
Yes. Don't leave anyone alive.

45
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.600
If we leave them buried under the snow with Yokoyama,

46
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.000
no one will find out until spring comes.

47
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.800
Man, what a terrible thing to do the first thing after waking up.

48
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.400
If you two had caught them quickly,

49
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.900
we wouldn't have such a hard time now.

50
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.700
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.300
Let's hurry.

52
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.100
If we don't catch them before the snow turns into a blizzard,

53
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.000
the footprints will...

54
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.800
The footprints are gone.

55
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.600
This is...

56
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.300
The brats must have done this!

57
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.800
"Please contact me immediately. Agasa."

58
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.500
And send.

59
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.300
I hate to think about it,

60
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.500
but those kids must be involved in a kind of trouble again.

61
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.700
It's a little cold.

62
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.300
But still, it's a lot better than being outside.

63
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.700
Yes. But how long do we have to stay here?

64
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.400
We used our snowboard to help us cover our tracks,

65
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.300
so we should safe here for a while.

66
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.500
But we don't know how soon they'll catch up to us.

67
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.500
That said, we might get lost in the snow if we go out carelessly.

68
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.900
The weather might get worse soon,

69
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.700
so it's difficult to decide what we should do.

70
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.100
What do I do? Maybe I should move to another cabin on my own.

71
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.900
Or...

72
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.200
If only I could get a signal on my smartphone.

73
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.400
-The call went through! -What?

74
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.400
Come on. Dr. Agasa, please pick up.

75
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.000
-Hello. -Dr. Agasa, it's me!

76
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.600
-He picked up! -Yes!

77
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.700
Where are you now? Are you all right?

78
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.400
Dr. Agasa, the phone signal isn't stable, so please listen!

79
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.800
We're being chased by that Ishibashi guy and his lackeys!

80
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.300
What did you say?

81
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.500
We're being chased!

82
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.900
Please come and help us!

83
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.500
Please, Dr. Agasa!

84
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.100
Guys, shut up.

85
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.100
We're being chased because when Ayumi was on the ski lift,

86
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.500
she watched the moment Ishibashi killed another man.

87
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.500
Right now, we're in a semi-detached cabin.

88
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.600
The weather is getting worse. Call the rescue team right away.

89
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.900
Please say that again. I can't hear you.

90
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.200
The police! Please call the police and rescue team!

91
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.800
Ishibashi and his lackeys are hanging around nearby!

92
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.800
About Ishibashi...

93
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.400
-What? -I...

94
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.000
Dr. Agasa? Dr. Agasa!

95
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500
It's no good. The call was cut off.

96
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.100
But you were able to talk to Dr. Agasa, right?

97
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.200
The phone signal wasn't stable,

98
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.700
so I'm not sure how much of the call went through.

99
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.200
So you're saying that help might not come for us?

100
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.700
Well, I can't deny that possibility.

101
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.900
No way.

102
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.600
I'm kind of getting hungry.

103
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.200
The blizzard is getting stronger.

104
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.600
Don't worry about it!

105
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.700
That's right! Things will work out somehow!

106
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.200
We're here with you!

107
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.500
Okay!

108
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.700
The blizzard's getting stronger.

109
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.100
Where did those kids go?

110
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.000
Let's get out of here.

111
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.700
Get out of here? In this blizzard?

112
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.100
Yes.

113
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.100
But why?

114
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.400
The first reason is that

115
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.600
the cabin may not hold up for much longer.

116
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.400
Honestly, I don't think it can withstand this blizzard.

117
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.000
The second reason is that they are coming for us.

118
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.800
Third, we can use a landline phone if we go to the other cabin.

119
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.900
A landline phone?

120
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.700
That's right. When we were on the road to the ski area,

121
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.800
I saw electrical and phone cables extending from the other cabin.

122
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.000
With a landline phone,

123
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.700
we can make calls without worrying about phone signals!

124
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.600
That means we can call for help, right?

125
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.000
At the very least, there's electricity.

126
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.500
If we can make it to the other cabin, we can bear the cold.

127
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.900
We shouldn't sit around and talk anymore.

128
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.300
But we can't see anything outside.

129
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.200
It'll be all right.

130
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.700
Now I get it!

131
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.600
With this, we don't have to worry about getting separated.

132
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.300
Just as expected from you, Conan!

133
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.700
Still, there's a blizzard out there.

134
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.500
Let's be careful.

135
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.900
Yes.

136
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.200
It's a whiteout.

137
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.100
Oh, no! I can't see anything!

138
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.900
Everything is all white!

139
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.300
Conan!

140
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.000
Stay calm!

141
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.700
Use the rope and take each step carefully!

142
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.900
Got that?

143
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.400
Okay!

144
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.700
The other cabin is over there.

145
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.600
Let's go!

146
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200
I can't see a thing.

147
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.900
It would have been dangerous if I didn't have the rope and my glasses.

148
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.000
Look out!

149
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.900
Oh, no, my glasses.

150
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.600
The rope has been cut.

151
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.500
Ayumi?

152
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.300
Genta?

153
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.100
Mitsuhiko?

154
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.700
Ayumi! Genta! Mitsuhiko!

155
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.300
If you can hear me, answer me!

156
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.500
Guys!

157
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.400
I can manage on my own, but those guys...

158
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.900
There's no caller ID.

159
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.100
Hey, kid.

160
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.400
Ishibashi?

161
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.700
I bet you're thinking, 'How did you get my phone number?'

162
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.000
You asked Dr. Agasa for it, didn't you?

163
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.800
It's not surprising at all.

164
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.200
You're such a cheeky brat. I'm coming for you, so you just wait.

165
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.800
And it's not just you.

166
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.300
I'll break your friends' necks too,

167
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.200
and bury you all under the snow.

168
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.100
You can be sure of it.

169
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.700
Even if you're clever, you're still just a kid.

170
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.200
There's only so much that you can do.

171
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.800
You're as good as dead, unlike me!

172
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.500
Kid! You're just a brat!

173
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.100
A weak little child who can't do anything!

174
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.300
Boss.

175
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.200
The call was disconnected.

176
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.500
How much more is that kid going to make a fool of me

177
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.400
until he's satisfied?

178
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.900
Gosh, the battery went out just as I finally got a phone signal.

179
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.500
I have to find everyone.

180
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.200
Think.

181
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.700
First, I have to find my glasses.

182
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.900
From the way it fell.

183
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.100
Calculate the distance by which it flew.

184
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.200
My glasses are over there!

185
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.100
Guys, can you hear me?

186
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.600
Don't move! I'll make my way to you!

187
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.400
I must have hurt my leg.

188
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.200
Wait for me.

189
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.500
My glasses should be around here.

190
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.900
Where is it?

191
00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.400
Where is it? It should be right here.

192
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.700
I have to find it now, or everyone's going to freeze.

193
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600
Found it.

194
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.500
I have to hurry.

195
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.700
Hold on! What's going on now?

196
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.100
Come on, just for one moment! So fix yourself!

197
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.500
Come on!

198
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.000
Guys.

199
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.000
I'm hungry.

200
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800
It's cold.

201
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.700
If this goes on, am I...

202
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.700
Am I going to die?

203
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.700
Somebody help me.

204
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.000
Conan.

205
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.400
I can't take it anymore.

206
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Ayumi!

207
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.800
Sorry, it took me so long.

208
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.700
Conan, I...

209
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.800
I had always thought you would come!

210
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.000
Yes.

211
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.400
Sorry for making you wait, Genta.

212
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.500
You're late.

213
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.900
Mitsuhiko, you must have waited for quite a while.

214
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.100
This much is nothing for me.

215
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.500
It stopped working.

216
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.500
It's okay. Just have to go along this way.

217
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.700
There's the cabin!

218
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.000
We'll be able to get help!

219
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.800
We did it!

220
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.100
Now that we're here, things will work out for us.

221
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.100
All right, let's go inside and find a heater and a phone!

222
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.500
Conan!

223
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.200
Look out!

224
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.100
Good. Let's go.

225
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.700
Hey, Conan!

226
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.400
Answer us!

227
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.500
Conan!

228
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.700
Conan! Conan!

229
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.100
Conan!

230
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.800
Answer us, Conan!

231
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.600
Conan!

232
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.600
"Okuyama Central Hospital"

233
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.900
Guys...

234
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.100
Where am I?

235
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.200
It looks like he has woken up.

236
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.500
This is the hospital.

237
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.200
Hospital?

238
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.600
Have you forgotten, Conan?

239
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.900
You were hit by a clump of snow and got knocked out.

240
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.600
Snow?

241
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.500
Was that it?

242
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.300
Dr. Agasa! What about the case?

243
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.000
What happened to Ishibashi?

244
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.700
-Ouch. -Look, you have to lie down.

245
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.500
You say that, but...

246
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.500
Don't worry about it. Dr. Agasa has taken care of everything.

247
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.600
I got a call from you,

248
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.500
so I thought things must have been pretty rough.

249
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500
I called the police,

250
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:51.000
coordinated a rescue team and headed towards that cabin.

251
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.200
All of us carried you inside.

252
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.800
And we found the victim at the place Ayumi said it happened.

253
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.000
The police have also arranged for a wide-area search

254
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.300
for Ishibashi and his men.

255
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.700
And?

256
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.500
Don't worry, those three have been apprehended.

257
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.500
The rescue team found them in the mountains

258
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.400
while they were sheltering from the blizzard

259
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.300
and they turned themselves in on the spot.

260
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.200
Conan went back to sleep.

261
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.700
He must have been really tired.

262
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.300
Is he not hungry?

263
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.700
He worked so hard in that blizzard after all.

264
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.400
The culprits have all been apprehended.

265
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.800
Thank goodness for that.

266
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.100
Yes, while I was asleep.

267
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.700
Apparently, the two accomplices

268
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.000
were Ishibashi's subordinates at his workplace.

269
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.400
They revealed a lot so that they could get lesser sentences.

270
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.600
Goodness, someone gets killed over medicine

271
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.800
that's supposed to save people.

272
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.000
Not again.

273
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.400
What do we do, Dr. Agasa?

274
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.600
Well, by all rights, I'd want to avoid trouble.

275
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.800
But let's help them.
