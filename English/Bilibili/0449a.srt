1
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:07,966
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,866
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,266
Here comes the one hour summer special!

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,566
A serial killer tries to murder a bride and groom

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,366
at a wedding party full of cops.

6
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:15,866
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,666
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,266
You did it.

10
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,766
Finally! Finally the day has come!

11
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,266
Defeating all my rivals,

12
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,466
I am now going to have eternal love with her!

13
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,366
Ms. Sato!

14
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,066
Takagi!

15
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,266
Yumi? Is that Yumi?

16
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,866
Takagi!

17
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,466
No, it is not Yumi that I'm going to marry.

18
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,966
Not you, Yumi!

19
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,466
Congratulations, Yumi!

20
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,666
I'm happy for you, Yumi!

21
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,866
Wait a second!

22
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,766
I can't talk?

23
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,666
I can't move my body either.

24
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,866
Please help, Chiba!

25
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,066
Congratulations.

26
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:29,266
Hey! Chiba, how can you eat a hamburger now?

27
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,466
Inspector Megure?

28
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:33,766
-Right, left. Right... -It's no good.

29
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,066
Takagi...

30
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,366
Congratulations, Takagi.

31
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,266
No. This is not what you think, Mr. Shiratori.

32
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,766
Gosh, what should I do?

33
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,866
This is bad.

34
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,566
Ms. Sato!

35
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,066
Congratulations...

36
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,266
Takagi!

37
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,866
Ouch.

38
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,066
That hurts...

39
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:05,366
It was a dream. That hurts, but I'm glad it was only a dream.

40
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:16,466
"Love Story of Metropolitan Detectives: Fake Wedding"

41
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,366
This is yours.

42
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,366
-Thanks. -No problem.

43
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,766
Well, that was a nice wedding.

44
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:40,866
It was.

45
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:43,866
But it would've been nicer if I caught that bouquet.

46
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,366
Oh, please. You're too young for that.

47
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:51,666
Or do you have someone that proposed to you already?

48
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,466
Well, not really.

49
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,066
I just want to wear a wedding dress.

50
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:05,266
Then I'll get you a cheap rental one.

51
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,766
You can wear it and take a picture of yourself.

52
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:07,766
Nevermind.

53
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,866
It'll still be expensive though.

54
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,066
No, please don't!

55
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,366
-Come on! It's just for a little while. -The voice sounds familiar.

56
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,366
Come on!

57
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,966
What are you...

58
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,866
Officer Takagi?

59
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:24,366
-You're going to get married? -Congratulations!

60
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,466
Well, no...

61
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,966
Why do I have to see them at a time like this?

62
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:31,166
So who's the bride?

63
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,766
Don't be foolish, Dad. It must be Officer Sato.

64
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,066
Wrong answer!

65
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,566
The bride is me!

66
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,566
Yumi...

67
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,166
-You are Yumi Miyamoto? -What? I thought you liked...

68
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,966
I thought you liked Officer Sato, didn't you?

69
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,566
Well, it's a long story.

70
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,766
Well, well.

71
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,766
You guys look awesome together.

72
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,066
Inspector Shiratori.

73
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:58,966
Why don't you get married with her right now?

74
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,666
Yeah, that's a good idea, darling!

75
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,466
Hey, Yumi.

76
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,466
Miwako.

77
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,066
You know what's going on, right?

78
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,366
You guys are the target today.

79
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,866
Yes, I know that all too well!

80
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,666
And you're also going too far!

81
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,266
Yes. I know.

82
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,066
-Hey... -What in the world is happening here right now?

83
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,666
Well, actually...

84
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,666
Inspector Megure!

85
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:26,266
What? Someone is trying to kill them?

86
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,966
Why Takagi and Yumi though?

87
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,466
Actually, they are the fake target.

88
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:37,666
The true target is the bride and the groom who called us for help.

89
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:42,866
Six months ago, a masked robber broke into the bride's house.

90
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,766
She was lucky because the groom happened to be there and chased him out.

91
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,966
But the robber said this before running away...

92
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,166
You...

93
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,066
I will never forgive you.

94
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,566
But that's what typical bad guys usually say, isn't it?

95
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,366
Why do they have to pretend to be the target?

96
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:02,166
It wouldn't be like this if it were a plain robbery.

97
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:06,166
We found fingerprints on a cooking knife

98
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,666
that happened to match the fingerprints of a man,

99
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,866
who is the suspect of four robbery cases.

100
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:14,466
The robber took six lives during that time.

101
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:20,866
Firstly, he broke into the house silently, so nobody noticed him.

102
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,466
Then he killed the victim by stabbing the throat with a knife.

103
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,866
After he took all the valuables

104
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,966
and set the house on fire, he immediately ran away.

105
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:32,866
And the night before yesterday,

106
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:36,366
a piece of paper was found in the bride's mailbox.

107
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:42,266
It said, "Happy marriage. My present should be coming to you soon."

108
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,366
I see.

109
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:47,166
Now I understand why you guys are disguised as the bride and groom.

110
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,766
But why does it have to be Officer Takagi and Officer Yumi?

111
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:51,966
What?

112
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,866
Are you saying that I'm not good enough for him?

113
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,366
Well, no...

114
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,966
What else could we do?

115
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:04,366
The bride, Rei Masudo, and the groom, Masateru Taira look like this.

116
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,166
Here.

117
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,166
I see.

118
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,766
They look just like Takagi and the girl on the police car.

119
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,066
Really?

120
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:16,166
Then, does the real wedding has been cancelled?

121
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,466
No. The real wedding will be held, as the bride really wanted to.

122
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,466
Well, police officers will be standing at the building entrance

123
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,166
so people with no invitation cannot come in.

124
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,066
So I suppose the only chance the killer can attack them

125
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:31,566
is when the bride and groom come out of the church after the ceremony.

126
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:34,866
That's when Takagi and Yumi will come to play.

127
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,466
Of course, they'll be wearing protective vests.

128
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:42,166
Plus, all the wedding attendants will be undercover officers.

129
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,966
Is it really going to be okay though?

130
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,866
You never know how the killer is going to attack you, you know.

131
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,366
Don't worry about that.

132
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:52,866
If anything happens, Miwako is going to come and save us.

133
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,366
-Right? -Yeah.

134
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,266
I will save Takagi first though.

135
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,266
Gosh! You choose affection over friendship?

136
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,066
I can't believe it!

137
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,866
What can I say?

138
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,366
It is more likely that the groom is going to be attacked

139
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:09,166
because he is the one who chased the killer out.

140
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,166
Besides, you are too close to him.

141
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,266
Miwako.

142
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:17,866
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

143
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,366
Sorry if I'm wrong,

144
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:22,566
but you came to the wedding ceremony of Mr. Taira and Ms. Masudo?

145
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:23,566
Yes.

146
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,166
Then, all of you as well?

147
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,966
Yeah.

148
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,566
It's going to be at the third ceremony hall at 5 o'clock, right?

149
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,666
All right, see you at the hall then.

150
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,166
Hey.

151
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,766
Good luck, Rei.

152
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:43,066
Let's see, the third ceremony hall is that way, I think.

153
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,966
Hi, Ms. Masudo.

154
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,166
I'm Karube.

155
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,166
Thank you for the invitation.

156
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,166
This is the first time we see each other in person, right?

157
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,366
Yeah.

158
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,266
All right, looking forward to see you at the ceremony hall.

159
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:57,966
They completely believe that you're Ms. Masudo.

160
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,766
Does she look that much like her?

161
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,366
Maybe it's a sign that you guys are a perfect match.

162
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,066
Inspector Shiratori...

163
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,566
Maybe that's why I had that dream this morning.

164
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,866
All right, I don't want you to get into unnecessary trouble.

165
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:14,266
You guys wait in your room until the ceremony.

166
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,266
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

167
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,066
Actually, people are coming in and out of this hall,

168
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,166
so why don't you wait in the other room?

169
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,466
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

170
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:26,766
Now, we should talk to the bride and groom about the situation.

171
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:27,966
-Yeah, we should. -Yes!

172
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,866
See you later then, Mouri!

173
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:32,666
Yes, sir! Please be careful!

174
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,866
Hey, why don't you go with them?

175
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:35,966
What?

176
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,566
You're that famous Detective Mouri.

177
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:41,066
You should go and help them.

178
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,566
You're right.

179
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,066
-Hey! Wait, Inspector! -Dad!

180
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,266
-I'm coming, too! -Hey, Conan!

181
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,766
-Excuse me. -Do I know you?

182
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,866
I'm sorry. You look just like my friend.

183
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,466
Hey, hey.

184
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,766
What are you talking about, Rei?

185
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:04,466
Today is an important day that we've been working on together.

186
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:07,166
Please don't say that we should cancel it now.

187
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,766
But, Masateru, somebody is trying to kill us.

188
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:14,566
What if something happens to the guests we invited here today?

189
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:17,566
Don't worry. He isn't going to come.

190
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,466
Trust me.

191
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:20,466
But...

192
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,066
Sorry to intrude.

193
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,366
Inspector.

194
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,466
How is it? Any news?

195
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,766
So far, nothing.

196
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:34,566
We put our officers on the inside and outside of this hall.

197
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:37,066
Plus, we're going to be with you guys when you move around.

198
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,466
So there's nothing to worry about.

199
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,566
See? You don't need to worry about anything.

200
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,466
By the way, who is the gentleman behind you?

201
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:47,566
He is Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

202
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,166
He just happened to be here today.

203
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,866
Hello.

204
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,366
That famous detective?

205
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,666
So you're the Sleeping Kogoro?

206
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,766
I'll be helping you guys. I'll try my best.

207
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,866
Now, I need you to tell me about the incident

208
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:03,366
that happened six months ago in detail.

209
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,366
All right.

210
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,466
It was a snowy night,

211
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,866
actually midnight, past 12 o'clock.

212
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,466
I woke up as I heard a weird noise.

213
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,666
I tried to turn on the light, but it didn't turn on somehow.

214
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,266
It was weird.

215
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,166
So I went to where the noise was coming from.

216
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:28,166
The man saw me and tried to attack me with the knife that he had.

217
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,966
I ran away desperately in the darkness.

218
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,366
But he caught me at the front door.

219
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:40,266
Seriously, I thought I was going to die.

220
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:43,266
But my husband came from the front door and saved me.

221
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,366
Actaually, I had a bad feeling that night,

222
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,866
because she told me that her parents were out on a trip,

223
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:54,566
and there were only two elderly servants in her house.

224
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,166
Then, he and the robber started fighting.

225
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,666
Hurry and call the police!

226
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,666
So I went back to my room and called the police.

227
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,966
When I came back, the man was telling Masateru something,

228
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,266
and he ran away.

229
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,866
So that's when he said, "I will never forgive you"?

230
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:18,166
-Yeah. -So, were you both okay?

231
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,966
I didn't have any injury at all,

232
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,666
but he was injured on his left hand.

233
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,466
I landed on my left wrist at a bad angle

234
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,666
while struggling with the robber

235
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,766
and I broke my left wrist and thumb.

236
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,566
I actually had a cast on my left arm until last week.

237
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,566
But we should've gone to that place

238
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,566
if we knew that things were going to be like this.

239
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,066
Where is that place?

240
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,566
Her father told her that we should leave Japan for a while

241
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:46,766
because such a dangerous man was trying to hurt her.

242
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:50,766
So he bought us a cottage in Hawaii.

243
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,666
That sounds good!

244
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,766
There, we don't need to worry about a robbery like the other one

245
00:13:56,766 --> 00:14:00,466
because we got all the security systems in the house.

246
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,366
What do you mean "the other one"?

247
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,366
There was a robbery in your house as well?

248
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,566
Yeah. It was in his house.

249
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:10,766
It happened while she and I were out.

250
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,866
Anything stolen?

251
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,266
Nothing.

252
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,866
Just that my computer was on after the robbery.

253
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,566
Excuse me.

254
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,966
This is Megure.

255
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:26,666
Hey, Chiba.

256
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,666
What? There's a burned dead body with the throat slashed?

257
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,866
Yes.

258
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:33,066
It was found in an empty warehouse by Teimuzu River.

259
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,266
It was a man between the age of 30 to 40 years old,

260
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,966
wearing a dark blue suit with a white tie.

261
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:42,366
I also got important information from the forensic officer just now.

262
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,866
Under his left fingernails...

263
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:48,366
You found fingerprints from the burglar and serial killer?

264
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:53,066
A white tie, so it was formal attire.

265
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:57,966
Hey, did your computer have the guest list for the wedding in it?

266
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:01,266
Yeah. We made that in his room together.

267
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:04,966
That means the burned dead body could be one of guests on the list.

268
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,966
The killer murdered him in order to get the invitation.

269
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:12,566
So it is possible that the killer is already in this wedding hall.

270
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:24,145
We have to cancel the wedding.

271
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:27,045
Stop all the weddings in this wedding hall

272
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:31,145
and get all the people out of here!

273
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,545
I don't want so many people here with a killer on loose.

274
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,545
It's best to get everyone out now.

275
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:39,845
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

276
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:42,845
Hold on a minute, Inspector.

277
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:45,245
It's a wedding.

278
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,045
You can't just cancel and ruin our important day

279
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:51,345
without concrete evidence that the killer is here.

280
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,945
But, Mr. Taira,

281
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:55,245
it is likely that you're going to be attacked,

282
00:15:55,245 --> 00:16:01,145
because you fought the robber that broke into Ms. Masudo's house.

283
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:06,445
Also, a blackmail was sent to Ms. Masudo's mailbox two days ago.

284
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:10,445
And now, we found a burned dead body

285
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,645
with his throat slashed in the warehouse.

286
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:15,045
Not only the method of homicide was the same,

287
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:19,445
even the serial killer's fingerprints were also found on the victim's nail.

288
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,345
Not to mention that the victim was dressed in formal wear,

289
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,745
and after someone broke into your apartment,

290
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:29,245
your computer that was off was turned on when you came back.

291
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:33,545
It is reasonable to think that the robber was the serial killer.

292
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:36,445
He stole the guest list for this wedding from your computer,

293
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,745
called someone on the list

294
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:41,645
and murdered him in order to get the invitation.

295
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:45,245
And with that invitation, the killer may be here

296
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,445
in this wedding hall right now.

297
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:51,945
That's right. He's trying to take revenge on you at your ceremony.

298
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,845
But we don't even know if the dead body was one of our guests or not.

299
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:03,445
Inspector Megure, we got something for the bride and groom.

300
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:06,045
It needs to be opened right now.

301
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:09,245
What is that?

302
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,545
Who gave you that?

303
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:14,545
Well, the hall staff gave me this,

304
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,845
so I don't know where this came from.

305
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,145
Hey, hey!

306
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:20,345
How could you bring such an unidentified thing here in this situation?

307
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,745
Well, but...

308
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,245
Actually, I've checked it already.

309
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,245
All right, I see.

310
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,545
Oh, it's from Ms. Shimizu.

311
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:33,145
You know, our chat friend.

312
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,545
Then this must be that video.

313
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,145
"Chat friend"?

314
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:41,945
We are into this internet website of hot springs right now.

315
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:44,545
And we're planning to have a party after the ceremony

316
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:47,845
with the people on the website.

317
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:51,045
And this is the video we are planning to play during the party.

318
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:54,345
We asked Ms. Shimizu to check it before the party.

319
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:56,645
I guess she finally finished editing it.

320
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:57,945
Let me take a look.

321
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,845
A day with Mr. Taira and Rei.

322
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:04,245
Last month, Mr. Taira chased a robber out.

323
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:05,745
Their relationship has become closer and tighter

324
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:07,445
and they have finally got engaged.

325
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,945
Now, what does their lovely life look like? Let's take a look.

326
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:14,145
-What? You came already? -Yes.

327
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,145
Where is this?

328
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,145
-The front door of my apartment. -Wait a second.

329
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,345
I'll get ready real quick, okay?

330
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:19,745
All right.

331
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,745
Is Ms. Shimizu the one shooting this?

332
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:24,445
Yes. We found out that we live close to each other.

333
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,445
So we became close friends in the real world as well.

334
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:28,645
Sorry to keep you waiting.

335
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,045
-We're heading to Tropical Land, right? -Yes.

336
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,345
You put your key on the light.

337
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,945
Do you always put it there?

338
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:38,845
Yes, it's my habit.

339
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:41,745
That means Ms. Shimizu could pick up the key

340
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,245
and break into your house any time.

341
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,645
She's not that kind of person!

342
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:49,545
She was the one who suggested

343
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,645
that we should report the robbery to the police.

344
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:56,045
She suggested it? You didn't tell the police about the robbery?

345
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:59,645
Yeah, because nothing was stolen.

346
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,445
But just in case,

347
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,445
the date of the wedding was postponed to the next day

348
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,145
than what was written on the list.

349
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,345
Even if the robber broke into my house and saw the list,

350
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,545
he can't come here.

351
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:16,945
But still, the killer could've called someone from the guest list,

352
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:19,045
pretending to be your friend

353
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,545
and confirm when the wedding was going to be

354
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:25,545
or even tell him to come see him, right?

355
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:32,145
Then, why don't the bride and groom go and see their guests in person?

356
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:37,145
The bad man may be there pretending to be your friend, right?

357
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,845
Right.

358
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,445
Seeing the guests in person?

359
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,245
What if the killer attacks them?

360
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,445
Well, seeing them in person maybe impossible,

361
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:49,045
but we can hide in the next room and check them out.

362
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:52,845
That sounds reasonable under this situation.

363
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,845
It's worth trying.

364
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,645
We don't want to trigger the killer's criminal act

365
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,445
by cancelling the ceremony all of a sudden.

366
00:19:58,445 --> 00:19:59,645
That's true.

367
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,445
Will you please confirm the guests?

368
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:04,045
Okay.

369
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,445
Sure.

370
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:08,845
Sato, tell Takagi and Yumi

371
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:12,845
that the killer may already be in this building

372
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:18,645
and that there's a possibility that they are going to be attacked.

373
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,245
Understood.

374
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,045
And one more thing, Sato.

375
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:25,345
You need to stay here to protect the real bride and groom.

376
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:26,345
Yes, sir!

377
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,845
Masateru, I'm so scared.

378
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,845
Don't worry. I'm with you.

379
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:39,145
Hey, guys! Look at me!

380
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,145
Tell me, how do I look?

381
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,245
Do I look good?

382
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,945
Really? Yumi, are you going to get married?

383
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,045
Are you kidding me?

384
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,245
I'm not going to get married.

385
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,845
It's part of my job!

386
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:51,645
Hey, Yumi.

387
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:54,445
I don't think you should be talking about this mission to outsiders.

388
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,645
Yeah, I know that, idiot!

389
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,245
Don't you interrupt my phone conversation, okay?

390
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,345
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:02,145
What? That man's voice?

392
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,045
No, it's from the television.

393
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:07,345
Gosh. She is totally opposite from a while ago.

394
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:10,345
Girls are so unpredictable.

395
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:13,545
The bride is me!

396
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:16,645
Anyway, why was I having that dream this morning?

397
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,945
I know we are the scapegoat of the bride and groom

398
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,345
but we don't have to have a wedding ceremony.

399
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,745
That must be a prophetic dream.

400
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:24,445
There's a subconscious desire deep inside your head

401
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,045
that you want to marry Kitada.

402
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,545
You're just not aware of it yet.

403
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,545
What? That can't be true.

404
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:32,345
Kitada? Why that nerd?

405
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:35,445
But people say, "Truth often comes out from lies."

406
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:38,645
I think it's fate that you and Kitada will be together!

407
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,945
Prophetic dream? Subconscious desire?

408
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,345
No way!

409
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,245
Ms. Sato.

410
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,245
That's nonsense.

411
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,545
There's no such thing as prophetic dreams or subconscious desires.

412
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,245
There's no truth behind them.

413
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,545
What are you talking about, Officer Takagi?

414
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:57,945
What are you doing here anyway?

415
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,145
You should be waiting in that room. Inspector told you so, right?

416
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:01,945
Yeah.

417
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,145
What do you mean by that?

418
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:06,045
You shouldn't be listening to our conversation!

419
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,345
That's right.

420
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:09,045
Okay. Let's go, Ms. Sato!

421
00:22:09,045 --> 00:22:11,245
Please, stay still.

422
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:15,145
Why did you have to break your arm just before our wedding?

423
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:16,345
Ms. Sato.

424
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:22,045
What is wrong with that couple?

425
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,145
Ms. Sato?
