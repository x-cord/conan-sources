1
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.610
That was delicious.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.990
I'm full, too.

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.240
What a truly delicious meal.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.440
Given its effect on Japan's economy,

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.930
we can afford this kind
of luxury once in a while.

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.500
Hey, kid. Don't forget to thank me.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.910
You're right. Thanks, Mister.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.650
Finally, a word from Kureno-san.

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.510
Thanks for holding this
company dissolution party.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.610
Are they the guests in the private room?

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.770
Sounds like it.

12
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.610
Thanks to all of you, this term our
company did the best it's ever done.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.280
Unfortunately, despite our success,
we've decided to sell the company.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.790
Kureno Jiro (38)
President of Online
Shopping Site "Clerno"

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.860
This decision was made with
all of our interests in mind.
Kureno Jiro (38)
President of Online
Shopping Site "Clerno"

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.540
This decision was made with
all of our interests in mind.

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.400
I'm not abandoning you and running away.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.490
Make sure you don't resent me for this.

19
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.210
Hold on.

20
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.700
Kamijo Hiroo (30)
"Clerno" Employee/Web Designer
Hold on.

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.630
I don't agree with the
decision to sell at all.
Kamijo Hiroo (30)
"Clerno" Employee/Web Designer

22
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.300
I don't agree with the
decision to sell at all.

23
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.590
He's right. Wouldn't we
normally discuss this first?

24
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.920
Koshimoto Eiji (38)
"Clerno" Employee/Merchandise
He's right. Wouldn't we
normally discuss this first?

25
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.010
It's too sudden.
Koshimoto Eiji (38)
"Clerno" Employee/Merchandise

26
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800
It's too sudden.

27
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.620
Narita Mayu (34)
"Clerno" Employee/Accounting

28
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.910
It's fine.
Narita Mayu (34)
"Clerno" Employee/Accounting

29
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.810
You guys know our president isn't the type
of person to explain every little thing.
Narita Mayu (34)
"Clerno" Employee/Accounting

30
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.520
You guys know our president isn't the type
of person to explain every little thing.

31
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.890
Now, now.

32
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.090
Toda Junnosuke (33)
"Clerno" Employee/Public Relations
Now, now.

33
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.850
Sir, thank you for all your hard work.
Toda Junnosuke (33)
"Clerno" Employee/Public Relations

34
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.360
This isn't much, but it's a
reflection of how we feel.

35
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.850
What's this?

36
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.750
Thank you.

37
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.870
Guys, thinking back, I know things
were tough when we first started,

38
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.130
but the company grew this much
because we worked together.

39
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.980
I'm overjoyed that we made it to today.

40
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.070
I can't breathe...

41
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.250
Sir?

42
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.890
Th-This is a joke, right?

43
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.890
Kureno!

44
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.020
I-It's an emergency.

45
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810
Narita-san, call an ambulance!

46
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.770
Got it.

47
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.520
Seriously?

48
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.510
Are you okay, Kureno?

49
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.200
Kureno?

50
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.990
Hey, Kureno!

51
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.490
Kureno!

52
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.270
Kureno!

53
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.660
Find the question that solves the mystery!

54
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.760
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

55
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.920
A dissolving company hosts its last party!

56
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.360
Identify the motives of all the witnesses!

57
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.970
Always determining the one truth

58
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.590
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

59
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.180
his name is Detective Conan!

60
00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:17.648
The Company Dissolution Party

61
00:04:17.648 --> 00:04:20.108
"The Company Dissolution Party!"
The Company Dissolution Party

62
00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:22.948
The Company Dissolution Party

63
00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:28.458
The deceased is the president of online
shopping website "Clerno", Kureno Jiro-san.

64
00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:32.708
He came here today to eat with his staff.

65
00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:36.178
And the man who reported the incident is...

66
00:04:36.178 --> 00:04:37.278
Inspector.

67
00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:40.018
Mori-kun.

68
00:04:41.618 --> 00:04:45.668
I happened to be eating
in the hall over there.

69
00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.478
I came running when I heard shouting.

70
00:04:48.478 --> 00:04:52.508
Mori-kun, you didn't witness the death?

71
00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:53.978
I didn't see anything.

72
00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:57.358
So, what's the cause of death?

73
00:04:57.628 --> 00:05:01.128
We believe he was poisoned.

74
00:05:01.128 --> 00:05:01.908
Poisoned?

75
00:05:04.118 --> 00:05:06.658
Judging by the photo stuck to the bouquet,

76
00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:09.788
all the employees seemed to get along.

77
00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:11.288
Huh?

78
00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:12.918
What's this?

79
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:16.838
Hey, is this mark on his neckâ€”

80
00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:18.748
C-Conan-kun?

81
00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:20.108
You're always sticking your
nose where it doesn't belong!

82
00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:20.928
Ow!
You're always sticking your
nose where it doesn't belong!

83
00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:23.098
Conan-kun, you shouldn't do that.

84
00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:24.428
Go someplace else.

85
00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:26.558
Sorry.

86
00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:30.848
Jeez. Anyway, what's this mark on his neck?

87
00:05:30.848 --> 00:05:32.268
Oh, right.

88
00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:37.548
The bouquet Kureno-san received during the
meal had a poison needle hidden in it.

89
00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:42.698
When he took the bouquet in his hands,
the needle stabbed and poisoned him.

90
00:05:42.698 --> 00:05:44.948
It left a mark on his neck.

91
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.078
So, who prepared the bouquet?

92
00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:51.578
It was Toda-san.

93
00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:55.738
But the other three also touched the bouquet.

94
00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:59.588
Let's start by questioning everybody.

95
00:06:03.288 --> 00:06:06.848
Forgive me for asking, Toda-san, but did
you join the company after its formation?

96
00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:12.138
Yes. I began working for President
Kureno five years ago.

97
00:06:12.778 --> 00:06:16.608
Until then, I'd been doing planning
for an advertising agency.

98
00:06:16.828 --> 00:06:21.608
I was recruited by this company,
who was one of our clients at the time.

99
00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:25.618
What were you going to do after
the company was dissolved?

100
00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:29.138
I hadn't received a formal offer,

101
00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.998
but I was planning to work with
Kureno-san on his next project.

102
00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:33.628
Clerno

103
00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:36.998
Toda-kun, you've helped me a lot until now.
Clerno

104
00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:43.008
I'd like you to serve in an even
better position on my next project.

105
00:06:43.668 --> 00:06:45.228
Thank you.

106
00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:50.138
So there's no way I would
have killed President Kureno.

107
00:06:50.388 --> 00:06:55.768
But we've been told the poison was
in the bouquet you handed to him.

108
00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.438
The bouquet was a surprise.

109
00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.978
I hadn't touched it since
the start of the party.

110
00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:06.598
Toda-san, do you have any idea
what happened to Kureno-san?

111
00:07:06.598 --> 00:07:08.618
Was there anyone who resented him?

112
00:07:10.428 --> 00:07:13.998
I don't wish to speak ill of my friends,

113
00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:16.698
but I do have some idea.

114
00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:19.748
It's the designer Kamijo-san.

115
00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:23.298
He was originally a famous web designer.

116
00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:25.758
He's been overbearing
since he joined the team.

117
00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:30.388
On top of that, he's a big spender and
keeps taking out advances on his salary.

118
00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:35.008
Kamijo-san is in the most trouble
if this team is dissolved.

119
00:07:36.368 --> 00:07:38.268
Man, what a hassle.

120
00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:42.278
I can't remember how long ago I started.

121
00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:45.778
President Kureno suddenly
contacted me one day.

122
00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:50.118
I thought I'd live the laid-back
freelance life forever,

123
00:07:50.118 --> 00:07:53.788
but his terms were so generous,
I agreed to work for him.

124
00:07:53.978 --> 00:07:58.468
You didn't approve of the
company's dissolution, correct?

125
00:07:58.468 --> 00:08:01.538
We heard you requested
advances on your salary.

126
00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:04.288
It has nothing to do with money!

127
00:08:04.288 --> 00:08:07.428
He always made decisions on his own,

128
00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:12.808
but it was awful of him to make such a big
decision without discussing it with me first.

129
00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:16.388
I suppose you're right.

130
00:08:16.388 --> 00:08:21.108
By the way, Kamijo-san, what are you
planning to do after the team is dissolved?

131
00:08:21.108 --> 00:08:22.348
Who knows?

132
00:08:22.348 --> 00:08:25.078
I haven't decided yet, but since
I was originally freelance,

133
00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:27.238
I'll be fine without a company.

134
00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:29.268
Oh, right.

135
00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:33.988
I think this was done by someone
with a personal grudge.

136
00:08:34.428 --> 00:08:36.518
A personal grudge?

137
00:08:36.518 --> 00:08:37.248
Yeah.

138
00:08:37.608 --> 00:08:41.998
So why don't you examine
our belongings some more?

139
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.408
We did take a quick look
through everyone's belongings.

140
00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.008
Inspector, look at this.

141
00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:53.288
We found this among Narita-san's belongings.

142
00:08:54.238 --> 00:08:58.218
I joined Kureno-san's team eight years ago.

143
00:08:58.218 --> 00:09:00.388
I was in charge of accounting.

144
00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:04.268
How did you end up joining Kureno-san's team?

145
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:07.278
I knew the president from before.

146
00:09:07.658 --> 00:09:09.158
Forgive me for asking,

147
00:09:09.158 --> 00:09:14.158
but were you and President Kureno dating?

148
00:09:14.368 --> 00:09:18.018
Yes, although shortly after
that picture was taken,

149
00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:22.308
he said he'd fallen in love with
someone else and broke up with me.

150
00:09:22.308 --> 00:09:23.918
I'm sorry to hear that.

151
00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:25.228
It's fine.

152
00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:29.778
Jiro-san genuinely recognized the work I did.

153
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.928
That was enough to make me happy.

154
00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:36.428
By the way, was there anyone who
had problems with Kureno-san?

155
00:09:36.428 --> 00:09:38.108
Well...

156
00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:40.978
There's Koshimoto-san.

157
00:09:42.088 --> 00:09:46.328
Yes, Kureno and I had been
friends since college.

158
00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:48.838
We'd been together since
the site was established.

159
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:51.448
I was in charge of merchandise.

160
00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:56.658
We heard you often clashed with Kureno-san.

161
00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:59.448
Yeah, we argued all the time.

162
00:09:59.688 --> 00:10:01.968
But so, what?

163
00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:06.958
We were just good enough friends that
we could say anything to each other.

164
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.338
If you suspect me, you should look into Toda!

165
00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:14.018
He had clients entertaining
him practically every day.

166
00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:15.848
He was spoiled.

167
00:10:16.258 --> 00:10:21.348
I think he'd hate to lose
that luxurious lifestyle.

168
00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:27.948
It sounds like all the suspects have motives.

169
00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:28.728
Yes.

170
00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.298
Who do you think did it?

171
00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:32.608
It was probably Toda-san.

172
00:10:33.038 --> 00:10:36.718
The poison was in the bouquet he prepared.

173
00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:38.238
Excuse me.

174
00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:43.198
Inspector, we received new testimony
from the restaurant staff.

175
00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:49.318
Inspector, I'm certain it was Toda.

176
00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:51.438
Yes.

177
00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:53.878
Thank you.

178
00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:55.898
Excuse me.

179
00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.468
Mister, what are you doing?

180
00:10:58.468 --> 00:10:59.138
Huh?

181
00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:02.598
Oh. It's just you, kid.

182
00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:06.128
I received an important phone call.

183
00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:07.558
An important call?

184
00:11:07.858 --> 00:11:12.358
I'm actually being recruited by a client.

185
00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:15.298
I didn't trust President Kureno,

186
00:11:15.298 --> 00:11:17.568
so I was secretly in discussions with them.

187
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.278
How bold...

188
00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:24.578
I don't want the police to
suspect me, so don't tell them.

189
00:11:24.948 --> 00:11:26.828
This should keep you quiet.

190
00:11:27.088 --> 00:11:29.148
Thanks.

191
00:11:29.148 --> 00:11:31.958
It's a unsold product from our site.

192
00:11:32.248 --> 00:11:35.748
Our imported toys were our top sellers.

193
00:11:37.168 --> 00:11:38.618
It's so cool.

194
00:11:39.788 --> 00:11:42.618
What? Is that true?

195
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:43.538
Yes.

196
00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:46.978
The bouquet was here during the meal.

197
00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:51.978
That tall man crouched over the
bouquet and fiddled with it.

198
00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:54.378
You're absolutely certain?

199
00:11:54.378 --> 00:11:55.108
Yes.

200
00:11:55.348 --> 00:11:58.708
Thank you for the valuable information.

201
00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:00.458
Well, I should go.

202
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:05.118
I knew it. I knew Koshimoto
was suspicious from the start.

203
00:12:05.968 --> 00:12:07.868
The old man's in great form today.

204
00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:11.728
Koshimoto-san was in charge of merchandise.

205
00:12:11.728 --> 00:12:17.148
He could have imported a poison
along with the other merchandise.

206
00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:19.328
Inspector, it was definitely him.

207
00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:23.138
I can't believe this is happening.

208
00:12:23.468 --> 00:12:28.558
Come to think of it, Toda, you're the one who
suggested we throw a company dissolution party.

209
00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:30.398
What does that mean?

210
00:12:30.398 --> 00:12:31.938
You think I did it?

211
00:12:32.178 --> 00:12:33.408
Who knows?

212
00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:35.068
I don't know about that.

213
00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:40.868
I know you were borrowing
money from Kureno-san.

214
00:12:40.868 --> 00:12:42.218
So, what?

215
00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:43.868
That has nothing to do with this.

216
00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:45.798
Cut it out.

217
00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.368
The president just died.

218
00:12:47.698 --> 00:12:48.728
What?

219
00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:52.378
A man just died, and you're
fixing your makeup.

220
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.508
Sorry to interrupt.

221
00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:00.428
Where's Koshimoto-san?

222
00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:02.298
Now that you mention it...

223
00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:07.558
Koshimoto-san, where are you going?

224
00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:09.878
To the bathroom.

225
00:13:09.878 --> 00:13:13.728
Should you be leaving the room
without the police's permission?

226
00:13:13.728 --> 00:13:16.468
We don't know how long we'll be waiting.

227
00:13:16.468 --> 00:13:18.828
I'm sure it's fine if we go to the bathroom.

228
00:13:19.508 --> 00:13:22.768
He's been gone since he left
for the bathroom a while ago.

229
00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:25.458
Come to think of it,
he hasn't been back since.

230
00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:26.578
What?

231
00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:29.188
What's wrong?

232
00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:30.678
Koshimoto-san ran off.

233
00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:31.558
What?

234
00:13:31.558 --> 00:13:36.088
But Mister, there are police
posted at the restaurant exits.

235
00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:37.318
You're right.

236
00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:40.238
Then Koshimoto-san is
still inside the building.

237
00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:41.538
Find him immediately.

238
00:13:41.538 --> 00:13:42.338
Yes, sir.

239
00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:44.218
I'll help.

240
00:13:47.298 --> 00:13:49.278
He wasn't in the hall.

241
00:13:50.738 --> 00:13:52.478
Nothing to report in the private rooms.

242
00:13:53.078 --> 00:13:54.728
Nothing to report in the kitchen.

243
00:13:54.998 --> 00:13:56.788
He's not at the tables either.

244
00:13:56.788 --> 00:13:57.668
Got it.

245
00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:00.608
Inspector, he's not at the tables.

246
00:14:05.628 --> 00:14:06.368
Huh?

247
00:14:06.968 --> 00:14:08.628
Is something the matter?

248
00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:10.618
What?

249
00:14:20.288 --> 00:14:23.488
No!

250
00:14:31.045 --> 00:14:34.675
Inspector Megure, this was
found next to the body.

251
00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:35.695
Let's see...

252
00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:38.405
"I killed Kureno."

253
00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:41.845
"The team succeeded because of me."

254
00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:44.535
"He claimed credit for everything."

255
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:45.955
"I couldn't forgive him."

256
00:14:46.095 --> 00:14:48.735
In other words, it's a suicide note.

257
00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:53.015
We were able to confirm that it's
definitely Koshimoto-san's handwriting.

258
00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:53.855
Inspector.

259
00:14:54.405 --> 00:14:58.225
The poison thought to be
used in Kureno-san's murder

260
00:14:58.225 --> 00:15:00.095
was found in the body's jacket pocket.

261
00:15:00.495 --> 00:15:01.735
Inspector Megure.

262
00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:02.415
All right.

263
00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:04.285
We're starting to get the full picture.

264
00:15:04.285 --> 00:15:07.095
Send the body to the coroner.

265
00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:11.105
What's going on?

266
00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.035
Kamijo-san's right.

267
00:15:13.035 --> 00:15:15.655
If I hadn't planned this party...

268
00:15:15.655 --> 00:15:17.615
Don't say that.

269
00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:19.365
It's not your fault.

270
00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:23.595
First the president, then Koshimoto-san...

271
00:15:23.595 --> 00:15:25.055
Why is this happening?

272
00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:27.125
Kamijo-kun, cut it out!

273
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:27.865
Excuse me.

274
00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.775
Coming through.

275
00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:32.875
Excuse me, coming through.

276
00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:39.075
No, they're wrong.

277
00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:44.685
Koshimoto-san was probably
killed by one of them.

278
00:15:45.465 --> 00:15:47.445
Ran, kid. We're leaving.

279
00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:49.785
What? We're leaving already?

280
00:15:50.385 --> 00:15:52.475
It's already so late.

281
00:15:53.635 --> 00:15:56.045
I see. I figured it out.

282
00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:59.195
But I need to find a way to
check the back of the house.

283
00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:01.485
Hey, Mister.

284
00:16:02.155 --> 00:16:06.865
My toy car is in a room back there.

285
00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:09.205
I'd like to get it before we leave.

286
00:16:09.205 --> 00:16:11.955
Jeez. You're hopeless.

287
00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:16.485
Did you find it?

288
00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:20.335
No. That's odd...

289
00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:22.845
I knew it.

290
00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.445
Are you sure it isn't over here?

291
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:36.725
What's the meaning of this, Mori-san?

292
00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.005
I apologize for keeping everyone here.

293
00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:42.235
I finally figured out the
truth behind this case.

294
00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:47.525
But Mori-san, the note was
written by Koshimoto-san.

295
00:16:47.525 --> 00:16:48.995
We even found evidence.

296
00:16:49.265 --> 00:16:50.295
That's correct.

297
00:16:50.805 --> 00:16:54.745
Koshimoto-san killed President Kureno.

298
00:16:55.155 --> 00:17:00.045
He poisoned the needle, hid it
inside the bouquet, and killed him.

299
00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:03.085
But the problem is Koshimoto-san's death.

300
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:08.005
He didn't kill himself. He was
summoned here and murdered.

301
00:17:08.565 --> 00:17:12.035
He either wrote the suicide note voluntarily

302
00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:15.145
or was made to write it by his killer.

303
00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:17.405
By the way, Detective Takagi,

304
00:17:17.405 --> 00:17:20.395
could you move to the middle of the room?

305
00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:22.275
What? Okay.

306
00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.965
Look closely at the floor.

307
00:17:23.965 --> 00:17:25.025
All right.

308
00:17:26.935 --> 00:17:29.745
There's a faint smudge on the floor.

309
00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:33.035
It looks like something
was dragged through here.

310
00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:37.495
Which means his shoe came
off when he was dragged.

311
00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:38.605
That's right.

312
00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:42.255
His murder probably wasn't planned.

313
00:17:42.555 --> 00:17:44.505
Allow me to explain.

314
00:17:45.145 --> 00:17:49.005
First, the culprit strangled Koshimoto-san
to death using some kind of string.

315
00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:53.455
They dragged the body to the door and
attempted to make his death look like a suicide.

316
00:17:54.165 --> 00:17:55.865
However, in their rush to leave,

317
00:17:55.865 --> 00:18:01.025
the culprit left the scene of the crime
without replacing his shoe on his foot.

318
00:18:01.335 --> 00:18:05.235
Who left the room after Koshimoto-san?

319
00:18:05.235 --> 00:18:07.265
Everyone, actually.

320
00:18:07.265 --> 00:18:09.385
I went to make a phone call.

321
00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:12.285
But I was with the boy then.

322
00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:16.915
Yeah. I ran into him,
and he gave me a toy car.

323
00:18:16.915 --> 00:18:18.285
C-Conan-kun.

324
00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:25.235
I went to the restroom,
but I didn't run into anyone.

325
00:18:25.235 --> 00:18:29.925
I left the room, too, but I
just went out into the hallway.

326
00:18:30.085 --> 00:18:32.035
What were you doing in the hallway?

327
00:18:32.035 --> 00:18:35.195
I was talking to a female employee.

328
00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:36.395
Excuse me.

329
00:18:36.885 --> 00:18:41.015
He's telling the truth. I'm sure of it.

330
00:18:41.335 --> 00:18:44.755
You're exactly my type.

331
00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:46.055
Please, you're bothering me.

332
00:18:46.475 --> 00:18:50.315
I-In any case, I have an alibi.

333
00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:53.405
Wait a minute. That means...

334
00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:56.035
The culprit is...

335
00:18:56.305 --> 00:18:58.535
Yes, that's correct.

336
00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:02.545
The only person here who doesn't
have an alibi is Narita-san.

337
00:19:02.735 --> 00:19:07.185
N-No way! And that alone
makes me the culprit?

338
00:19:07.185 --> 00:19:08.675
You don't even have proof!

339
00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:10.735
Well, Mori-kun?

340
00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:12.885
Don't worry, Inspector.

341
00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.685
There is proof.

342
00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:15.555
What?

343
00:19:15.765 --> 00:19:20.555
The culprit still has in their possession
the weapon they used to kill Koshimoto-san.

344
00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:25.565
You're saying the weapon isn't the
wine napkin hanging off the door?

345
00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:27.945
It's not that.

346
00:19:27.945 --> 00:19:32.075
The weapon is something much
thinner than a wine napkin.

347
00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:37.575
If you look at the body, you can see that the
skin is raised just inside the ligature marks.

348
00:19:38.035 --> 00:19:40.815
After strangling him using
some type of string or cord,

349
00:19:40.815 --> 00:19:44.835
the culprit strangled him
again with the wine napkin.

350
00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:49.335
But Narita-san doesn't have
anything like that on her.

351
00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:51.755
Could it be?

352
00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:57.765
Come on, Narita-san.

353
00:19:57.765 --> 00:20:01.015
If I'm wrong, let the police borrow your bag.

354
00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:07.525
Your bag's shoulder strap and the ligature
marks should be a perfect match.

355
00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:09.185
Narita-san?

356
00:20:09.185 --> 00:20:10.755
Why?

357
00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:14.325
I didn't mean to kill him.

358
00:20:14.325 --> 00:20:15.785
Then why?!

359
00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:20.285
I couldn't forgive him after what he said.

360
00:20:21.435 --> 00:20:23.785
Around the time the decision to
dissolve the company was made,

Around the time the decision to

362
00:20:25.835 --> 00:20:26.295
I found a strangely expensive and
mysterious product among his purchases.

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:29.295
I found a strangely expensive and
mysterious product among his purchases.

364
00:20:29.585 --> 00:20:31.695
For a long time, I wondered what it was.

365
00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:34.365
Please be honest with me.

366
00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:37.055
Did you import a poison?

367
00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:40.055
You killed the president, didn't you?

368
00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:41.715
What should I do?

369
00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:44.385
I've done something crazy!

370
00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:46.065
Koshimoto-san...

371
00:20:46.325 --> 00:20:48.195
I always resented him.

372
00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:51.495
He claimed sole credit for all our success,

373
00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:55.065
even though he couldn't
do anything without me.

374
00:20:55.065 --> 00:20:56.575
So I...

375
00:20:56.745 --> 00:20:59.245
Koshimoto-san, turn yourself in.

376
00:20:59.245 --> 00:21:01.825
I'll go with you to the police.

377
00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:04.295
All right.

378
00:21:09.385 --> 00:21:14.525
But don't you think this was bound to happen?

379
00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:15.965
What do you mean?

380
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:20.855
There isn't anyone who truly
loved that selfish guy.

381
00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:22.505
He was surrounded by enemies.

382
00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:25.145
Even if I hadn't done it, this
would've happened to him eventually.

383
00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.895
Both you and I were just being used

384
00:21:30.315 --> 00:21:32.645
by that piece of trash.

385
00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:35.885
What?

386
00:21:35.885 --> 00:21:37.985
What did you say?

387
00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:41.845
I looked up to the president.

388
00:21:41.845 --> 00:21:46.035
I wanted to someday become
an executive just like him.

389
00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:49.405
I couldn't forgive him for insulting him.

390
00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:53.775
And besides, Koshimoto-san
didn't seem to know,

391
00:21:53.775 --> 00:21:57.675
but the president said he wanted to
work with this team again someday.

392
00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:01.175
That's what he told me.

393
00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:33.395
Dad, let's go.

394
00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:36.945
Excuse me.

395
00:23:37.355 --> 00:23:40.445
With everything that happened,
I forgot to give this to you.

396
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.655
Here. This is for you.

397
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:46.085
That's great, Conan-kun.

398
00:23:47.575 --> 00:23:49.085
Thanks.

399
00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.665
I can't believe I got a second one...
