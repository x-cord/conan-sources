1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,240
Oh, it stopped raining.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,540
Yeah.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,940
That's Orion Planning where Mr. Higashiyama

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,740
that we're going to be meeting now is working.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,640
What does the company Orion Planning do?

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,640
They do commercials, plan events and produce TV programs.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,640
It seems that the Kamen Yaiba show that kids love

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
is also what this company handles.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,240
I went to watch it last week too

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,840
because Genta and the others wanted to go.

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,540
Brooding over passing seasons

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,340
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,140
Someone falls to death in front of your eyes.

14
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,340
The mystery of an alibi with a blind spot.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,140
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,029
"Alibi of a Fall"

19
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,629
We have an appointment with

20
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,329
Mr. Higashiyama of the publishing planning division.

21
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,929
You're Mr. Mouri.

22
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,029
I've heard of you from Mr. Higashiyama.

23
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,029
I'll put him through on the extension right now.

24
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,029
Mr. Higashiyama told me

25
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:49,729
to call him on the extension phone from here.

26
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,429
It's extension 423, isn't it?

27
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,129
Yes, that's right.

28
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,129
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:04,729
Uh... 4, 2, 3.

30
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:11,029
Yes, hello.

31
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:14,129
Mr. Higashiyama? Mouri here.

32
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,629
Mr. Mouri!

33
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,629
Thank you for coming at this hour of the day.

34
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,429
Don't worry about it!

35
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,029
I'll come for you right away.

36
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,829
My office is located in an annex behind that office, you see.

37
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:30,629
What?

38
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,629
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

39
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,429
Well... A person just went falling outside the window.

40
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,229
What was that?

41
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,829
The person who died was the event planner

42
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:58,629
who works here named Mr. Fujihiko Takahata.

43
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,329
He fell to his death.

44
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:02,029
It seems that Mr. Takahata's office

45
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,129
is right above here on the 6th floor,

46
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,429
and he most likely fell from that window.

47
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:09,029
I see.

48
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,829
And, what brings you here?

49
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,329
I was asked to come here by Mr. Higashiyama who works here.

50
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,429
Yes, that's right.

51
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,929
I wanted to hear what Mr. Mouri had to say about

52
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:24,229
a book on mystery quizzes that I'm planning to publish.

53
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,229
The only two that are left in the company tonight

54
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,229
seem to be Mr. Higashiyama and Ms. Sunakawa.

55
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,729
I guess we should start by going to look at

56
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:35,229
Mr. Takahata's office on the 6th floor.

57
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,329
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,329
The back of the corpse is wet,

59
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,329
despite the rain having stopped. Why?

60
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,429
The elevator... Are you checking it?

61
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,329
No, we've already finished so you can use it.

62
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:03,129
-Did anything happen? -Yes, sort of.

63
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,029
We may have to ask you some questions later,

64
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,329
so please wait around, all right?

65
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,529
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

66
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,629
Mr. Takahata's office is the one at the very end?

67
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,929
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,429
You sure perspire a lot, don't you?

69
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:26,629
You're soaked with sweat

70
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,829
all the way to the collar of your dress shirt.

71
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,029
What? Is that so?

72
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,029
There's a band aid wrapped around Ms. Sunakawa's finger.

73
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,929
She didn't have it when we got here.

74
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:38,829
I wonder when she got hurt?

75
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,529
It's locked.

76
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,629
If his office is locked, it could mean that

77
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,129
it's highly probable that he committed suicide.

78
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,029
Suicide?

79
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,629
Mr. Takahata? No way!

80
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:55,329
What do you mean?

81
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,429
It's hard to believe that a person as arrogant

82
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:00,429
and overly confident like him would commit suicide.

83
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,529
There seems to be no mistake that he fell from here.

84
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,929
Inspector, this...

85
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,129
What's that?

86
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,229
"My talent has reached its limits."

87
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,329
"Embarrassing myself further is not something I want."

88
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,929
"I shall thus end my life. -Takahata Fujihiko" -This is...

89
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,129
Is it Mr. Takahata's will?

90
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:29,429
Oh no! I can't believe it!

91
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,129
Huh?

92
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,829
Conan!

93
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,129
Just what do you think you're doing?

94
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,129
It's wet over there!

95
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,329
What?

96
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,829
True.

97
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,129
When did tonight's rain stop?

98
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,329
If I remember correctly, it started raining at around 7:30

99
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,329
and stopped about 8:00.

100
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:53,929
We arrived at this building at around 8:20, right?

101
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:55,029
Yeah.

102
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:59,529
Hold it. Which means, that the window was left open

103
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:02,629
for more 20 minutes before Mr. Takahata fell from it?

104
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,129
Mr. Takahata's back was also wet, right?

105
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,729
I wonder if Mr. Takahata was standing by this open window

106
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,729
with his back against it way before he fell?

107
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,129
That's strange.

108
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:17,629
Inspector!

109
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,129
This was found stuck to Mr. Takahata's suit top!

110
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:23,929
What's that?

111
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:27,429
It looks familiar.

112
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:30,529
That's something that's used during the Kamen Yaiba Show.

113
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,229
Yes, that's right.

114
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,729
I think it's the scale that's on the monster suit.

115
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,929
Why would something like that be here?

116
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:43,029
The other day, I went to watch the Kamen Yaiba Show.

117
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,229
The Laser Police that's friends with Kamen Yaiba

118
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,729
fired his laser gun,

119
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,829
then the monster went "pssss" and deflated!

120
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,629
Huh, what's going on?

121
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,929
Hey! Just what do you think you're talking about?

122
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,129
Why? Why?

123
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,229
That monster is made of balloon.

124
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,429
The gun that the laser police has gives off infrared rays

125
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,729
just like that of a TV remote control

126
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,129
and when this hits the sensor of the monster,

127
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,629
it's made so that air escapes and the monster deflates.

128
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,329
That's something!

129
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,129
Air escapes from the balloon and it deflates?

130
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,929
Wait a minute.

131
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,129
The eaves is not wet.

132
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,029
Just as I thought.

133
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,529
What's the matter?

134
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,429
No... nothing!

135
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,129
Inspector! This is homicide made to look like suicide.

136
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,329
What?

137
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,029
First, he put the inflated monster balloon

138
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:46,029
on top of the eaves outside.

139
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,529
Then, Mr. Takahata who was put to sleep

140
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,729
with a sleeping drug or something,

141
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,329
was placed on the balloon by pushing him

142
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,729
forward out of the window.

143
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:55,229
Then, the culprit leaves the room!

144
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:59,129
But the door was locked from the inside, you know?

145
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,429
As for that,

146
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,829
if the window of the room next door is left open beforehand,

147
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,429
it's possible to move over using the window and get out!

148
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:06,729
I see.

149
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:09,229
And if he fires the gun at the monster from another room

150
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,129
using a remote controller,

151
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:14,529
Mr. Takahata's body bumps into the eaves and goes falling

152
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,829
without leaving any unexplained wounds on his body!

153
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,729
There were no traces of the eaves

154
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:22,429
under this window being wet by rain.

155
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,729
That's evidence that the monster balloon

156
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,429
was set in place before it rained!

157
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,229
I see. So, he retrieved the deflated balloon

158
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,629
by pulling on the rope or something

159
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,129
he had tied on to the balloon beforehand.

160
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,129
Wow, that's super deduction, Pops!

161
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,029
Of course it is!

162
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,929
The culprit after setting all this up left the room,

163
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,629
but it began to rain before he carried out his plan,

164
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,729
so the back of the corpse and floor got wet.

165
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:49,029
So, the culprit made this will up too!

166
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,629
Where is that balloon usually stored?

167
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,729
Inside the 1st floor warehouse.

168
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,129
All employees can access it at all times.

169
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,829
The culprit is an employee of this company.

170
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:03,829
Chiba! The monster balloon and gun that is moved by a remote controller

171
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:05,329
should be somewhere in this building.

172
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:07,829
Search every nook and cranny and find it!

173
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,129
Yes, sir!

174
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,829
How far does the infrared laser reach?

175
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:19,429
The farthest it goes at most is 56 meters.

176
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,429
Which means, it won't be difficult

177
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,429
to find which room the culprit used.

178
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,429
True. The conference room next door and...

179
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:31,129
The office rooms right below here on the 5th and 4th floor,

180
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,029
and the conference room next to those rooms.

181
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,629
A total of 5 rooms.

182
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,429
But only the user of those offices have the key,

183
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,529
so other people do not have free access to them.

184
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,829
In other words, it's any one of the conference rooms

185
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,529
on the 4th, 5th or 6th floor.

186
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,729
Are the conference rooms all made the same way?

187
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,229
Yes.

188
00:10:57,229 --> 00:10:59,029
Inspector. If it's this distance,

189
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,029
it's possible to move from window to window.

190
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:03,929
Okay, Takagi. Go to the security guard room

191
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,629
and check who went in and out of here this evening.

192
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,329
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,329
I'd like to start by asking you some questions, then.

194
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:17,629
I was on the phone talking to a client in this office

195
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,529
on the 2nd floor right through from a little before it started raining.

196
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,229
By the time I finished talking on the phone,

197
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,729
the rain had stopped.

198
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,429
When did you hear that

199
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:29,329
I would coming here from Mr. Higashiyama?

200
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,029
About 7:00.

201
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,629
Before I received the call from my client,

202
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,129
I got a call on the extension phone from Mr. Higashiyama's office.

203
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,129
How did you know that it was from Mr. Higashiyama's office?

204
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,529
Because the extension number is displayed,

205
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:44,929
there's no mistake.

206
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:48,629
-Mr. Mouri and the others came after that. -Yes, sir.

207
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,329
While Mr. Mouri was talking on the extension phone with Mr. Higashiyama,

208
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,329
I went to the reference room to return some documents.

209
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,129
This way.

210
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,629
I was organizing some papers here,

211
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,229
so I didn't notice all the noise

212
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,029
Mr. Mouri and the others were making here.

213
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,829
Didn't you just make it look that way,

214
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,529
when you actually ran right away up to the 4th floor,

215
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,029
and pushed Mr. Takahata out the window from the conference room?

216
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,529
But the stairs is right beside the elevator,

217
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,129
so the maintenance men working on the elevator would've seen her.

218
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,929
True.

219
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,629
You were organizing some papers and?

220
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,629
I cut my finger with the paper,

221
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:33,729
so I went back to the office to get myself a band aid.

222
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,129
That's when I first noticed

223
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,929
the voices of Mr. Mouri and the others outside the window,

224
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,229
and tried to go outside, too.

225
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:42,029
Just then I saw Mr. Higashiyama

226
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,729
coming along from the connecting corridor.

227
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,829
Did you pick up the call on the extension phone

228
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,529
from Mr. Mouri in this room?

229
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,529
Yes. Since I was working here all evening.

230
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,929
There's no doubt that Mr. Higashiyama was here.

231
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:01,529
I dialed the extension myself besides.

232
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,729
The phone over there is hooked on to the wall

233
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,729
and cannot be moved.

234
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:10,929
In order to go to Mr. Takahata's office

235
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:13,529
that's in the main building from this room in the annex,

236
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,929
I'd have to cross the connecting corridor.

237
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,429
To go from there to the stairs,

238
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,329
I'd have to pass in front of the elevator.

239
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,729
So if you ask the maintenance men who were checking the elevator,

240
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:27,529
I'm sure that they will testify that I didn't go pass there.

241
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,129
Can you go from outside to the main building?

242
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,729
If so, you'll have to go pass the entrance

243
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,829
where the security guard is.

244
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:38,229
Either way, the culprit would have to go pass someone.

245
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,929
Can you change the extension number?

246
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,229
Not with this telephone.

247
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,629
There is what is like a concentrated switchboard

248
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:47,029
on the 2nd floor of the main building,

249
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,629
and that's the only place any changes can be made.

250
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,029
Is that right?

251
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,629
Do you do Japanese archery, sir?

252
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,229
Yeah.

253
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,929
When I was a student, I did a bit.

254
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:02,029
Mr. Higashiyama is a really good archery shooter

255
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,029
who won the city tournament.

256
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:06,329
That's really something!

257
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,929
No, I'm not that great of a shooter.

258
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,929
According to the testimony of the security guard,

259
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,129
Mr. Takahata who had been out, returned at 7:10.

260
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,629
After that, the only people who went in or out of the building

261
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,329
were Mr. Mouri and his party.

262
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,829
The elevator maintenance workers

263
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,129
started checking the elevator about 7:00

264
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:29,929
and saw Mr. Takahata go climbing up the stairs.

265
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:34,529
Didn't the workers see Ms Sunakawa or Mr. Higashiyama?

266
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,629
No. They say that nobody

267
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,629
other than Mr. Takahata went by.

268
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:39,629
Inspector!

269
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,429
We found the monster balloon and remote controlled gun!

270
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,729
Where were they found?

271
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,629
There is a dust chute on the landing of every stairs on every floor

272
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,529
where people can throw trash away.

273
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,829
It was stuck in there.

274
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:55,029
Around the 3rd and 4th floor.

275
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,529
So the culprit use this and...

276
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,729
And one other thing.

277
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,929
This was found on the eaves of the window

278
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,129
of the conference room on the 4th floor.

279
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,029
A fountain pen...

280
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:09,429
According to the forensic officers,

281
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:12,029
it's not something that was dropped there today or yesterday.

282
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,629
I don't think it has anything to do with the incident,

283
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,829
but just in case...

284
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,229
No, wrong! That fountain pen

285
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,829
is in fact the vital key to solving the incident!

286
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,129
I see, I got it!

287
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:29,129
The one who killed Mr. Takahata is that person!

288
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:41,276
What is it, Mr. Mouri?

289
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,276
Huh? He's gone.

290
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,276
"Extension 423"

291
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,076
What the?

292
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,276
It's me, Inspector.

293
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:53,576
Mr. Mouri, where are you?

294
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:56,776
This is the phone number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

295
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,276
Inspector.

296
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:02,276
Could you please switch the phone over to speaker phone?

297
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,676
All right.

298
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:09,576
Mr. Mouri, are you in my office?

299
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:12,176
I'm sorry to have entered without permission.

300
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,676
But it's necessary to solve this case.

301
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:18,376
Have you come to the truth of the case?

302
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,176
Yes, I've figured everything out.

303
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:24,876
Mr. Takahata returned at 7:10 tonight.

304
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,676
It began to rain at around 7:30.

305
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,476
In other words, the culprit went to

306
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,576
Mr. Takahata's office during this time

307
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,176
and put him to sleep.

308
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,976
Then, he set up the trick using the Yaiba Show balloon

309
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:37,576
and left the office.

310
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,376
But, since it began to rain,

311
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,276
before the culprit could carry out his scheme,

312
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,076
the corpse and the floor got wet,

313
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:46,476
his trick was given away.

314
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,676
Why didn't the culprit push Mr. Takahata out the window

315
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:52,576
as soon as it started raining?

316
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,676
It sure is weird.

317
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:57,776
That's because the culprit wanted to be

318
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,376
as far as possible from the place that Mr. Takahata fell from,

319
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:03,376
since then it would serve as an unfaltering alibi.

320
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,976
Isn't that right, Mr. Higashiyama?

321
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,076
The one who killed Mr. Takahata...

322
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,476
is you, Mr. Higashiyama!

323
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:15,276
What?

324
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:18,276
Just what are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

325
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,476
I took your call from the annex

326
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,776
in another building when you called,

327
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:24,876
so how could I have killed Mr. Takahata?

328
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,576
Mr. Higashiyama.

329
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,076
Where do you think I'm calling you from just now?

330
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:33,276
Where from...

331
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,076
Don't tell me?

332
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,476
Mr. Mouri!

333
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,676
Why are you there?

334
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,676
Are you really calling from that conference room?

335
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,676
Yes.

336
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,676
But the extension number is 423.

337
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,676
Extension numbers are not something

338
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,176
that is attached to the telephone itself,

339
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,876
but rather, to the telephone line.

340
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:59,876
In short, it is something connected to the modular cable

341
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:02,176
that is attached to the phone.

342
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:06,076
Mr. Higashiyama removed the cable from the phone at his office,

343
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,276
and used the extension cable

344
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:10,976
and connected it to the phone in the conference room.

345
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:14,676
That way, the extension phone number of this conference room

346
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,976
is changed to 423,

347
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,976
which is the extension number to Mr. Higashiyama's office.

348
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:23,076
How did he cross the cable between the main building and annex?

349
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,976
Mr. Higashiyama is an expert at Japanese archery.

350
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:29,476
He probably tied the extension cable and arrow with a long string

351
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,376
and shot that arrow from his office in the annex

352
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,776
to the window of the corridor of the main building.

353
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,076
Then if he pulls that string from the main building,

354
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:40,576
he can cross the extension cable from the annex to the main building.

355
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:41,976
Mr. Higashiyama.

356
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:44,776
This is how you connected the cable of your office

357
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,276
to the telephone in the conference room.

358
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:50,176
You then waited until elevator maintenance began at 7:00

359
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:52,176
and called Ms. Sunakawa,

360
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:55,276
in order to make it look like you were in your office in the annex.

361
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:58,576
And when you got my call on your extension phone,

362
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:01,776
while picking up my call, you used the monster balloon trick,

363
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:04,276
and pushed Mr. Takahata out of the window.

364
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,776
After that you re-connected

365
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,676
the telephone cable the way it should be,

366
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,376
then hid the gun and balloon

367
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:13,876
that you retrieved into the dust chute.

368
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,276
You hurried back to your office

369
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:18,576
and retrieved the extension cable,

370
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:21,476
joined Ms. Sunakawa as if nothing had happened

371
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,476
and appeared before us.

372
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,276
Please wait!

373
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:28,276
How did I get back to the annex?

374
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,676
Yes. In order to get back to the annex,

375
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,476
he would've have to go pass

376
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:33,676
in front of the elevator that was being checked.

377
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,876
He went out the 3rd floor window

378
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,576
and crossed above the connecting corridor.

379
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:41,376
This way, he wouldn't have to be seen by the maintenance workers.

380
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,176
Your statement is based only on assumption!

381
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:47,276
Do you have proof? Proof!

382
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,976
The extension cable that I am using now

383
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:52,576
is what I found in your office.

384
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:55,776
I know of... no such thing!

385
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:59,476
Mr. Higashiyama, it looks so clear to me.

386
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:00,976
You're perspiration prone

387
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,876
so you have to keep wiping off sweat.

388
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:05,376
So much to the point

389
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:09,076
that the collar of your sky blue dress shirt had turned dark blue.

390
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:10,576
Yeah.

391
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,776
Is that really perspiration?

392
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,776
A fountain pen was found

393
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:20,276
on top of the eaves of the window of this conference room.

394
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:23,076
When it rains the ink that leaks out from there,

395
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:26,076
comes dripping mixed in the rain.

396
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:28,476
When you leaned forward out of the window

397
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,876
to fire at the balloon monster,

398
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:33,776
the ink dropped on your collar.

399
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,976
Mr. Higashiyama.

400
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,576
You did it, didn't you?

401
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:54,376
Right, I did it.

402
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,476
The fact is, a small factory that my older brother ran,

403
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,676
fell into financial difficulties,

404
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:03,276
so I introduced this company to him.

405
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,576
A lot of goods to be used at events were ordered,

406
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,776
so he was very happy.

407
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:12,476
However, Takahata picked on my older brother's weakness

408
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,476
and demanded illegal kick back,

409
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:18,376
but my brother who had a strong sense of justice refused.

410
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:22,376
Then, the company refused to pay for the items.

411
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:25,276
You could've sued them for breeching of contract.

412
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:27,476
Takahata had seen through that and schemed it

413
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:30,576
so that he could get away with it.

414
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:35,076
My older brother ended up with a large amount of debt

415
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,976
and he committed suicide.

416
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,576
Oh, no...

417
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:42,076
That's why I killed him!

418
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:45,476
With the things that he used to carry out his plan for events!

419
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,876
I was sure it was going to work out well!

420
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:51,976
I figured that if the renown detective Kogoro Mouri was my witness,

421
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:55,376
I could surely succeed assured!

422
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:59,376
Only if... Only if it didn't rain!

423
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,676
I'm upside down!

424
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:45,176
I guess Pops is wide awake now?

425
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,976
"Next Episode" -What's this Blood Smoke Hit Man about?

426
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:52,976
It's a movie about a killer.

427
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:56,076
For some reason, he is asked to do jobs at hot spring towns,

428
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,576
and smoky steam is dyed in blood.

429
00:23:57,576 --> 00:23:59,576
That seems to be how he got his name.

430
00:23:59,576 --> 00:24:02,176
Would you like to try the specialty of this hot spring inn...

431
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:05,376
an open-air bath on the lake?

432
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,776
It's been three days since I've last taken a bath!

433
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:16,914
Next Conan, "Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 1)"

434
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:20,003
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,103
"Outdoor spa on the lake"

436
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:23,903
This place is full of open air baths. It looks like fun!

437
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:24,903
Pops, you're going to stay back home.

438
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:26,757
What? No way! I'm going no matter what!
