1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,750
Always keep your poker face...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,780
Taking my father's teaching to heart...

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,150
The miracle magician glides amidst the skycraper.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,020
Here I come, Kid the Phantom Thief!

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,590
Today's target is Crystal Mother.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,990
Now, it's showtime!

7
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,000
Yo, I'm Kaito Kuroba!

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,760
The renowned magician and the thief of the century,

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,170
The identity of Kid the Phantom Thief is my father...

10
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,270
Toichi Kuroba.

11
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,110
He was killed in an accident during a magic show.

12
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,770
To uncover the organization that killed my father...

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,540
I became Kid The Phantom Thief II!

14
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,150
I will steal the big jewel before them!

15
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,620
About my identity as Kid...

16
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,050
My childhood friend and classmate, Aoko Nakamori...

17
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,460
And her dad, Inspector Nakamori from Police HQ...

18
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,790
I keep it a secret from them.

19
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,990
But some people discovered my identity.

20
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,330
The mysterious assassin from the organization, Spider.

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,570
His cover is a renowned illusionist.

22
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,670
What is it that he really wants?

23
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,040
Well, perhaps being the greatest thief comes with trouble.

24
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,980
Now, today's treasure is...

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,952
The Crystal Mother of Tears.

26
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,740
Honored to make your acquaintance, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,310
Is it to your liking? Japan's luxury train…?

28
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,980
Yes, very.

29
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,490
Could you enjoy the sunset in peace?

30
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,330
Yes, thank you.

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,030
This lounge car has been closed off.

32
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,440
However, I would usually have closed off all the cars on the train…

33
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,370
It's fine.

34
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,240
As I requested, I would like to interact

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
with the Japanese people as much as possible.

36
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,740
So I heard, but…

37
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,750
And I was able to meet that famous man as well.

38
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,020
Huh? I saw the whole passenger list but…

39
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,620
Kid the Phantom Thief.

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
What!?

41
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
Back off!

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,500
I won't allow you to disrespect the Japanese police!

43
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,730
Did you really see The Kid!?

44
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,740
He came to my room just now.

45
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,900
To do as he said, steal my kingdom's jewel,

46
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,440
the largest topaz in Europe, this Crystal Mother…

47
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,780
Then why didn't he steal it?

48
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,250
I'm sure he could immediately see that this was a fake.

49
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,650
A fake!?

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,990
Yes. I've hidden the real one in a certain place

51
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,290
In a certain place…!?

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,330
I couldn't tell you, Inspector.

53
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,100
The Kid could be listening from anywhere in this train.

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,930
So! The Kid is on board!

55
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,600
Check every passenger on board!

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,270
Yes!

57
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,240
Stop!

58
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,940
I will not allow you to be troubled for the sake of
the Duchy of Ingram.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,310
However, Your Majesty…

60
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,680
This is a fight between The Kid and myself…

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,050
will he steal the jewel in the two and a half hours left
on this train ride,

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,250
or will I protect it, and the honor of my country!!?

63
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,620
Mother…

64
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,960
Something's wrong with your necklace.

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,930
Phillip! What a bad boy.

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,060
I told you not to leave your room…

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,830
And I told you so many times,

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,470
to call me Your Majesty in front of people,

69
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
But…

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,640
Your Majesty!

71
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,140
I was looking for you, Your Majesty

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,610
Alice! You are indulging him too much.

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,410
You must be more in control…!

74
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,950
I apologize…

75
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,720
It's not her fault.

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,890
I'm sorry, but who is she?

77
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,330
This is Alice, she looks after Prince Phillip.

78
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,860
Since my husband, King Henry passed away two years ago,

79
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,170
she is the only person I can truly rely on.

80
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,530
Come this way.

81
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,040
That fake is a different shape than it was before!

82
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,050
This is a listening device…

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,680
When he snuck into your room…

84
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,590
Are you listening! Kid the Phantom Thief!!

85
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,130
As long as I'm here, I won't let you touch the jewel!!

86
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,500
That stupid Inspector…

87
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,070
What's wrong, Kaito?

88
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,470
You're making a weird face…

89
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,970
Nothing!

90
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,300
Your dad just shouted at me…

91
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,210
What are you upset about?

92
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,650
You're the one that said you wanted to ride on a luxury train.

93
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,620
That's why I asked my father…

94
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,390
Hey, hey, I'm always grateful to your father.

95
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,660
What is it then.

96
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,290
We're about to go meet the Queen and everything!

97
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh, look at the time, it's almost dinner,

98
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,570
Regular passengers are in the observation car.

99
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,540
Two cars ahead is the dining car.

100
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,680
The Queen is going to go there as well.

101
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,580
Ahead of that,

102
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,050
everything from the lounge car to the private car is all closed off,

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,420
but the organization is after the same jewel, and is in here as well…

104
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,150
Dinner's my chance…

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll have to find where the real jewel is before they do.

106
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,260
Hey, Kaito, stop staring into space.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,070
Straighten up, you have to greet Her majesty.

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,470
Oh, greet her?

109
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,100
Yeah. I'm going to tell her,

110
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm Inspector Nakamori's daughter,

111
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,810
For real…

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,550
We are fully aware of that.

113
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,420
If The Kid appeared in The Queen's private room,

114
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,820
then it won't be hidden there!

115
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,890
The Queen is either hiding the real one on herself…

116
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
Or the Prince.

117
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,790
Just look for it.

118
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,230
Hey! Spider!!

119
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,560
Where are you hiding?

120
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,330
Stay out of the way!!

121
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,930
Who's getting in the way of who?

122
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,500
Shit!

123
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,410
We would normally have you take your meal in the lounge car.

124
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,280
If you're that worried...

125
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,180
Then stay by my side and guard me.

126
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,020
The Inspector will dine with me!

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,620
Huh?

128
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,520
…B, but…

129
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,890
Don't be so nervous.

130
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,530
Would you like an aperitif?

131
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,430
I'll make one for you.

132
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,100
What, alcohol? No, I'm working…

133
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,740
Oh…you're the first person to ever down one of my drinks.

134
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,410
Then…I suppose I can have one glass.

135
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,260
What an honor to have a Queen make me a drink!

136
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,430
…Oh, father!

137
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,430
Whoa, he's drinking alcohol…

138
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,230
Oh, here you are.

139
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,140
Your Majesty! This is my daughter, Aoko, and her friend Kaito.

140
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,140
Well…

141
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,340
Ni... Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,380
Where is it!?

143
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,950
The real jewel…?

144
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,420
In her hat…her bag…or…

145
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,650
The cat!?

146
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,760
Is it inside the cat's eye…?

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,530
Come here, Caesar!

148
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,100
Over here!

149
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,730
Good.

150
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,770
Her Majesty's cat…

151
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,070
No…

152
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,400
I'm Phillip Maximillion Ingram.

153
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,040
A prince!?

154
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,610
Yeah.

155
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,510
You wanted to see this cat, right?

156
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,610
Uh, yeah…

157
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,720
Wow, it's so cute. Can I hold it?!

158
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,320
Alright, Aoko...

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,160
Now's my chance

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,590
Um, right eye looks normal.

161
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,490
Left eye…

162
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,030
Great, it was just a normal cat.

163
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,870
Are you alright, Kaito?

164
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,030
Yeah.

165
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,940
That's a pretty cute little guy you've got there.

166
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,480
Yeah, it was a present from my father.

167
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,950
Really. Huh? Its eye's falling off!

168
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,710
What?

169
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,850
Let me see...

170
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,250
Alice…

171
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,090
Your Majesty, let's return to your room.

172
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,260
But…

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,920
Huh?

174
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,730
You're Kid the Phantom Thief, right?

175
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,870
That's a good joke, Prince!

176
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,870
Oh, so you're not?

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,570
I know where the treasure is!

178
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,240
But I'm not going to tell you.

179
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
That little…

180
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,010
Now, Your Majesty, let's go.

181
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,980
Her Majesty will get angry.

182
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,220
I don't want to, Alice. I'm staying here.

183
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,430
I'm going to protect mother and the treasure from The Kid!

184
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,490
You care about your mother, don't you?

185
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,630
I hate my mother!

186
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,070
Because she changed after father died…

187
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,570
She used to be so nice, but now she's always angry!

188
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,910
I think she hates me now…

189
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,950
But I promised father…

190
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,580
I'll look after mother from now on.

191
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,620
That's why…

192
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,020
That's why…

193
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,240
She used to be so nice, but now she's always angry!

194
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,470
I think she hates me now…

195
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,840
But I promised father…

196
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,180
I'll look after mother from now on.

197
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
That's why…

198
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
That's why…

199
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,690
I'm staying here…!

200
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,130
Please wait…

201
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,570
You insolent child!

202
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,340
It seems you don't understand words.

203
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,870
Mother!

204
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,780
Not mother, Your Majesty!

205
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,110
You lack self awareness.

206
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,350
You…don't need to go that far.

207
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,950
You are not to come back here again.

208
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,490
Mother…

209
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,450
Do you understand...

210
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Leave him alone!!

211
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,360
Why are you looking like that, Aoko!

212
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,030
You don't need to worry.

213
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,300
He's a boy.

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,540
Mother…

215
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,410
Mother!

216
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,650
Is it alright…?

217
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,550
Yes…

218
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,820
That's the only way he'll understand.

219
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,660
And he has Alice.

220
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,660
I'm sure she understands how I feel…

221
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,900
Please, Inspector. Have some more to drink.

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,580
It's so good!

223
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,890
Hey, Kaito, can I have that if you don't want it?

224
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,860
Yeah...

225
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,290
Yay!

226
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,560
The dinner's almost over…

227
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,430
Where is the jewel…?

228
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,770
Phew.

229
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,630
Your Majesty!

230
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,170
Please just tell me where you've hidden the jewel.

231
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,740
In a little while.

232
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,410
I shall tell you after we arrive at our destination.

233
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm sure you'll be surprised.

234
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,510
Where is it…?

235
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,220
If I don't hurry…

236
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,850
Oh, the kitty cat.

237
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,690
Good kitty...

238
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,960
Come here...

239
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,790
Huh…that's strange…

240
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,960
It hasn't changed at all.

241
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,330
It usually changes its shape more…

242
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,100
I know where the jewel is!

243
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,740
Oh, wait, kitty cat.

244
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,740
…Now's my only chance…

245
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,580
Kitty cat...

246
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,350
There you are.

247
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,790
Um, excuse me.

248
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,900
Are you alright?

249
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,210
Twenty minutes until we arrive at the final station…

250
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,450
It looks like I've won.

251
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,960
B-blackouts?!

252
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,260
So The Kid's here at last!!

253
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,400
Your Majesty!

254
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,500
Don't get it wrong.

255
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,140
I was just protecting Her Majesty…

256
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,670
But Inspector, where is your glass?

257
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,210
Glass?

258
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,340
It's here...

259
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,080
What!?

260
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,450
Which one is your glass!?

261
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,960
What is going on…?

262
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,590
Find it immediately

263
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,300
I see…

264
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,240
You hid the jewel with the ice in my glass.

265
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,510
How bold…

266
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,150
Found it!

267
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,150
The Crystal Mother is safe.

268
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,260
Kid the Phantom Thief.

269
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,500
I am honored to see you again, Your Majesty.

270
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,100
What a fool…there is nowhere for you to run.

271
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,970
Your Majesty…please remember,

272
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,610
that Kid the Phantom Thief is mysterious...

273
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,750
And he can always find the location
of the jewels with certainty.

274
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,020
And I know,

275
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
that you are a Queen...

276
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,220
And a mother with a heart!

277
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,560
Stop!!

278
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,090
Stop, Kid!

279
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,300
Damn!

280
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,940
How many times are you going to fall for that
dummy trick, Inspector…?

281
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Alright!

282
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,840
Make an emergency warning and post a police cordon!

283
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,780
Don't let him get away!

284
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,480
Yes!

285
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,450
Father!

286
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,050
Come here, father.

287
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,220
Something's wrong.

288
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,180
Aoko!?

289
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,590
Give it back.

290
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,420
That belongs to the people of my country!

291
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,430
Give it back!!

292
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,960
Wow...

293
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,700
How did you come all the way up here on your own?

294
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,630
I'm not alone

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,910
I told Alice you'll come.

296
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,570
And she helped me.

297
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,640
Alice!?

298
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,780
No! That's not Alice

299
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Spider, get away from that child!!

300
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,630
It's me you came to kill!

301
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,330
I see that you can't wait for my show…

302
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,240
Good work, Spider.

303
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,370
Out of the way.

304
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,640
Kid, give me the jewel!

305
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,110
We've got a little company…

306
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,480
Your nightmare is ready

307
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,320
What!?

308
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,290
Let's put a smile on that face!!

309
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,890
Kid!

310
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,200
Don't move, Kid!

311
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,930
Put the jewel down!

312
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,270
I held it up to the moon just now,

313
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,470
And saw that this isn't the Pandora that you're looking for.

314
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,680
Silence! I'll be the judge of that!

315
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,710
Turn around!

316
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,950
Hmph, we didn't need to hire that strange assassin after all.

317
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,890
I'm more than capable of taking care of you.

318
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,460
We'll see about that.

319
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,680
Are you alright?

320
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,050
Give the jewel back.

321
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,320
What? Is that any way to talk to the guy that saved your life?

322
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,260
The people in my country needs it.

323
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,830
I won't give it to a liar.

324
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,230
You want to get it back and have your mother praise you, right?

325
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,170
Right?

326
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,140
Yeah…

327
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,910
If you want to know how your mother feels,

328
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,610
I have a really good way of finding out.

329
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,750
She was apparently attacked soon after coming aboard.

330
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,990
The Kid must have disguised himself as her.

331
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,090
Alice…what is the meaning of this?

332
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,630
You were attacked, and the jewel was taken…

333
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,090
Your Majesty…

334
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,200
It is all my responsibility…

335
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,700
I was not able to maintain the honor of my nation…

336
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,470
Where is Phillip!?

337
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,910
Mother…

338
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,480
Prince Phillip…

339
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,710
Phillip!!

340
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,620
I'm sorry, Mother…

341
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,450
I chased Kid the Phantom Thief

342
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,990
and cornered him on the roof and tried to get the jewel back, but…

343
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,230
It got stolen…

344
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,170
Mother…

345
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,240
Why won't you listen to me?

346
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,280
Why are you always putting yourself in danger?

347
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,950
What is the point of me forcing myself to be so strict with you?

348
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,190
I know that I have to take your father's place, and protect you…

349
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,860
But…

350
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,960
Thank goodness...

351
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,560
You're safe…

352
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Mother!

353
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,070
Prince…

354
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,410
Good for you, Prince…

355
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,480
Your mother really is the Queen of Hearts!!

356
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,950
Now! Boys shouldn't cry!

357
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,820
And haven't I told you…

358
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,390
To call me Your Majesty!

359
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,960
Everything worked out in the end.

360
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,900
Wh…what… is this?

361
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,580
The masked Nightmare.

362
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,610
A mysterious planner who works with thieves all over the world,

363
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,180
to put together the perfect crime!

364
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,420
That weirdo masked man decided to call me!

365
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,360
Every thief targeted by Nightmare

366
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,130
either gets caught, or loses their life…

367
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,960
Interesting…I'll have to steal for him then!

368
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,800
The truth behind the Nightmare…!

369
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,766
Next on "Magic Kaito,"
"Tears of Love for the Dark Knight"!

370
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,346
