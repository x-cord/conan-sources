1
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,732
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,632
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,632
Today, the case as well as the lies will be figured out.

4
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,932
The identity of the beautiful client sure is a surprise.

5
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:28,432
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:30,332
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:32,532
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:58,491
A beautiful client appears at the detective office.

9
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,891
Her name is Shizuka Ikenami.

10
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:03,191
She comes to ask Pops to look for her classmate

11
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,891
during her intermediate school days,

12
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,391
who belong to the same Kendo club,

13
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:10,091
whose name is Shiro Shibata.

14
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:13,091
He was located immediately.

15
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,691
He seemed to be working as a P.E. teacher in Shizuoka.

16
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,691
We set off immediately to his place, but...

17
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,191
what awaited us there was...

18
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,791
the dead body of Mr. Shiro Shibata who had been killed.

19
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:32,591
He had the picture of Shizuka Ikenami gripped firmly in his hands.

20
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,091
What bothers me is why the client is so full of lies.

21
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,691
Almost everything that she says is a lie.

22
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,691
What on earth is she hiding?

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:54,291
"A Client Full of Lies (Part 2)"

24
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,691
Officer Yokomizo.

25
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:58,691
We've found a blood smeared wooden kendo sword

26
00:02:58,691 --> 00:02:59,791
that seems to be the murder weapon.

27
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,891
Really?

28
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,491
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:06,491
It was found by the emergency stairs right beside the front door.

30
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,791
Mrs. Shibata, did you have a wooden sword in the house?

31
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,991
Yes, on top of that shoe cabinet.

32
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,691
My husband kept it there to get rid of persistent solicitors.

33
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:19,791
It's not there right now, is it?

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,591
By the way, how many phones do you have?

35
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,291
Just two. One in the living room and one in the bedroom.

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,791
We did have one by the front door before too, though.

37
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,391
I see. I got it.

38
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:39,691
Now I know that the killer is you, Ms. Ikenami.

39
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:41,991
Hey, hey, Officer Yokomizo.

40
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:45,991
You made sure that he had the picture by calling him beforehand.

41
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,691
And in order to get it back,

42
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:50,491
you had already come here this morning.

43
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,491
However, you got into an argument with him

44
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,191
over the picture at the front door,

45
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,391
and on impulse struck him with the wooden sword

46
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,291
that was on top of the shoe cabinet.

47
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,691
Thinking that you had killed him,

48
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:05,791
you escaped from the emergency stairs.

49
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,691
But, Mr. Shibata was still alive at that time.

50
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,391
He desperately crawled across the floor

51
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,791
to the living room phone to get help,

52
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,791
but his body did not move as he willed it.

53
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,391
Just then, he sees the book with your picture between the pages.

54
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,691
He uses whatever strength that is left within himself...

55
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,191
and grabs the picture of the one who killed him, then dies.

56
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,891
But, it's only a picture...

57
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:39,891
There must be some secret behind the picture.

58
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,691
That's why she came back here again with you Mr. Mouri.

59
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,291
To get the picture back.

60
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,391
So, Ms. Ikenami,

61
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:52,291
please come to the station with me.

62
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,391
I refuse.

63
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:58,991
If you want to interrogate me,

64
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:03,491
please do so after you get an arrest warrant from court, will you?

65
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,491
Well, at this stage

66
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:08,591
when you are lacking in documents with credible evidence

67
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,991
on which the judge needs to base his impression of me,

68
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,891
I don't even think it is possible for you to compel him

69
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,891
to issue you a warrant of arrest anyway.

70
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,891
Of course, it would be a different story if Mrs. Shibata were there,

71
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:22,691
intends to file charges against us

72
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,491
for trespassing on private property.

73
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,291
What the...

74
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,691
Who the heck is this lady anyway?

75
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:37,291
Look at his left hand. It's smeared all over with blood.

76
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,091
He must've touched the wound on his head.

77
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,991
Strange, though.

78
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:46,191
There's no blood on the bandage around his finger.

79
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:48,791
Come to think of it, that lady's left hand was also...

80
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:52,891
Wait a second.

81
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,591
If so, on his right hand.

82
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:55,691
Hey.

83
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:03,391
I see, I get the picture now.

84
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:04,491
Hey!

85
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,091
That's a no, no!

86
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,691
So, the killer is...

87
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,591
She was here.

88
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:14,791
She came here before we came here.

89
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,491
To this blood smeared murder scene.

90
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,091
But, Ms. Ikenami...

91
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,391
the victim, Mr. Shibata was found dead

92
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:27,391
with your picture grabbed firmly in his hand, wasn't he?

93
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,191
I'll have to have you at least explain

94
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,791
what your relationship is with Mr. Shibata,

95
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:35,891
as well as why he happened to have that picture in his possession.

96
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:39,791
I have explained everything to Mr. Mouri already.

97
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:44,091
Then, come with us to the station and explain it to us too.

98
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,791
Then, let's do this.

99
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:51,691
I'll give Mr. Mouri power of attorney over me.

100
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:55,491
If he says I should go to the station

101
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,191
to be interrogated as a suspect,

102
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,791
I will.

103
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,291
Well...

104
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,191
Well, Mr. Mouri?

105
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,691
I think you should at least go for the interrogation.

106
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,491
But maybe it's not all that necessary.

107
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:13,691
Mr. Mouri!

108
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:17,191
-Well... -Mr. Mouri.

109
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:18,191
Mr. Mouri!

110
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:27,991
Mr. Mouri?

111
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,591
Ms. Ikenami, under these circumstances,

112
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,991
I guess you have no choice but to be interrogated.

113
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,191
Right?

114
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,491
Only not as a suspect but,

115
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:44,891
as a witness to prove the truth of the case

116
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:47,591
that I am about to disclose now.

117
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:50,791
Are you saying that she is not the killer?

118
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,091
No.

119
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,891
If she were the killer,

120
00:07:53,891 --> 00:08:00,491
and if she came here with us again to get her picture back,

121
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:04,491
she would've walked into the house

122
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,691
saying that the door was not locked

123
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:10,491
the minute I rang the doorbell and no one answered.

124
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,391
If she had come here beforehand

125
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,991
and struck Mr. Shibata to death,

126
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,891
she should've known that the door wasn't locked!

127
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,191
The only chance she had to get the picture back

128
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,391
was during the short time

129
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,491
between when the body was found to when the police arrived.

130
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,591
Then, is it you, Mr. Yoshikawa?

131
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:37,291
Since you seem to have known

132
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,291
"Takezo Yoshikawa (47)" -that the door was open back then.

133
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:45,591
Besides, you're the one who found the dead body.

134
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,291
I'll bet you came back to the scene

135
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,391
to get rid of something that you didn't want the police to see.

136
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,391
Hey...

137
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,691
No, Mr. Yoshikawa is not the killer either.

138
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,891
If the late Mr. Shibata always left the door open,

139
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:06,391
it wouldn't be hard to assume that the door would've been open then too.

140
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,991
Besides, it would be much too dangerous for Mr. Yoshikawa

141
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,791
whose alibi around the estimated time of the killing is not all that clear

142
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,991
to set foot again into the scene of the crime.

143
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,691
If there was something that he wanted to come and get that badly,

144
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,491
he would've done so, first thing...

145
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:26,091
He wouldn't come and get it almost half a day after the murder.

146
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,591
He would've known that if he called,

147
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:31,991
there would be nobody here except for the dead body.

148
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,891
Moreover, he went out of his way to stop all of us

149
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,791
who were ready to leave.

150
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,491
If I were the killer,

151
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,991
I would see to it that the visitors leave first,

152
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:46,891
then sneak into the house alone.

153
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,191
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

154
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:55,591
Yes, the one who seemingly has a legitimate alibi.

155
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,291
You!

156
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,999
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

157
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,099
Yes, the one who seemingly has a legitimate alibi.

158
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:14,699
You!

159
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,599
Mrs. Kyoko Shibata.

160
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,399
Mrs. Shibata is the killer?

161
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,799
Mrs. Shibata, don't tell me that you...

162
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,799
But, Mr. Mouri...

163
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,899
Mrs. Shibata prepared breakfast

164
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,099
and left at 05:00 in the morning, you know?

165
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:37,799
Why was the paper that was delivered at 06:00 am found on the table, then?

166
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,199
Moreover, she got back here after 07:00 pm

167
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,099
when a friend of hers dropped her off.

168
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:48,299
That's just about when you arrived here, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,799
How could she, who came back after you arrived here,

170
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,799
have moved the morning paper onto the table?

171
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,799
It's true that I got here after 07:00 pm.

172
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,999
This is indeed a very convenient way of expressing the time,

173
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,299
don't you think?

174
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,699
Whether it's 07:05 pm or 07:10 pm,

175
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,499
we can say after 07:00 pm.

176
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:15,299
In other words, Mrs. Shibata could've got back just before we got here.

177
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,099
Wait a minute.

178
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,299
Then, are you saying that the breakfast on the table is...

179
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,299
It's probably what she prepared for him

180
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,599
when he got home at three in the morning.

181
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:31,799
All she had to do was put the morning papers beside it

182
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,899
to make it look like breakfast.

183
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,899
But, what about that video?

184
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,899
The program that was aired at 08:00 am was being recorded.

185
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,499
All that needs to be done

186
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:50,099
is to set the pre-set record time to "long" and you've got it.

187
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,799
So, this is what Mrs. Shibata did...

188
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,299
"Around 03:00 am" -First, she urged her husband

189
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,399
who came back at 03:00 am in the morning

190
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,199
to take a bath or something, in order to kill time.

191
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,199
At just before 05:00 am,

192
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,399
she makes him eat the night snack on the table.

193
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,599
Then, she calls her husband while he is eating to go to the corridor,

194
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,099
and strikes him to death from behind with the wooden sword.

195
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:18,399
She then set the video up,

196
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,599
locks the front door and leaves the house.

197
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:24,799
"Around 05:00 am" -She gets into her friend's car that is waiting for her

198
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,999
at the main entrance of the condo at 05:00 am.

199
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,499
"Around 07:00 pm" -She returns after 07:00 pm,

200
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,999
takes the newspaper out of the door post box,

201
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,699
and put it on the dining table. Then she calls the police.

202
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:43,399
She has a perfect alibi.

203
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,999
I see.

204
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:49,799
That way she can make it look like somebody who had visited

205
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,799
had killed her husband while he was having breakfast

206
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,099
at around 08:00 in the morning.

207
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:57,299
But, when Mrs. Shibata returned,

208
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:00,599
something that she didn't expect had happened.

209
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,399
Her husband who was supposed to have been lying in the corridor,

210
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,999
in order to call for help,

211
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:09,799
crawled all the way over to the living room.

212
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:15,199
Yes, and as she was watching what had happened,

213
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,699
she gets a phone call.

214
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,199
Don't tell me that it was from me?

215
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,799
Yes, your call saying, "I'm going to pick you up soon."

216
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,199
Mrs. Shibata who heard the message on the answer phone got an idea.

217
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,099
Instead of reporting directly to the police

218
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,399
with the morning paper and food on the table,

219
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,299
she thought it better to make somebody else discover the body

220
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,999
and return home later.

221
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,399
That way, it would make her much less suspicious.

222
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,099
Then, where was Mrs. Shibata till then?

223
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:53,599
She was probably hiding behind the door of the emergency stairs

224
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,699
besides the front door until Mr. Yoshikawa came.

225
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:03,299
Although we seemed to have arrived here earlier than he did.

226
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,399
Mr. Detective, then what is that picture all about?

227
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,099
Why did Mr. Shibata have her picture gripped in his hand?

228
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,299
That's a camouflage that Mrs. Shibata thought up

229
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:17,599
to on the spur of the moment to divert everyone's attention.

230
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,499
Camouflage?

231
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:23,199
First, please look at her husband's left hand.

232
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,799
The palm of his hand is smeared with blood and yet,

233
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,099
there is no blood on the bandage that is wrapped around his ring finger.

234
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:33,699
You're right!

235
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:36,099
Then, look at his right hand.

236
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,899
This is...

237
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,899
Don't tell me that this is a trace of...

238
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,299
Yes. When Mrs. Shibata came to the living room,

239
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:50,299
Mr. Shibata was already holding it in his hand!

240
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,899
The marriage ring that is a symbol of their being husband and wife.

241
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,799
Mrs. Shibata who realized

242
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,899
that her husband was not wearing his marriage ring

243
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,599
that he always wears on his left ring finger,

244
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:07,199
knew right away that he was grabbing it in his right hand,

245
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,999
and somehow opened his fist that had already closed tight

246
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,999
and removed the ring.

247
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,199
But, if she left things as were,

248
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,399
his right hand would look awfully unnatural and stand out.

249
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,999
Therefore, she made him hold the picture of Ms. Ikenami

250
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,399
that was between the pages of the book.

251
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:27,899
I see.

252
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,499
So, it could've been anything if it didn't point at her.

253
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,099
Yes, she then tried to put the ring back

254
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,899
on the ring finger of his left hand,

255
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,499
but she couldn't put it back on because his fingers were bent.

256
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,699
That's why she wrapped a bandage around his finger.

257
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,099
All to hide the traces of his marriage ring.

258
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,699
She probably also wrapped his little finger

259
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,999
so that it wouldn't stand out as much.

260
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,699
Officer Yokomizo, I found it.

261
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:57,999
The trace of a marriage ring under the bandage.

262
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,599
Okay, take a picture of it right away, will you?

263
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,499
Now, for the ring.

264
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:04,499
Search every nook and cranny in this house.

265
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,999
No, that won't be necessary.

266
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,699
I'm sure Mrs. Shibata still has it on her.

267
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,699
I don't think she would hide a ring that would have luminal reaction

268
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:20,099
even if the blood were to be wiped off,

269
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:23,499
somewhere inside the house before the police arrive.

270
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,399
Of course she wouldn't hide it by the emergency stairs either.

271
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,999
The safest thing to do would be to get rid of it

272
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:32,499
after the police leave.

273
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,099
That's why I'm sure she still has it with her.

274
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,699
The dying message that her husband left behind to indicate

275
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,999
that he was killed by her.

276
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:57,299
I guess evil never wins after all.

277
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,999
The evil things that my husband and Mr. Yoshikawa had been doing

278
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,399
didn't come out in the open yet.

279
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,999
Don't you think it's unfair?

280
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,899
They were gambling playing mahjong!

281
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:10,899
My husband was playing mahjong and gambling everyday.

282
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,799
Moreover, they were gambling exorbitant amounts

283
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,599
that would make your eyes pop out.

284
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,999
Thanks to them, I had to sell off the computer, jewelry, car,

285
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:21,999
laser disc player and speaker, one after the other.

286
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,399
All because of that detestable game.

287
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,299
My husband told me

288
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,499
that the next thing he was selling was my golf clubs.

289
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,099
And, after that he would even sell off

290
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,099
the sword that my father gave him as a wedding gift.

291
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:38,899
Let's go to the station so we can hear you out.

292
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:43,299
Yes, right after I change clothes.

293
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,899
A sword?

294
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:51,899
Oh no.

295
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:53,399
Don't tell me?

296
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,499
Stay away!

297
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,299
I really don't have a choice.

298
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,699
-I need to stop my evil deeds. -Mrs. Shibata, please calm down.

299
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:11,899
I'm finished, because I've killed somebody.

300
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:14,599
-Mrs. Shibata. -Will you move out of the way?

301
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:27,099
What's with you, stay away from me.

302
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,499
Stay away I said!

303
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,099
Are you going to kill again?

304
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,199
I'm asking if you're still going to kill

305
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,399
after having already killed your husband.

306
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,999
Kill... I was just going to kill myself.

307
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,099
You idiot! There is no such thing as mine or yours when it comes to life!

308
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,299
It's something very important that you're not supposed to take away!

309
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,399
Those who kill are all killers and fools!

310
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:05,199
It doesn't make any difference if it's your own life!

311
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,899
Don't you ever forget that!

312
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,899
Shall we get going then, officer?

313
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,999
Oh, yes.

314
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:18,399
Before that, Ms. Ikenami.

315
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:22,599
Isn't it about time you tell us

316
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,799
the reason for your four lies?

317
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,499
I can't figure out how you with weak bronchial tubes like knitting,

318
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,999
when there is yarn flying all over the place.

319
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:36,499
Knowing what kind of fish it is, just by looking at slices of it,

320
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,699
goes to show that you like cooking.

321
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,999
Moreover, you are married

322
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,899
but you're hiding the trace of the wedding ring

323
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,099
that is on your ring finger.

324
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,199
And, the name Reiko...

325
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:53,699
Nobody in that ninja novel has that name.

326
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:58,299
And, what is the meaning behind the reason you mumbled "Reiko"

327
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,999
in the coffee shop?

328
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,699
Not "Reiko", but "Rei" of cold, "co" of coffee.

329
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,599
She was probably going to order cold coffee,

330
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,399
but decided otherwise.

331
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,799
Because calling iced coffee, "rei-co"

332
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,299
would give away the fact that she is from Osaka.

333
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,199
In this day and age, though,

334
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,999
the only people who would talk like that are mom or middle aged women.

335
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,899
Right, old lady?

336
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:24,999
Heiji and Kazuha.

337
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,999
No.

338
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,199
Hey, old lady!

339
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,499
You finished what you had to do, right?

340
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:32,099
So go on back to Osaka.

341
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,899
Hey, you!

342
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,399
Hey, stop calling her old lady, how rude!

343
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,399
It doesn't matter what I call her

344
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,299
because she's my mother.

345
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,899
She can't be, because she's not dark skinned!

346
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,899
You idiot!

347
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,999
I got my dark skin from my grandpa!

348
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,899
Oh my God.

349
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:28,099
What? You came to check me out?

350
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,999
Yes, that's right.

351
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:32,699
Every time Heiji is with you,

352
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,899
he seems to have serious wounds, right?

353
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,599
I thought that maybe you were making him go through

354
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,199
rigorous training of some sort,

355
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,999
saying that he needed it in order to become a detective.

356
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:45,699
Even when I came to Osaka,

357
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,499
you didn't drop by but went straight back to Tokyo.

358
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:52,499
So, I was worried that you may be a ruthless and callous guy.

359
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,499
Talk for yourself, mom. You didn't even come to the hospital back then,

360
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,099
but was waiting in front of the balloon fish restaurant.

361
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,699
I couldn't let things go by without checking it out any longer,

362
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:04,099
and that's why I decided to come.

363
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,799
However, after seeing you, I really got the picture.

364
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,399
That you, Mr. Mouri, are a sharp, keen and nice man

365
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:12,399
that Heiji couldn't help but respect.

366
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,199
Well, thank you.

367
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,399
I arranged things beforehand with Shiro by phone,

368
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:19,799
and made it sound like I was looking for him.

369
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,799
You saw through my lies

370
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,199
and the murder of Shiro that happened coincidentally too.

371
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:25,899
You solved it all in no time at all.

372
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm really sad about what happened to Shiro,

373
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,799
but I got the picture that I had been looking for back.

374
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,699
What a lady.

375
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,499
I thought you said you didn't want the picture back

376
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,199
because it's a picture of an underclassman beating you, and it vexed you,

377
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,499
so you didn't want it back.

378
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:45,099
Now, I can rest at ease leaving Heiji and Kazuha in your hands.

379
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,599
Leave them in my hands?

380
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,299
By the way, why are the two of you carrying luggage?

381
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,999
Hey, didn't you hear anything from this kid?

382
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,699
What? You mean that phone call was for real?

383
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,999
"Next Episode" -The message went...

384
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,499
"The mermaid will kill me, help."

385
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,499
A mermaid...

386
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:10,999
Will kill somebody?

387
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:13,599
That's...

388
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:20,999
This crime can be carried out by anyone, be it a man or a woman.

389
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,999
And, the killer is still somewhere nearby.

390
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,099
Next Conan,

391
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,720
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Mystery)"

392
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,617
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,717
"Numbered tag"

394
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,717
Must watch those two people.

395
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,417
Good looking brothers and sisters.
