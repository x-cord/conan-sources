1
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:04,924
The live performance of popular ventriloquist, Riichi Tengan

2
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,224
was a story about a ventriloquist

3
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:09,924
who is possessed by his "partner" doll

4
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:13,224
and driven to kill his wife.

5
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:15,924
However, Mr. Tengan

6
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:18,524
who suffers from dissociative personality disorder,

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,824
also known as multiple personality disorder,

8
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,624
asks Pops to keep watch over him

9
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:27,024
since he may kill his wife.

10
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:29,524
Pops refused to take on the job,

11
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:31,824
but the following morning,

12
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,824
his wife was found killed

13
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,224
in a very similar way as the performance.

14
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:41,324
However, Mr. Tengan is soon cleared of suspicion.

15
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,624
Believing that Mr. Haruomi Togawa,

16
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,424
wanting to settle his illicit affair,

17
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:48,424
and therefore, committed the crime,

18
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,124
the police requests a warrant for his arrest.

19
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:53,824
However...

20
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:58,124
Would a person who wanted to frame Mr. Tengan for the crime

21
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,924
call Pops and ask for help in the first place?

22
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,724
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

23
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,924
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

24
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:07,924
The ventriloquist or his partner the doll, who's in charge?

25
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:10,224
This is what leads to the essence of the case.

26
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:11,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:13,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,724
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:06,337
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 2)"

30
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,337
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

31
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,837
I respected the master.

32
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:21,137
I would never do something like frame my master.

33
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,937
Never ever!

34
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,337
What's this then?

35
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,837
Didn't you use this to make Mr. Tengan

36
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:32,637
believe that he had multiple personality disorder?

37
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:36,037
That... that's mine for sure.

38
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:38,937
I used it to practice ventriloquism.

39
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:42,637
But, I haven't seen it around for some time.

40
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:43,837
To think that it was

41
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,337
set up in a place like that...

42
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,037
Then, are you saying that

43
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,937
these glasses splattered with the victim's blood,

44
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,637
and the fact that it was hidden inside your bag,

45
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:54,637
you know nothing about it, either?

46
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:55,737
Of course, I know nothing of it.

47
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:58,937
I lost that a little while ago too.

48
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:02,737
I really have no idea why it was in there.

49
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:04,037
It's true!

50
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,537
Too bad.

51
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,837
I was hoping that it would be for your sake

52
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:10,137
to admit to the crime you committed

53
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:12,837
before the arrest warrant arrived, but...

54
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:14,637
Even so...

55
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,637
What I didn't do, I didn't do!

56
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:25,237
From Mr. Mouri?

57
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:27,837
Officer Takagi, it's me.

58
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:31,137
I want to check something just in case.

59
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,037
Dad, you'll catch cold!

60
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,837
Conan?

61
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:49,437
Where's Mr. Mouri?

62
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,637
He said he had something else to investigate,

63
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,737
so he told me to come and confirm it.

64
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:57,137
Can you hurry and open it, Officer Takagi?

65
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:00,237
Yeah, hold it.

66
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,337
I see, this is it!

67
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:16,137
This is what I was so bothered about it!

68
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:19,437
Is something wrong, Conan?

69
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:22,537
This picture is of the living room, right?

70
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,037
Of the crime scene beyond.

71
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:28,537
Yeah, it looks to be so.

72
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,337
What about it?

73
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,137
When the suspect Mr. Togawa

74
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:35,737
found Mr. Tengan's wife's corpse,

75
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,737
he used the spare key to get in too, right?

76
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:44,137
Right, he came as always to pick Mr. Tengan up to go to work,

77
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,337
and rang the doorbell, but since nobody answered

78
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,837
he entered using the spare key.

79
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,637
And he found the corpse in the living room.

80
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:54,937
He woke Mr. Tengan who was sleeping in the bedroom.

81
00:05:54,937 --> 00:06:01,337
Then, he called 110 and Mr. Mouri for help.

82
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:04,137
That's his version of the story.

83
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,937
But, he has the spare key.

84
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:09,937
Deep in the night, after Mr. Tengan falls asleep

85
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,737
drinking his sleeping pills as usual.

86
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,637
It would've been possible for him to sneak in.

87
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,037
It's also possible that the victim,

88
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:18,737
his adulterous lover let him in.

89
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,637
Then after committing the crime,

90
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:23,637
we don't know yet whether he stayed at the crime scene

91
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:27,337
or came back again in the morning but...

92
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:30,937
The murder weapon trophy was here, wasn't it?

93
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,037
But, I don't think it was here to begin with.

94
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:34,037
Oh?

95
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:38,637
See, the traces of dust doesn't match with the trophy.

96
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:39,937
True.

97
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:43,837
It looks as if the trophy in back was originally here.

98
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,137
This...

99
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,937
was here?

100
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,137
It matches perfectly.

101
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:54,237
That's the way it was in the picture at the entrance too.

102
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,337
Officer Takagi.

103
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:00,237
I have something I'd like you to confirm.

104
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,637
What?

105
00:07:02,737 --> 00:07:04,437
Yes.

106
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,537
Yes. Is that so?

107
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:08,037
I understand.

108
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:12,837
I had them ask the suspect Mr. Haruomi Togawa about it.

109
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:16,137
That trophy is what Mr. Tengan won for the first time

110
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:18,637
at the long hoped for international tournament.

111
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,037
It seems he always had it in front

112
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:23,237
because it was so precious to him.

113
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,637
But, it was put behind,

114
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,937
and the trophy that was the murder weapon was placed in front.

115
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:37,637
And as to the place where he called 110 and Mr. Mouri.

116
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,137
As to that phone call.

117
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:40,137
If I remember correctly,

118
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:42,337
I think I made the call from the front entrance.

119
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,637
Because I didn't want him to hear me saying that

120
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:48,637
maybe he killed his wife.

121
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,137
A bag.

122
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,137
I don't know.

123
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,937
Because I was panicked too, I don't know where I put it.

124
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:58,637
I probably left it in the living room

125
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:01,437
and went to make the phone call.

126
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:04,937
What's this?

127
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:09,037
That's probably thread from the gloves,

128
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,337
is what I was told by forensics.

129
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:12,637
Gloves?

130
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:17,537
It seems the perp used it to keep his fingerprints off the trophy

131
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:21,137
that had only Mr. Tengan's prints on it.

132
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:25,537
Were the gloves found already?

133
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:29,637
No, they weren't found in his residence or any place around.

134
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:33,937
They think he already disposed of them somewhere.

135
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,537
Strange.

136
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,637
Who would hide the glasses on his person

137
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,637
without even cleaning them,

138
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:42,937
while throwing away just the gloves?

139
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:47,237
Are we about done already, Conan?

140
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:50,437
I've got to start getting back to headquarters soon.

141
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,037
Did we cover everything Mr. Mouri wanted us to confirm?

142
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:56,237
Yes. Thank you very much, Officer Takagi.

143
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,737
I've got to report this to Pops too.

144
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:00,037
See you.

145
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:04,337
I don't get it.

146
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:06,537
The real perp is him.

147
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,837
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:14,537
But, I can't figure out the most important thing yet.

149
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,537
That's from this afternoon.

150
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:26,937
I'm sorry for all the commotion I've caused.

151
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:31,937
I'd like to apologize from the bottom of my heart

152
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,837
for all the trouble and worry

153
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:36,637
that I caused to all my fans and staff.

154
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:40,237
You don't need to apologize, partner!

155
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:41,937
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

156
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:44,737
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

157
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:47,537
I see! I got it.

158
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:50,437
I've finally figured out the most important thing.

159
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,037
Pops was...

160
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:56,237
Rather, we were being framed by him.

161
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,637
"The Terrifying and Bloodcurdling Ventriloquist"

162
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:12,737
"Riichi Tengan's Dark Performance"

163
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:05,204
Thanks for waiting, partner.

164
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:11,804
You really worked it out well, didn't you, partner?

165
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,604
Let me toast too.

166
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:40,304
What're you looking for, partner?

167
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:44,004
Is it that speaker and recorder?

168
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,704
You'd never find anything like that around.

169
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:51,804
The police confiscated it long ago.

170
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:56,104
Shut... shut up!

171
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,104
I'll shut up, partner.

172
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:02,704
If you don't want to talk, I can't talk.

173
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,104
Shut up!

174
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,704
You and I are one and the same.

175
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm you and you're me.

176
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,104
You know that, don't you, partner?

177
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,804
Shut up...

178
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,104
It can't be.

179
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,204
Don't tell me that I really...

180
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,104
It can't be!

181
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:27,204
It's impossible, totally impossible!

182
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:32,004
Right. It's impossible.

183
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:35,304
You're completely sane,

184
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,004
and you completely planned out

185
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:39,704
the murder of your wife.

186
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,604
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,604
Rather, Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:47,004
So, you...

189
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:50,404
set up a recorder and speaker somewhere here after all.

190
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,704
Just what're you trying to do?

191
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,204
I killed my wife?

192
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:57,404
Please quit joking.

193
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,604
I've got to practice from now

194
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,004
for my additional performance tomorrow, you see, so I'm busy.

195
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:05,004
Right. I want a reasonable explanation for this, Mr. Mouri.

196
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:06,704
Because just as you told me to,

197
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,904
I stopped the request for the arrest warrant

198
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,404
for Mr. Togawa for now.

199
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:15,004
I've got to give the court a persuading explanation.

200
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:17,804
I'm fully aware of that, Inspector.

201
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:22,804
I will now tell you of the truth of the case that I've arrived to.

202
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:26,604
Isn't Togawa the one who killed my wife?

203
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,404
Didn't he try to frame me by making me believe that

204
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:31,504
I was suffering from multiple personality disorder?

205
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:35,704
So, that indeed was your plan.

206
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:38,804
You made people initially suspect you,

207
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,604
then made me the great Detective Kogoro Mouri,

208
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:42,204
clear you of suspicion, which after

209
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:45,004
you put the blame of committing the murder on Mr. Togawa.

210
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,504
A very clever scheme indeed.

211
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:49,804
What?

212
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,204
You went as far as to change the program

213
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:55,204
of your live performance and acted it out

214
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:59,104
in order to mislead me, correct?

215
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,104
Don't tell me that...

216
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,504
So...

217
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:08,204
Yes, the one who set up the recorder and speaker

218
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:11,704
that was stolen from Mr. Togawa beforehand,

219
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:15,004
as well as the one who told Mr. Togawa to practice

220
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:17,604
and he would check on his progress the next day morning,

221
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,704
making it impossible for Mr. Togawa to establish an alibi

222
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,704
was Mr. Tengan.

223
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:25,104
After having said all this, I'd like to go on to explain

224
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,504
how he went on to commit the crime

225
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,604
and the circumstances involved.

226
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,404
The murder weapon that killed your wife.

227
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:36,204
That trophy

228
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:39,804
was normally placed towards the back of the sideboard.

229
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:40,804
Therefore, before committing the crime,

230
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,004
the position of the trophy that was precious to you, Mr. Tengan

231
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:45,204
was changed and placed behind.

232
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:49,104
If Mr. Togawa were the perp,

233
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:51,904
this act would be totally meaningless.

234
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:55,404
Because anything would've served as a murder weapon.

235
00:14:55,404 --> 00:15:00,604
Didn't he do so to frame me?

236
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:02,704
I'm sure that's it!

237
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:07,204
Like I already said, he didn't need to do such a thing.

238
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:12,104
Mr. Tengan, only your prints were found on the trophy.

239
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:16,504
Of course this was done to first make us suspect you.

240
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,304
Therefore, you held the murder weapon trophy with your bare hands.

241
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:21,804
Moreover, you went as far as to say.

242
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,304
"I killed her."

243
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:28,104
Why would he have to take such bothersome steps?

244
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,304
That... that's...

245
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,804
Then after committing the crime, you wore gloves,

246
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:37,604
and splattered the victim's blood on Mr. Togawa's glasses

247
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,504
that you also stole beforehand.

248
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,404
In the morning, Mr. Togawa woke you up,

249
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,304
and you pretended to find out about her death for the first time.

250
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:51,204
During the time Mr. Togawa

251
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:54,504
was calling 110 and me for help on the phone,

252
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,704
you put on your gloves again

253
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,204
and put the blood splattered glasses

254
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,604
into the bottom of Mr. Togawa's bag and hid them.

255
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,404
It was probably then that the thread got hooked onto

256
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:09,004
the connection between the temple and the frame of the glasses.

257
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,804
So, that's what it was.

258
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,204
Then you feigned suffering from multiple personality disorder

259
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:17,104
saying that your doll ordered you to do it.

260
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:20,004
This way, you made everyone suspect you initially.

261
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,104
I killed her.

262
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:24,504
That guy...

263
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:27,004
That guy inside of me ordered me to do it.

264
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:29,704
I killed my wife.

265
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:32,904
Hey. Here I'm trying to establish an alibi for you

266
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,304
and you got to make that remark?

267
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:38,904
Then, you made me find this recorder and speaker.

268
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:43,104
This is a speaker?

269
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,104
You made everyone shift their suspicion to Mr. Togawa,

270
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:50,804
and as the final blow, you made the police discover the glasses.

271
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:54,304
This is ridiculous.

272
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,104
Where do you have such evidence?

273
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,604
The evidence are the gloves.

274
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,504
The gloves?

275
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:06,204
Yes, the gloves that were thought to be used

276
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:09,704
when put the glasses splattered with blood into Mr. Togawa's bag

277
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,504
that I mentioned a while ago.

278
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,504
After that, Mr. Tengan,

279
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:17,404
you hid those gloves.

280
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,904
The place is...

281
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,904
Yes, judging from the time,

282
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,604
it's in that room no other place than the crime scene,

283
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:26,804
the living room is thinkable.

284
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,404
Then did you find it?

285
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:34,604
No, they weren't found even when the police investigated the site.

286
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:37,004
That's right, Mr. Mouri.

287
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,604
Most naturally.

288
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,604
There's no such thing to begin with.

289
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:45,504
Then, let's try and ask your partner.

290
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:49,704
You know where he hid them, don't you, partner?

291
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:58,604
Don't worry, partner!

292
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:02,404
I won't dare tell them that I have them with me.

293
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,704
Well, that's enough for the joke.

294
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,404
Officer Takagi!

295
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:16,304
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:26,104
I found them. The gloves.

297
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:28,204
That stain is...

298
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:29,904
Blood!

299
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:31,104
Impossible!

300
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:33,404
I've disposed of them long ago!

301
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:36,804
I would think so.

302
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,904
Of course, those are fake.

303
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:41,704
Fake?

304
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,204
The real ones were probably disposed of by Mr. Tengan

305
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:47,204
as soon as he was acquitted.

306
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:51,704
But you should've thrown away the doll, too.

307
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:54,504
However, he's your partner who's been with you for years

308
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:58,904
and even helped you win a international tournament,

309
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,204
I guess you never even thought of doing so.

310
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:04,304
Could it be?

311
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:08,504
Yes, while you left your partner here a while ago

312
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:12,404
and went to another room to make arrangements with your staff,

313
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:14,404
we took the liberty of investigating.

314
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,504
The same fiber that was found on the glasses

315
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:21,404
although very slight, was found from inside the doll.

316
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:25,104
The blood of the victim was also found there.

317
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:28,804
Furthermore, the perspiration of another person,

318
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:31,104
the DNA, was also detected on the fiber.

319
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,804
It's probably what was on the gloves.

320
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:38,504
If necessary, we would like to get a warrant

321
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:42,104
and ask you to provide us with your saliva or hair.

322
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:46,104
Then, we could wait for the test results.

323
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:51,304
No need for that.

324
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:52,804
I won at the international tournament

325
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,204
that I've always been hoping for and yet,

326
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,104
to find of all things that my wife and apprentice

327
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,204
had been involved in an illicit affair.

328
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:02,404
My pride just couldn't forgive them.

329
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:06,204
Mr. Mouri, how did you figure it out?

330
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:10,004
Of course, the doll told me.

331
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:14,004
Because you hid your gloves there

332
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,804
the facial expression of the doll had changed.

333
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:23,304
Now everything that's yours is mine.

334
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:30,104
Now, who should I possess next?

335
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:38,904
You don't need to apologize, partner!

336
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,604
You're victim of an extramarital affair,

337
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:44,104
and the bereaved family of the victim who was killed.

338
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,104
If I were to go on further, the doll...

339
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:48,404
Rather, you and the doll

340
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:52,304
had been telling the truth from the very beginning.

341
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:54,604
The only one truth.

342
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,204
How can I shut up?

343
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,604
That woman, of all things,

344
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:01,804
is having an affair with your apprentice, you know, partner!

345
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:03,904
I did it.

346
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:07,104
I killed my wife.

347
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:12,904
You used the doll to make remarks to act out a perfect crime.

348
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:52,604
What's going on?

349
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,304
I remember to the part till when I came here.

350
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,304
Inspector, where is it?

351
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,704
The new evidence?

352
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:12,704
I really did nearly arrest the wrong man this time.

353
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:15,304
You really helped me out a lot, Mr. Mouri!

354
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:16,904
Is that right?

355
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,204
I helped you out again.

356
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:24,104
But, I didn't know you had the talent of being a ventriloquist.

357
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:26,604
-A ventriloquist? -Oops...

358
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:30,304
The voice of the doll a while ago, was you, wasn't it?

359
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,704
Just as you said,

360
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:36,104
we still have the recorder and speaker in our custody.

361
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:38,004
Well, I guess so.

362
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:44,304
For me, ventriloquism is like sleep talking.

363
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:47,304
Well, I guess for you it is, Pops.

364
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:55,304
First of all, take a look at this picture, will you?

365
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:56,804
What's this?

366
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,004
A sickle.

367
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,004
An animal that has sickles is...

368
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:03,204
-Ka... -Kamaitachi?

369
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,404
Dad?

370
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,604
Heiji? What's up?

371
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:09,804
Both of you are bleeding.

372
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,404
Hey, that wound.

373
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:15,804
Don't tell me that...

374
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:21,804
Next Conan, "Kamaitachi Inn (Part 1)"

375
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:24,747
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,847
"Outdoor bath"

377
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,747
Hattori and Kazuha will be joining us in the next episode.

378
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:30,147
Maybe there'll be no room for Pops to appear.

379
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:31,747
But, it's an outdoor bath, you know.
