1
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,832
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:22,732
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,332
Today's episode is Part II of the story about the mermaid.

4
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:26,232
Danger creeps up on the interesting couple.

5
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,732
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:29,532
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:32,132
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,691
The strange letter sent to Heiji Hattori beckons us

9
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:03,391
and we come to the island of Bikuni

10
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,791
"Bikuni Island"

11
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:12,191
But we learn that the sender, Saori Kadowaki is missing.

12
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,791
That night, the island is lively

13
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,591
because they are celebrating the annual Dugong Festival.

14
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,791
The islanders believe that whoever possesses the Dugong Arrow blessed by

15
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,891
the holy person who gained eternal life by eating dugong meat

16
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,691
would also be granted with eternal life.

17
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,491
But during the festival,

18
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:37,591
one of Saori's childhood friends, Toshimi Ebihara

19
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,191
is found hanging by the neck in the waterfall.

20
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,091
Hattori and I realize this is a murder

21
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,591
and we begin to investigate,

22
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:51,091
but on the night of Toshimi's wake, another murder takes place.

23
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,191
You're right.

24
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,391
What's going on?

25
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,691
Oh, Heiji.

26
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,191
Somebody's out there.

27
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,591
Are you sure?

28
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:12,391
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Unveiling)"

29
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,291
I don't think she's been dead longer than an hour.

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,391
She was probably strangled then put in this net.

31
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:26,991
The footprints on the sand are from sandals and rubber boots.

32
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,191
Nahoko was probably wearing these sandals,

33
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,491
so the murderer must've been wearing boots.

34
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,291
How cruel.

35
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,491
Hey, look.

36
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:39,091
See, doesn't this look like an arrow was stepped on by sandals?

37
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:40,991
It's been stepped on by sandals

38
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,291
so Nahoko must have stepped on it after it fell

39
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
while she struggled with the murderer.

40
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,391
The killer must've taken the arrow.

41
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:54,391
Let's follow the boot prints, that'll lead us to the killer.

42
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,791
You're right.

43
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,791
Hey, these prints...

44
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,191
They look like they go straight into the ocean.

45
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,091
You're right.

46
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,491
There's some shiny things around the prints.

47
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,991
What are they?

48
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,291
These are...

49
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,891
Fish scales?

50
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:21,691
There're fish scales on Nahoko's body too. There's 2 or 3 on her.

51
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,991
What?

52
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,291
What are you people doing there?

53
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,591
Carrying out an investigation, of course.

54
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:32,791
We're the Fukui Prefecture Police, that's our job.

55
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,291
-Prefecture Police? -You're finally here.

56
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:41,191
What? The killer's footprints disappeared into the sea?

57
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:44,691
Yeah, they left some fish scales behind too.

58
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,391
Did you say fish scales?

59
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,391
You're not saying the killer's a mermaid?

60
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:52,091
How stupid. Mermaids don't wear rubber boots.

61
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,691
The killer probably approached from the shoreline

62
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,091
and then went up to the nets where Nahoko was told to wait.

63
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,691
After murdering Nahoko, the killer walked back to the shoreline

64
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:04,891
and left the scene walking through the water.

65
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,191
Now I get it.

66
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:11,191
By the way, did anyone see Nahoko leave the room?

67
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:15,591
Not me. She wasn't there when I got there.

68
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:17,891
Benzo, what about you?

69
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,091
You signed in right after Nahoko, didn't you?

70
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,491
I didn't see her

71
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:24,191
and nobody was in the room when I got there.

72
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:28,091
That means Nahoko was the first one to get here

73
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,191
then she left to go to where the nets were hung.

74
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:33,591
Wait a minute, do you think the person who killed Toshimi

75
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,991
killed Nahoko too?

76
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,791
We don't know that for sure yet

77
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,091
but we do know the killer took Nahoko's arrow.

78
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,691
The Dugong Arrow?

79
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,591
Before she disappeared,

80
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:47,691
Saori also said that she'd lost her arrow.

81
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:49,191
Don't tell me that...

82
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,691
Yeah. She might already be dead too.

83
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,291
I saw Saori near the Mermaid's Waterfall

84
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,991
on the morning of yesterday's festival.

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,191
I saw her too. She was far away and I only got a glance,

86
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:05,291
she was in the forest by the waterfall.

87
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,591
Are you absolutely sure it was Saori?

88
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:11,791
No mistake, she's the only girl with brown hair and glasses.

89
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,391
And she always wears blue clothes.

90
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,591
Then she must be running away from something,

91
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,991
that's why she's hiding from everyone.

92
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:24,191
Mr. Benzo, don't you have any idea what's happened?

93
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:29,491
Don't ask me. She never told me anything.

94
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:34,391
I just hope she hasn't turned into a mermaid like this dead girl.

95
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,991
Mermaid? What do you mean?

96
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:40,691
Didn't you know? The legendary nun

97
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,791
ate the meat of the mermaid that was caught in the net.

98
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,791
Mermaid?

99
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,091
If the arrow leaves your person, evil will overtake you,

100
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:54,791
women will return to water and become silent mermaids.

101
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,491
Kazuha.

102
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,891
Never mind that, in the morning, let's all go look for Saori.

103
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,191
Kazuha.

104
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,691
Stay close to me.

105
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,691
Heiji.

106
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,591
Later that night,

107
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,791
the police searched everyone at the wake

108
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:23,191
looking for the person who took Nahoko's arrow, but...

109
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:26,091
The only ones with arrows were Benzo and Kazuha

110
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,791
who won them at the festival.

111
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,891
Kudo, did you find anything out?

112
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:33,591
No, nothing.

113
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,991
All I know at this point is,

114
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:39,191
Toshimi, Nahoko and the missing Saori

115
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:43,291
believed in the powers of the Holy Person

116
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,691
who is said to have eaten mermaid flesh.

117
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,591
Yeah, it's almost abnormal how much they believed it.

118
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,691
If we only knew who held what number at last night's festival.

119
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,091
That's easy.

120
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,291
We have everyone sign the list.

121
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,191
Would you like to come with me now and take a look at the list?

122
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,691
Of course.

123
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,891
Watch out.

124
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,191
For goodness sakes, dad. Get a grip on yourself.

125
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,991
Kimie.

126
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,891
I know this is a bad time,

127
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,391
but did you think about what we talked about before?

128
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,991
I'm serious, you know.

129
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,091
I can't. Toshimi's dead, it wouldn't be fair to her.

130
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,991
Besides, I have my great-grandmother to take care of,

131
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,891
I can't leave this island.

132
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,391
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,891
Did the 5 of you go to college together too?

134
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,291
Yes.

135
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,891
We all loved watching movies

136
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,891
and joined the movie club in college.

137
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,991
We even made a film about the legendary nun.

138
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,491
And it took first place in the film contest,

139
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,391
we were so excited.

140
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,891
We all set our sights on Hollywood.

141
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,491
That's fantastic.

142
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:03,391
But we all loved this island and ended up coming back.

143
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:06,991
Who would have dreamed Toshimi and Nahoko would end up like this?

144
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,091
That's strange.

145
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:13,991
I could have sworn we left them here.

146
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,691
Can't you find them?

147
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,391
No. Only the ones for this year are missing.

148
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,891
Maybe that old lady took them?

149
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,491
She would never do that.

150
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:25,291
Did anyone else know you kept them there?

151
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,291
Most of the locals knew.

152
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:32,491
I'll go check the other rooms just in case.

153
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,891
-I'll help you. -Me too.

154
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,291
Thank you.

155
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,291
Wow, look at these names.

156
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,591
A former Foreign Affairs Minister,

157
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:48,791
a Chief Secretary of the Cabinet

158
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,591
and President of the Bank of Japan.

159
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,491
They all wanted to live a long life, I guess.

160
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,591
Shino Miyano?

161
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:00,591
I'm pretty sure her real name was something like that.

162
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,191
But it couldn't be,

163
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:05,491
she's not the type to wish for eternal youth and beauty.

164
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,191
What happened?

165
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:14,491
I saw a brown-haired girl with glasses standing over there.

166
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,791
She was staring at us.

167
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,491
-That's impossible. -Saori was here?

168
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:25,191
What is this? Why's this glass cracked?

169
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,191
Where's Kimie?

170
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,891
She said she was going to look in the rebuilt warehouse.

171
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,591
Where is it?

172
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:33,891
I'm pretty sure she said it was behind the shrine.

173
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,691
Hey, what's that? It's awfully bright over there.

174
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,891
It couldn't be...

175
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:41,591
The fire continued to burn throughout the night

176
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,691
just like 3 years ago, it burnt to the ground.

177
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:50,091
That's right, it was exactly like the fire 3 years ago.

178
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:52,491
Including the remains of 1 victim.

179
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,591
A burned body?

180
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,391
That's right, it was burned beyond recognition

181
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,891
but it had glasses on.

182
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,391
You could just barely make out it was wearing blue clothing.

183
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,491
It's probably Saori who was missing.

184
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,891
Then the girl we saw last night was...

185
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:09,691
A ghost?

186
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,991
Kimie.

187
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:15,191
Kimie. Where are you, Kimie?

188
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,691
Kimie!

189
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,891
Isn't Kimie back yet?

190
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:19,891
No, she's not.

191
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,791
I'll go stay with the great-grandmother.

192
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,191
I'll go too.

193
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,791
Hey, Hattori.

194
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,491
Didn't Kimie say she went to the dentist recently?

195
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,391
Yeah, she did.

196
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,191
You don't mean...

197
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,591
Do you know what you're implying?

198
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:36,991
Don't play dumb.

199
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,391
The same thought passed through your mind too, didn't it?

200
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,191
We both have the same bad feeling about this.

201
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,891
"Half A Day Later" -Yes, I see.

202
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:48,191
"Half A Day Later" -Thank you very much.

203
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:51,791
What did you find out?

204
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,891
They compared Kimie's dental records

205
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:57,491
with the burn victim's teeth and...

206
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:00,891
They were a perfect match.

207
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:03,691
-How awful. -Kimie's dead.

208
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:10,691
I don't believe it. It's all a lie!

209
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,199
I see.

210
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,399
So Kimie's dead.

211
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,199
We've very sorry.

212
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,599
We lost sight of her for just a moments.

213
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,699
Another young life has been lost

214
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,499
and here I am, still alive at this old age, I'm so ashamed.

215
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,799
I have a question, the mermaid's grave

216
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,299
that you asked someone to help you move into the forest,

217
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,199
who helped you do it?

218
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,999
It won't do you any good to know,

219
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,999
that person's died before me too.

220
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,699
Hey, Pops.

221
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,599
Did you find anything?

222
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,299
Absolutely nothing.

223
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,599
What a complicated case.

224
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,599
We can't even figure out who the killer is,

225
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,999
how can we find a motive for all of this.

226
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:09,499
On top of that, we don't even know why Kimie was dressed like Saori.

227
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:14,699
Well, that was probably to make us think it was Saori who died.

228
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,999
Then the killer must be Saori?

229
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:20,899
Or it could be someone who wants us to think it is.

230
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,399
Is that the ocean?

231
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,999
Yes, the ocean's right behind us.

232
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,399
Last night...

233
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:34,199
Kimie told us that, last night.

234
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,599
Well, no matter who the killer is, one thing is for sure.

235
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,399
We've got to find the killer as soon as possible,

236
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,699
we can't let such a heartless killer run free.

237
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,599
Dad.

238
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,399
What is it, Ran?

239
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,799
Someone just called Kimie's home,

240
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,999
the caller said something strange.

241
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,499
What do you mean?

242
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:01,099
The caller said, 'thank you for letting me have the arrow'.

243
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:05,399
'It was worth the 1,000,000. My son's operation was a success'.

244
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,099
Someone bought the arrow?

245
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:08,599
For 1,000,000?

246
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,699
Yes. The caller said that the other morning, a man who said

247
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:15,099
he worked at the shrine agreed to sell it as a special favor.

248
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:18,599
Doesn't that have something to do with the old couple

249
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,399
who cancelled the morning of the festival?

250
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,599
It probably does.

251
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,499
And so, what was the man's name?

252
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:26,399
I don't know but he was a big man probably in his 50's

253
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,499
and he had a scruffy beard.

254
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,899
Are you sure?

255
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:31,899
Mr. Benzo?

256
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:35,999
Hey. If it was before the festival, then that arrow...

257
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,599
More than likely it was the arrow Saori said she lost.

258
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:43,599
And lucky for Benzo, he won an arrow at the festival

259
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,599
and on top of that, the register with all the names got lost.

260
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,099
Something's going on.

261
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,899
Nahoko, who was killed on the day of Toshimi's wake

262
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,399
also had her arrow stolen.

263
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,099
I'm going to the Ebihara's home where the wake was held.

264
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,399
Kudo... I mean Pops.

265
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,699
Please go and check Benzo's place.

266
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:02,999
Good grief.

267
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,899
Are you sure about that?

268
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,199
Did you say Benzo left right after us last night?

269
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,899
That's right, he looked scared.

270
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,499
I knew it, Benzo was listening to us.

271
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:22,799
He heard us talking about going with Kimie to check the register.

272
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,799
So he took a shortcut and stole it before we arrived.

273
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,899
Then it was probably Benzo who set fire to warehouse, right?

274
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,099
You're probably right.

275
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:34,499
If Kimie found him hanging around holding the register...

276
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,799
What're you doing here?

277
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,999
Don't tell me you forgot. You're the one who told to stay close.

278
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,599
Oh, that's right.

279
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,399
Besides, since I have an arrow that's been blessed,

280
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,699
I'm your good luck charm.

281
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,499
You have nothing to worry about, if you're in danger,

282
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,199
I'll protect you.

283
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,399
I'm so lucky.

284
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,999
I'm serious. Heiji.

285
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,099
But now that Kimie's dead,

286
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,899
I guess this will be the last Dugong Festival.

287
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,599
I guess so.

288
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,699
Hey, you.

289
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,499
Can you tell me once more

290
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:11,899
which footprints are yours and your friends?

291
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,799
Sure, no problem.

292
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,399
What...

293
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,399
What is it, Heiji?

294
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,899
There are scratches on the back of this sandal

295
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,299
and they're still fresh.

296
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:31,999
Where are the sandals Nahoko was wearing?

297
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,099
They were taken to the Fukui Police Department.

298
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:37,699
Kazuha, let me see your arrow.

299
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,499
Perfect match.

300
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:48,199
These are the sandals that stepped on the arrow on the sand.

301
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,199
Which means... what I thought all along...

302
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,399
Rats. I knew it, no one's home.

303
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,899
Hey, what're you people doing here?

304
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:05,099
Well, we wanted to talk to Benzo, do you know where he is?

305
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,799
I haven't seen him since the wake last night.

306
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,099
What a bad timing. We thought at least we could take a look

307
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,799
at the missing Saori's room.

308
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,299
If you want to get inside, take a look under the potted plant.

309
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:18,999
That's where the key is.

310
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,599
Let's see now.

311
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,799
I found it.

312
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,899
Alright, let's do it.

313
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:27,799
Are you sure it's alright to go in without permission?

314
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,999
He won't mind, we'll just have a fast look.

315
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:34,099
Hey, how did Saori act just before she disappeared?

316
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,499
Well, she was scared, even when the ocean got rough,

317
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,699
she said the mermaid was going to punish her.

318
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,099
Punish her?

319
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,599
This is Saori's room.

320
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,199
What's this bag doing here?

321
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,999
I wonder what's inside.

322
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,799
Conan.

323
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,699
Aspirin, toothbrush.

324
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,699
That's Saori's run away from home set.

325
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:04,699
But then she usually went to Kimie's

326
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:08,299
so I heard she kept extra clothes and a spare pair of glasses there.

327
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,299
So you mean the clothes Kimie was wearing

328
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,799
when she was found in the warehouse,

329
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,799
she could have put them on herself?

330
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,899
How stupid, why'd she have to go and do that for?

331
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,299
Maybe to lure the killer out.

332
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,699
Just kidding.

333
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,699
That's ridiculous.

334
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:30,399
But if Kimie thought the killer was after Saori too

335
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:33,199
and if she saw someone suspicious hanging around the house,

336
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,799
she might have done what Conan said

337
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,499
so that she could catch the killer.

338
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,599
You're crazy, last night during the fire,

339
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,099
didn't you say you saw someone who looked like Saori in the yard?

340
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:46,799
Is there a picture of Saori in this room?

341
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,999
I think there's a photo album around.

342
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:53,899
Ran. Is this the girl you saw?

343
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,699
I'm not sure, it was pretty dark.

344
00:18:56,699 --> 00:19:00,499
These pictures, are they the ones from when you did the film

345
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:01,999
on the legendary nun?

346
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:02,999
Yes.

347
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,499
Where? Let me see.

348
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,399
Wow, this is something.

349
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,399
It really looks like a mermaid is swimming in the ocean.

350
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,599
It really does, this scene in the storm is so realistic.

351
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,499
Yes, Saori's special effect photography

352
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,499
and Kimie's theatrical makeup techniques

353
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:22,399
were the main reasons we won first place.

354
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:26,299
But 1 year after that, there really was a storm

355
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,399
and both Kimie's parents, as well as mine and Saori's mother

356
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,999
were lost at sea.

357
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,999
Not one of us dreamed anything like that would happen.

358
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,199
Wait a minute.

359
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,799
Bank book, cash card, name stamp.

360
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,699
Driver's license and passport are here.

361
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,399
But that thing's not here.

362
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,299
I don't understand.

363
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,799
It can't be?

364
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,799
Hattori here.

365
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,699
Oh, Kudo... I mean, Pops.

366
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:06,999
I was just about to call you.

367
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,299
The sandal we found in the Kadowaki' yard

368
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,899
had scratches on it from stepping on the arrow.

369
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:13,899
It proves that on the night of the wake,

370
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:15,999
the killer went to where Nahoko was waiting near the nets

371
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,299
and after killing her, the killer returned to the wake.

372
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:26,499
The only 2 who could have done that were Benzo and Rokuro.

373
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,299
But seeing how upset Rokuro was in the afternoon,

374
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,899
I doubt he'd do anything to hurt Kimie...

375
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,199
Which means the killer is...

376
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,799
Hattori. I'm going to tell you my theory now.

377
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,099
Listen carefully.

378
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,399
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:02,099
That's ridiculous! It's impossible! I don't believe it!

380
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:03,399
Hattori.

381
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,599
When we rule out the impossible,

382
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,999
only the truth remains, no matter how unbelievable it might seem.

383
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,099
What did you say?

384
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:14,899
Inspector!

385
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:17,899
Our men are in the forest tracking down Benzo Kadowaki.

386
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,499
Good. Let's go, men.

387
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:23,199
After we catch Benzo, I'll go to where you are.

388
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,399
-Wait there for me. -Heiji?

389
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,499
Hey!

390
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:34,499
I don't want to believe in it either, Hattori.

391
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,599
It's a lie. A lie. It can't be true.

392
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,799
You can't make me believe it, Kudo.

393
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,099
What's that? Do you smell incense?

394
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,399
Idiot.

395
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,999
Who'd be burning incense this deep in the forest?

396
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,099
"Danger - Cliff Ahead"

397
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,499
A grave.

398
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:02,499
Is this the mermaid's grave?

399
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:06,299
Wait a minute, then this must mean...

400
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,199
It's like Kudo said after all,

401
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:12,199
so the murderers who he said it is...

402
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,499
Oh, no.

403
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,999
Oh, no. The cliff.

404
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,399
No...

405
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:32,599
Kazuha!

406
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,399
Forgive me, Heiji.

407
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,199
Kazuha?

408
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,799
Goodbye.

409
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,799
You fool!

410
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,299
The only 2 capable of leaving the wake

411
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,199
were Benzo and Rokuro.

412
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:19,899
There's only 1 person who could have come with that plan

413
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:22,399
before the festival.

414
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,199
That's right, you are the killer.

415
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,199
Next Conan,

416
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,720
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Conclusion)"

417
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,617
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,717
"Insurance card"

419
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:36,817
In the next episode, the mystery is solved.

420
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:38,717
I wonder if Kazuha is all right.

421
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,717
Watch the next episode and find out!
