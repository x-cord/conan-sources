1
00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:20.732
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:22.832
Step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:24.332
A pond that changes color with the passing of time turns crimson.

4
00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:26.432
And the case is solved.

5
00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:27.832
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.832
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:32.332
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.791
We attended a tea ceremony on behalf of Sonoko and her father

9
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.791
that were to be held at Aonogi residence.

10
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:04.491
There is a pond in the garden where the color of the water

11
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.991
changes into five different hues.

12
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.091
And in the center of it

13
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:09.691
is a tearoom that is accessed by a connection corridor.

14
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.191
We were enjoying ourselves looking at the pond

15
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.791
when the incident occurred.

16
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:18.991
The master had hung himself and died!

17
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:21.391
Moreover, he died exactly like legend had it.

18
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:25.891
No, this is not suicide.

19
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.091
It's homicide!

20
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.091
I'm sure that someone here

21
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:34.091
schemed a very clever trick and killed the master

22
00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.391
after making it look like he committed suicide!

23
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.691
Who could have done this?

24
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:42.991
:Who is pretending to be the monster?

25
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:51.291
"The Legend Of The Five Colored Water Palace (Part 2)"

26
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:54.491
So, at a little after 4pm

27
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:55.991
when everyone gathered in this room,

28
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.991
you all saw the master's corpse from this veranda, right?

29
00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:03.391
Yes.

30
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.791
The water of the pond was just changing crimson.

31
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.291
And besides, Ryoichi looked at his wristwatch to confirm the time.

32
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.791
Yes.

33
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.591
It was 4pm sharp.

34
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:16.891
I looked towards the tea room then,

35
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:19.291
but my father's corpse was still not there.

36
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:23.891
It happened right after Ms. Mimura returned.

37
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.191
Where were you all at that time?

38
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.591
I was taking a bath for about 30 minutes.

39
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.391
I had some business to attend to and went out for a while.

40
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.491
Where did you go?

41
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.491
It was something personal!

42
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:40.091
I don't have to answer you!

43
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:43.091
What about you, Ms. Hanasaki?

44
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.191
I was the kitchen making preparations for the evening

45
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.791
and taking care of the guests here.

46
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.991
How about you, Mr. Ryoichi?

47
00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:54.691
I was going in and out of the guestroom.

48
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:59.791
I heard that the master burned your precious fishing rod?

49
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.691
Well, you see...

50
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:04.691
Tell us about what really happened.

51
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:10.191
I was told to attend the tea ceremony tonight.

52
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:14.891
It seemed that he wanted to announce me becoming his successor

53
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:16.991
at the ceremony.

54
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.691
But you don't know a thing about the practice of tea!

55
00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:21.891
No way!

56
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:25.391
He couldn't have possibly said something like that!

57
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.591
So, did you accept the offer?

58
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:31.891
No way! I refused!

59
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.291
In other words, the master burned your fishing rod

60
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.591
because you wouldn't listen to him?

61
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.291
And you hated him because of that?

62
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:44.191
Wait a second.

63
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:47.791
Officer Yokomizo, when the master was died,

64
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.091
everyone including Ryoichi was here in this room.

65
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:52.491
Exactly.

66
00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.991
If in fact someone did go over to kill him,

67
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.791
as you can see, we would've witnessed it from the veranda.

68
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.291
I was sitting on that chair all the while,

69
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:06.391
and no one was seen going to the tea room.

70
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.991
Which means everyone has a perfect alibi.

71
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:17.391
I wonder about what Ms. Mimura brought in when she returned.

72
00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:20.291
She looked to be concerned about people seeing her.

73
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.891
But she couldn't possibly had time to hide anything.

74
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.091
Which means...

75
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.891
Could that be it?

76
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.391
I knew it. Just as I thought!

77
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:42.491
Could I please have a glass of water?

78
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:47.391
I'm sorry, I'm so thirsty.

79
00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:49.691
Here you go.

80
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:50.891
Thank you so much.

81
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.991
I'll make some tea for everyone else right now.

82
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.591
Excuse me, Ms. Hanasaki.

83
00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:01.091
Yes, sonny?

84
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:03.491
Why doesn't Mr. Ryoichi want to succeed the master

85
00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:05.591
despite being an only child?

86
00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:07.891
That's...

87
00:06:07.891 --> 00:06:11.491
Keep out of this, kid!

88
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:14.991
But that's true. Why?

89
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.391
I didn't want to become like my father.

90
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:19.991
Father was so haughty

91
00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.391
that mother was always crying in sadness.

92
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.691
But isn't it only natural for a father to want his son

93
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:27.491
to take over the seat of the successor

94
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:29.191
that has been handed down for generations?

95
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:32.791
Becoming a master means giving speeches and lectures.

96
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:37.091
The pay is really good, and you get to own tea bowls

97
00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:39.491
that have been handed down for generations.

98
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:42.591
That's all father was ever interested in!

99
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:45.091
So, if he passes the seat onto you,

100
00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:49.891
he can go on living the way he has up to now.

101
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:53.291
That's what I didn't like about father.

102
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:55.491
Let me help you, Ms. Hanasaki.

103
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.791
Thank you.

104
00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:00.191
If you don't like him that much, why didn't you leave the house?

105
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:01.891
Hey!

106
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:03.191
Right.

107
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:06.491
Well, I was gone for quite a while actually.

108
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:08.191
I had him come back

109
00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:12.191
because I was burdened taking care of the master alone.

110
00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:13.491
I see.

111
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.991
I came back on the condition that I would not succeed my father.

112
00:07:15.991 --> 00:07:18.691
He didn't have anyone to manage his money,

113
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:20.491
so he said I could come back if I handled accounting for him.

114
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:23.891
He's really greedy, you know.

115
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:28.691
But he asked you to be his successor again.

116
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.091
Accounting?

117
00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:32.791
Then, you know how much money and assets

118
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:34.691
the Aonogi family has, don't you?

119
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:35.691
Hey!

120
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:37.891
Is he right?

121
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:41.891
In the event your father dies before his successor is decided on,

122
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.891
you will inherit all his assets, right?

123
00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:45.991
Not to mention that

124
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:48.991
the seat of the master is free for you to do as you please.

125
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:51.991
What was your real reason for coming back home?

126
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:53.391
How rude!

127
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:57.091
Master had health problems!

128
00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:58.691
Why else would he came back

129
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:00.691
if it's not because of he's worried about his father?

130
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:03.591
It's okay. Thank you, Ms. Hanasaki.

131
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:05.791
I'm going to go and serve this, then.

132
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.991
So, the master who was afraid of the monster of the pond

133
00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.891
stayed confined in the tea room

134
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:17.891
where there's talismans were posted everywhere.

135
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:21.491
Moreover, he hated it when anyone comes near the room.

136
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.991
Yes, he even had an alarm set up to keep intruders away.

137
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:27.291
Which means that

138
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:31.591
it would be difficult for an outsider to come in.

139
00:08:31.591 --> 00:08:33.691
Right.

140
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:36.291
On top of that, the tea room is surrounded by the pond.

141
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.391
If anyone were to go by the only corridor there us here,

142
00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:42.391
somebody would've seen it.

143
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:44.491
How did the killer do it?

144
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.391
What's with you?

145
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.891
I'll bet you were deceiving the master by offering him expensive bowls,

146
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:53.891
but let me tell you, he isn't dumb!

147
00:08:53.891 --> 00:08:55.391
Speak for yourself!

148
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:58.291
I heard you invested so much money

149
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.691
to the point of running your company bankrupt!

150
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.391
Hold on a minute please!

151
00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:05.591
All I'm asking is about your relationship with the master.

152
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:11.191
Huh? What's with this tea cup?

153
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.091
Ms. Hanasaki! There's a crack in this cup.

154
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:17.691
I'm very sorry.

155
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.191
I'll bet that all you're concerned about is how it looks on the outside

156
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.391
and don't care about how it looks on the inside!

157
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:26.591
Care only about how it looks like on the outside?

158
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:30.191
Now, now. I'm sure she's upset after what happened.

159
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:31.691
I wonder?

160
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:35.191
Ms. Hanasaki, I'll bet you're glad that the master's dead.

161
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.591
After all, he's the one who lead his wife

162
00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:41.891
who was taking such good care of you to her death.

163
00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:44.191
I would never!

164
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:48.691
Ms. Hanasaki has been taking good care of father.

165
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.991
Oh, my! For all I know, I'll bet you both

166
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:55.191
drove master to commit suicide with all your talks about the monster.

167
00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:58.291
-What? -How absurd!

168
00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:01.691
Ms. Hanasaki!

169
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.291
Ms. Hanasaki.

170
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:11.691
How dare she say that I hated him.

171
00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:15.191
Don't let her bother you.

172
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:18.291
Like you already know, she's always like that.

173
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:21.591
Is she the master's wife?

174
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:23.691
She looks very kind.

175
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.291
She really was kind.

176
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:31.691
Just by looking at her picture comforts me.

177
00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:34.491
That's why I have so many pictures of her here.

178
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:40.391
She never got down on me for not liking tea ceremony.

179
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.891
She used to keep company fishing, too.

180
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:47.491
The way this rope was tied...

181
00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:05.391
There! Somebody forced their way here.

182
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:07.791
If my deduction is correct...

183
00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:17.991
Just as I thought.

184
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.691
Which means the killer must be the person

185
00:11:19.691 --> 00:11:23.891
who was acting at the time the corpse was found.

186
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:28.291
There must be some evidence that the killer left behind.

187
00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:36.291
That's...

188
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:39.991
I've found unmovable evidence!

189
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:43.391
Thank you so much, everyone.

190
00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:45.191
Okay, so I get to go home.

191
00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:48.891
Yes, since there is no doubt it was suicide.

192
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:51.091
-Oh, no! -Goodness.

193
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:52.991
Oh, Conan. We're going home.

194
00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:54.591
Where's Pops?

195
00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:55.691
He'll be down right now.

196
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:56.691
Okay!

197
00:11:58.591 --> 00:12:01.091
So, it's over.

198
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:04.391
All right, time to head home.

199
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.291
Sure, after you take a nap first, though.

200
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.180
All we have to do now is wait for the coroner's report.

201
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.180
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.580
Officer!

203
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.480
Pops is saying, "Don't tell me they're leaving

204
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.080
with the killer right before their eyes!"

205
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.680
The killer?

206
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.280
Dad figured it out!

207
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.380
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

208
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.980
You actually already know, don't you,

209
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.380
Officer Yokomizo?

210
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.280
That the master didn't commit suicide,

211
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.380
but was killed.

212
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.980
Please give me the details.

213
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.180
Well, I'm sure glad that we have a famous detective around!

214
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.480
At least, we're spared being bored.

215
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.080
I guess I'll explain it briefly, then.

216
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.280
About the time when the pond turned crimson in color,

217
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.980
the killing took place without anyone noticing.

218
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.780
However, when the master's body was found,

219
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.180
you were all in this room, right?

220
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.880
Yes, the killer tied the master

221
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.280
inside the tea room onto a beam

222
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.280
while staying in this room using one rope!

223
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.780
What?

224
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.880
With one rope?

225
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.680
The killer following the account of the monster story

226
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.080
about this pond that had been carried down for generations,

227
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.180
and slashed the master on the porch of the tea room.

228
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.380
Then, the master was strangled to death

229
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.780
with a rope wrapped around his neck from behind.

230
00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.380
The killer tied the rope that was hidden somewhere

231
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.080
in the tea room to a beam.

232
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.980
A special knot was tied so that if one side was pulled on,

233
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.380
the loop of the rope would get smaller

234
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.880
with one end was wrapped around the master's neck,

235
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.380
and the other end was tied to the support of the beam.

236
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.980
The rope was then passed through the window on the outside.

237
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.080
The rope was tied onto the stick of the windmill beforehand

238
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.180
and sunk way deep in the water of the pond.

239
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.280
The rope was then tied onto the end of the rope

240
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.380
that was drawn outside from inside.

241
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.180
This is how the rope was rigged.

242
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.980
Finally, a spring is made by using the removable wood

243
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.980
by the miniature entrance, a thumbtack and a rubber band.

244
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.180
The locked door trick is set up by supporting the door

245
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.180
with the hanging scroll,

246
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.380
which after the killer leaves.

247
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.380
Come to think of it, there seemed to be something

248
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.580
that looked to be a needle hole on the door.

249
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.480
What?

250
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.580
The killer came back to this room after all that was done,

251
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.680
and created an alibi.

252
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.180
Oh, my God! Really?

253
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.180
The pond turns crimson just about 4pm

254
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.580
and the timer starts the windmill spinning automatically.

255
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.580
Then, the rope is wound by the stick of the windmill

256
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.480
and the corpse is pulled into the room.

257
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.280
The hanging scroll bumps into the body which falls,

258
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.580
and the door completely falls.

259
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.780
The removable wood locks into the hole in the pillar.

260
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.980
After the rope pulls the body up to the beam,

261
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.680
the loop is closed tightly.

262
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.980
The part of the rope that had been measured beforehand

263
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.080
and partly severed was cuts off completely,

264
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.780
and were pulled by the windmill and goes outside.

265
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.180
All that needed to be done after that was deliberately

266
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.980
make it look like the door was being moved to the side

267
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.080
while we were all shocked at finding the corpse,

268
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.480
and remove the thumbtack and rubber band.

269
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.980
I see.

270
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.680
If so, the crime could've been committed.

271
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.680
At about the time the windmill begins spinning,

272
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.880
the sunshine from the west

273
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.980
diffuses reflection on the surface of the water,

274
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.180
making the rope difficult to see.

275
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:50.080
The killer used this characteristic to commit the crime.

276
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.780
But how did the killer made it to the tea room?

277
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.180
By using the joining corridor that we were looking at.

278
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.480
Wasn't it you that just testified

279
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.680
that nobody was seen going to the tea room?

280
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.680
But you were the one who said,

281
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.780
"All you're concerned about is how it looks on the outside,

282
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.680
and don't care how it looks on the inside."

283
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.380
Isn't that right?

284
00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.680
What? Yes.

285
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.780
You're right.

286
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.180
The killer used that blind spot,

287
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.380
leaving us looking at the pond

288
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.080
while walking right before our eyes

289
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.780
under the joining corridor.

290
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.880
What?

291
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.480
The killer first snuck under the joining corridor

292
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.880
from the bushes beside the corridor.

293
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.880
Then, he swam all the way to the tea room.

294
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.180
After that, he came up in front of the entrance door on the veranda.

295
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.580
After luring the master out,

296
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.980
the killer slashed him with the knife.

297
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.380
So, Mr. Mouri, just who is the killer?

298
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.380
The killer acted strange

299
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.580
during the time the crime was being committed.

300
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.480
Ms. Mimura, it's you, isn't it?

301
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.280
You said you were going out, but...

302
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.280
What's with you?

303
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.880
Are you saying that I'm the one who killed the master?

304
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.080
So, I take it you will explain where you went now?

305
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.680
I just went to pick this up!

306
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.880
Isn't that an expensive bowl?

307
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.080
How did you know?

308
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.380
After knowing that the master

309
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.680
was going to retire after the tea ceremony tonight,

310
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.780
weren't you afraid that Mr. Yagura

311
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.780
would get the seat as his successor?

312
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.480
That's why you went out to go and get yourself a bowl

313
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.980
that was even more expensive than that Mr. Yagura brought.

314
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.280
Isn't that right, Ms. Mimura?

315
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.780
Because if I inherit the master,

316
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.280
most of his asset would become mine.

317
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.880
I just got a bit greedy.

318
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.880
I'm sure you're telling the truth.

319
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.080
If you go out and sneak back in,

320
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.480
the security alarm would go off.

321
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.880
When Ms. Mimura actually returned,

322
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.180
Ms. Hanasaki went to greet her at the door.

323
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.980
Unfortunately, she had no time to go near the tea room.

324
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.680
Which means Ms. Mimura is not the killer.

325
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.980
Then, who killed the master?

326
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.880
The killer, after having calculated that the master

327
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.780
wanting to put on a grand performance,

328
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.080
would not let anyone near the tea room

329
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.980
hung the master by the neck tying the rope in a special way.

330
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.480
It is a method of rope tying that the fishermen use

331
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.880
when they want to anchor the boat in place.

332
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.780
Fisherman?

333
00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.880
I didn't do it!

334
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.080
No, it's not you.

335
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.480
The killer swam across the corridor.

336
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.080
I see!

337
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.280
The killer had to be drenched! His hair, body and all!

338
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.780
In order to hide this fact, the killer had to take a bath

339
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.280
right after he committed the crime.

340
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.480
That's right.

341
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.180
The killer is you, Mr. Yagura!

342
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.180
When everyone was gathered in this room,

343
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.380
you criticized Ms. Mimura's behavior severely, right?

344
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.980
I had to go between both of you and stop you.

345
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.580
You did that because you didn't us to notice

346
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.180
that the master being pulled up, didn't you?

347
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.780
No wonder you were so enraged.

348
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.880
All you had to do after that

349
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.880
was wait for someone to notices the master's body.

350
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.980
It's all a lie!

351
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.580
You're assuming everything with no proof at all!

352
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.080
No use trying to deceive us at this point.

353
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.980
You've left evidence behind for all of us to see.

354
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.280
In the joining corridor to the tea room.

355
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.080
Mr. Mouri, I've found what you asked me to look for!

356
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.380
What is it?

357
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.880
The thing that was found on the beams

358
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.680
under the joining corridor.

359
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.680
What?

360
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.880
It's a handprint.

361
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.180
And this black thing is...

362
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.980
It's the moss in the pond.

363
00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.680
If he passed by there,

364
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.680
I figured it had to be stuck somewhere.

365
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.280
There are many traces of the handprint

366
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.980
and I'm sure we can distinguish the fingerprints from it, too.

367
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.580
The officers of the criminal investigation section

368
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.880
are checking on it now.

369
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.980
I hate to be rude,

370
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.180
but will you let me take your fingerprints, Mr. Yagura?

371
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.280
I thought the whole plan was perfect.

372
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.180
So, you admit it?

373
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.480
That guy was the worse!

374
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.980
I'll bet he told you

375
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.880
that he'd let you inherit his seat and were all for it.

376
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.580
No!

377
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.480
I was making fake pieces of expensive pottery

378
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.680
together with him and selling them off.

379
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.780
No way.

380
00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.180
I'll bet you didn't know, did you?

381
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.580
We've been at it for the last 10 years.

382
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.480
However, after the death of his wife,

383
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.580
he started believing the existence of the monster,

384
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.580
and his entire personality changed.

385
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.380
He said he would let Ryoichi inherit everything

386
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.080
and publicize what took place.

387
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.680
So, you had no choice but to kill him

388
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.980
before he made everything public.

389
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.880
He shouldn't have made that tea room.

390
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.380
Look! It's happening as legend has it, didn't it?

391
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.280
It's already night time.

392
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.880
I can drive you over to a station

393
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.980
or a hot spring if you like.

394
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.780
I'd really appreciate that!

395
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.580
Although he may have made it look like it goes with the legend,

396
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.780
I'm beginning to think

397
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.380
that there may actually be a monster.

398
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.280
Well, since it happened long ago,

399
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.280
there may have been a gigantic serpent at least?

400
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.480
But it's not a big deal.

401
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.680
If it comes squirming out,

402
00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.980
all we have to do is catch it and shed its skin.

403
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.480
What's wrong with you guys?

404
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.880
-That... -That...

405
00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.180
It's a serpent!

406
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.580
Hey, I thought you said it was no big deal?

407
00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.780
"Next Episode"

408
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.880
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

409
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.780
Take my advice, stay away from her.

410
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.580
Because she's not one you can handle.

411
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.880
Hey, I've found it!

412
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.580
Mitsuhiko's Youth Detective Squad badge!

413
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.380
Next Conan,

414
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.301
"Mushrooms, A Bear and the Youth Detective Squad (Part 1)"

415
00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:31.498
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:31.498 --> 00:24:33.298
"Hunter"

417
00:24:33.298 --> 00:24:34.898
In the next episode, the Youth Detective Squad goes all out.

418
00:24:34.898 --> 00:24:36.798
Conan, I'm counting on you as to the next episode.

419
00:24:36.798 --> 00:24:37.998
Okay!
