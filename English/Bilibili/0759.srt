1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,840
The Red Woman was seriously scary!

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,240
Well, the one who actually attacked wasn't The Red Woman, though.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,540
You can say that again.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,640
I wonder what would've become of us

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,640
if Inspectors Yamato and Morobushi didn't come back then.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,240
Even if the two didn't come,

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,740
I think we could've suppressed her hands down!

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,140
You're really strong after all!

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,940
Aren't you doing anything besides martial arts?

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,440
I was really into Jeet Kune Do when I was a child.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,540
I used to watch the video that my oldest brother used to send me

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,840
until I practically wore it out and trained myself with it!

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
Besides, there was also a practice hall in the neighbourhood too.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,840
As for other sports,

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
I just did a bit of everything in PE class.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,840
But after I left for the States when I was in junior high school,

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,140
I played other sports sometimes with my friends over there too.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,240
There were no practice halls where I went either.

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,940
Really?

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,040
I used to watch a lot of sports with Mom too.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,140
I can also tell that Conan is pretty good

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,240
at playing soccer too, you see.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,040
Thank you.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,240
Which means your mother is still in the States?

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,340
Yes. Thanks to her being there,

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,840
I end up staying in hotels after coming back to Japan!

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,940
Well, I could've gone to live with my second oldest brother

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,040
who's been living in Japan all this time

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,740
but, he didn't want me to do so.

30
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,540
But living in a hotel?

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,340
I'll bet you're a girl that comes from a rich family or something?

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,340
My father's friend that's been taking care of us from before is rich.

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,740
Well, not as rich as your family, though, Sonoko.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,340
I know of no other relative that I can depend on.

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,140
Besides, I'm thinking

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,840
that I'd have to repay him when I grow up!

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,740
If she has only two older brothers and herself,

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,240
and know nothing of her relatives...

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,140
Who was that girl

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,040
that resembled Sera that I saw on her cell?

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,740
Hey, is that hotel near here?

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,040
Yes.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,140
May we go over for a while then?

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,440
I'd like to see where you live too, Sera!

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
I guess so.

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
I guess I'll text mail him then.

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,140
I was actually supposed to meet my brother.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,640
Oh, then don't bother.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,140
It's fine.

50
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,240
I wanted to tell him directly about The Red Woman case

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,140
so I sort of forced myself onto him.

52
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,940
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

53
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

54
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,740
A popular novelist is confined to his hotel room.

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,940
A romantic novel transforms into a mystery.

56
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,440
His name is Detective Conan.

59
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,270
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 1)"

60
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,170
This hotel has 50 floors.

61
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,170
But, it's not as tall as our Bell Tree Tower.

62
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,370
Of course.

63
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,770
Because that's the tallest tower in Japan.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,470
Well, I'm going to be moving out of here in a while again though.

65
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,070
Is that so.

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,770
Who were they?

67
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,170
Those grumpy looking men.

68
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,670
It seems that they're waiting for the manuscript

69
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,570
from a novelist that's being confined to this hotel.

70
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,470
If I remember correctly his name was...

71
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,170
Keigo Hiura!

72
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,970
-"Keigo Hiura (48)" -I'm a so-called writer of romantic novels.

73
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,370
I read your books!

74
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,470
I'm currently hooked on, "Telephone, Sea and I"

75
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,670
Oh, thank you so much!

76
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,870
Not at all.

77
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,270
You don't have to be meticulous, ok?

78
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,770
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,570
We'll be going then.

80
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,070
Okay.

81
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,870
How about you guys?

82
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,270
Why don't you guys join me for a meal here?

83
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,670
I'll bet you're hungry?

84
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,970
But...

85
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,970
We're here for the manuscript.

86
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,370
The deadline's closing in too, you see.

87
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,270
Oh, come on.

88
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,170
I think I ordered a bit too much food

89
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,670
and can't eat all of this by myself.

90
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,270
I'll guess I'll ask for his autograph later.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,870
Look at this. You really went all out, didn't you.

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,670
No wonder a lot of people

93
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,870
were going in and out of your room.

94
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,170
Well, we haven't had lunch yet so it's pretty good timing.

95
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,570
Well, help yourself and dig in.

96
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,970
Room service.

97
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,570
Your wine, sir.

98
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,870
Here it is. Here it is!

99
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,370
Thank you for waiting.

100
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,270
This... This is it.

101
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,470
I've been waiting for you!

102
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,070
Hey, Mr. Hiura! Don't tell me you plan to drink?

103
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,970
Please put the wine in the decanter over there, will you?

104
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,670
Yes, of course.

105
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,070
Mr. Hiura.

106
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,370
Well, please take it as a token of my appreciation

107
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,770
for everything you've done for me so far.

108
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,770
Please go ahead and help yourself to your heart's content.

109
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,470
My priority is finishing the manuscript of the publishing company

110
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,470
that has editors that eat the most!

111
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,070
Come on.

112
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,470
The amount of food eaten?

113
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,070
Just how you going to measure that?

114
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,170
I'll just weigh you before and after you've eaten.

115
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,970
I've got scales too.

116
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,470
Beika Sushi.

117
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,770
Here it is.

118
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,870
There's more food coming?

119
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,170
Yes. Pizza, Chinese and doughnuts are on their way.

120
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,670
So eat up, will you!

121
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,070
While you're eating,

122
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,770
I'm going to take a bath and work over my plot.

123
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,370
Make sure you keep close guard

124
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,670
so I don't sneak out of this room

125
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,270
and get into trouble.

126
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,570
What a nice view!

127
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,270
It's like you can see that the earth's curvature!

128
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,270
This is the 30th floor after all.

129
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,670
Conan.

130
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,470
That's the bedroom.

131
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,370
It's messy, so don't go inside.

132
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,670
Is that so?

133
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,170
Well, if you want to look at the underwear that I've taken off left as is,

134
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,570
help yourself.

135
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,570
I think I'll pass.

136
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,570
Hey. Why don't we also get room service too?

137
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,670
Like the novelist a while ago!

138
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,270
That sounds good!

139
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,870
I was just about getting a little hungry too.

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,870
Then, just as promised,

141
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,370
I'll finish my manuscript in the order that you won.

142
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,670
So wait here!

143
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,270
Yes.

144
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,970
I heard that he was a bit weird.

145
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,470
But, he's way beyond that.

146
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,970
Well, he was going downhill for a while

147
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,370
but, he's picked up his past momentum recently.

148
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,070
That's thanks to the woman assistant he hired last year, right?

149
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,670
Yes.

150
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,270
Chiaki Minazuki!

151
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,570
It seems she's reserved a room right below Mr. Hiura's today too.

152
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,170
But, I haven't seen her around if she is.

153
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,670
I guess she's finding it hard to come because we're all here.

154
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,270
Since a scandalous article saying that she's his lover just came out too.

155
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,370
Come to think of it, our editing room got a blackmail fax,

156
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,470
saying that to pull that assistant apart from Mr. Hiura.

157
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,070
That came to our office too!

158
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,670
Well, he was a handsome novelist in the past.

159
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,570
His women fans are still alive and kicking, I guess.

160
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,170
Kyogoku's so cute.

161
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,270
He is, isn't he?

162
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,270
You don't sound like a master of Karate, at all.

163
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,970
-If he likes ramen so much... -Afternoon tea at a girls' gathering,

164
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,470
talking about love.

165
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,170
I feel kind of out of place here.

166
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,070
You don't you have any love stories, Conan?

167
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,170
A love story of a girl

168
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,870
that you've met somewhere before that you can't forget.

169
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,670
No. I don't.

170
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,270
Well... In his case,

171
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,070
I'll bet he's head over heels about Ayumi!

172
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,070
No way!

173
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,570
I thought it was Ai!

174
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,870
Oh, her?

175
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,170
Hey, which one do you like?

176
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,970
Which one?

177
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,570
I won't tell anybody so tell me, won't you?

178
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,970
I'd really like to know.

179
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,270
I'm telling you, it's you.

180
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,570
It's already 6 pm, isn't it?

181
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,370
Oh no! I've got to home and make dinner!

182
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,070
That brat got away.

183
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,570
See you later, then.

184
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,270
Thank you so much today

185
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,070
-Sure. -Hey, ma'am?

186
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,070
Ma'am, are you all right?

187
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,070
Ma'am!

188
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,670
The clear echoing of this voice.

189
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,070
It's coming from the floor below!

190
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,770
Oh, wait.

191
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,670
Wait up, I tell you.

192
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,962
Ma'am! Ma'am!

193
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,462
Are you all right, Ms. Minazuki?

194
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:18,962
Ms. Minazuki?

195
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:23,062
A ligature mark on her neck as if she were strangled by a rope like thing.

196
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:27,762
Defensive scratch marks made when she was strangled.

197
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,262
-Killed by strangulation! -Killed by strangulation!

198
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:32,462
Who are you two?

199
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,462
Her chin is starting to stiffen.

200
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,762
She's been dead about two to three hours.

201
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,362
Ms. Minazuki?

202
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,762
What happened?

203
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,362
What on earth happened?

204
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,162
Oh, Sir!

205
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:47,962
There you are!

206
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:51,262
You said you were going out just a bit to buy cigarettes and yet.

207
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:56,362
Ms. Minazuki was found lying on the ground in front of her room.

208
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,962
Minazuki, you mean your assistant?

209
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,562
She was killed.

210
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:05,262
Someone strangled her to death.

211
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:08,362
-What? -What? Impossible. Why?

212
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:12,062
Maybe it has something to do with that fax.

213
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,262
We got a fax this morning saying,

214
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:19,762
"If you don't make his assistant quit, you're going to pay for it".

215
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:22,262
Why didn't you tell me that?

216
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:26,062
You had all the time in the world to tell me, didn't you?

217
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:30,062
You mean, I was unaware of what was happening to her

218
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:33,862
and just writing my romance novel?

219
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,262
I see.

220
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,562
The killer is...

221
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:42,862
That guy.

222
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,962
Champagne?

223
00:12:55,962 --> 00:13:00,362
When you brought the champagne that he ordered,

224
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,462
you found this corpse, eh?

225
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:04,362
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:07,862
I brought it over because I was told to deliver it at 6 pm sharp.

227
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,162
The card key of the door was inserted through the door

228
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,762
and the door was slightly opened.

229
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,762
I opened the door wondering what was wrong.

230
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,162
Then, I found her lying on the ground.

231
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:18,562
What's the victim's identity?

232
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,362
Yes, sir. Her name is...

233
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,262
Chiaki Minazuki.

234
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,862
She was a very efficient assistant of mine.

235
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,962
I think she was going to turn 30 years old this year.

236
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,862
Who are you?

237
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:32,162
I am novelist, Keigo Hiura.

238
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:35,262
I'm the one who ordered that champagne too.

239
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:37,962
Oh, so you ordered the champagne?

240
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:39,362
Yes, sir.

241
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:43,962
I reserved a room right above here to do some writing.

242
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:46,762
Since I was scheduled to finish about 6 pm,

243
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:50,262
so I was planning to have a toast with her.

244
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,162
But, I had no idea that something like this was happening to her

245
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,562
during the time I was writing.

246
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:59,262
Which means you came here because you finished writing your manuscript?

247
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:02,762
No, I was having a tough time trying to finish the last page.

248
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:04,362
Just about 30 minutes ago,

249
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:06,562
I decided to get some air while getting cigarettes

250
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:09,362
and think about what to write at the same time.

251
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:13,462
After buying my cigarettes at the vending machine two floors down,

252
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,662
and as I was going up the stairs,

253
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:20,862
I heard the bellboy scream and rushed over.

254
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:25,862
Then all you were doing back then was walking around, right?

255
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:31,162
How did you know she was killed when you were writing your novel?

256
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,862
It could've been that she had just been killed, and yet.

257
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,962
It's true that when the body was found,

258
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,562
her chin had begun to stiffen.

259
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:45,462
I think that two to three hours had passed since she died.

260
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:49,562
You didn't even touch the corpse and yet you knew,

261
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:51,062
maybe you should shift

262
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:55,262
from being a love novel writer to a mystery writer?

263
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,862
How about it?

264
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,062
She didn't come to my room.

265
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:03,262
She was supposed to have brought materials over to my room

266
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:06,862
two to three hours ago,

267
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,262
but she didn't come.

268
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,862
When I saw her body,

269
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:16,762
I just automatically thought that she'd been killed.

270
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:21,562
And is it true that she'd been killed two to three hours ago?

271
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:22,662
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:24,162
According to the coroner,

273
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,662
the estimated time of death is two and a half hours

274
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:28,062
before the body was found.

275
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:31,862
She seems to have been strangled to death around 3:30 pm.

276
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,162
Isn't that just around the time

277
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,762
all of you were having lunch in my room?

278
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,262
Yes. We started around just after 3 pm.

279
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:40,662
You are?

280
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:42,062
I'm from Nichiuri Publishing Company,

281
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:45,762
and an editor that is in charge of Mr. Hiura.

282
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:49,462
Since Mr. Hiura seems to have ordered more food than he could eat,

283
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,462
I was in Mr. Hiura's room eating lunch

284
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:54,462
with two other editors from different companies.

285
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:57,862
Were you writing a total of three manuscripts?

286
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:58,862
Yes.

287
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:01,362
The deadlines for all of them turned out to be the same day.

288
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:04,462
So, I decided to finish my manuscript

289
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,762
based on the amount of food each editor ate.

290
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:09,862
Which means Mr. Hiura ate with all of you too?

291
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:13,162
No, he went to take a bath

292
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:15,862
while we were eating saying that he wanted to think up a plot.

293
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:17,162
That's right.

294
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:20,462
Then, maybe you could've snuck out of the room.

295
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,062
No way!

296
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:26,062
Several people brought deliveries after that too,

297
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:28,862
but from the table where we were eating at,

298
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,362
the front door was in clear view.

299
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:34,162
We paid for things in his place too.

300
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:38,462
I don't think that he went near the front door while we were eating.

301
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:41,362
Until about what time were you eating?

302
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,562
Until about 4:30 pm.

303
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:46,562
After eating and leaving Mr. Hiura's room,

304
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:48,462
we waited for him in front of the elevator

305
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:51,962
where the door of Mr. Hiura's room was in clear view.

306
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:54,062
But, the only time Mr. Hiura came out of his room was

307
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:57,762
when he came to give the editor in charge his completed manuscript.

308
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:00,562
As soon as he handed over the manuscript, he went right back.

309
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,362
I don't think he could've snuck out.

310
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:07,362
Which means you finished all your manuscript in short amount of time?

311
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:11,662
Yes. Because all of them were more or less completed already.

312
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,462
However, as I mentioned a while ago,

313
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:15,462
as for the third manuscript,

314
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:18,062
"Telephone, Sea and I" that he was in charge of,

315
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:20,362
I was stuck at the last scene.

316
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:25,362
I gave him all the pages except the last page at a little past 5:30 pm,

317
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:28,262
and went out to buy cigarettes.

318
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:31,562
I figured he could read them while he was waiting.

319
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,162
Right?

320
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,362
Yes.

321
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,162
He went to the stairs holding a wallet.

322
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:39,562
You didn't take the elevator?

323
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,762
Taking the stairs help inspire me.

324
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,762
Besides, it's good exercise.

325
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,262
And while I was reading Mr. Hiura's manuscript,

326
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:50,162
I heard the bellboy scream.

327
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:53,562
Mr. Hiura called to tell me that something seems to have happened

328
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,162
on the floor below.

329
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:56,362
When I got here,

330
00:17:56,362 --> 00:18:00,362
Mr. Hiura and the others were standing in front of the room.

331
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:01,662
I see.

332
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:06,162
Do you know of anyone who would've had something against Ms. Minazuki?

333
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:08,662
The blackmail fax!

334
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:12,062
I'm sure the culprit's the one who sent that!

335
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,962
Blackmail fax?

336
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:17,262
We received one at our editor's office this morning too.

337
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,662
It said, "If you don't make Assistant Minazuki quit,

338
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:21,662
you're going to pay for it".

339
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:24,162
We tried checking where it came from

340
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:27,762
but it seems to have been sent from a convenience store somewhere.

341
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:29,962
But, why would such a blackmail fax be sent?

342
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:34,162
It's because a picture of me walking with her was taken by a magazine

343
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:36,862
with the headline, "A Lover's Scandal".

344
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:40,562
Thanks to that, my wife went back to her parent's place.

345
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:43,962
Mr. Hiura's novels consist mainly of genuine or platonic love,

346
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:47,662
and his fans are mostly women readers who hate illicit affairs.

347
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:51,662
How intimate were you really with Ms. Minazuki?

348
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,862
We had nothing going on between us.

349
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:56,662
She was an efficient assistant

350
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,462
that had ideas flowing out like running water.

351
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,262
She earnestly helped me with the novel, "Telephone, Sea and I",

352
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,962
that it could be called her work,

353
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,262
instead of mine.

354
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,162
I was thinking of introducing her as a novelist next year

355
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:13,262
so she could stand on her own two feet, but how unfortunate.

356
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:17,162
How unfortunate. Why?

357
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:19,662
Why was she...

358
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:49,262
We, the police will take things from here now,

359
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:52,762
so Conan and Sera, you two can head home.

360
00:20:52,762 --> 00:20:57,462
Well, we may have to interrogate you later though.

361
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:58,862
Yes, sir.

362
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,562
Look at those spectators.

363
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,862
Since when did they crowd up like this?

364
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:23,362
Excuse me. Please let me through.

365
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,062
Where is she?

366
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:30,362
Where did she go?

367
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:37,862
Why are you scowling like that, Conan?

368
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,262
Didn't you see a girl?

369
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:42,562
A girl?

370
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,162
Sonoko, did you see a girl?

371
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,162
-I don't think so. -There is!

372
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:48,262
She was here in the crowd.

373
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:52,762
A girl who looked a lot like Sera. About Junior High School.

374
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:55,462
A Junior High School girl who looks like Sera?

375
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:59,162
But, she said that she has no sisters.

376
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:01,662
Maybe you saw someone else?

377
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,262
I didn't make a mistake!

378
00:22:06,262 --> 00:22:08,362
I'm sure I saw her.

379
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,962
The girl that was on her cell phone

380
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:14,162
that looked just like Sera.

381
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,862
Who on earth is that girl?

382
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,162
No joke?

383
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,962
The novelist Mr. Hiura is a murderer?

384
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,762
Really?

385
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:35,162
Yes. Most likely.

386
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:36,362
But...

387
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,862
If I remember correctly, didn't he have an alibi?

388
00:22:39,862 --> 00:22:42,062
Back then, he was in his room

389
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:44,462
and the editors were keeping an eye on him.

390
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:47,362
Yes. That's why in order to shatter it,

391
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,262
we need to think of a way to get into the victim's room

392
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:52,962
that is one floor down.

393
00:22:52,962 --> 00:22:55,762
After all, this is the 30th floor.

394
00:22:55,762 --> 00:23:00,162
It's too scary to use a rope and enter from the veranda.

395
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:01,162
If the editors were eating lunch

396
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,362
in the living room where the front door was in view,

397
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:07,362
the veranda would've been in clear view,

398
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:12,862
Right, Conan?

399
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,462
You think so, don't you, Conan?

400
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,662
Oh, yes.

401
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:25,362
Oh, no!

402
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,362
I forgot about making dinner!

403
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:29,062
I've got to call Dad!

404
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:32,262
I think Mr. Mouri's outraged by now.

405
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:35,562
Grudge over food is horrors, you know.

406
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:37,562
Hello, Dad?

407
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:39,762
I'm sorry!

408
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:44,762
I was over at Sera's place and an incident occurred, you see.

409
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:46,862
It's no lie!

410
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,962
The caps for the shampoo and hair conditioner are gone?

411
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,862
We only came through the front door, you know?

412
00:23:56,862 --> 00:24:00,162
Then, did you two knock the table down too?

413
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:03,662
There were many people who brought deliveries, right?

414
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:05,062
Yes.

415
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:07,462
How do you suppose I took the corpse

416
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:11,662
to the room below from this room?

417
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:15,262
Right, that's was his purpose!

418
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:16,862
Next Conan,

419
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:20,762
"The Romance Novel with the Unexpected Conclusion (Part 2)"

420
00:24:36,262 --> 00:24:38,462
Next Conan's Hint:

421
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:41,062
"Old postcard".

422
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,762
Does Sera bother you that much?

423
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,162
Not again, you precocious brat.

424
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:45,462
Wrong.
