1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,110
A man named Eiji Kadowaki was murdered.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,010
Eiji was a man with a bad reputation

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,010
who was often taken into police custody.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,110
He also allegedly abused his mother,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,410
while his older brother Yuichi Kadowaki protected her.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,610
He was suspected of killing his younger brother

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,110
to protect his mother from his repeated acts of violence,

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,810
but his alibi was verified, and Yuichi was released.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,210
Meanwhile, another suspect emerged.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,910
This is Takase.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,010
Rintaro Takase,

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,310
one of Yasuko's students from when she was a teacher.

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,810
Mrs. Yasuko Kadowaki?

14
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,810
Yeah, of course I remember her.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,210
I was a rowdy kid.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,710
She scolded me all the time.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,910
Honestly, I hated her.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,310
But that was 20 years ago.

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,310
What? He has an alibi?

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,510
-Yes, sir. -I see.

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,710
I told you so.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,210
I didn't do it.

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,910
Well, I'm leaving now.

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,610
Good luck with your job.

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,310
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,510
Megure here.

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,410
What? A fire at the Kadowaki family residence?

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,310
That night, there was a fire at the Kadowaki family residence,

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,710
and the mother Yasuko was killed.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,110
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,910
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,910
A complicated family situation and a former student and suspect.

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,910
With a fire layered on top of that, the truth is hard to see.

34
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,510
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,210
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,909
"The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 2)"

38
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,109
I told the cops who came yesterday about that customer.

39
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,809
He sat in that corner seat

40
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:11,609
for the three-hours all you can eat and drink.

41
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:15,509
You're sure it was from 8 pm to 11 pm?

42
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,709
Yeah. We even checked the security cameras.

43
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,909
Hey.

44
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:23,109
Which side was Takase sitting on?

45
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:27,209
I think it was that side.

46
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,409
What does it matter?

47
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,909
So his back was facing the other customers.

48
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,509
We should check the security cameras next, right?

49
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,209
Yeah. Can we?

50
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,209
Sure.

51
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:46,209
That's definitely Takase.

52
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,609
And the time is 8:01 pm.

53
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,109
Next let's check three hours later at 11 pm.

54
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,109
Yeah.

55
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,509
Hey, can't you make it go any faster?

56
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,709
Yeah, but...

57
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,109
What?

58
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,509
Oh, sorry. Wrong person.

59
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,909
Gosh.

60
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,209
Their builds looked similar.

61
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,909
Idiot.

62
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,409
He's wearing totally different clothes.

63
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,309
He's got glasses, too.

64
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,909
Look closely.

65
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,309
Okay.

66
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,409
What?

67
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,009
What now?

68
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:23,109
Look. He came back out in less than 10 minutes.

69
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:27,109
It seemed like he was meeting someone.

70
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,609
He checked inside the shop, but no one was there.

71
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,909
He said he'd come again and left immediately.

72
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,209
He came back about an hour and a half later,

73
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:38,209
but there was still no one there.

74
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:41,509
He said he got the date wrong and left.

75
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:45,009
What? Sounds like a real scatterbrain.

76
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:46,709
Right? Isn't it funny?

77
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:49,209
Come to think of it,

78
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,909
we got an even stranger customer the other day.

79
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,109
Look at this.

80
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,609
What? Did you find something?

81
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:56,609
Yeah.

82
00:05:56,609 --> 00:06:00,609
This is the second time that person came,

83
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,309
and this is when he left.

84
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:05,309
What about it?

85
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:09,309
I'll play it again. Watch his face.

86
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,109
This is when he came after 9 pm.

87
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,209
You can see his face, right?

88
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,109
And this is when he left.

89
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,609
He's facing downwards so you can't see it.

90
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:23,209
This is when he came back an hour and a half later.

91
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,109
You can't see his face clearly here either.

92
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:28,109
And this is the last time he left.

93
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,609
You can clearly see his face,

94
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:32,309
and he seems to have a satisfied smile.

95
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,509
Isn't it strange for him to be satisfied

96
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,809
if he got the day of his meet-up wrong?

97
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:41,909
When did he first leave and return?

98
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:47,909
He first left at 9:08 pm and came back at 10:35 pm.

99
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,209
9:08 pm to 10:35 pm.

100
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,309
That's about an hour and a half.

101
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,409
Hey.

102
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,509
From here to the crime scene...

103
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,709
It's about a 30 minutes walk.

104
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,309
So that's how it is.

105
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:04,809
"Three Hours 3,330 Yen All You Can Eat and Drink! Nebada Brewery"

106
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,609
Hello, inspector?

107
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:09,309
He had an accomplice.

108
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:13,609
Yes, the store's security cameras caught him.

109
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:14,809
Yes.

110
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,209
I'll tell the waiter to expect you.

111
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,409
Bye.

112
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,709
Now we just need evidence that Takase did it.

113
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,309
We don't need evidence.

114
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,909
If we tell him we've disproved his alibi,

115
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,309
he'll give it up.

116
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,709
"Safety First" -Later.

117
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,209
"Rintaro Takase (32), Construction Site Worker"

118
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:40,709
Is that...

119
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:46,109
What's he doing here?

120
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:50,309
Darn it.

121
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,609
The water taxi for Asakusa is departing.

122
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,009
Sucks for the great detective.

123
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,609
So you thought you got away.

124
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,309
The fact that you fled when you saw me proves it.

125
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:29,609
Rintaro Takase, you're the culprit.

126
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,809
I fled?

127
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:36,209
I just wanted to try riding the water taxi.

128
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:40,409
You only have 40 more minutes to crack jokes.

129
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,909
Then this boat will arrive in Asakusa.

130
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,809
Yes, inspector. Mouri here.

131
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:54,409
Yes. I'd like to turn over Eiji Kadowaki's murderer.

132
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:59,709
Could you come to the water taxi pier in Asakusa? Yes.

133
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,409
I'll tell you more then. Bye.

134
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,109
The alibi you've been relying on to prove your innocence

135
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,709
is easily constructed if you have,

136
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,509
for example, a friend to help you.

137
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,109
Bingo.

138
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:20,609
You used a person with a build similar to yours as a stand-in.

139
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,309
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer!

140
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,009
Ten cutlet skewers and a large beer.

141
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,309
Welcome.

142
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:31,109
I'm meeting a friend. Can I look inside?

143
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,109
Go right ahead.

144
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,709
You swapped places with your friend in the bathroom.

145
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,009
Spirit! Spirit!

146
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,709
Looks like he's not here. I'll be back.

147
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,209
Okay.

148
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,809
You left the store, and murdered Eiji.

149
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,309
Then you returned to the restaurant

150
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:00,509
and swapped places with your friend again,

151
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,309
creating your fake alibi.

152
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,909
Unfortunately, this is the end of the line for you.

153
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:16,309
Right. There's a fireworks show today.

154
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,609
Listen, Takase.

155
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,809
It would be best if you came clean

156
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,309
and turned yourself in.

157
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,109
Where's the proof?

158
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,509
Not good.

159
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:31,109
You were just saying how I could've killed him, too, weren't you?

160
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:34,509
What proof do you have that I did it?

161
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,909
Well...

162
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,709
I think I'll go have a beer downstairs,

163
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:45,509
until the great detective remembers what proof he has.

164
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,509
I told you we needed evidence.

165
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,109
Shut up. He's not getting away, darn it.

166
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:55,609
Gosh.

167
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,309
But now that we've started this,

168
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,409
we have to do whatever it takes to get him.

169
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:19,176
A man as kind-hearted as me could never kill a man.

170
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:22,676
You called yourself rowdy just yesterday.

171
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:23,876
Hey, Pops.

172
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:24,976
What?

173
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,176
Let's let him talk.

174
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,776
He might accidentally reveal something.

175
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,076
Darn it. I'm having a beer, too.

176
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:47,476
Hey.

177
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,976
Give yourself up and confess already.

178
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:58,076
But I didn't do it. I can't confess to anything.

179
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,576
In that case...

180
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:06,576
Who do you think killed Eiji Kadowaki, and why?

181
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,676
How should I know?

182
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:11,876
He probably got on someone's bad side.

183
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,976
I heard he was one hopeless dude.

184
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:21,276
Really? So Eiji wasn't a very good person.

185
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:27,776
But since the good brother was around, Mrs. Kadowaki...

186
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,076
I'm going to use the bathroom.

187
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:35,376
So he knew.

188
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,676
But if that's true, isn't it strange?

189
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,976
What's strange?

190
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,576
If he wanted to get back at Yasuko Kadowaki,

191
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:47,876
he would've killed Yuichi instead of Eiji.

192
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,076
Hey, mister.

193
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,376
It's you, kid.

194
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,076
Don't scare me like that.

195
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:20,076
Were you really that rowdy when you were a kid?

196
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:24,276
Yeah, I guess. Bad enough that my parents abandoned me.

197
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,376
It must've been hard.

198
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:31,076
Abandoned at home, yelled at by teachers at school.

199
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:35,876
You get in trouble at school, too?

200
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:40,676
What? Yeah. Sometimes.

201
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:45,276
Someday you'll understand what a blessing it is.

202
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:54,176
I see. So that's how it is.

203
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:01,576
But why now?

204
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,376
Why after running into her for the first time in 20 years?

205
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:14,876
Drink up.

206
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,076
Thanks.

207
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:20,476
Once you finish that, confess.

208
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,976
You never give up.

209
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:24,676
I can't confess to something I didn't do.

210
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:26,276
Come on!

211
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:28,076
Hey.

212
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,976
You said you ran into Mrs. Kadowaki.

213
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:33,376
Where was that?

214
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:37,376
She was there when I went to the orthopedist for my chronic back pain.

215
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:42,376
She was at the hospital, too.

216
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,176
Full body contusions?

217
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:48,276
That's right. I accidentally missed a step on the stairs last night

218
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,876
"Yasuko Kadowaki (63)" -and rolled all the way down.

219
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,776
Accidentally?

220
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:55,876
I laughed, too.

221
00:14:55,876 --> 00:15:00,176
I couldn't believe that happened to that careful teacher.

222
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:01,676
That's it.

223
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:08,176
I think it was last Saturday.

224
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,976
She must've lied on the spot.

225
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,676
She couldn't tell her former student

226
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:17,976
that her son was abusing her.

227
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:21,176
So that's how it is.

228
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:23,376
Which means the fire...

229
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:33,676
What? This bridge...

230
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:36,676
We just passed Ryogoku Bridge.

231
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:39,676
The fireworks show grounds are approaching,

232
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,976
-so we'll be lowering the lights within the boat. -Darn.

233
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:44,976
-Asakusa is getting closer. -Please enjoy the sights from the windows.

234
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:49,676
A fireworks show? What fun.

235
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,976
Darn it.

236
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:52,576
Let's go upstairs to watch the fireworks.

237
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,276
Good idea.

238
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:55,476
We should go upstairs, too.

239
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,876
Yeah, let's.

240
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:58,476
I'm so excited.

241
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:03,376
Darn it!

242
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,376
I told the inspector to come.

243
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,476
There's no turning back now.

244
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,276
Too bad, detective.

245
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:18,076
Gosh. Who's calling? I'm busy.

246
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,476
"Incoming Call, Inspector Megure" -Inspector Megure?

247
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:23,676
Oh, no! What do I do...

248
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:28,376
Yes, hello! Mouri here!

249
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:31,476
Yes. No, of course not.

250
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:35,076
In just a few more minutes...

251
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,076
Yes.

252
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:40,276
What? What do you mean?

253
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:48,176
Darn. That just leaves this.

254
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:49,476
Takase!

255
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,676
What? Did you find the evidence?

256
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,076
I don't have any.

257
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,776
I'll force it out of you if I have to.

258
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,076
What's gotten into you?

259
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:06,376
Hey, are you okay?

260
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:08,676
Takase.

261
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:14,276
You probably thought you were returning the favor

262
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:17,376
when you killed Eiji Kadowaki.

263
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:20,176
When even your own parents had abandoned you,

264
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:25,176
Yasuko Kadowaki was the only one who paid you any attention.

265
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:29,176
You felt indebted to her because of that.

266
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,076
Don't be ridiculous!

267
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,676
Who would feel indebted to that woman?

268
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,276
All I had for her was hatred!

269
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:40,576
When you saw her again at the hospital,

270
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:44,476
you couldn't believe that careful woman

271
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:47,176
could have done that.

272
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:50,476
And when you began investigating the Kadowaki family,

273
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,876
you heard a certain rumor.

274
00:17:54,476 --> 00:18:00,076
Yasuko was being abused by her younger son Eiji daily,

275
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:04,676
and her older son Yuichi was trying to protect her.

276
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,876
You had an idea.

277
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:12,076
Fortunately, Yuichi had protected Yasuko

278
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:14,876
from Eiji's violence until now.

279
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:19,076
However, there was no guarantee

280
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:21,176
Yuichi would always be there in the future.

281
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:24,976
At this rate, Eiji might eventually kill her.

282
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,276
Believing that, you...

283
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,176
I told you, I didn't do it!

284
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:36,176
When you think of it that way, it explains what you said.

285
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:41,776
So that was your destiny.

286
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:45,276
You thought you'd saved her from her son's violence,

287
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:49,776
but in the end, she was destined to die.

288
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:52,376
Isn't that what you meant?

289
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,076
You're making all of this up!

290
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,876
If you're so determined to pin this on me,

291
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,176
bring me the evidence!

292
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:00,476
Takase.

293
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:06,276
You shouldn't assume rumors are true.

294
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,476
What?

295
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:12,076
You ran into Mrs. Kadowaki at the hospital last Saturday.

296
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:16,876
In other words, Yasuko Kadowaki was injured the day before,

297
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:20,476
on Friday night.

298
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:25,876
But that Friday night, Eiji wasn't at home.

299
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:29,076
Last Friday, he got drunk

300
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:32,376
and argued with a bar employee.

301
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:36,176
He spent the night in jail.

302
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,376
But since Yasuko was injured regardless,

303
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,676
there's only one explanation.

304
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:48,676
It was the older brother Yuichi

305
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:51,176
who was abusing his mother Yasuko daily,

306
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:55,176
and it was the younger brother Eiji who was protecting her.

307
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:58,476
You can't expect me to believe that!

308
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:03,276
And without Eiji to put the brakes on the situation,

309
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:06,576
the worst possible outcome occurred.

310
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:12,676
Yasuko's murder at Yuichi's hands.

311
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:18,676
Perhaps he did it for revenge.

312
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,676
I'll never forget the humiliation I suffered

313
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:25,776
while being treated like a murder suspect.

314
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:29,776
Yuichi couldn't let go of his rage.

315
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:32,176
Isn't he the one who did it?

316
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,376
Your former student?

317
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:36,276
There's no way.

318
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,076
Even the police said they weren't sure yet.

319
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,376
I don't care about the police!

320
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,576
I'm asking you!

321
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,976
Maybe you didn't teach him well enough!

322
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:51,776
Because of him, I suffered that humiliation!

323
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:53,176
Darn it!

324
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:02,176
After killing his mother,

325
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:08,576
Yuichi set the house on fire to destroy the evidence.

326
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:13,276
No. That's just your fantasy!

327
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:15,076
What evidence is there of that?

328
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:17,676
I just got a call.

329
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,476
When asked about the unnatural way the fire started

330
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:23,076
during his deposition,

331
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:25,776
Yuichi Kadowaki admitted to it.

332
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,176
He killed his mother

333
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:32,876
and started the fire to hide the evidence.

334
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:43,276
No... Then what I did was...

335
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:46,976
No... No...

336
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:24,076
Later, Rintaro Takase confessed to Eiji Kadowaki's murder.

337
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:26,776
He was taken away by the police officers and Inspector Megure

338
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:28,776
waiting at Asakusa.

339
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:35,676
The final water taxi from Asakusa to Hinode Pier

340
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:37,776
is departing.

341
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:38,776
What?

342
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,676
What? What?

343
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:46,876
Hey! Hey, wait!

344
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:49,376
Pops!

345
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:53,676
What? Fireworks! What?

346
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:59,376
"Next Episode" - Ran, Conan!

347
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,176
-Ms. Anna! -Ms. Anna!

348
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:07,376
Right. Ms. Anna is always with her poodle, Sally.

349
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,576
Next Conan,

350
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:24,376
"The Poodle and the Shotgun (Part 1)"

351
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:27,119
Next Conan's Hint:
