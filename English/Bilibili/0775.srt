1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,940
Let's determine a name for you then.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,040
How about Mr. Moustache?

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,740
Moustache?

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,040
What should I call you?

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,440
Boss, maybe?

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,740
The others call me Mr. Head.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,240
Head... Brains, eh.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,040
And so, did I successfully pass the entrance exam, Mr. Head?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,940
We're counting on your skills.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,840
Give it your all, Mr. Moustache.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,740
Hello?

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,840
Yes.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,940
I've succeeded infiltration!

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,540
Now, the band of robbers will surely be wiped out

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,040
by the hands of I, the great Detective Kogoro Mouri...

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,640
Hello? Hello?

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Mr. Mouri? What's up?

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,840
What happened?

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,940
Hello?

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,340
Too bad, great detective.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,540
Hello?

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,140
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,940
Pops Kogoro is not his usual self.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,840
Dangerous purpose of undercover investigation.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,740
His name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,669
"The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 1)"

30
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,669
Awake?

31
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,369
She's a cute daughter, isn't she?

32
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,869
Ran!

33
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:42,569
Why you... What're you up to?

34
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,669
It's up to you.

35
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,969
Darn it! What do you want?

36
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,869
Just as expected of a great detective,

37
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,569
getting right to the point.

38
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,469
Hurry spit it out!

39
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,869
You deliberately disguised yourself

40
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:56,069
and almost succeeded your mission.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,469
So, just as scheduled,

42
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:02,169
work along with my men as a skilled safe breaker.

43
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,469
What?

44
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,469
The fact is...

45
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:09,369
Among my men, there's the one who killed my son.

46
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:15,069
I'd like you to determine who it is with your skills as a great detective

47
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,969
by dawn of the day after tomorrow.

48
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,469
What?

49
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,569
Dawn day after tomorrow is also the time,

50
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,669
when we carry out our plan this time and leave Japan behind us.

51
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,069
That's why I need you to do so by then.

52
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,369
What, after specifying who it is?

53
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,669
Are you planning to avenge the death of your son?

54
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,969
That's none of your business.

55
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,469
But, if you refuse my request...

56
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:44,269
You'll never see your daughter again.

57
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:49,369
If the killer isn't instructed to cancel before the time limited by me,

58
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:53,769
he will kill her.

59
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,569
Don't tell me you had this in mind to begin with!

60
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,969
Darn it!

61
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:01,469
But I believe in...

62
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,869
Kogoro Mouri, your skills as a great detective.

63
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:08,169
Huh?

64
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,569
What shall I do, Conan?

65
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,569
Dad's still not home.

66
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,769
I can't get through to his cell phone either.

67
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,569
It's been one whole day since yesterday!

68
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,769
Calm down, Ran.

69
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:24,369
He said that he had work to do, right?

70
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:27,269
Yep. That he was going to meet a client.

71
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,169
Didn't you get a name or an address of where he went?

72
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,269
Well... I didn't ask him for neither...

73
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,269
Rather, now that I think of it,

74
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,469
he didn't seem to be his usual self.

75
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,569
Bye, Dad.

76
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,769
You're eating at home, aren't you?

77
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,969
I can't tell for now.

78
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:50,969
Geez, I know you like to drink after work, but...

79
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:53,969
But I'll promise to come home.

80
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,469
I promise you, I'll come back home so don't worry.

81
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:58,669
Bye.

82
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:01,769
Dad.

83
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,269
You asked Inspector Megure already, too, right?

84
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,069
Yep, just a while ago.

85
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,569
I haven't been able to get a hold of Dad since yesterday.

86
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,669
I see.

87
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,069
Have you heard anything from him?

88
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,169
No, not really.

89
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,969
If you're worried, we can try looking for him on our side, too.

90
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,669
Don't worry, he'll be back.

91
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,369
Goodbye, then.

92
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:30,569
Inspector!

93
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:35,369
Come to think of it, Inspector Megure wasn't quite himself either.

94
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,369
Something's fishy.

95
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:41,769
I don't know what it is, but something's going on.

96
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,469
Maybe...

97
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:51,869
April 25th, 10:00,

98
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,169
Hotel Mole Cafe Terrace.

99
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,769
Hey, sir.

100
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,269
I had a quick glance yesterday,

101
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:06,869
but the great detective Mouri was here yesterday, wasn't he?

102
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,569
Yeah, he was.

103
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,269
Was he meeting someone here?

104
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,469
Who are you?

105
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,569
Well, I actually wanted to ask him

106
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,269
to investigate a great case, you see.

107
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,569
So, I thought that if he was staying over here.

108
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,669
A great case?

109
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,869
I'm sorry, but it's not that he's staying here.

110
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,669
He was sitting in that seat yesterday.

111
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:31,269
Sir, you have a phone call.

112
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,969
Thank you.

113
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,169
Hello?

114
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,369
Huh? Don't use a cab right away?

115
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,069
Just what do you mean?

116
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,369
I see. Got it.

117
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,269
Hey, where's the closest subway station?

118
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,269
Maybe Pops was trying to lose somebody that was trailing him.

119
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,869
Rather, maybe somebody was making him?

120
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,869
Darn it!

121
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:03,469
If I don't know what train he took, I've got no lead.

122
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:06,469
The taxi stand is...

123
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,869
Over here?

124
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:11,769
No, there's one by the exit on the opposite side, too.

125
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,069
Don't use a cab right away?

126
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,869
"Right away."

127
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,769
I see! That's what it meant!

128
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,669
"Taxi Stand"

129
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,069
Yeah, you mean the great detective Kogoro Mouri, right?

130
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,669
-He got on yesterday. -Really?

131
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,169
Then, will you take me to the place where Detective Mouri got off?

132
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,469
Yeah, no problem.

133
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:42,369
A place like this?

134
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,769
Pop's cell phone?

135
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,969
Darn it, no good. The data's all gone.

136
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,369
These shoes prints...

137
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,069
"Mr. Mouth (28)" -Just what do you think you're doing, you jerk?

138
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:44,769
"Mr. Nose (35), member of a band of robbers"

139
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,769
Wait!

140
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,669
Put it down! Quick, put it down, Nose!

141
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,669
Cut out the noise.

142
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,569
"Mr. Eyes (40)" -We're just starting work.

143
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,069
Enough already!

144
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,669
Yeah.

145
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:11,769
Ms. Lip is as thorny as always.

146
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,069
"Ms. Lip (33)" -Your crew is as dinky as always.

147
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:17,969
Just to think I'm going to be together with them...

148
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:20,169
Watch your mouth!

149
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,769
Wanna crush her once?

150
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,069
Go ahead and try if you can!

151
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,069
It's instructions from Mr. Head.

152
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:33,069
Another member will be working with us this time.

153
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,269
Glad to join you. I'm Mr. Moustache.

154
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:45,169
Pops was definitely here.

155
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,069
It doesn't match the room. It's new.

156
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,769
What were they projecting?

157
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,269
Smells burnt.

158
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,769
This is...

159
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,569
A map and a blueprint of the sewer?

160
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,269
Sorry, but can you stop by at the convenience store?

161
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,969
You're so nervous that you gotta go to the john or what, mister?

162
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,569
I want to buy something. I want gum.

163
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,169
Gum?

164
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,369
Without it, my senses go dull when I open the safe.

165
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:36,369
I've got to somehow get away from them and make contact outside.

166
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,569
Huh?

167
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:41,069
We don't need to stop now, do we?

168
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:42,869
Yeah.

169
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,869
Darn it.

170
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,469
I did it!

171
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:22,969
Oh, no!

172
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:32,269
Freeze!

173
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,369
If you move, I'll shoot!

174
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,669
I'll crush you, get that!

175
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,869
Stay there and don't move!

176
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:43,269
I'll tell you once more. Move and you're dead!

177
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:04,828
Freeze!

178
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,628
If you move, I'll shoot!

179
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,128
I'll crush you, get that!

180
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:12,228
Stay there and don't move!

181
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:15,928
I'll tell you once more. Move and you're dead!

182
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:22,428
If you wanna live, out with your wallets!

183
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,028
I'll crush you, get that!

184
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:28,528
Line up! Come on!

185
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:31,128
They're armed with guns and knives.

186
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,728
When did they...

187
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,528
I wonder where they came in from.

188
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,528
Takagi. Sato.

189
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,328
Things have changed.

190
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,928
Please don't make any false moves, please.

191
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:47,428
Showtime, Mr. Moustache.

192
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,828
The customers' wallets are worth only so much.

193
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,328
This way.

194
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:57,328
I've heard that there's no safe you can't break.

195
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:58,928
We're counting on you.

196
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:02,328
Yeah, you can count on me.

197
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:05,528
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

198
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:08,728
Where's?

199
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,428
Oh, well, this is a first for me, you see.

200
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:15,528
-Not that, where's the gum? -Huh?

201
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:18,328
Who are you?

202
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,928
Let me go! I'll crush you!

203
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:27,428
Darn it!

204
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,928
Cut it out!

205
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,228
Inspector! Please hurry!

206
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,328
Okay! We're going in!

207
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,728
We're going in!

208
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,128
-We're going in! -Go!

209
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:41,628
Cut it out!

210
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,028
Just what do you think you're doing?

211
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,728
Mr. Mouri?

212
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,128
Mouri?

213
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,428
You mean, Mouri, that great detective?

214
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:01,628
-Huh? -Right! That face!

215
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:04,228
The detective's a member of the band of robbers?

216
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:06,828
No! I've got my reasons, you see!

217
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:09,128
Darn it! So that's the story!

218
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:15,328
Police! All of you, freeze!

219
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,428
Please wait, Inspector!

220
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,228
Good work, Mr. Mouri!

221
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,828
-Uh... -Fighting back?

222
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,728
Gosh, you're not getting your way!

223
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,028
-What? -I'll crush you!

224
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,628
No! Don't shoot!

225
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,828
Get down! Get down!

226
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,128
Somebody, stop me!

227
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:50,028
Now! Nab them all!

228
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:58,028
Don't let the band of robbers get away!

229
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,628
It's okay already, Mr. Mouri.

230
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:09,128
The infiltration project is over!

231
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,428
"Several days ago" -Infiltration?

232
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,828
You're going to infiltrate that band of robbers?

233
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:18,528
Yeah. As you can see, with a little disguise,

234
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:23,628
I look just like the safebreaker that you guys arrested.

235
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,528
I'm going to sell myself to them, get hired,

236
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,928
and get a hold of concrete evidence of their crimes.

237
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:30,528
It's a chance of a lifetime.

238
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,228
It's true that if we succeed,

239
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:36,728
we could make a wholesale arrest of the band of robbers

240
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:39,428
that we've been pursuing for several years now.

241
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,828
But, what if they find out who you are?

242
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,228
To make sure that doesn't happen,

243
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:44,928
Officer Takagi and you, Officer Sato

244
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:47,728
are sneaking into the casino as customers.

245
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,228
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

246
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:51,728
And, one more thing.

247
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,728
Please don't tell Ran about this case.

248
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:59,928
I don't want to worry her if at possible, you see.

249
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:02,128
Got you.

250
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:05,628
But, why is Mr. Mouri doing something so far out as that?

251
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:10,728
I guess he's just an ex-cop at heart.

252
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:20,428
Darn it! By the time I noticed, I was attacking.

253
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:23,328
If things go wrong, I may lose my job as a detective!

254
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,828
Inspector! There's no one on this side!

255
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,228
Gosh! Where'd they disappear to?

256
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:34,628
There are no other exits, and yet...

257
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,728
A ventilation hole?

258
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,028
A rope ladder!

259
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,328
They probably made it inside from here, too.

260
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:53,528
I see! That blueprint of the sewer.

261
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,528
You're not getting away!

262
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,428
Over there? After them!

263
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:01,428
Yes, sir!

264
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,728
Chiba, get the blueprint for the sewer!

265
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,428
We'll beat them to the exit!

266
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,928
Yes, sir!

267
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,028
We won't let you get away!

268
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:12,428
I wonder why Mr. Mouri acted the way he did?

269
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:15,528
The strategy's not over yet!

270
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,228
Not until I make sure that Ran is safe first.

271
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:21,628
I'm sorry, Inspector!

272
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:31,828
That blueprint was an escape route after all.

273
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:34,028
Okay! If so...

274
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,928
I'm beating them to it!

275
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:17,628
No doubt about it, she's one of them, too.

276
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:20,028
She's probably the driver for the escape car.

277
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:30,228
What a safebreaker.

278
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,828
Hey, hey. Are we taking him with us?

279
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:35,228
It's faster to crush him!

280
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:37,128
Don't.

281
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:40,028
Mr. Head's the one who added him on as a member.

282
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:42,728
We need to hear him out.

283
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,228
Hurry!

284
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:51,628
They're coming for us from up ahead!

285
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:53,128
Hurry, get on!

286
00:20:57,728 --> 00:21:00,628
Emergency alert, all stations!

287
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:01,628
Yes, sir.

288
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:10,628
We did it!

289
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:12,528
We shook the cops off!

290
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,128
That's Ms. Lip.

291
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:15,928
Head on as scheduled, will you?

292
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,928
But, before that...

293
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,428
What's up, Lip?

294
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:28,028
My steering wheels heavy.

295
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,128
Like there's some unwanted mouse in the trunk or something.

296
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,228
What the?

297
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,928
What, what?

298
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,128
Darn it!

299
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:38,628
What's up?

300
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:44,628
I'm opening it.

301
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,228
Okay.

302
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,428
"The Mouri Detective Agency"

303
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:00,828
Mouri Detective Agency.

304
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:03,028
Inspector Megure!

305
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:04,428
Huh?

306
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:06,528
Dad and Conan are?

307
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,828
I'm sorry, Ran. It wasn't supposed to turn out this way.

308
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,128
At any rate, all the stations are out looking for them now.

309
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,828
"Next Episode" -The truth of 1 year ago.

310
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:57,028
In other words, I decided to have the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri

311
00:23:57,028 --> 00:24:00,528
to figure out who killed my son.

312
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:05,628
There's no such person on the casino side.

313
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:07,528
Then, are you saying that

314
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,228
either Mr. Mouse or I am the one who did it?

315
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:13,128
Darn it!

316
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,328
Don't get on, Ran!

317
00:24:16,228 --> 00:24:21,328
Next Conan, "The Great Detective is Manipulated (Part 2)"

318
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:39,028
Next Conan's Hint:

319
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:41,428
"Black out"

320
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:44,528
Dad and Conan could actually be watching Sunflower at the theater.

321
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,528
-It'll be years before we can do. -Something so sunny.
