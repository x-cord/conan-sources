1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.360
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.890
I'm so glad to have met you!

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.190
What might today's wine taste like?

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.860
Don't judge something by its name!

5
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.320
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.650
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.780
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.369
"The Farewell Wine Murder Case"

9
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:43.139
I don't get it.

10
00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.049
Why were we invited, too?

11
00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.129
How should I know?

12
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:48.129
You don't really care?

13
00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.629
Of course not!

14
00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:54.859
Ichikawa Kotaro may be president
of Ichikawa Industries now,

15
00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.239
Ichikawa Industries

16
00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:57.819
but he's also a deceitful jerk.
Ichikawa Industries

17
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.529
I doubt he has honest work for me.

18
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:01.949
Then why don't you say no?

19
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.659
Grownups have grownup
circumstances to take care of!

20
00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.759
Yeah, that's true.

21
00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.119
He hasn't had any work
at all for a long time now.

22
00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.049
Mori-sama, yes?

23
00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.719
Yes.

24
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.669
We've been expecting you.

25
00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:24.959
Please come in.

26
00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.639
Is there a party going on?

27
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:36.609
The president has a family
meeting every year on his birthday.

28
00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.569
Mori-sama is here to see you.

29
00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.299
Enter.

30
00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.449
This is Ichikawa,
the head of the house.

31
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.169
Thank you for coming.

32
00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.379
Just so you know, I haven't
decided to help you just yet.

33
00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.379
Imamura.

34
00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.839
Imamura Toshiaki (55)
Ichikawa family butler

35
00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:05.629
100,000 yen?!

36
00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.889
You must take the great
Mori Kogoro for a cheap joke!

37
00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.479
Wait, mister.

38
00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:14.959
What?

39
00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.549
It isn't 100,000 yen.

40
00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.049
See?

41
00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.819
One, ten, hundred, thousand,
ten thousand, hundred thousand--

42
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.989
A-A million yen?!

43
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.169
Ichikawa Kotaro President of Ichikawa Industries
I've prepared another million yen

44
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.909
for you if your job is successful.
Ichikawa Kotaro President of Ichikawa Industries

45
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.369
So, how can I help you?

46
00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.079
Geez...

47
00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.169
My two daughters will be in
attendance at today's family meeting.

48
00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:47.049
I want you to watch what
they do and what they try to do.

49
00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.509
Huh?

50
00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.509
Umm, should I leave?

51
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.979
No, it's fine. You can
explain my condition to them.

52
00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:55.949
Right.

53
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.049
Okano Hitoshi (30) Kotaro's physician
If he continues to push himself,

54
00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.439
there's no guarantee he'll live.
Okano Hitoshi (30) Kotaro's physician

55
00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.909
So I'm thinking of retiring now,
but I need to decide on a successor.

56
00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.829
It'd be one of your daughters, right?

57
00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.089
Not necessarily.

58
00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.629
I have no intention of sharing
my fortune with uncouth vultures,

59
00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.539
which may include my children.

60
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.959
Even so, inheritances are
subject to legally-secured portions.

61
00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:27.009
Your children would still get
a percent of it, no matter what.

62
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.639
But not if there's an
issue with who it's going to.

63
00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.389
Issue?

64
00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.649
Something's going to happen.
Something. I can feel it.

65
00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:43.589
Something?

66
00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:47.459
I've told everyone you're a friend,
and that you're with your family.

67
00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:50.389
Be careful not to be
found out as you do your work.

68
00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:52.619
Right...

69
00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:55.539
So Ran and I are camouflage?

70
00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:59.499
Still, what a horrible guy this is.

71
00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:10.679
Cheers!

72
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.139
Mori-sama. Over there is
Kazue-san, the eldest daughter.

73
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.339
She currently manages an art gallery.

74
00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.049
Imamura. Who might this be?

75
00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:28.169
Yes, this is Mori-sama,
a friend of your father's.

76
00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.409
How do you do?

77
00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:30.349
Oh, Father's friend?

78
00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.799
Imamura Kazue (30) Eldest daughter
Oh, Father's friend?

79
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:36.159
Isn't it a bother, being forced
to attend a gathering like this?
Imamura Kazue (30) Eldest daughter

80
00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.169
No, not at all!
I came with my family...

81
00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.799
...and we're having a great time!

82
00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:43.589
Oh, Sister!

83
00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:46.549
I didn't think you'd actually come.

84
00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:49.799
Of course I would attend.

85
00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.509
I'm the next in line
in the Ichikawa family.

86
00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:53.109
I wonder. I somehow doubt

87
00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:54.509
Ichikawa Mizue (27) Second daughter
I wonder. I somehow doubt

88
00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.169
Father would give everything to you.
Ichikawa Mizue (27) Second daughter

89
00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:57.189
You did act selfishly and leave
home after you argued with him.
Ichikawa Mizue (27) Second daughter

90
00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.519
You did act selfishly and leave
home after you argued with him.

91
00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.799
Who're you to talk?

92
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:08.489
You got married right away because
you were sick of seeing his face!

93
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:13.299
That reminds me, I hear
your art gallery is being sued

94
00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:16.299
for selling forgeries
or something like that!

95
00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:17.459
What?!

96
00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.119
One is as bad as the other...

97
00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.019
"Both daughters have
terrible personalities."

98
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.169
"Cave (a wine storeroom)"

99
00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:48.339
It's Kazue-san!

100
00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.539
A syringe! What is
she planning to do?!

101
00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.039
What's in it?!

102
00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:08.129
Oh no!

103
00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:10.209
Chloroform...

104
00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:17.549
Where could Conan-kun
have gone off to?

105
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:24.979
I thank you for gathering
here on my birthday.

106
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.689
I intend to give up my position
as company president very soon.

107
00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:30.649
In other words, I'm retiring.

108
00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:38.419
Therefore, I've decided to sell
all my stock and ownership rights

109
00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.799
to Nichiuri Industries.

110
00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:41.949
What?!

111
00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:42.619
Come again?!

112
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.749
S-Sir! What happens to us, then?!

113
00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:50.129
If you want to stay with the company,

114
00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.339
you'll need to prove your
worth to the new administration.

115
00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.049
Y-You can't be serious!

116
00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:58.299
What'll you do with the money
you make from selling the company?!

117
00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:01.459
How I use it is up to me.

118
00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:04.669
I have no intention of
giving any of you a single yen.

119
00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.439
Not even my daughters.

120
00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.189
Eh?!

121
00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.299
Damn, I let my guard down!
I gotta hurry!

122
00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:20.209
It was probably poison
she put in the wine!

123
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.299
How does she plan to use it?!

124
00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:27.579
I won't object to your decision, Father.

125
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:29.259
Nor will I.

126
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:35.049
I brought out a '57 wine to celebrate
this new chapter in your life!

127
00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:39.639
It's worth even more for
a wine aficionado like yourself.

128
00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:45.389
I'd feel bad for the wine if regular
know-nothings like us drank it.

129
00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:48.019
Here you are.

130
00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.629
Oh, she's more
considerate than I thought!

131
00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:55.299
Hey, I haven't seen
Conan-kun for a while.

132
00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:56.199
Huh?

133
00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:02.129
Ouch!

134
00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.039
What was that?

135
00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:06.289
Perfect!

136
00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:13.169
Success!

137
00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:16.169
But ouch!

138
00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:30.659
Ran-neechan!

139
00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:31.799
Oh, Conan-kun!

140
00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.129
What happened to Ichikawa-san?!

141
00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:34.689
He suddenly collapsed!

142
00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:41.009
President!

143
00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:45.829
Well?!

144
00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:54.299
Sir!
Father!

145
00:09:55.249 --> 00:09:56.879
Call the police!

146
00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:57.799
Huh?!

147
00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:01.839
This is an unnatural death for now.
A police examiner is needed.

148
00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.479
A glass?

149
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:17.049
So, he collapsed immediately
after drinking the wine?

150
00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:17.819
Yes.

151
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:20.279
He was murdered!

152
00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:25.129
He did have a weak heart,
but one drink wouldn't have killed him!

153
00:10:25.129 --> 00:10:27.199
There was poison in the wine!

154
00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:31.169
Come again?! Are you
suggesting I poisoned it?!

155
00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:33.479
That's the only possibility!

156
00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:34.629
You're horrible!

157
00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.709
Do you have a basis for your claim?

158
00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:40.379
Dr. Okano knows
about our father's condition!

159
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:44.419
It's true that he had a weak heart,

160
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:46.849
but something so soon
and sudden is out of the question.

161
00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:48.339
See!

162
00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:50.009
Are you still saying it was me?!

163
00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:55.259
Now, now! I'm sorry to ask,
but may we inspect your belongings?

164
00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:08.009
Dr. Okano. Can you
tell what's in this vial?

165
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.999
It seems to be a muscle relaxant.

166
00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:16.419
What would happen if
this was given to Mr. Ichikawa?

167
00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:19.919
It's very dangerous
even for healthy individuals.

168
00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:23.009
Given that he had
a serious heart illness...

169
00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:30.309
There's no question she was
the one who poisoned the wine.

170
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:34.549
But just who attacked me?!

171
00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:48.617
Do you have any idea
as to Kazue-san's motive?

172
00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:52.367
Her art gallery
was in quite a lot of debt.

173
00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:54.487
Maybe she was after the inheritance?

174
00:11:54.807 --> 00:11:59.447
He declared he wouldn't even
leave his own daughters a single yen.

175
00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:01.157
How dumb.

176
00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:04.487
We'd still get our legally-secured portions,
no matter what he said.

177
00:12:04.487 --> 00:12:07.367
Even if he said nothing,
we'd still get a percentage of it.

178
00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:10.327
Did the younger sister attack me?!

179
00:12:10.907 --> 00:12:12.577
If she knew about her sister's plan

180
00:12:12.577 --> 00:12:15.647
and locked me up to
keep me from getting in her way...

181
00:12:19.277 --> 00:12:21.527
If the older sister was found guilty,

182
00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:24.057
the huge inheritance would be all hers!

183
00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:30.877
A single key not on his keychain?

184
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:34.197
Hey! Hey, hey!

185
00:12:34.197 --> 00:12:36.197
What does this key go to?

186
00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:39.317
Oh, I think it might
be the basement key.

187
00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:43.407
How odd. He almost
never went into the basement...

188
00:12:46.697 --> 00:12:48.027
Wait!

189
00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:51.777
Was it the victim, Ichikawa-san,
who threw me into the basement?!

190
00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:58.657
If so, that means he knew the wine
was poisoned when he drank it!

191
00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:00.197
That can't be!

192
00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.817
A video camera lens!

193
00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:19.567
The cord goes into the ceiling!

194
00:13:35.527 --> 00:13:38.777
Was this to record
the person who killed him?!

195
00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:09.157
This smell... Ichikawa-san
didn't drink the wine after all!

196
00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:14.747
He knew the eldest daughter,
Kazue-san, had tampered with the wine,

197
00:14:14.747 --> 00:14:17.207
so he dumped it into this flowerpot!

198
00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:21.027
Then he pretended
to drink it and writhe in pain...

199
00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.137
...to see how both daughters reacted!

200
00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:29.367
But there's no doubt
that he really was poisoned.

201
00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:32.577
I don't get it!
How did he ingest the poison?!

202
00:14:35.277 --> 00:14:37.327
Damn kid, scampering
around everywhere...

203
00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:47.527
Maybe they gave him poison
in a capsule or something, not wine?

204
00:14:48.277 --> 00:14:51.737
No, the time doesn't add up.

205
00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:54.077
It's no good!

206
00:14:54.077 --> 00:14:57.277
No one could've given him
the poison in front of everyone else!

207
00:14:59.237 --> 00:15:00.357
Given?

208
00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:06.757
That's it! Only that
person could've done it!

209
00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:12.637
You damn kid,
sneaking into a place like this!

210
00:15:13.477 --> 00:15:14.737
What the--?!

211
00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:23.817
Now, then!

212
00:15:23.817 --> 00:15:28.197
I'm a pathetic personal physician.
I couldn't save him...

213
00:15:28.197 --> 00:15:31.697
Don't say that! It's not your fault!

214
00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:34.827
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

215
00:15:34.827 --> 00:15:38.197
I've finally figured out
the truth behind this incident,

216
00:15:38.197 --> 00:15:40.987
so please gather in the business room.

217
00:15:46.257 --> 00:15:49.087
What do you mean
by "the truth," Mori-kun?

218
00:15:49.087 --> 00:15:54.477
Indeed, I have no doubt that
Kazue-san poisoned the wine.

219
00:15:56.157 --> 00:16:00.147
However, Ichikawa-san never drank it.

220
00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:02.647
Not even a sip.

221
00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:04.107
What do you mean?

222
00:16:04.107 --> 00:16:08.567
He pretended to drink, but dumped
it in the flowerpot by the window.

223
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.657
Then it was his heart?

224
00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:16.697
No. He died of a poison-induced
heart attack. I'm certain of it.

225
00:16:16.697 --> 00:16:21.497
What kind of nonsense is this?!
My sister obviously killed him!

226
00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:25.777
I guess he just couldn't
accept death normally,

227
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:29.257
even though he trusted you
two until the very last moment...

228
00:16:29.257 --> 00:16:32.257
But didn't he hire you to investigate
because he didn't trust them?

229
00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:36.987
He wanted to trust them.
So he tested them.

230
00:16:36.987 --> 00:16:39.137
Ran. Play the video tape.

231
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:40.897
Okay.

232
00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:46.237
Oh! Is this it?!

233
00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:47.407
What is this?!

234
00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:50.907
This was all set up by Ichikawa-san.

235
00:16:50.907 --> 00:16:56.527
He probably planned to pretend to
collapse from his heart illness

236
00:16:56.527 --> 00:17:01.877
and then check later on the tape
to see how both daughters reacted.

237
00:17:01.877 --> 00:17:04.737
But the plan changed somewhat

238
00:17:04.737 --> 00:17:09.577
when he learned Kazue-san
was planning to kill him.

239
00:17:09.577 --> 00:17:10.587
So that's...

240
00:17:11.657 --> 00:17:16.737
So that's when he decided to
pretend to drink the poisoned wine.

241
00:17:16.737 --> 00:17:21.557
Wait, hold on. Wasn't it
poison that caused his death?

242
00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:24.027
That, we can be certain of.

243
00:17:24.027 --> 00:17:27.777
But it wasn't added to his wine or food.

244
00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:31.277
It was given to him
with a more direct method.

245
00:17:31.277 --> 00:17:36.867
Hold on now. I'm not sure
anyone had enough time to do that.

246
00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:38.907
Yeah! Everyone was watching!

247
00:17:38.907 --> 00:17:46.117
Yes. The killer openly gave him
the poison while everyone watched.

248
00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:48.907
Ran. Pause the tape.

249
00:17:48.907 --> 00:17:49.827
Okay.

250
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:52.337
You don't mean--?!

251
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:56.527
Yes.

252
00:17:56.527 --> 00:17:57.867
Dr. Okano.

253
00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:04.347
You could've given him a shot
of poison instead of a heart stimulant.

254
00:18:04.347 --> 00:18:09.367
You knew of Ichikawa-san's
plan, did you not?

255
00:18:09.367 --> 00:18:10.527
When you think about it,

256
00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:16.117
he would've required his
doctor's help to put on the act.

257
00:18:16.117 --> 00:18:23.117
Otherwise, you would've
realized he was faking right away.

258
00:18:23.117 --> 00:18:29.087
Ichikawa-san confided
his plan to you alone.

259
00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:31.077
I don't know what that plan was,

260
00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:37.967
but you decided to use
it as a chance to murder him.

261
00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:42.337
Everyone knew he had a weak heart.

262
00:18:43.407 --> 00:18:48.317
So no one would doubt his
personal physician's diagnosis.

263
00:18:48.317 --> 00:18:52.777
But why?! He has nothing
to do with the inheritance, right?!

264
00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:56.567
The most likely possibility is revenge.

265
00:18:57.367 --> 00:18:58.907
As his personal doctor,

266
00:18:58.907 --> 00:19:04.037
there was no need to
dirty your own hands to kill him.

267
00:19:04.617 --> 00:19:08.497
If you had told him his condition
wasn't serious, given how he was,

268
00:19:08.497 --> 00:19:15.467
he would've kept pushing
himself, hastening his death.

269
00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:19.427
The fact you instead
took direct action...

270
00:19:19.427 --> 00:19:21.657
I despised him.

271
00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:24.387
To that extent.

272
00:19:25.487 --> 00:19:32.027
The president--no, Ichikawa
Kotaro--killed my father.

273
00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:40.867
Ichikawa and my father were
partners when the business started.

274
00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:43.697
It happened thirty years ago.

275
00:19:43.697 --> 00:19:47.447
The venture business they
started together was a great success.

276
00:19:48.697 --> 00:19:52.487
But then he backstabbed
my father and kicked him out

277
00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:54.837
without even a yen to his name.

278
00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.297
Family life was miserable after that.

279
00:19:58.827 --> 00:20:01.737
He would always utter
complaints to me, just a little kid.

280
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:07.407
In the end, my mother passed
away before I entered middle school,

281
00:20:07.407 --> 00:20:11.847
and my father hastened his own death.

282
00:20:13.027 --> 00:20:18.357
Then, after I became a doctor,
this man appeared before me.

283
00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:24.787
He never realized who I was.

284
00:20:25.777 --> 00:20:32.277
But when he told me about his
plan to test his daughters' loyalty,

285
00:20:32.277 --> 00:20:34.547
I suddenly made up my mind.

286
00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:40.507
A horrible backstabber like him,
testing the loyalty of others...

287
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.407
I had to make him pay...

288
00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:46.197
I had to make him pay!

289
00:22:28.737 --> 00:22:31.027
I'm going to be busy now!

290
00:22:31.027 --> 00:22:33.777
I need to organize
the things Father left me!

291
00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:34.707
Madam!

292
00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:38.407
Madam! About that...

293
00:22:38.407 --> 00:22:42.737
Your father said in his will
that if something should happen to him,

294
00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:45.407
everything should be donated away.

295
00:22:45.407 --> 00:22:48.177
Don't be stupid! I won't
allow any such thing!

296
00:22:48.447 --> 00:22:53.137
But he did have the will written
in the presence of an attorney...

297
00:22:53.527 --> 00:22:56.617
Listen. There's something
called a "legally-secured portion."

298
00:22:56.617 --> 00:22:59.367
I insist on receiving what I deserve!

299
00:22:59.367 --> 00:23:00.387
Mizue-san.

300
00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:01.907
What is it?

301
00:23:01.907 --> 00:23:07.067
I hear you disposed of your
father's stock certificates on your own.

302
00:23:09.027 --> 00:23:13.367
I'm told the board of directors
is charging you with embezzlement.

303
00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:18.247
No way! It's not true! It's not true!

304
00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:22.077
In the end, Ichikawa-san's daughters

305
00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:24.487
don't even get one
yen of his inheritance...

306
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:28.027
H-Hey! What's gonna
happen to this house?!

307
00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:30.947
What do you mean?
It's going to be donated to someone.

308
00:23:30.947 --> 00:23:34.027
Then what happens to my pay?!

309
00:23:34.027 --> 00:23:35.827
You got a million yen already!

310
00:23:35.827 --> 00:23:37.477
What about the other million?!

311
00:23:37.477 --> 00:23:38.517
Just forget about it?

312
00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:41.277
No!

313
00:23:51.537 --> 00:23:52.997
H-Hold on!

314
00:23:52.997 --> 00:23:54.797
What do you think you're doing?

315
00:23:55.377 --> 00:24:02.377
And, just by chance yet again,
you're here too, Mori-kun?!

316
00:24:02.377 --> 00:24:07.597
P-Please don't shout, Inspector.
My hangover is killing me...

317
00:24:08.257 --> 00:24:09.877
On the next Conan--

318
00:24:09.877 --> 00:24:13.317
The Famous Potter Murder Case (Part 1).
