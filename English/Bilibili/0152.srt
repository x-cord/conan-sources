1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.166
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.866
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.766
Today is about a strange passenger on the bus.

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.766
The incident unfolds into something beyond Imagination.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.379
-Run! -Hey!

9
00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.779
Ran, hurry! Quick!

10
00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.379
-Wait, bus! Wait! -I'm getting on!

11
00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.479
Thank God.

12
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.379
We made it.

13
00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.879
It's because you try to buy everything at once.

14
00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.379
Talk for yourself.

15
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.879
Look at all the outlet brand goods you bought too.

16
00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.479
But I really wanted this.

17
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.779
Oh. I see.

18
00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.579
I'm happy for you.

19
00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.179
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

20
00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.479
Good night.

21
00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.679
It's not fair.

22
00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.379
Let me know when It's time to get off.

23
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.579
Geez.

24
00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.879
"The old man disappears"

25
00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.079
Are you all right?

26
00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.779
Yes.

27
00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:03.679
I thought they finally got me.

28
00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:05.979
This jabbed me in the stomach.

29
00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.879
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.379
Aren't you Mr. Mouri's daughter?

31
00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.479
Yes. And you are?

32
00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.179
I'm Shitara, Jukichi Shitara.

33
00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:22.179
"Jukichi Shitara (70)" -It's not surprising

34
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.779
that you don't remember me though.

35
00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.879
Mr. Shitara?

36
00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.179
It's written like this.

37
00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.579
"Shitara"

38
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:39.379
It's a nice name. I am Ran Mouri.

39
00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.279
Today is quite humid, isn't it?

40
00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.679
Yes. Because it's raining, I guess.

41
00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.379
"Ran Mouri" -This is how my name is written.

42
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.179
Thank you so much.

43
00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:54.779
It's nothing.

44
00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.379
I was on my way to visit your father.

45
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.979
Is it a request for an investigation?

46
00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.179
Yes.

47
00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.079
But it's not the kind of work that can be discussed over the phone.

48
00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:12.279
By the way, is the Muromachi Hospital still far from here?

49
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.579
What? You mean the bus stop.

50
00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:16.279
Let's see.

51
00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:20.779
It's the fourth station from here.

52
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.179
I'm going to ride way pass there.

53
00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:25.679
Would you like me to let you know when it's time for you to get off?

54
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.879
Thank you so much for your kindness.

55
00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:28.979
No problem.

56
00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:42.979
Ran...

57
00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.379
It's time to get up.

58
00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.579
Come on, get up.

59
00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.579
We're almost there.

60
00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:50.879
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

61
00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.479
Gosh. I'm the one who asked you to wake me,

62
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.779
and I'm waking you up instead!

63
00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.879
What?

64
00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.079
Is it Muromachi Hospital yet?

65
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.379
We've passed that station a long time ago! What?

66
00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:03.879
Did the old man get off all right?

67
00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.879
What?

68
00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.979
The old man.

69
00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.179
His name was Mr. Shitara.

70
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.679
Who's that?

71
00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:12.879
The man that was sitting next to me!

72
00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.179
How should I know?

73
00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:16.479
I didn't see such an old man.

74
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.479
That's because you were asleep, Sonoko.

75
00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:19.979
Don't ask me, then.

76
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.279
Maybe you were dreaming or something?

77
00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.079
Dreaming?

78
00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.979
I wonder if it was a dream.

79
00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:38.379
Ran!

80
00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.079
Excuse me. Did an old man get off at Muromachi Hospital Station?

81
00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.479
An old man who was wearing a cap and was holding an umbrella.

82
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.679
I'm not so sure

83
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:49.179
because a lot of passengers get on and off at that bus stop.

84
00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:51.179
I see.

85
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.779
So, we're home! Home at last.

86
00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:58.179
Well, do you want to stop by and grab something to eat?

87
00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:01.079
Hello?

88
00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:03.779
-It still bothers me. -What does?

89
00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:04.879
Taxi!

90
00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.479
What?

91
00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:07.579
Keep me company, Sonoko.

92
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:09.679
Hey, Ran!

93

"Muromachi Hospital Station"

94
00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.879
And just what do you intend to do now?

95
00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.279
We're going to ask around.

96
00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.279
Why are you so concerned over that old man?

97
00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.179
Something about that old man bothers me!

98
00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:25.479
I'm sure I met him somewhere,

99
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.479
but I can't remember.

100
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.079
Besides...

101
00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:34.479
I was on my way to visit your father.

102
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:38.979
It seems he wanted to ask dad for an investigation.

103
00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:40.279
How about over there, then?

104
00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.279
What?

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.879
"Beika Newspaper Agency" -Beika Newspaper Agency?

106
00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.579
Beyond that.

107
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.879
"Muromachi Hospital" -Mr. Jukichi Shitara...

108
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.479
He doesn't seem to be here.

109
00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:54.679
He's not here?

110
00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:56.779
Yes, his name is not listed

111
00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.379
among the out-patient list or the in-patient.

112
00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.379
Oh, I see.

113
00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.679
How strange, though.

114
00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:04.579
That old man said that he was going to the hospital, right?

115
00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:07.379
I think so. I wonder if he just came here to visit someone.

116
00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:09.679
No, I don't think so.

117
00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:15.379
The name Mr. Shitara is not on the list of visitors either.

118
00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.679
You're being over anxious.

119
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.479
If he wants to see your dad,

120
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.879
he must have contacted him first.

121
00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.679
I guess so.

122
00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:23.779
It has to be.

123
00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:26.779
If not, the old man never existed in the first place.

124
00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.379
Oh, so you don't believe me after all!

That's all I can think of.

128
00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.079
Sonoko thinks it's just my imagination,

129
00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:43.379
but something bothers me.

130
00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:46.279
I wonder if you could ask Inspector Megure to look for the old man.

131
00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.179
I guess not.

132
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:51.579
Of course not!

133
00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:54.579
You're probably just imagining things or dreaming.

134
00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.079
I wonder if it was a dream after all.

135
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.779
An M.O. disc?

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:07.179
What's this?

137
00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.479
What?

138
00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:09.979
I wonder what it is.

I don't remember buying anything like this.

140
00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:15.779

143
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:26.279
No good.

144
00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:27.279
What?

Top secret. Don't take off premises.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.979
Well, it's understandable, but...

150
00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.679
Can't you somehow figure out the password

151
00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.579
and open the file, Dr. Agasa?

152
00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:47.779
It'll take some time.

153
00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:49.179
But, aren't you in a rush?

154
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.379
Yep.

155
00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:53.179
Now, we going to visit the company of the bus

156
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:54.879
that I rode this afternoon.

157
00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:58.579
We might be able to get some more clues.

158
00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:03.279
Okay. I'll contact you when I get to open the file.

159
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:05.079
-Okay! -Thank you!

160
00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.779
"Suzuki's Residence"

161
00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:10.879
Yes...

162
00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:11.979
Oh, is that right?

163
00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:14.679
Thank you very much.

164
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.979
Everything's okay. The company told that

165
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:19.079
the bus is still running it's course.

166
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:20.279
Okay, let's go!

167
00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.179
Wait up, will you?

168
00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:26.279
Why on earth do I have to get involved in this?

169
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.379
Because Conan said that you should be with me

170
00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:32.479
to compensate for my vague memory.

171
00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:34.679
So, it's you after all.

172
00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:37.879
Please help me, Sonoko.

173
00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:42.179
Gosh! I just took a shower and was feeling refreshed.

174
00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:55.179
What's with that car?

175
00:10:55.179 --> 00:10:58.279
Hey, Conan! Looks straight ahead! It's dangerous.

176
00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:00.979
Ran, that car.

177
00:11:00.979 --> 00:11:02.179
What?

178
00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:07.379
There's nothing. Now, look ahead.

179
00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:19.379
Like I said this afternoon,

180
00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.779
I don't remember a thing about the old man.

181
00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:24.279
I see.

182
00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:28.879
Something may be left where the old man was sitting.

183
00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:30.579
-That's right! -Hold on.

184
00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:32.079
This bus wasn't the bus earlier.

185
00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.479
What?

186
00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:35.879
That bus was not functioning too well,

187
00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:38.779
so it's under maintenance now.

188
00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:41.479
Let's go! Ran!

189
00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:42.479
Okay!

190
00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:44.279
It must've been about you girls.

191
00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:45.579
-What? -What do you mean?

192
00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:49.079
Well, I was asked where a girl named Mouri,

193
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.279
who was on the bus, got off.

194
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.979
-What? -No! What does that mean?

195
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.279
Creepy.

196
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.779
What kind of person was the one who asked you that?

197
00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:58.479
What kind of person is that person?

198
00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:02.379
Well, he was wearing a coat and sunglasses.

199
00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.579
Could it be...

200
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:11.979
That man?

201
00:12:11.979 --> 00:12:13.279
Do you know him?

202
00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:14.979
But, why?

203
00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:17.879
Let's hurry, Ran!

204
00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:20.879
The old man who disappeared.

205
00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.379
A top secret M.O.

206
00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:24.079
The man who is wearing sunglasses.

207
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.879
Something smells fishy!

208
00:12:46.768 --> 00:12:48.768
"Heian Bus Company"

209
00:13:00.068 --> 00:13:01.768
Please wait here.

210
00:13:03.068 --> 00:13:04.668
Wait, mister!

211
00:13:06.668 --> 00:13:08.868
Hey... You can't come in!

212
00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:10.968
I'm sorry. I forgot something on the bus!

213
00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:12.068
Over there, Conan.

214
00:13:12.068 --> 00:13:13.468
Hey!

215
00:13:13.468 --> 00:13:15.668
No doubt about it. It's here.

216
00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:19.368
I sat here, and the old man sat next to me.

217
00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:21.268
Do you remember anything else?

218
00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:25.168
That's right! His name!

219
00:13:25.168 --> 00:13:26.168
His name?

220
00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:28.568
Right, he wrote his name on the window back then,

221
00:13:28.568 --> 00:13:31.068
because the window was cloudy.

222
00:13:31.068 --> 00:13:34.168
Like this, with his fingers.

223
00:13:34.168 --> 00:13:36.068
But, it's gone already.

224
00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:40.868
"Shitara, Ran Mouri"

225
00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:43.368
It wasn't a dream after all.

226
00:13:43.368 --> 00:13:44.968
What's going on?

227
00:13:44.968 --> 00:13:46.968
I have no idea what is going on.

228
00:13:50.168 --> 00:13:52.268
Hello.

229
00:13:52.268 --> 00:13:54.768
What? You figured out the password?

230
00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:58.468
Yeah and about the contents of the disc.

231
00:13:58.468 --> 00:14:01.168
This is double accounting.

232
00:14:01.168 --> 00:14:02.868
Double accounting?

233
00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:06.468
You know the company Beika Construction Company, don't you?

234
00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:10.168
It's something that was taken out of their accounting department.

235
00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:11.768
It has a dummy account book,

236
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.768
and an account book that corresponds to that

237
00:14:13.768 --> 00:14:16.268
which shows all the bribes given to politicians and all.

238
00:14:16.268 --> 00:14:17.668
The names of all the corrupted assembly men

239
00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:19.868
that had transactions dealing with the general assembly meeting

240
00:14:19.868 --> 00:14:22.768
of stockholders are also listed.

241
00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:24.068
I see.

242
00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:26.868
The old man was sought after

243
00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:28.368
because he had the double account book on him.

244
00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:32.968
Yes. I thought they finally got me.

245
00:14:35.768 --> 00:14:38.568
The man wearing sunglasses was not after me,

246
00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:41.068
but rather, after the old man.

247
00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:44.468
Yes. That's why the old man who realized that he was being tailed,

248
00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:47.668
put this MO into your pochette.

249
00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:52.368
Yes, and also because he knew that I was Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

250
00:14:52.368 --> 00:14:54.068
We've got to find the old man!

251
00:14:54.068 --> 00:14:55.768
What do you mean to find him?

252
00:14:55.768 --> 00:14:58.468
We don't even know where he is after he gets off the bus.

253
00:14:58.468 --> 00:14:59.568
The newspaper agency!

254
00:14:59.568 --> 00:15:00.968
What?

255
00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:03.068
He went to the newspaper agency

256
00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.868
after leaving the double account book with me!

257
00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:05.868
I see!

258
00:15:05.868 --> 00:15:07.268
-No! -What?

259
00:15:07.268 --> 00:15:09.268
Try and remember.

260
00:15:09.268 --> 00:15:12.068
The man who was wearing sunglasses asked the bus driver

261
00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:15.368
about you, right?

262
00:15:15.368 --> 00:15:19.868
Which means he found out that the old man didn't have the account book!

263
00:15:19.868 --> 00:15:21.368
That's why he was looking for Ran

264
00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:24.768
who was sitting next to him on the bus!

265
00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:27.068
Yes, in other words...

266
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:31.168
The old man was captured by the man wearing sunglasses?

267
00:15:31.168 --> 00:15:33.968
Ran, call Pops and Inspector Megure!

268
00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:35.668
Where are you going?

269
00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.968
I'm going to look around the area where the old man got off!

270
00:15:37.968 --> 00:15:38.968
I'll go too.

271
00:15:38.968 --> 00:15:40.568
No!

272
00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:42.668
Since they are after you,

273
00:15:42.668 --> 00:15:44.768
stay and wait for me here at the bus company!

274
00:15:44.768 --> 00:15:46.068
Okay!

275
00:16:02.168 --> 00:16:04.268
Excuse me, may I use your phone?

276
00:16:04.268 --> 00:16:05.768
Go ahead.

277
00:16:07.268 --> 00:16:09.768
My telephone card.

278
00:16:10.968 --> 00:16:11.968
Will you hold this for me?

279
00:16:11.968 --> 00:16:13.068
Okay.

280
00:16:22.468 --> 00:16:24.468
No, that's not it, dad.

281
00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:26.168
Are you listening to me?

282
00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:28.068
Don't sleep on me!

283
00:16:28.068 --> 00:16:31.668
Yes, I'm listening...

284
00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:33.768
Gosh, how can he be like that at a time like this!

285
00:16:33.768 --> 00:16:35.868
Well, is he coming right away?

286
00:16:35.868 --> 00:16:37.068
I can't get through to him at all!

287
00:16:37.068 --> 00:16:39.168
I'm calling Inspector Megure!

288
00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:47.668
It's pretty good for something that was bought at the outlet.

289
00:17:08.768 --> 00:17:10.068
That is bad!

290
00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:13.168
Yes, that's right.

291
00:17:13.168 --> 00:17:15.868
I'm at the Heian Bus Company right now.

292
00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.568
Bad news!

293
00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:20.068
The other girls were kidnapped!

294
00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.668
Shinichi, it's me.

295
00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:26.668
What up, Dr. Agasa?

296
00:17:26.668 --> 00:17:30.968
Ran just called saying that Sonoko has been kidnapped!

297
00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:31.968
What?

298
00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.968
The kidnappers car seems to have gone to the left

299
00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:35.968
after leaving the bus company!

300
00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:38.268
Left, which means the other way!

301
00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:40.068
Driver, please make a U-turn!

302
00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:41.168
What?

303
00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:47.368
Hey, you're late.

304
00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:50.768
Sorry, it took me some time to get to her.

305
00:17:55.268 --> 00:17:56.668
Strange!

306
00:17:56.668 --> 00:18:00.768
We should have overtaken the kidnapper's car by now!

307
00:18:00.768 --> 00:18:03.568
On one side of this road is the fence of a factory.

308
00:18:03.568 --> 00:18:06.268
Which means they made a left turn somewhere!

309
00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:08.768
Driver, please turn right, over there!

310
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.668
Does this road lead out somewhere?

311
00:18:16.668 --> 00:18:20.268
No, beyond here is a warehouse area, and it's a dead end!

312
00:18:20.268 --> 00:18:21.968
Using this road as a short-cut wouldn't do any good

313
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:24.968
because you'd have to go all the way around anyway!

314
00:18:24.968 --> 00:18:28.568
Which means that Sonoko is somewhere nearby!

315
00:18:39.668 --> 00:18:42.768
Beika Construction Company?

316
00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:43.968
"Kakuda Construction Resources"

317
00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:45.168
"Tamamoto Construction"

318
00:18:48.068 --> 00:18:51.068
"Ryujin Economics Research Lab"

319
00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:52.768
Wait a second.

320
00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:54.668
The one who's going to be in trouble

321
00:18:54.668 --> 00:18:56.168
when the double accounting book is publicized

322
00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:58.468
is not only the Beika Construction Company.

323
00:18:58.468 --> 00:19:01.268
All the companies that had behind the curtain dealings are involved.

324
00:19:03.468 --> 00:19:05.968
Dr. Agasa! Is there a place called

325
00:19:05.968 --> 00:19:09.268
Ryujin Economics Research Lab in the list of the MO?

326
00:19:09.268 --> 00:19:12.068
Wait.

327
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.068
I found it, Shinichi!

328
00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:17.368
A lot of money is involved here.

329
00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:18.868
Thank you, Dr. Agasa.

330
00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:21.568
Stupid, she's not the one!

331
00:19:21.568 --> 00:19:24.368
What? You mean the other one?

332
00:19:24.368 --> 00:19:27.268
You goofed it.

333
00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:29.968
I'm sorry, boss.

334
00:19:31.768 --> 00:19:33.068
She had the pochette with her

335
00:19:33.068 --> 00:19:34.268
so I thought she was the one.

336
00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:36.268
Go again and get her!

337
00:19:36.268 --> 00:19:38.568
Okay, boss.

338
00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:45.068
Don't goof it this time now!

339
00:19:45.068 --> 00:19:46.868
Yeah, okay.

340
00:19:46.868 --> 00:19:48.968
What're we going to do with them?

341
00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:50.668
Without the disc,

342
00:19:50.668 --> 00:19:51.968
we don't need them anymore!

343
00:19:53.268 --> 00:19:54.868
Get rid of them.

344
00:19:57.568 --> 00:19:58.768
What the...

345
00:20:17.268 --> 00:20:19.368
What is this kid doing here?

346
00:20:21.268 --> 00:20:22.668
I'm Conan Edogawa!

347
00:20:22.668 --> 00:20:24.168
A detective!

348
00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:26.568
You brat!

349
00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:46.968
The two sunglasses men turned out to be bad men

350
00:20:46.968 --> 00:20:49.568
who had dealings behind the curtains

351
00:20:49.568 --> 00:20:51.968
with Beika Construction Company.

352
00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:55.968
And, Mr. Jukichi Shitara,

353
00:20:55.968 --> 00:20:58.868
who was an executive of the Beika Construction Company for a long time,

354
00:20:58.868 --> 00:20:59.968
decided to take the double accounting book

355
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.468
out of the company after pondering.

356
00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:09.168
Sonoko!

357
00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:12.168
Ran...

358
00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:18.868
I was so scared.

359
00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:20.568
I'm glad.

360
00:21:20.568 --> 00:21:23.168
I'm so glad that you're okay, Sonoko.

361
00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:27.668
The following day,

362
00:21:27.668 --> 00:21:31.468
Beika Construction Company was searched by the police.

363
00:21:31.468 --> 00:21:35.768
Thanks to the courage of one old man who reported the crime.

364
00:23:05.568 --> 00:23:08.268
"Mouri Detective Agency"

365
00:23:08.268 --> 00:23:10.068
"Cafe Poirot"

366
00:23:10.068 --> 00:23:15.468
I still think I've seen that old man somewhere.

367
00:23:15.468 --> 00:23:19.368
You still can't remember, Ran?

368
00:23:19.368 --> 00:23:23.368
That old man was an executive of the Beika Construction Company,

369
00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:26.968
so maybe you saw him in the papers or on television?

370
00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:29.968
-I wonder... -Hi, there, upstairs people.

371
00:23:29.968 --> 00:23:33.768
Here's your sandwich with coffee and orange juice.

372
00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:34.768
Here you go.

373
00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:35.868
Thank you.

374
00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:42.768
I wonder if I'm mistaken after all.

375
00:23:42.768 --> 00:23:44.168
No...

376
00:23:44.168 --> 00:23:46.768
You didn't mistaken about anything.

377
00:23:49.968 --> 00:23:52.468
Grampa!

378
00:23:52.468 --> 00:23:54.968
Mr. Jukichi Shitara was a patron of the coffee shop

379
00:23:54.968 --> 00:23:59.968
that is located below the Mouri Detective Agency.

380
00:24:03.368 --> 00:24:07.068
"Next Episode"

381
00:24:07.068 --> 00:24:09.368
What's the matter, Ran?

382
00:24:09.368 --> 00:24:14.568
I have a feeling I saw that person with the glasses somewhere.

383
00:24:20.368 --> 00:24:21.568
Where?

384
00:24:21.568 --> 00:24:24.268
Where did you see him, Ran?

385
00:24:24.268 --> 00:24:25.768
Ran!

386
00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:29.468
Next Conan,

387
00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:33.389
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 1)"

388
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.370
Next Conan Hint:

389
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.270
"Sonoko's camera"

390
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.570
-In next episode... -Wait! Ran, that swimsuit is pretty bold.

391
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.070
Yours too, Sonoko.
