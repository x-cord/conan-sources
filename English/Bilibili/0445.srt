1
00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:03.807
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:05.607
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:07.107
A code like cell phone mail.

4
00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.707
Pops is pondering when a cat appears!

5
00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.107
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:12.707
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:14.807
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.251
At 9:00 in the morning, I have to meet a client.

9
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.551
From 10:00 to after 1:00 in the afternoon,

10
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.051
I'll have lunch at Poirot while enjoying a relaxing coffee time.

11
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:08.251
Then from 2:00, I get to watch the long awaited drama series

12
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.651
starring Yoko Okino while video taping it.

13
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.751
And I'll take consideration making deductions from the plot.

14
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:17.151
No. Wait.

15
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:19.151
I'll quickly watch five previous episodes

16
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:20.851
while waiting for the client to arrive.

17
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.951
Not bad a plan since I can review the storyline.

18
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.051
Talk about being busy!

19
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:30.651
What a satisfying life I'm leading.

20
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.851
Hey.

21
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.351
Just what're you guys doing?

22
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.451
It's already time to go to school, isn't it?

23
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.451
Well...

24
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:42.751
What is it?

25
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.051
Are you hiding something from me?

26
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:47.551
Well, it's not something weird or anything.

27
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.351
What the... It's just a cat.

28
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.251
What?

29
00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:00.751
A cat?

30
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.351
A cat!

31
00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:14.851
"Secret of the Russian Blue"

32
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:17.351
Hey, hey.

33
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.351
Don't tell me you picked up a stray.

34
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:20.951
Well, no.

35
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.751
It's Aunty Eri's cat.

36
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.451
Eri?

37
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:29.051
If I remember correctly, she had a black and brown cat.

38
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.451
It wasn't this strange mouse like gray colour, was it?

39
00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:34.951
It's called a Russian Blue.

40
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.551
It's known for its blue-gray fur and green eyes.

41
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:42.151
The cat she had before died a month ago,

42
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:44.751
so she got this cat from an acquaintance of hers.

43
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:46.751
Her previous cat was pretty aged already.

44
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.051
And why is that cat in my office?

45
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:54.651
Because mother came just a while ago and...

46
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.251
Sorry, Ran.

47
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:58.351
Will you watch this cat for three days?

48
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:01.051
What's up?

49
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:03.051
I have to fly on an afternoon flight to Okinawa

50
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:05.551
where a client of mine is working.

51
00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:09.551
Ms. Kuriyama who was supposed to take care of him is bedridden with flu.

52
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.451
But...

53
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.551
I have nobody else I can ask but you right now, Ran.

54
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.251
Okay?

55
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:17.851
Wait, Mom.

56
00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.251
Take care of Goro for me, okay?

57
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.651
That's the story.

58
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:26.751
Take care of the cat?

59
00:04:26.751 --> 00:04:30.551
But while you guys are at school, I'm the one who has to watch it.

60
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:35.351
Good morning, Ran!

61
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.551
Sonoko!

62
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.151
We're going to be late, Ran.

63
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:41.651
Is there something I should know?

64
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:43.651
Sorry, I'll be right there.

65
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.351
Bye, Dad!

66
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:47.351
Hey!

67
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.851
Take care of Goro for me, Dad.

68
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.551
I see.

69
00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:57.651
But, Ran,

70
00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:00.751
wasn't the name of the previous cat she had also Goro?

71
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:01.851
Yeah.

72
00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:06.051
I think mom likes that name and gave him the same name again.

73
00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:09.151
She says she named it Goro because its always rolling around doing nothing.

74
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:12.651
But I think the real reason is...

75
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.151
Gosh.

76
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:19.051
Why must a great detective like me take care of a cat?

77
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:20.851
It's easy because its already toilet trained

78
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:25.051
and all you have to do is make sure it doesn't run outside.

79
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.951
You watch it then.

80
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.351
You can play hooky today.

81
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.751
I give you permission to do so.

82
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:33.551
Give me permission, I mean...

83
00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:38.551
I'm busy all day today.

84
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:40.751
Excuse me.

85
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.251
I'm the one who called you last night. My name is Kirishita.

86
00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:46.251
What? I thought we agreed to meet at 9:00 over the phone.

87
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:49.551
Moreover, I thought I was told your wife would be coming.

88
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:52.951
The thing is, my wife fell ill,

89
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:56.151
so I stopped by here on my way to work in her place

90
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:57.851
and brought my daughter's code with me.

91
00:05:57.851 --> 00:05:58.951
A code?

92
00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:02.951
This is indeed

93
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:04.251
a code.

94
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.851
Yes.

95
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:10.951
This is an e-mail that my daughter mistakenly sent to my cell phone.

96
00:06:10.951 --> 00:06:12.651
I don't understand what it means

97
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.151
and my daughter kept on telling me to erase it right away.

98
00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:17.351
I've come to ask for your help

99
00:06:17.351 --> 00:06:20.651
thinking that maybe it could be something that needs attention.

100
00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:23.851
What is it?

101
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.451
Oh, well...

102
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.651
It just reminded me of "Speckled Cat Holmes".

103
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.251
You know, the cat that appears in Jiro Akagawa's novel.

104
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.951
Right.

105
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.251
In the first story of "Speckled Cat Holmes",

106
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:41.751
Holmes is sitting on someone's shoulder.

107
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:43.551
Which means if a Russian Blue is trained,

108
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.751
it can ride on a shoulder too, right?

109
00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:48.851
-I see. -Yeah.

110
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:52.951
Hey, hurry and go to school!

111
00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:53.951
Okay!

112
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:58.151
I thought you told me to play hooky just a while ago.

113
00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:02.751
Well, this mail does seem to smell a bit dangerous.

114
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.051
So you think so too, Mr. Mouri?

115
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:06.551
Yes.

116
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.851
The most I can make out of it is the second line, "Kare" (He),

117
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:15.051
and the last part of the third line, "Tsukiatte" (Go with me).

118
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.551
That's right.

119
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.851
My daughter is in the second year of high school,

120
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:22.751
but it seems that she's recently working part-time in secret.

121
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.651
I'm worried that maybe she's being deceived by some bad man somewhere

122
00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:27.651
and dishing money out to him.

123
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:31.051
The fact is that my wife fell ill because of this, too.

124
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.451
I see.

125
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.751
Second year of high school...

126
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:38.851
It sure is an age surrounded by many dangers.

127
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:41.851
My daughter is also in her second year of high school.

128
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:45.951
And she seems to be concerned about this leery detective kid.

129
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:49.151
Hey, I told you to hurry up and go to school!

130
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.551
I forgot something.

131
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:52.951
Gosh.

132
00:07:55.051 --> 00:08:00.351
Maybe it's a code that is popular among young girls.

133
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:03.751
I thought so, too.

134
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:06.851
So I asked the daughter of one of my colleagues at work.

135
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:09.751
And, what did she say?

136
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:10.751
Well...

137
00:08:13.651 --> 00:08:17.451
She chuckled as soon as she saw the mail.

138
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:20.151
Why don't you let her do as she likes?

139
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:22.451
That is what she said.

140
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:24.651
While smiling mischievously.

141
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.251
Maybe it's a dirty mail after all.

142
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:34.351
For the time being, please forward this mail to my cell phone.

143
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:37.451
All right.

144
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.951
I'll contact you as soon as I figure it out.

145
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.351
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:49.151
See you later, Goro.

147
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:50.651
Take care of Pops, okay?

148
00:08:57.851 --> 00:09:01.251
I don't have the slightest idea, no matter how many times I look at it.

149
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:06.351
I guess I'll go wash my face and freshen up.

150
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.451
He was in the bathroom.

151
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.151
Gosh, what a nuisance.

152
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:22.451
Well, if it's as smart as the speckled cat in the novel,

153
00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:24.451
it's another story.

154
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:29.651
What the heck?

155
00:09:29.651 --> 00:09:33.651
That cat has been sleeping on this towel!

156
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:36.651
Hey, you cat!

157
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:38.451
Just what do you think you're doing?

158
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:43.351
These are videos of Yoko's drama series!

159
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:47.851
If you scratch them, I won't forgive you!

160
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:51.051
The second episode's not here.

161
00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:53.251
Don't tell me you hid it somewhere?

162
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:01.551
Hey, this time it's a shoe?

163
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.151
This is Conan's shoe.

164
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:09.451
Just where did you bring it from?

165
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.551
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

166
00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:15.651
They're of no use if they were separated.

167
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:16.851
Remember that!

168
00:10:20.351 --> 00:10:21.351
Gosh.

169
00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:24.351
Sneaking in and bringing things without permission.

170
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:27.151
He is not Holmes, but Lupin.

171
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:31.351
I see, I see.

172
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.151
This letter that looks like an "O" with strand of hair on it

173
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:36.351
must be the Greek alphabet "S" (sigma)

174
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:39.651
This letter that looks like a distorted "V" is the Greek alphabet "nyu".

175
00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:44.851
The letter that looks like the hiragana "te" is the Greek alphabet "tau".

176
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.451
Which means the letters that formed "please come with me"

177
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:51.851
are read as "Please come witauh me".

178
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.751
What's this?

179
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:56.451
The Greek alphabet may stand for the names of stars.

180
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:59.451
It may have something to do with stars.

181
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.051
I'm sure that there was a book on stars around here some place.

182
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.751
Darn it! Playing pranks again!

183
00:11:11.051 --> 00:11:13.851
An English-Japanese Dictionary?

184
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:17.851
English-Japanese means translating English to Japanese.

185
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:24.251
In this e-mail, the English alphabet that is used is only "W".

186
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:27.751
But if this "W" were to be forcibly changed to Japanese...

187
00:11:29.751 --> 00:11:31.751
I guess it could pass for the hiragana "n"!

188
00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:33.151
I see!

189
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.651
I wonder if she's using foreign letters

190
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:38.351
that look like Japanese hiragana and katakana just for fun?

191
00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:42.651
That's why instead of "tsukiatte", she used "tsukiatau".

192
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:47.051
If so, I feel like I'll be able to read it.

193
00:11:47.051 --> 00:11:49.151
Good work, Goro.

194
00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:51.751
Wait.

195
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.651
Don't tell me this cat

196
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.251
was trying to tell me all this?

197
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.560
Could it be like in the novel?

198
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.660
Hey!

199
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.460
This is not a toy!

200
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.160
It's no more than a cat after all.

201
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.860
At any rate, she had purposely substituted

202
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.460
foreign characters for hiragana and katakana.

203
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.160
And it's obvious that our young lady wrote this message in a playful way.

204
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.360
I'll take that into consideration.

205
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.960
"W" equals the hiragana "n".

206
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.160
And "nu" equals the katakana "re".

207
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.960
"Tau" equals the hiragana "te".

208
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.260
So, the symbol equal would stand for the katakana "ni"

209
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.560
and the postal code symbol equals the katakana "de".

210
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.260
But...

211
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.260
"Ni-de-de-ku"?

212
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.360
What on earth does it mean?

213
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.960
It seems that the "S" that comes after the "W" and before hiragana "tsu"

214
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.060
has to be solved before this can be read.

215
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.760
But there's no such letter in hiragana or katakana.

216
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.260
So I'll use a circle to mark the unknown symbols and go from there.

217
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:26.560
"Yo-nn-gen-en-reka-re-niteteku"

218
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.160
I wonder if this is some kind of code after all?

219
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.860
Hey!

220
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.460
Darn it.

221
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.560
Hey, not again!

222
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.460
I told you not to come here.

223
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.360
It's already past 12:00!

224
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.360
It's less than two hours to Yoko's drama.

225
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.060
I've got to solve the contents of this mail before then.

226
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.560
Otherwise, I won't be able to watch Yoko's drama in peace.

227
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.160
Wait. Come to think of it,

228
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.760
he was doing something among the video tapes a while ago, too.

229
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.260
Maybe he's trying to tell me something again.

230
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.760
The thing that bothers me now

231
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.460
is that the video tape for the second episode is gone.

232
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.460
Gone... Lacking?

233
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.560
Wait, wait.

234
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.660
Before that, he was sleeping on the towel in the bathroom.

235
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.960
And his cat hair got on all over my face.

236
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.760
I see!

237
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.460
Remove and lacking.

238
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.060
Maybe these letters not only look like hiragana and katakana,

239
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.160
but are actually scribbles that young girls nowadays

240
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.860
use a lot in writing words to make them look cute?

241
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.760
In that case, the sigma must mean a certain hiragana or katakana

242
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.560
but with missing or dropped parts.

243
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.660
If so, the letter I can think of is...

244
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.660
The hiragana "no".

245
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.760
Then this plus-minus sign

246
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.260
is the hiragana "chi".

247
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.160
Which means the plus-minus, "W" and sigma are...

248
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.160
"Chi-chinno?"

249
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.760
What is this?

250
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.360
No. If something were added to the right of the plus-minus sign,

251
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.360
it would turn out as the hiragana "chi",

252
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.760
but what if something was added to the left?

253
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.160
It'll turn into "sa"!

254
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160
So if this is "sa",

255
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.660
then the plus-minus, "W", and sigma will be...

256
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.960
"Sa-n-no".

257
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.160
Could it be that it should go before someone's name?

258
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.960
The problem is the arrow before the plus-minus.

259
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.260
I've seen this arrow on Sonoko's New Year's postcard before.

260
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.960
What's with that arrow?

261
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.660
Oh, this means...

262
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.560
"Happy New Year!"

263
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.860
I see. The arrow is a dash.

264
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.460
It's used when you want to make a long sound.

265
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.860
In that case, the name that goes before the plus-minus

266
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.660
should be Sato or Taro,

267
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.860
a name that has a long sound at the end of it.

268
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.960
Okay! I'll solve this code all at once.

269
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.460
Darn it!

270
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.260
"Please go with me".

271
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.960
"Ni-te-te-ku-no-tsu-ki-a-tte".

272
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.360
It's almost readable but not quite.

273
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.260
Names that start with "yo"

274
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.660
and end with a long sound are "Yo-jo" or "Yo-ichiro".

275
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.760
No matter how I look at it, it doesn't look that way.

276
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.460
Hey, you.

277
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.660
Stop playing with my shoe!

278
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.960
Shoe?

279
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.560
Come to think of it,

280
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.360
he was playing with Conan's shoe.

281
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.860
Moreover, with only one side.

282
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.360
Back then, I...

283
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.360
Listen. You need two shoes to form a pair.

284
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.760
They're of no use if they're separated.

285
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.160
Two makes a pair.

286
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.860
Spaces for two characters were being used to display one character.

287
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.160
That is, "koto" means "words" and "en" means "extend" in the first row.

288
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.960
If written as one word, the kanji character "tan" will be (tanjo=birth).

289
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.060
And the two postal marks in the third row form "gyou" or "to go".

290
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.260
Wait.

291
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.560
Then the first hiragana character is "yo",

292
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.360
and if you add on the missing parts,

293
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.460
that is the hiragana character "ku" that is on the side,

294
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.660
it'll make the hiragana character "o".

295
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.060
And for the following character,

296
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:50.260
if I pair the "L" with the mirrored version of the hiragana "tsu",

297
00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.960
it becomes the hiragana "to".

298
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.660
The letter on the second line which looks like flattened katakana "fu"

299
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.260
and the little circle make the katakana "pu".

300
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.160
If I read the second line keeping all this in mind, I get "pu-re-ka-i-ni".

301
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.860
It means "buy birthday present"!

302
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.160
All right, if I keep reading...

303
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.760
"Go with me to buy my father's birthday present."

304
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.860
It's pretty easy to read girlish writing.

305
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.960
Girlish writing?

306
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.660
Hey, Dad.

307
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.060
I hope you didn't lay your hands on a young girl or something?

308
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.360
Oh, no.

309
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.460
This is an e-mail that a client asked me to decipher for him.

310
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.260
Wait. Why are you all here?

311
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.060
What about school?

312
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.560
We went.

313
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.460
Just what are you talking about, Pops?

314
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.760
It's already sundown.

315
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.460
Then, hurry up and make dinner!

316
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.760
Yes, sir.

317
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.060
Let's go, Ran.

318
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.560
I'm home.

319
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.660
Hi!

320
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.660
Oh, glasses kid.

321
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.260
Gosh.

322
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.860
They snatch away all the good parts.

323
00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.260
Even though we solved it all by ourselves, right?

324
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.760
I guess I'll call the client right now.

325
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.560
The bonito strategy worked out great.

326
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.060
I snuck bonito in places and on things that would serve as clues

327
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.560
and made the cat mess around in the area,

328
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.360
so that Pops would catch the hint.

329
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.060
It seems to have worked out well.

330
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.160
Hello, Mr. Kirishita?

331
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.460
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri, whom you came to see early this morning.

332
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.660
Then don't tell me that...

333
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.360
Then did you solve the code of my daughter's e-mail?

334
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.960
Yes, indeed I have.

335
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.260
Hey.

336
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.460
It's dangerous if you fall off!

337
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.760
Dangerous?

338
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.160
So it was a dangerous e-mail after all.

339
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.760
I mean, no...

340
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.660
She's nowhere close to danger. Rather, she's well brought up.

341
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.560
Well brought up?

342
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560
Hey, idiot! Stop pulling!

343
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.460
You're the one who's pulling and stalling the conversation, Mr. Mouri!

344
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.960
I mean, no...

345
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.460
Please tell me quickly.

346
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.260
What are the contents of the mail?

347
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.560
No matter what the contents, I won't be surprised.

348
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.460
I'm fully prepared for what's to come!

349
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.860
If I tell my daughter about the contents and ask her about it,

350
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.860
I'm sure she will stop sneaking around and tell me what she's up to.

351
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.360
So, go on, please tell me.

352
00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.860
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Mouri!

353
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.560
No, actually I couldn't solve it at all.

354
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.960
What? Just what are you getting at?

355
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.160
Besides, I got a request for a big job,

356
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.260
and will probably be tied up with that job for a while.

357
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.960
So I'm calling to say that I'd like to decline this request from you.

358
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.560
No way.

359
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.360
But she is a fine young lady,

360
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.960
so I'd advise you not to worry and watch over her!

361
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.960
How can you be so sure?

362
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960
You've never even met her.

363
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.860
I know from my hunch as a detective.

364
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.560
Please give my regards to your daughter.

365
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.060
Birthday presents should be kept a surprise after all.

366
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.960
That cat maybe didn't need my help.

367
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.660
Are you hungry?

368
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.560
Then let's ask Ran to make dinner for you.

369
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.860
Dinner?

370
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.360
Sundown?

371
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.260
Yoko's drama!

372
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.260
I not only missed it, I didn't get to tape it either!

373
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.560
I forgot all about it because you keep going here and there.

374
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.360
Not only that, but you hid the video tape, too!

375
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.460
-Well... -Hold it.

376
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.260
Just what do you think you're doing to my Goro?

377
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.960
Dear.

378
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.360
Eri? Aren't you were supposed to be in Okinawa?

379
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.960
I was so worried about him,

380
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.860
I flew back early and plan to finish the rest of my work via phone and fax.

381
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.260
Come, Goro.

382
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.560
It's time to say goodbye to this scary man.

383
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.460
You may both be "Goro", but what a difference.

384
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.960
What?

385
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.660
Wasn't the other black and brown Goro you had also attached to you?

386
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.160
You're so different when it comes to denseness, too.

387
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.360
Don't tell me that Goro...

388
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.760
stands for Kogoro's goro?

389
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.660
"Next Episode" -A story behind it?

390
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.260
Don't tell me that

391
00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.360
it's that villa where the murder of the bandaged man occurred?

392
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.660
It's completely sealed.

393
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.260
There are no traces of nails being removed either.

394
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.760
Next Conan, "Sealed Western-style Window (Part 1)"

395
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.760
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.260
"Key holder"

397
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.860
The next episode will be at Sonoko's villa.

398
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.560
It's been a long time since we last dealt with Gunma Prefectural Police.
