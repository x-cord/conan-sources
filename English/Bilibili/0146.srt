1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.366
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.066
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.566
Today's stage is police headquarters.

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.266
Officers are people, too.

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.266
They are busy falling is love as well as solving cases.

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.066
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.166
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.166
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:59.879
"Detective Love Story (Part 1)"

10
00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.379
"Police Department"

11
00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.779
So this is the police department!

12
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.679
It's so big!

13
00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
This is where they are doing all the investigation of cases, right?

14
00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.179
This is like the big boss of Japan's police force.

15
00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.179
It's so exciting!

16
00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.579
Come now.

17
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.279
We've been summoned here to answer questions

18
00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.379
about the old blue castle we saw the other day.

19
00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.279
We're not here on a picnic.

20
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.479
Conan, you were excited saying that

21
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.879
you may be able to hear about unsolved cases too, weren't you?

22
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.779
Right! The one who looked the happiest to come here

23
00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.179
was none other than you, Conan!

24
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.179
Oh, is that so?

25
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.279
I'm going home.

26
00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.379
You guys go on and answer their questions.

27
00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.179
Hey, Ai!

28
00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.979
Mr. Agasa?

29
00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.179
"Wataru Takagi" -Thank you for waiting.

30
00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.079
I'm Takagi of the First Investigation Division!

31
00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.579
Please come in, all of you.

32
00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.179
All right.

33
00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.979
Thank you for coming all this way.

34
00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:04.979
Oh, don't mention it.

35
00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.179
It's a pretty nice place.

36
00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:13.579
How strange, I expected it to be dirty.

37
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.679
I bet it's just the exterior appearance that's nice.

38
00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.779
Yes, I bet the room of the officers are...

39
00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:20.779
"First Investigation Division"

40
00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.379
There is almost no one around.

41
00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.479
Everyone is out.

42
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.079
Is it that surprising?

43
00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.379
Because all the police rooms that I've seen

44
00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.079
are always filled with cigarette smoke!

45
00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.979
I thought that men with scary faces

46
00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.079
would be looking at me the minute I entered.

47
00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.779
You've been watching too many police stories.

48
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.279
I am an officer too, you know.

49
00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.279
He doesn't look scary at all.

50
00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.379
I wonder if he can nab criminals at all?

51
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.979
I'm sure he's not popular with girls, too.

52
00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.579
By the way, where is Inspector Megure?

53
00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.379
He is the one who told us to come here.

54
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.479
The Inspector is at the Investigation Headquarters

55
00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.879
working on that bank robbery case.

56
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.479
You mean that bank robbery from three days ago at Haido-cho's bank

57
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.379
where 200 million yen was robbed?

58
00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.079
Yes, it seems that the Inspector's wife

59
00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.479
was also at the bank at that time

60
00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.879
and was hurt when she was kicked by the robber.

61
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.379
That's why the Inspector's all into this case.

62
00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.579
That's why you're going to question us instead, right, Officer Takagi?

63
00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.679
Yes, that's right.

64
00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.879
All right, let's get started by going to another room.

65
00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.179
I've got another appointment at 5:00 pm.

66
00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:38.679
It looks like the button of your sleeve is going to come off.

67
00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:41.179
Oh, you're right!

68
00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:43.379
You've got ring around the collar, too.

69
00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.579
Your shirt is all wrinkled, too.

70
00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:48.379
Don't tell me that

71
00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.379
you don't have a girlfriend, Officer Takagi?

72
00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.579
Would you like me to introduce you to my cousin's grandchild?

73
00:04:55.579 --> 00:04:57.979
No way.

74
00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.679
I have someone that I feel special about too, you know!

75
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:03.479
Officer Takagi.

76
00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.879
What's with those children?

77
00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:07.879
If they're lost,

78
00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.179
you 're supposed to take them to the Safety Division, aren't you?

79
00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:11.579
No, these children are...

80
00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.279
What's with this lady?

81
00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.479
She is...

82
00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.279
Why are you blushing?

83
00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.379
I get it!

84
00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.379
She is the one that you like, isn't she?

85
00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.979
Hey, hey...

86
00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:23.979
Is it all right

87
00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.679
to bring your girlfriend all the way to your work place?

88
00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.479
You've got it all wrong.

89
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.479
I am Miwako Sato.

90
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.879
I may be a woman,

91
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.179
but I belong to the First Investigation Division.

92
00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:36.879
I'm a woman officer!

93
00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:37.979
A woman officer?

94
00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.079
That's cool!

95
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.879
And what are these children here for?

96
00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.379
They're witnesses of the old blue castle case.

97
00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.879
What? You mean they're the ones

98
00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.679
who helped with the arrest back then?

99
00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:53.279
Yes, since the suspect confessed completely,

100
00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.479
we had them come in for further questioning

101
00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.879
to back up he confession.

102
00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.179
Oh, I remember!

103
00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:04.179
You're the one that was at the incident at the stadium, right?

104
00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.279
You were so awesome back then!

105
00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.379
I see.

106
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.279
The little shrimpies who were skittering here and there.

107
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.479
We weren't skittering here and there!

108
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.079
We helped with the investigation, didn't we?

109
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.579
We didn't get in your way!

110
00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:22.079
That's right!

111
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:25.079
The Youth Detective Squad is fighting in the name of justice!

112
00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.279
Is that wrong?

113
00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.579
Hey!

114
00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:28.779
True...

115
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.179
I guess we owe it to you that both cases

116
00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:34.879
at the stadium and the old blue castile were solved.

117
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.379
But, sonny, remember this.

118
00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.679
The word justice

119
00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:45.879
is not something you should go hollering around about.

120
00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.879
It's something that you keep preciously inside of you.

121
00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.579
Got my message, little detective squad?

122
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.579
Yes...

123
00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:57.279
Did I sound a bit dorky?

124
00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.979
Oh, no.

125
00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.379
Why are you here, Officer Sato?

126
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.479
Weren't you supposed to go with Inspector Megure

127
00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.679
to the Criminal Investigation Headquarters

128
00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:08.279
to work on the 200 million robbery case?

129
00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.579
I am here to check that case out.

130
00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:14.779
I got a call last night from the bank's branch manager

131
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.979
saying that he remembered something about the robbery,

132
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.879
so I am supposed to meet him here at 2:00 pm.

133
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.679
His wife is coming with him, too.

134
00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:25.079
Why are both of them coming together?

135
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:29.179
His wife was also at the bank when the robbery took place

136
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.679
and she was held at gun point.

137
00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:35.479
Maybe she recalled something that happened back then.

138
00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.379
But that's strange.

139
00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:41.679
I got similar phone call from her last night, too.

140
00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:44.279
She said that she will be coming here alone at 5:00

141
00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.779
because she had something to say about the robber.

142
00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.279
Mr. Masuo mentioned that, too.

143
00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.479
He said that

144
00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:53.879
he didn't want his wife to be attacked by the robber again,

145
00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.179
so they decided to come here together while the sun is still up.

146
00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:59.179
Oh, I see.

147
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:05.479
Did you hear anything from Yumi from the Traffic Department?

148
00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:07.979
I seem to have got drunk last night

149
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:10.279
and gave her a bad time.

150
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:12.079
But I don't remember a thing.

151
00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:15.579
Oh, no. I haven't heard a thing.

152
00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.079
Officer Takagi, hear me out, will you?

153
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.279
I got Miwako drunk and heard from her

154
00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:22.479
that she has somebody she likes

155
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:24.579
in the First Investigation Division after all!

156
00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:27.879
Maybe it's you, you know?

157
00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.079
Oh, you lover boy!

158
00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.179
Officer Sato!

159
00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.279
The branch manager of Tohto Bank is here!

160
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:42.579
Thank you for coming. This way please.

161
00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:45.179
"Keizo Masuo (53)"

162
00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:47.279
I seem to have made it in time.

163
00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.679
Huh? Wasn't your wife supposed to come here with you?

164
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.379
I had some matters to attend to at the bank,

165
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:55.879
so I'm supposed to be meeting her here.

166
00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:57.379
Isn't she here yet?

167
00:08:57.379 --> 00:08:58.379
No.

168
00:08:58.379 --> 00:08:59.979
Strange...

169
00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:02.379
I wonder if she's still asleep?

170
00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:06.379
May I borrow your phone?

171
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.679
Go ahead.

172
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:16.979
It's the third time.

173
00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:18.879
Huh? What is?

174
00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:21.579
The number of times he looked at his wristwatch.

175
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:28.379
Yes, this is the Masuo residence.

176
00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:29.979
Oh, it's you.

177
00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.779
What? You're at the police station?

178
00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:36.479
Yes, I'll put the officer on.

179
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.579
Hello, this is Officer Takagi.

180
00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:42.779
"Kayo Masuo"

181
00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:43.979
You're the officer I talked to last night.

182
00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:45.679
Officer Takagi, was it?

183
00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:49.079
Yes. You still seem to be at home...

184
00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:50.879
Is anything the matter?

185
00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:53.079
Huh? What do you mean?

186
00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:54.879
I'm supposed to meet you at 5:00, aren't I?

187
00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:59.579
Your husband says that he has changed the schedule

188
00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.879
and has decided to come here with you at 2:00 pm.

189
00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:04.479
He didn't tell me about it!

190
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.679
You haven't heard?

191
00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:07.779
Hey! Just what are you talking about?

192
00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:14.679
Give it to me!

193
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.079
Hello, Mrs. Masuo?

194
00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:18.479
Please answer me, Mrs. Masuo.

195
00:10:18.479 --> 00:10:20.479
What's the matter?

196
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.179
Officer Takagi, get the officers ready for standby!

197
00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:24.679
I'll go and get the car!

198
00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:26.879
Okay!

199
00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.379
Officers?

200
00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:30.179
The troops that are dispatched at the start of a case

201
00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:32.479
to carry out investigations.

202
00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:34.079
Isn't that right, Conan?

203
00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:36.579
Where is Conan?

204
00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:37.779
Beats me.

205
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:45.179
I wonder if my wife's okay?

206
00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:49.379
Have you noticed anything unusual happen around you recently?

207
00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:51.079
Anything unusual?

208
00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.379
Come to think of it...

209
00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:57.279
My wife said that a strange man was loitering near our house!

210
00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:00.079
There's a possibility that

211
00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:03.479
one of the robbers came to shut her up

212
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:05.479
thinking that she saw his face!

213
00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.879
No... no way!

214
00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.379
But there's still a possibility

215
00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:11.079
that she just screamed at seeing a burglar or something.

216
00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:12.279
If it were a burglar,

217
00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.679
I think she would've said

218
00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:16.579
that the phone is connected to the police!

219
00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:18.879
When did you get in?

220
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.879
What shall we do?

221
00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.379
We don't have time to take him back!

222
00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:23.679
Making sure that his wife is safe is our first priority!

223
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:25.479
Don't bite your tongue, sonny!

224
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:26.679
Huh?

225
00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:46.279
Hey, Kayo!

226
00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:49.079
Officers, please check upstairs.

227
00:11:49.079 --> 00:11:51.279
I'll go check the living room!

228
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.479
Let's go, Officer Takagi!

229
00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:53.579
Okay!

230
00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.779
The glass was cut.

231
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.879
Did someone come in from outside?

232
00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:13.879
What's the matter?

233
00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.779
Kayo...

234
00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.679
Mrs. Masuo!

235
00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:24.179
I will go get an ambulance!

236
00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:27.379
No, call the investigation squad,

237
00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:30.679
the criminal investigation officers and the coroner.

238
00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.179
She's already dead.

239
00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:34.979
No... no way.

240
00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:36.479
Will you give me the time?

241
00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:39.479
14:46, corpse is found!

242
00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.979
Who on earth would do something cruel like this?

243
00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:45.779
Did the robber back then kill her after all, officer?

244
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:47.279
Strange...

245
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.779
He should've seen the corpse of his wife

246
00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:53.579
as soon as he entered this living room door.

247
00:12:53.579 --> 00:13:00.679
But he didn't raise a voice until I went over by the window

248
00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.179
and realize that the window was cut open.

249
00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:04.979
I wonder why.

250
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.279
I wonder if you'd usually attack someone who is on the phone?

251
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:17.379
Your voice may accidentally be heard over the phone,

252
00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.679
and besides, it's more than obvious

253
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:20.179
that the person on the other side of the phone

254
00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:21.979
will rush over here.

255
00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:25.779
His incomprehensible remarks and actions

256
00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:28.179
at the police station also bother me.

257
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:32.579
Don't tell me that the person who set this murder up is...

258
00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:34.879
It can't be...

259
00:13:40.568 --> 00:13:45.268
The victim is Mrs. Kayo Masuo, age 42.

260
00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:46.368
The murder weapon

261
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.268
is the knife that is poked into the middle of her back.

262
00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:52.668
She doesn't seem to have put up a fight,

263
00:13:52.668 --> 00:13:54.968
and she probably died on the spot.

264
00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.768
The estimated time of death

265
00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:59.468
is probably just about the time she screamed.

266
00:13:59.468 --> 00:14:02.068
Officer Sato, did you hear her scream?

267
00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:04.668
The victim's husband called her from the police station

268
00:14:04.668 --> 00:14:06.868
and was talking to her.

269
00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:10.968
Then, I happened to accidentally press the monitor button.

270
00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.468
It was at that time

271
00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:17.068
that we heard her scream over the phone.

272
00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:18.868
Which means that the victim

273
00:14:18.868 --> 00:14:22.868
was attacked from behind while she was on the phone, right?

274
00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:25.768
I don't think she was only on the phone.

275
00:14:25.768 --> 00:14:27.068
-What? -What?

276
00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:31.268
She was pedalling the aero-bike while talking on the phone.

277
00:14:31.268 --> 00:14:32.268
And...

278
00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:33.568
Look!

279
00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:37.168
She's perspiring and her shirt is a little damp, too.

280
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:40.068
When people die, their body metabolism stops.

281
00:14:40.068 --> 00:14:42.468
So even if the room temperature rises, they don't perspire.

282
00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:43.868
And if they were perspiring,

283
00:14:43.868 --> 00:14:46.968
it doesn't dry up until after some time.

284
00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:50.168
Which means that she must've been doing something

285
00:14:50.168 --> 00:14:53.168
that made her perspire until she was killed, right?

286
00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:56.968
When I looked a while ago in the shoe box,

287
00:14:56.968 --> 00:14:59.668
there were no jogging shoes.

288
00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:03.768
The only thing in this house that can make a person perspire

289
00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:07.568
is the aero-bike that is near the corpse.

290
00:15:07.568 --> 00:15:09.368
Hey! You're not supposed to be fooling around

291
00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:11.568
at the crime scene.

292
00:15:11.568 --> 00:15:13.268
You're pretty good, aren't you?

293
00:15:14.568 --> 00:15:17.668
Sonny, I haven't got your name yet.

294
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:22.068
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective!

295
00:15:22.068 --> 00:15:23.968
A detective?

296
00:15:23.968 --> 00:15:27.368
He's the boy that Detective Mouri is looking after, you see.

297
00:15:27.368 --> 00:15:30.968
I see! That's why you know all these things.

298
00:15:30.968 --> 00:15:34.768
Then, sonny, be a police detective when you grow up.

299
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.368
If you're ever put on duty here,

300
00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:39.568
we'll be kind and take good care of you.

301
00:15:39.568 --> 00:15:41.668
Right, Officer Takagi?

302
00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:43.068
Yes!

303
00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:46.868
Officer Sato, we'll go ask around

304
00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:48.868
and see if there are any witnesses in the neighbourhood.

305
00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:52.768
We'll have to scrutinize inside this house, too.

306
00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:54.768
Robbery hasn't been ruled out yet either.

307
00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:55.768
Yes, madam!

308
00:15:55.768 --> 00:15:59.768
No, this is not the work of an ordinary robber.

309
00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:06.268
From my point of view, the killer

310
00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:08.668
was after Mrs. Masuo's life in the first place.

311
00:16:08.668 --> 00:16:11.268
Assistant Inspector Shiratori.

312
00:16:11.268 --> 00:16:13.268
I'm no longer assistant inspector.

313
00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:14.468
"Ninzaburo Shiratori" -I've been promoted...

314
00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:16.968
to Inspector as of today.

315
00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:20.768
So, I'm going to be taking charge of this case.

316
00:16:20.768 --> 00:16:22.168
Oh, my. How lucky.

317
00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:25.168
You guys in the career group get promoted so quickly.

318
00:16:26.268 --> 00:16:28.268
If it's okay with you, will you put me on the list

319
00:16:28.268 --> 00:16:30.368
of candidates wanting to be your future wife?

320
00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:32.268
Yes, of course. It'd be my pleasure.

321
00:16:32.268 --> 00:16:33.968
Huh?

322
00:16:33.968 --> 00:16:37.368
Don't tell me that the person Ms. Sato likes...

323
00:16:38.368 --> 00:16:40.968
is Mr. Shiratori?

324
00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.168
No good!

325
00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:47.768
What a thing to think about while still on duty!

326
00:16:47.768 --> 00:16:50.668
And do you have any proof that this is not a robbery?

327
00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:52.768
The victim screaming

328
00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:54.668
which you said you heard over the phone.

329
00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:56.368
A robber would normally

330
00:16:56.368 --> 00:16:59.868
not attack a person who is on the phone.

331
00:16:59.868 --> 00:17:02.468
And besides, if he is seen as well as screamed at,

332
00:17:02.468 --> 00:17:04.868
the more natural it would be for him to flee.

333
00:17:04.868 --> 00:17:07.468
Wasn't the victim supposed to come to the police station today

334
00:17:07.468 --> 00:17:09.868
to testify?

335
00:17:09.868 --> 00:17:14.868
Yes, she said she remembered something about the robbery,

336
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.968
so she was supposed to come to the station today with her husband.

337
00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:20.568
But since she didn't show up at the scheduled time,

338
00:17:20.568 --> 00:17:24.168
her husband got worried and called here on the phone.

339
00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:28.868
Didn't the victim say anything

340
00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:33.368
to hint that she was talking to the police?

341
00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:34.968
She did.

342
00:17:34.968 --> 00:17:36.368
When I got on the phone, she said,

343
00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:38.568
"You're the officer I talked to last night."

344
00:17:38.568 --> 00:17:40.768
Then, there is no doubt!

345
00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:45.068
The killer killed her during the phone conversation

346
00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:47.368
because he didn't want her to talk to the police.

347
00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:48.768
Wait. Do you mean that...

348
00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:53.968
Yes, the killer was probably one of the bank robbers.

349
00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:57.368
The victim was held at gun point at that time,

350
00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:00.768
and got really close to one of them.

351
00:18:00.768 --> 00:18:03.868
The robber probably thought that she had seen his face,

352
00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:07.768
and killed her to keep her from talking.

353
00:18:07.768 --> 00:18:10.668
And besides, it seems that the victim struggled viciously

354
00:18:10.668 --> 00:18:15.368
and even pulled at the mask of the robber, too.

355
00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:17.268
Yes, not being able to handle her,

356
00:18:17.268 --> 00:18:20.268
he grabbed Inspector Megure's wife who walked into the bank

357
00:18:20.268 --> 00:18:22.868
and took her hostage instead.

358
00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:27.968
Rather, it was Mrs. Megure who offered to become a hostage.

359
00:18:29.668 --> 00:18:34.968
I remember my wife saying something last night about a foreigner.

360
00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:36.068
That's it!

361
00:18:36.068 --> 00:18:38.668
Mrs. Masuo probably wanted to tell us

362
00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:41.268
about that characteristic of the robber!

363
00:18:41.268 --> 00:18:43.668
Officer Takagi! Call the Special Investigation Headquarters

364
00:18:43.668 --> 00:18:44.868
and tell them that one of the robbers

365
00:18:44.868 --> 00:18:47.068
have been specified as being a foreigner!

366
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:48.668
Oh, okay.

367
00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:50.668
But isn't it strange?

368
00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:56.568
See, the rear of the aero-bike is only two meters high.

369
00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.668
I wonder how she was attacked from behind

370
00:18:58.668 --> 00:19:00.968
while she was riding the aero-bike

371
00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:02.768
when there is no door behind her?

372
00:19:02.768 --> 00:19:04.368
So, it's you again.

373
00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:05.768
Oh, do you know him?

374
00:19:07.268 --> 00:19:08.568
Yes.

375
00:19:08.568 --> 00:19:12.368
He is the little detective who often tag along with Mr. Mouri.

376
00:19:13.368 --> 00:19:16.068
So you're quite famous, aren't you?

377
00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:22.868
What's wrong, Officer Takagi?

378
00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:24.368
No, it's nothing.

379
00:19:25.368 --> 00:19:29.268
Don't you think it's strange too, officers?

380
00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:33.268
But, sonny, just because she was stabbed in the back,

381
00:19:33.268 --> 00:19:36.168
it doesn't mean that she was attacked from behind.

382
00:19:36.168 --> 00:19:39.268
There are cases when the victim tries to run from the killer

383
00:19:39.268 --> 00:19:41.768
and gets stabbed in the back, too.

384
00:19:41.768 --> 00:19:44.168
If so, the corpse would be lying farther away

385
00:19:44.168 --> 00:19:47.068
from the aero-bike, wouldn't she?

386
00:19:47.068 --> 00:19:49.268
The phone is on the floor near her, too.

387
00:19:49.268 --> 00:19:51.168
If she fell somewhere else,

388
00:19:51.168 --> 00:19:54.868
there should be perspiration stains there, too.

389
00:19:54.868 --> 00:19:57.268
Lastly, there would be no reason for the killer

390
00:19:57.268 --> 00:20:00.368
to move her body all the way near the aero-bike, right?

391
00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:04.468
That is true.

392
00:20:04.468 --> 00:20:08.368
Mr. Masuo, did your wife always use the aero-bike?

393
00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:11.968
Yes. It was her daily routine to pedal the aero-bike

394
00:20:11.968 --> 00:20:14.468
at 2:00 pm everyday.

395
00:20:14.468 --> 00:20:15.468
I don't want to get personal,

396
00:20:15.468 --> 00:20:18.468
but what time do you both usually get up in the morning?

397
00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:20.868
Since I work at the bank,

398
00:20:20.868 --> 00:20:22.968
I leave the house in the morning.

399
00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:25.268
But since my wife has recently been going drinking

400
00:20:25.268 --> 00:20:27.768
until late at night with her friends,

401
00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:31.568
I think she always slept until noon.

402
00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:34.368
Then, the answer is quite simple.

403
00:20:34.368 --> 00:20:36.968
If my deduction is correct,

404
00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:39.868
the killer was probably...

405
00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:42.768
hiding behind this curtained bookshelf!

406
00:20:42.768 --> 00:20:44.268
What?

407
00:20:44.268 --> 00:20:47.168
Oh, how convenient.

408
00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:49.668
There are not many books in here.

409
00:20:49.668 --> 00:20:52.368
It's a great hiding place.

410
00:20:52.368 --> 00:20:54.968
What an empty bookshelf.

411
00:20:54.968 --> 00:20:57.768
The curtain of that shelf is dark beige,

412
00:20:57.768 --> 00:20:59.068
unlike the other curtains in this room.

413
00:20:59.068 --> 00:21:01.568
We just moved that shelf there

414
00:21:01.568 --> 00:21:03.668
when we redid the interior of this room.

415
00:21:03.668 --> 00:21:08.168
We were planning to change the other curtains to that color soon.

416
00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:12.068
I wonder if a person can hide in a place like that?

417
00:21:12.068 --> 00:21:14.268
If two of the shelves are removed,

418
00:21:14.268 --> 00:21:17.468
it'd easily fit an adult inside.

419
00:21:17.468 --> 00:21:20.568
In other words, this is what the killer did...

420
00:21:21.568 --> 00:21:26.568
After checking Mr. Masuo's activities beforehand,

421
00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:28.968
the killer snuck into the house right after Mr. Masuo left.

422
00:21:28.968 --> 00:21:30.668
And right before Mrs. Masuo gets up,

423
00:21:30.668 --> 00:21:33.268
he breaks into the house

424
00:21:33.268 --> 00:21:35.268
and hid behind this book shelf,

425
00:21:35.268 --> 00:21:38.468
waiting for chance to kill her.

426
00:21:38.468 --> 00:21:40.668
For the moment when she would get on the aero-bike

427
00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:43.768
and vulnerably turn her back towards him.

428
00:21:44.768 --> 00:21:48.468
But when the time finally came, his plan were foiled slightly.

429
00:21:48.468 --> 00:21:53.368
Becasue just then, she receives a call from the police.

430
00:21:53.368 --> 00:21:55.968
The killer who panicked dashed out from the bookshelf

431
00:21:55.968 --> 00:21:59.268
and carried out his plan.

432
00:21:59.268 --> 00:22:03.268
The killer got in from the window by the corridor that was cut open.

433
00:22:03.268 --> 00:22:06.068
True. Mr. Masuo had also mentioned that

434
00:22:06.068 --> 00:22:10.668
his wife said a suspicious man was loitering around their house.

435
00:22:10.668 --> 00:22:12.368
It's not strange that the killer should know

436
00:22:12.368 --> 00:22:16.568
the habits of the victim as well as the layout of the room.

437
00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:17.868
No.

438
00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:21.468
There is a big loophole in that deduction.

439
00:22:21.468 --> 00:22:24.868
I'm positive that he is the killer.

440
00:22:24.868 --> 00:22:27.768
There must be a way to kill his wife from the police station

441
00:22:27.768 --> 00:22:32.468
that is located several kilometres away.

442
00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:04.968
"Next Episode"

443
00:24:04.968 --> 00:24:07.968
There is just one person

444
00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:10.368
who can restore the bookshelf to it's original place

445
00:24:10.368 --> 00:24:13.468
and needed to use this trick.

446
00:24:15.468 --> 00:24:20.068
Don't be ridiculous! Do you have proof that I rigged it?

447
00:24:22.068 --> 00:24:23.668
What's the matter?

448
00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:27.568
It seems you poked your finger with something and got hurt.

Officer Sato, tell me it isn't true.
