1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,170
Hold it! Freeze!

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,770
Stay away!

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,870
You're not getting away!

4
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

5
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,970
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

6
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,070
Pops is full of weak points,

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,170
but they have to be overcome.

8
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,370
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:54,928
"Weak Point of the Great Detective"

12
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:57,228
"The Metropolitan Police Department"

13
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,828
"Taxi"

14
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:07,328
What? The gun disappeared?

15
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:10,128
Just what do you mean, Inspector Megure?

16
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,228
When the suspect was arrested,

17
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:16,028
he didn't have a gun, much less a knife.

18
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,328
Well... but...

19
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:20,628
Yes. It's true that he robbed the bank

20
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,028
and fired the gun.

21
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:27,428
And, it's also a fact that he fired at you, Mr. Mouri

22
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,928
who determined where he was and fled.

23
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:31,428
Which means...

24
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:34,228
He either hid it somewhere or disposed of it.

25
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:37,328
Those are the only options.

26
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,328
It's strange.

27
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:44,728
The gun wasn't found at the site of his arrest either, was it?

28
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,128
Conan.

29
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:47,128
Ran.

30
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,028
Gee, you really had me worried, Dad.

31
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:52,928
It's nothing but a scratch.

32
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,728
"Mouri Detective Agency"

33
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:26,428
He had a fear of heights to begin with,

34
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:29,228
and went through that sort of experience.

35
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,628
So it seems he's in a slight state of shock.

36
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:36,428
The doctor said that he'd be fine

37
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:39,628
if he refrains from going out for a while and rests.

38
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,428
Darn.

39
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:45,428
Two days have already gone by since then and yet.

40
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:48,628
How pathetic, for Kogoro Mouri,

41
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,928
a great detective like me.

42
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,328
Dad.

43
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:58,228
The doctor also told you to keep from drinking too, didn't he?

44
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:01,228
Shut up.

45
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,428
I know.

46
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:05,328
"Live"

47
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,728
"Taizo Sakaki (43), President of a futures group" -The bail is expensive.

48
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:11,228
If I'm innocent, the courthouse is the real scam.

49
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,128
Just kidding.

50
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:17,528
Defendant Taizo Sakaki has just been released on bail.

51
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:21,928
He will later stand trial for fraud charges of the group he leads.

52
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:41,328
That's...

53
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,028
He's been shot.

54
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,928
Defendant Sakaki's been shot.

55
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,928
-What? -No.

56
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:52,428
Darn. That gun...

57
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,928
Hello.

58
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,128
Mr. Mouri.

59
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,428
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush over to the site.

60
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:08,428
What? What did you say?

61
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,028
The gun that was used was the gun that disappeared?

62
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,328
"Beika General Hospital"

63
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:29,928
"Forensic Investigation Laboratory" -It matched. Yes.

64
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,028
It's undoubtedly the same gun.

65
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,528
"Sasaki" -Yes.

66
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,728
He's in critical condition needing to be hospitalized for a month.

67
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:40,128
But, since it was a 22 caliber of small impact,

68
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:42,128
his life is not in danger.

69
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,828
Are you really okay, Pops?

70
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:48,328
Ran's worried about you too.

71
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,628
As long as I don't climb up somewhere high, I'm just fine.

72
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,328
Rather, this is my case.

73
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,328
I'll get the gun back with my very hands.

74
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:00,228
That's fine but... to begin with...

75
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,128
Stay away!

76
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:05,028
The robber who had the gun and...

77
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,728
The person who was shot,

78
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,528
did they have any connection?

79
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,028
Connection? Why would they?

80
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:15,428
As for the gun, it was an absolute coincidence

81
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,428
that the perpetrator got hold of it.

82
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:20,128
Probably back then...

83
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,228
Wasn't any likely person there?

84
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:43,728
While you were chasing the robber?

85
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:46,428
So, in order to recall back then...

86
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:48,928
I'm here again at the site...

87
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,228
Come to think of it...

88
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,128
Hold it!

89
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,128
Excuse me.

90
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,328
I won't let you get away!

91
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,828
Don't tell me that she took the gun?

92
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,728
Do you remember her face?

93
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,828
What about her clothes or something she was holding?

94
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,428
If I remember correctly,

95
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,228
she had a tote bag

96
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,728
and a convenience store bag.

97
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:27,428
Pops, look at that.

98
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:31,628
Do you know her?

99
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:33,128
Really?

100
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,628
I think she's a regular.

101
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:36,728
What's her name?

102
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:38,228
I don't know.

103
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:42,028
Only she always comes out of that condo over there.

104
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:47,928
Pops, look.

105
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,728
This license plate...

106
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,128
It's the perpetrator's motorbike.

107
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:01,128
Room 403, is it?

108
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:04,028
All right. Found her.

109
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,828
Don't you have to call Inspector Megure?

110
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,228
I know.

111
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,828
Rather, how come you're here?

112
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:13,828
It's dangerous, so go on home already. Understand?

113
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,328
Inspector, Mouri here.

114
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,928
I'm worried about you.

115
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:20,328
Rather, did you just realize now that I was here?

116
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,728
Hey. I said it's dangerous so go home.

117
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,728
Never mind, just hurry.

118
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:37,828
Room 403 is...

119
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:41,928
You...

120
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,528
Hold it!

121
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,728
Pops.

122
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:26,928
This smell?

123
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,528
This is...

124
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,928
The perpetrator's...

125
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,828
Shoots.

126
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,695
We found the suspect.

127
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,195
Izumi Onda, age 26.

128
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:57,995
She works for a printing office nearby.

129
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,695
She seems to have been a candidate

130
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:02,995
for the Olympic Shooting sport in the past.

131
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,695
Her motive was that her father invested a large sum

132
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,095
in the futures offered by the Sakaki Group,

133
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:12,595
"Onda Machinery" -which eventually led his factory to bankruptcy.

134
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,395
He committed suicide six months ago.

135
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:18,095
Her mother also fell ill after that

136
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,695
and died as if following her husband.

137
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:21,995
And...

138
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,295
"Sasaki Group Information, Taizo Sakaki, Kohei Shibazaki, Rina Kadota"

139
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:32,395
What? She has other targets too?

140
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,095
"Sasaki Group"

141
00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:00,895
-Are we here? -Yes. Are you all right, Pops?

142
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:03,895
"Executive office"

143
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,495
Let me go.

144
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,695
Let go.

145
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,995
Let go, I said.

146
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:15,595
Mr. Shibazaki and Ms. Kadota.

147
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:16,595
"Kohei Shibazaki (35), Trader"

148
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:19,195
President Sakaki's confidants

149
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:20,795
and the ones who are rumored to be arrested of the same fraud charges

150
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,895
"Rina Kadota (32), Analyst" that he's been accused of.

151
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:25,495
Who the heck are you?

152
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,195
Just where do you think this is?

153
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,195
We're sorry to intrude on you without notice.

154
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:32,895
Did anyone come to ask you

155
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,395
of what your schedule for today is?

156
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,695
My secretary was asked that a while ago.

157
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,595
I figured it was a call from the media or something.

158
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,995
Was it from a man or a woman?

159
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:48,395
I think she said it was the voice of a young woman.

160
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,895
So, you're saying that you're going to guard us

161
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,995
since someone is after our lives?

162
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:58,795
Don't you understand?

163
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:04,495
There's no need for anything like that.

164
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,595
Mr. Mouri, Conan.

165
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:13,995
Are you all right?

166
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,695
Hold it! You...

167
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,695
Are you all right, Pops?

168
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,095
Darn.

169
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,695
Takagi, Chiba, do you know where the perpetrator is?

170
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:30,695
Our APB's haven't found her yet.

171
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:33,695
Rather, I think you should rest, Mr. Mouri.

172
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,095
We'll take care of things here.

173
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,995
If the perpetrator appears, we'll make sure she doesn't get away.

174
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,595
What is it?

175
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:44,395
Something's bothering me.

176
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:46,095
I wonder what on earth it is?

177
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,495
It's been two hours since then.

178
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,195
I wonder what the perpetrator's doing?

179
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,495
Hurry up and show up.

180
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:59,295
I wonder why she didn't target these two first?

181
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:00,295
What?

182
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,795
The perpetrator got a hold of the gun

183
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:06,195
two days before President Sakaki was released on bail, right?

184
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:09,495
Back then, the police didn't even know

185
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,495
that she was going to target these two.

186
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:15,195
Maybe she just wanted to get rid of the big shot first.

187
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,995
What? Wait a second.

188
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,195
Back then, it wasn't even known

189
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:21,095
if he was going to be released on bail or not either.

190
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,395
It's odd.

191
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,395
She hasn't even finished off the big one yet.

192
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,195
She fired an accurate warning shot but...

193
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,795
She failed to shoot down her actual target.

194
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:36,295
She was riding a motorbike then.

195
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,495
Even a candidate for the Olympics...

196
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,495
probably didn't think she'd miss either.

197
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:51,795
But it was a serious but non-fatal injury.

198
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:56,995
Would she really leave the unexpected remain the unexpected?

199
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:00,195
I get it.

200
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,395
In other words, the perpetrator asked about the schedule

201
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:06,995
to mislead us.

202
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,695
Yeah, I think you're right.

203
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,295
She's trying to distract us,

204
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:15,695
while in the meantime she finishes off her primary target.

205
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:20,095
And finish Sakaki off.

206
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:23,395
"Evacuation drill today"

207
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:28,895
"Sasaki"

208
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:34,195
Where did Mr. Sakaki go?

209
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,995
That's why we should buy now.

210
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:40,295
We'll definitely sell soon.

211
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:47,495
You...

212
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:52,895
I see, so it was you.

213
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,995
I've got to make sure to get rid of you.

214
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,595
Otherwise, nothing will begin and nothing will end.

215
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:02,395
Darn. It's not coming at all.

216
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,895
-Pops. -What?

217
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,195
"Stairs"

218
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,695
No joke?

219
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:14,395
What floor is this?

220
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:20,595
Pops, are you all right?

221
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,295
Of course I am. This is no big deal.

222
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,695
I'll go on ahead, then.

223
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:29,395
Wait! Kid! It's dangerous, let's go to...

224
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:31,695
Darn. I won't look.

225
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,595
I'm not going to look.

226
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:45,195
Pops! We can't go out from here!

227
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:47,995
What?

228
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:52,395
Why didn't you hurry up and tell me?

229
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,295
"Emergency exit" -What? That's...

230
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,095
Idiot.

231
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,495
I would never come alone.

232
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:05,995
I did it in self-defense!

233
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:07,795
Get lost!

234
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,495
Don't underestimate me.

235
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,295
I can handle heights.

236
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,095
Even if I'm scared...

237
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:22,595
I'm...

238
00:17:22,595 --> 00:17:26,595
The great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

239
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:31,795
Pops.

240
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:49,195
Pops, you did it.

241
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:03,995
Don't shoot!

242
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:06,995
Don't shoot.

243
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:09,995
Move. If you don't, I'll shoot you too.

244
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:14,895
Forget it already, Izumi.

245
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,595
Don't be ridiculous. Stop it!

246
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,595
If I can't even avenge their deaths,

247
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,995
I've no other choice than to die,

248
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,095
because I'm so worthless.

249
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,695
I finally got it...

250
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,595
why you didn't go after those two.

251
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,295
You weren't sure, were you?

252
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,995
Shoots.

253
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:57,195
Hello. Inspector, I have a favor to ask you.

254
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,995
Please hurry.

255
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,995
Rather... after he was arrested,

256
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:05,595
you had long decided against taking revenge, right?

257
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:11,995
This is my hunch as a detective but,

258
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:16,195
back then you were in shopping, weren't you, Izumi?

259
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,395
You overcame your anger and grief

260
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:21,895
and was getting back to living a normal life.

261
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:22,995
Am I wrong?

262
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:29,395
But, it's a fact that deep down you weren't sure.

263
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:33,595
That's why you happened to take the gun

264
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,595
that the robber accidentally dropped.

265
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:43,695
But, you still weren't sure.

266
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:49,595
You didn't go after those two,

267
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:52,795
but after you saw Sakaki released on bail,

268
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:55,795
your feelings of revenge built up again.

269
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,395
Even so...

270
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:59,995
why would you want to kill yourself?

271
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,195
You're unworthy?

272
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,495
Wrong.

273
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:03,795
Izumi.

274
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:07,995
Didn't you have an intimate relationship with this guy?

275
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:17,695
I'd like you to check on this once more on these lines.

276
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:20,795
I found it.

277
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:26,095
From Takagi?

278
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,695
This is...

279
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,295
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

280
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:36,895
You're absolutely correct.

281
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,995
Just because they trusted that guy

282
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,895
for being their daughter's boyfriend.

283
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,695
Dad and Mom...

284
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,295
More than anything else,

285
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:49,895
I cannot forgive myself!

286
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,295
But, if you didn't have the gun in the first place...

287
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:57,095
If only I had taken the gun back then...

288
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,595
It's my fault,

289
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,595
no matter if it was a coincidence that you ended up picking the gun up.

290
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,895
So, if you're going to shoot, shoot me!

291
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,195
Don't die!

292
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:09,795
Pops.

293
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:13,295
Thank you.

294
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:15,995
But...

295
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:17,895
It's too late.

296
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,095
Don't!

297
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:28,695
Pops!

298
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:45,995
They made it.

299
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:51,695
Later, it was decided

300
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,595
that Attorney-At-Law Kisaki would serve as Izumi's lawyer.

301
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:56,495
As for the group that committed fraud,

302
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:58,695
a new evidence was found

303
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,395
and another investigation was started.

304
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,695
"Sasaki Group Representitive Re-arrested, Two Employees Were Also Arrested"

305
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:25,695
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I did it!

306
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,395
Completely recovered!

307
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,595
I guess I'm still not completely cured.

308
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,995
Rather, you're just drinking too much.

309
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,295
Gee. I tell you, Dad.

310
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,895
"Next Episode" -Room 901, right?

311
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,195
Yeah, the floor on the very top.

312
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:01,395
You snuck into the car, didn't you, glasses kid?

313
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,095
Die!

314
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:09,595
I did it.

315
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:15,895
Mr. Takarada?

316
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:19,095
Yeah. He asked for it.

317
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,695
Next Conan,

318
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:24,295
"The Man Who Died Twice (Part 1)"

319
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:27,038
Next Conan's Hint:

320
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,338
"Warning note"

321
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:30,838
-It's show time for me in the next episode. -Why's that?

322
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,838
Like they say (007)00 Kogoro dies twice.

323
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,938
I don't understand.
