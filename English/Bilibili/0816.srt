1
00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:06.662
"Susan Trummelperman (22), Arisa Nakashima (23), Office Worker"

2
00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:20.462
We are extraterrestrials (ET).

3
00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.362
In memory of this encounter,

4
00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.562
if you would take a picture of me with you

5
00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:30.562
and publicize it, I wouldn't be happier.

6
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.962
He's tapping under his chin just as promised to.

7
00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:38.162
He says "we" but he's alone.

8
00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.262
This is hilarious!

9
00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.162
Okay, stand side by side!

10
00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:50.462
We are ET.

11
00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:52.562
Cool!

12
00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.362
It's an ET!

13
00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.262
It's an ET! Help!

14
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.562
-What? -He fell!

15
00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:07.862
Ambulance!

16
00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:09.362
Are you all right?

17
00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:10.862
"Yasuo Hanzaki (42)" -Hey, are you all right?

18
00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.062
Get a hold of yourself! Are you all right?

19
00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:14.962
Are you all right? Hey!

20
00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:16.162
-No way. -No way.

21
00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:20.762
No...

22
00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:24.462
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

23
00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.562
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

24
00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:30.162
The sudden appearance of an ET leads to an unexpected case.

25
00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:31.762
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:33.562
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult

27
00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:35.962
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:27.133
"A Disappointing And Kind ET"

29
00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.633
I doubt he has common sense.

30
00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.233
To lead somebody to die by mimicking an ET.

31
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:36.233
What a hopeless adult.

32
00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:39.133
You can say that again. I wonder what he's thinking.

33
00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:40.833
Wrong.

34
00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.633
Don't talk bad about Mr. Takedera.

35
00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:47.133
"Kota Matsumoto (6)" -It's my fault. I'm sure.

36
00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.133
Who are you?

37
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:51.833
I'm Kota Matsumoto.

38
00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.733
What do you mean it's your fault?

39
00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.933
Mr. Takedera always plays with us

40
00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.233
at the recreation center on his day off.

41
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.333
So, the ET came to earth not to invade us

42
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.633
but because he wanted to be friends with us.

43
00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.333
"Hitoshi Takedera (26)" -They want to be friends with earth people, right?

44
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.833
Yes. That's why earth people should...

45
00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.233
He's lying again.

46
00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:19.533
There's no such thing as an ET, right?

47
00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.733
There is! My father who died told me so!

48
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.733
So, maybe...

49
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.433
I see.

50
00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:39.433
They wanted eye-witnesses to cause a rumor.

51
00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:40.833
Yes.

52
00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.933
He wasn't a hopeless adult, was he?

53
00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:46.533
He was a kind good person.

54
00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:49.233
I'm sorry for talking bad about him.

55
00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:52.733
But he did cause an accident after all.

56
00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:55.233
I'll bet he'll regret it for the rest of his life.

57
00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.933
What'll happen to Mr. Takedera?

58
00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:09.533
Hey, miss.

59
00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:14.033
Are you the ones that were together when the accident happened yesterday?

60
00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:15.333
Yes.

61
00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.933
You are?

62
00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.933
I'm Mr. Takedera's friend.

63
00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:21.433
I see.

64
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:24.033
May I ask you about last night?

65
00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:27.433
Sure or would you like to take a look at this instead?

66
00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:28.533
What?

67
00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:34.033
Is this the ET?

68
00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.133
And this video too.

69
00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:38.133
It's an ET!

70
00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:42.833
It's an ET! Help!

71
00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:51.533
May I see that picture again?

72
00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:52.933
Yep.

73
00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.233
Do you think this ET can scare anybody?

74
00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:59.433
It looks no better than a Halloween costume to me.

75
00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:04.933
We only found out that he was an ET because he claimed to be one, right?

76
00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:08.833
He said "We are ET".

77
00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.933
I'm sure.

78
00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:14.933
But Mr. Hanzaki who died...

79
00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:20.933
came down from above and just about here on the street below,

80
00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:23.933
he saw the ET that appeared so he was surprised,

81
00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.633
tried to flee then he fell.

82
00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:34.133
But how did Mr. Hanzaki know it was an ET?

83
00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.433
Because he said so, right?

84
00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:40.533
He said "We are ET".

85
00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:45.733
Do you think he could hear in a voice like that, all the way over here?

86
00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:47.733
True, it's strange.

87
00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:48.933
And while I'm at it,

88
00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:50.733
I wonder why that man called Hanzaki

89
00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:53.933
was in a place like this at that time?

90
00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:56.933
He couldn't have come to the temple to pray.

91
00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.433
It's been long abandoned.

92
00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:03.033
There must be something behind what happened last night.

93
00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:05.533
I don't think that it was just an unfortunate accident.

94
00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:09.133
-I guess it's show time for us! -Yep!

95
00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:12.433
First of all, we've gotta check on the man called Hanzaki.

96
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:15.233
Who are you guys anyway?

97
00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:16.233
We are...

98
00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:17.533
Together the five of us...

99
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:19.933
The Youth Detective Squad!

100
00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.233
You mean Hanzaki who lives next door?

101
00:07:26.233 --> 00:07:28.933
Yep, we asked the person below

102
00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:32.533
and was told that you were good friends with him.

103
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:35.833
We were both unemployed and had a lot of time on our hands.

104
00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.933
What kind of person was he?

105
00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:39.733
"Tsuneyuki Tamai (40)" -An unlucky guy.

106
00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:43.433
He was laid off from the factory where he worked six months ago.

107
00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:45.833
Even last night, he was supposed get a hold of some cash and yet...

108
00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.133
Oh, bummers.

109
00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:51.333
What do you mean?

110
00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:54.733
Well, who cares? You're only kids.

111
00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:59.533
I think he was blackmailing somebody to raise money for making a living.

112
00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:00.833
What?

113
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:03.433
Blackmail, is it?

114
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:05.033
Yeah. And even last night,

115
00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.233
it seems he was called out by the other party,

116
00:08:07.233 --> 00:08:09.033
saying that he'd be given money.

117
00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:16.433
That's why he went to Beimyoji?

118
00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:19.433
And Mr. Hanzaki died.

119
00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:22.933
So, X who was being blackmailed must've been relieved.

120
00:08:22.933 --> 00:08:26.833
Does it mean that X killed Mr. Hanzaki?

121
00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:30.133
Who was the person being blackmailed?

122
00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:32.133
How would I know?

123
00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:34.033
We can go check if you like.

124
00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:38.033
Because he never locks his room anyway.

125
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:39.033
-What? -What?

126
00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:41.133
He doesn't lock the door?

127
00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:44.833
No. He said there's nothing inside for anybody to steal.

128
00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:49.733
There's no clue to X.

129
00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:53.633
Geez, this room sure smells of cigarettes.

130
00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:56.533
Well, he was a heavy smoker after all.

131
00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:59.033
I wonder what characters they are? There are so many of them.

132
00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:00.933
Giveaways from the karaoke shop.

133
00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:02.933
He used to frequent the shop.

134
00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.333
"Medicine"

135
00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:13.233
The guy he was blackmailing could've been from the factory.

136
00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:15.933
I think it was last month, he...

137
00:09:15.933 --> 00:09:19.633
I'd rather work than going on blackmailing on and off.

138
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:22.533
Please work something out so that I can go back to work again.

139
00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:26.333
If you help me, I'll forget about the incident.

140
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:31.333
You mean he wanted to be re-hired at the factory that laid him off?

141
00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:32.933
Probably.

142
00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:35.533
If the person had the power to do so...

143
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.333
He could've been a previous boss at the factory.

144
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:39.433
What?

145
00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:43.233
Did Mr. Hanzaki work at Sanko Heavy Industries

146
00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:45.433
It's a super top rate company!

147
00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:47.333
No way.

148
00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:49.033
Hanzaki was working at a subcontractor company

149
00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:52.133
for Sanko Heavy Industries.

150
00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:58.733
-I'd like to go check out the identity of X, -I feel refreshed.

151
00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:01.933
but the factory's closed on Sundays.

152
00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:04.233
Let's check on something else.

153
00:10:04.233 --> 00:10:08.733
I've something that I'd like to confirm directly from him about the ET too.

154
00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:18.933
"Beika Police Station"

155
00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.933
I know you want to do it for Kota

156
00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:29.733
but how did you come about the idea of wanting to become an ET?

157
00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:32.733
It's not me who came up with the idea.

158
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:37.533
I discussed it over with my friend

159
00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:40.333
who was in the children's literature club with me in my university days,

160
00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:43.633
called Akira Omi.

161
00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:45.633
He's a good boy with a pure heart.

162
00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:49.933
Then, why don't you become an ET?

163
00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.133
And then you should be witnessed by somebody,

164
00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:56.133
take pictures with that person and gain publicity,

165
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:58.733
making everybody think that ET existed after all!

166
00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:00.133
Sounds good!

167
00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:01.533
"Akira Omi (26)" -The sooner the better.

168
00:11:01.533 --> 00:11:03.333
Let's get to it tomorrow.

169
00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:04.933
Okay!

170
00:11:04.933 --> 00:11:08.033
I'm glad I discussed with you, Omi.

171
00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:11.133
I just jumped at his suggestion.

172
00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:15.533
That Mr. Omi really thinks up interesting things, doesn't he?

173
00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:17.433
I acted out a play

174
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:20.533
in which we both played the role of ET too.

175
00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:26.333
We are ET.

176
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:30.333
That outfit was one that we made back then.

177
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.833
That's why it looked so dorky.

178
00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:35.133
It was made for children to begin with after all.

179
00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:39.633
In order not to scare them.

180
00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:41.233
I'm sure that Omi is concerned

181
00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.433
about the incident that happened last night.

182
00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.333
Because he was the one that suggested that around 8 pm

183
00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.733
would be a good time to make an appearance too.

184
00:11:51.433 --> 00:11:53.933
He also told me that site had the atmosphere and setting

185
00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:56.433
that fit the situation.

186
00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.533
But, that all turned out for the worst.

187
00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.333
I'd like to confirm once again.

188
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:06.433
Your friend Omi was the one who suggested that

189
00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:12.333
the ET should appear below the steps of Beimyoji at 8 last night?

190
00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:13.533
Yeah.

191
00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:17.033
Omi knows that area well.

192
00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:19.033
He used to live there

193
00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:22.933
until he was hired at Sanko Heavy Industries and entered their dorm.

194
00:12:22.933 --> 00:12:24.733
Sanko Heavy Industries?

195
00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.633
Can we see Mr. Omi if we go to that employees' dorm?

196
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:33.633
He was saying that he goes to the gym on his days off.

197
00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:35.733
Why do you want to go see him?

198
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.500
"Sanko Heavy Industries Beika Dorm"

199
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.500
It seems that Mr. Omi went out around 7:30 last night.

200
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.000
If from here, it takes about 20 minutes to get to Beimyoji

201
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
He'll make it way in time for the appearance of the ET at 8 pm, won't he?

202
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.100
He seems to be in the production administration division.

203
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.300
Moreover, he seems to be the adjustor for subcontracting companies.

204
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.700
Therefore, he also has a say in the hiring of workers.

205
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.200
So, X is Akira Omi.

206
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.100
It's natural for him to have some kind of connection with Mr. Hanzaki.

207
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.700
It's possible that he was blackmailed

208
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.400
because Mr. Hanzaki had something on him.

209
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.800
But, there's one thing I can't figure out.

210
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.700
What one thing?

211
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.100
There's no doubt about anything anymore, is there?

212
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.200
Lying that he would pay cash,

213
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.400
Mr. Omi tells Mr. Hanzaki to come to Beimyoji at 8 pm last night.

214
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.900
Then, he lures Mr. Hanzaki into going down the steps together with him.

215
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.400
Hey, that's an ET!

216
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.100
What?

217
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.500
He makes Mr. Hanzaki witness the ET that he made Mr. Takedera act out.

218
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.300
Run for it, or he'll get you!

219
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.600
It's an ET! Help!

220
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.000
He surprised him, got him to panic

221
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.300
and contrived it so that he would fall down the steps!

222
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.500
That would explain why that man called Hanzaki saw it

223
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.100
and thought it was an ET.

224
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.600
Because Mr. Omi, who was with him, said so.

225
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.900
In other words, this was a planned murder schemed by Mr. Omi,

226
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.200
who wanted to shut blackmailer, Mr. Hanzaki up for good.

227
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.800
But...

228
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a gamble whether he would panic or not.

229
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.500
Or rather, do you think that an adult would be surprised over

230
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.600
such a dorky character to begin with?

231
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.400
-True. -Right.

232
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.500
But, it's probably true that he was surprised too.

233
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.700
Because he screamed.

234
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.800
That's the part I don't understand.

235
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.600
There's no reason why he'd be surprised, and yet...

236
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.500
That's where I sense Mr. Omi's undesirable intention.

237
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.600
I'd never be able to understand something as difficult as that.

238
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.300
-Genta! -Genta!

239
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.300
Are you all right?

240
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.100
"Beika Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic"

241
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.500
"Medicine"

242
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.700
Maybe.

243
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.000
"Beika Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic"

244
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Bull's eye!

245
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.600
Now we can corner the perpetrator.

246
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.900
He left the concrete evidence behind for us too.

247
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.900
But only if his next door neighbor told us about it,

248
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.100
we would've figured out how the perpetrator did it even faster.

249
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.900
I'm sure he knew, right? About Mr. Hanzaki.

250
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900
I don't think so,

251
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.000
because they didn't say that he screamed even on the news.

252
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.300
But when I borrowed the restroom at his house, I told him, you know.

253
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.200
In a loud voice, "It's an ET! Help!"

254
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.600
So, I'm sure that back then he already realized something wasn't right.

255
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.800
This is bad!

256
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.800
I don't know what the heck you're talking about.

257
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.500
Okay, then I'll just go tell the police about it.

258
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.700
Don't.

259
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.800
Cut it out, stupid!

260
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.600
People will think that you came back to the crime scene

261
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.000
and fell off the steps by accident, the stupid perpetrator!

262
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.000
We won't let you do anymore than you already did!

263
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.200
You realized that this was a homicide when you heard my story, right?

264
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.900
And, you followed us to get an idea of who the perpetrator was...

265
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.400
You tried to blackmail him, right?

266
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.100
I'm unemployed so I just got the urge.

267
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.700
And if you're almost killed just because of that, it's not worth it.

268
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.200
You're right.

269
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.700
What did you guys want with me?

270
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.300
Omi?

271
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.900
Why are you here?

272
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.700
I was called by these children of the Youth Detective Squad.

273
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.200
The Detective Squad?

274
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.600
You were acquainted with Mr. Hanzaki, who died, right?

275
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.900
You worked together, didn't you?

276
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.600
Is that right?

277
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.300
Mr. Omi who was being blackmailed by Mr. Hanzaki

278
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.400
succeeded in shutting him up.

279
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.500
What?

280
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.100
Excuse me?

281
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.600
As proof of that he even tried to kill me, who found out about it.

282
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.600
What?

283
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.200
I was just trying to give him a taste of his own medicine

284
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.400
because he was being unreasonable.

285
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.000
There's no way I would seriously try to kill him, right?

286
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.600
You were dead serious! You think so too, right?

287
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.400
Be quiet, will you?

288
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.000
You were saved after all,

289
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.900
so why don't you scoot off to a doctor or something already?

290
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.400
You're right.

291
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
He died last night of an accident. Right?

292
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.400
Because he was surprised by my ET disguise.

293
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.800
The women who witnessed it together also testified to it.

294
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.600
But Mr. Takedera...

295
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.800
Nobody would think that you in that outfit would be a real ET.

296
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.500
So long as you don't say so yourself.

297
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.600
"We are ET".

298
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.300
But, Mr. Hanzaki couldn't have heard your voice from here.

299
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.700
There are only four people in this world

300
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.800
who could identify that as an ET.

301
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.200
Mr. Takedera who acted it out,

302
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.700
the two who were nearby and heard him identify himself

303
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.200
and Mr. Omi who was the one who suggested it to begin with.

304
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.100
But, it can't be helped because that man called Hanzaki also thought so.

305
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.600
That's why he was surprised and screamed.

306
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.700
That doesn't work out.

307
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.100
Your reasoning is reckless.

308
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.000
Nobody but the person himself would know how he feels at seeing something.

309
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.200
Mr. Hanzaki had a sore throat.

310
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.900
A while ago, the next door neighbor

311
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.100
as well as Mr. Hanzaki himself

312
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.200
thought that he had a cold at first

313
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200
but it turned out that because he used his throat too much.

314
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.900
He had acute chorditis.

315
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.900
He wasn't even able to talk normally.

316
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.600
There's no way he could've screamed!

317
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.300
Then, what was that scream that we heard?

318
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.700
That would be the man who knew that Mr. Takedera was acting as the ET,

319
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.100
as well as the one who was here together with Mr. Hanzaki.

320
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.600
Mr. Akira Omi! None other than you, right?

321
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.800
You...

322
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.800
Last night Mr. Omi called Mr. Hanzaki out here.

323
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.400
You passed him out and then waited for Mr. Takedera to act out the ET.

324
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.200
It's an ET!

325
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.600
It's an ET! Help!

326
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.100
You pushed Mr. Hanzaki down and killed him.

327
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.700
By making it look as if he was surprised by the ET and fell by accident.

328
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.900
It was not good just to make it look as if he fell and died,

329
00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.000
because that may call upon a thorough investigation for murder.

330
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.600
In order to make it look like an accidental fall,

331
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.400
you needed Mr. Takedera and the other witnesses to testify for you.

332
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.700
Isn't that right, Mr. Omi?

333
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.100
Omi, don't tell me that you...

334
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.300
They're just imagining things.

335
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.500
You know how imaginative children can be, don't you?

336
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.700
It seems you don't know anything about the concrete evidence.

337
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.200
The women who encounter Mr. Takedera last night

338
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.700
took a video of the scene back then.

339
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.600
If we do a voice analysis of the scream,

340
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.000
it'll be easy to tell whose voice it was.

341
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.400
I didn't know he had vocal chord problems.

342
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.400
I like the money too,

343
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.800
but please work it out so that I can go back to the factory, Mr. Omi.

344
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.500
That hateful hoarse voice...

345
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.100
I thought it was an act to scare me.

346
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.300
Then, don't tell me that you, Omi...

347
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.800
You did it, after all.

348
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.800
Hanzaki, who knew me, saw me when I was tempted to shoplift

349
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.900
and went through with it, at a convenience store.

350
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.600
For I, who work at the great Sanko Heavy Industries,

351
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.000
just merely shoplifting means I could be in serious trouble.

352
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.900
Just when I was thinking of how to shut him up,

353
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.500
you came to discuss your problem over with me.

354
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.600
So I came upon the idea.

355
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.000
This guy who was satisfied just working for a third rate company

356
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.400
and was still seriously taking on kids.

357
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400
What a happy-go-lucky idiot.

358
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.200
That's why I decided to take advantage of you.

359
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.500
What do you mean by "Happy-go-lucky idiot"?

360
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.100
He also said mere shoplifting.

361
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.900
Why don't you tell him, Tsuburaya?

362
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.600
Yes. Mr. Akira Omi!

363
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.200
You're a hopeless adult.

364
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.900
We are ET.

365
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.200
Really, you don't look at all like an ET.

366
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.300
You think so.

367
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.500
Real ET look more awesome, don't they?

368
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.000
Yep.

369
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I mean, if they exist, that is...

370
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.200
Yes, that's true.

371
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.000
They're more good looking them him.

372
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
-I'm sure. -Yes...

373
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.700
-Yeah. -Right?

374
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.400
Would an ET call himself an ET?

375
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.900
"Next Episode" -She said that the movers would be coming to get her things.

376
00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.500
They took all her things with them.

377
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.500
I'm Detective Mouri.

378
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.000
A detective?

379
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.500
I'd like to ask you something about Ms. Motoko Kawaguchi.

380
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.400
Terakado was having a tough time with that person called Kawaguchi.

381
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.600
I've figured it out, all of it!

382
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.500
Next Conan, "The Fiancee who Disappeared"

383
00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:23.843
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:24:23.843 --> 00:24:26.443
"Cufflinks"

385
00:24:26.443 --> 00:24:28.543
Ran sure has it tough with each movie, doesn't she?

386
00:24:28.543 --> 00:24:30.543
Neither do you. Wait! Neither do I!
