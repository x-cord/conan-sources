1
00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.003
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.413
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:12.913
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.863
Today's case involves a missing corpse!

5
00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:18.473
Even if you do deceive everybody,
there's still always only one truth!

6
00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:55.865
The Missing Corpse Murder.

7
00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:09.735
Sure is quiet around here lately...

8
00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:14.465
The Junior Detective League can't
do anything if nobody needs help...

9
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:17.115
Of course not.

10
00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:20.835
If clients showed up that easily,
we detectives would be worry-free.

11
00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.865
And Professor Agasa went through
the trouble of making badges for us...

12
00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:27.325
They look cool no matter
how many times I look at them!

13
00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:31.425
Detective Boys... The Junior
Detective League's exclusive design!

14
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:33.135
They even act as transceivers!

15
00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:36.615
Bah! These badges are worthless
if we have no cases to solve--

16
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.975
Excuse me...

17
00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:41.395
I have a small request for you...

18
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:44.615
You're Hiroki,
from the next classroom over!

19
00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.375
What is it? A murder?!

20
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.275
Fraud?!

21
00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:49.835
Your parents are having an affair?!

22
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:55.045
No... Akira disappeared last night...

23
00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:55.325
A missing persons case!

24
00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:58.015
A missing persons case!
A missing persons case!

25
00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:02.085
Kidnapping isn't out of the question!

26
00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.625
So what does she look like?!

27
00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.795
I have a picture of her. Here.

28
00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:09.835
A cat?!

29
00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:14.465
Are you saying it was
this cat that disappeared?

30
00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:15.095
Yes.

31
00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.295
Too bad it wasn't a kidnapping!

32
00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:21.195
I can pay you each 10 yen.

33
00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:22.125
10 yen?!

34
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:26.305
No way! We only handle
higher-level cases!

35
00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.125
I'm sure the cat will
come back eventually!

36
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.795
But...

37
00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:32.965
Bye now.

38
00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:39.245
I was going to give you some
Masked Yaiba cards if you found her...

39
00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:43.625
See! I collect them!

40
00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.295
Masked Yaiba cards?!

41
00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:49.925
What's more, these are the super rare...

42
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.515
...Hyper Golden Cards!

43
00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:54.365
We accept the case!
We accept the case!

44
00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:54.905
Eh?!

45
00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:58.235
What's with you guys?!

46
00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:17.455
Darn it, we can't find her anywhere...

47
00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:24.165
That's strange... She disappeared yesterday,
so she should still be nearby...

48
00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:28.755
Hey. We worked really hard,
so give us our cards now.

49
00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:31.965
No way. You didn't find her.

50
00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:35.925
Say, does this cat have any habits
or special abilities or anything?

51
00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:42.585
Now that you mention it, Akira's meow
is a lot different than other cats'.

52
00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:45.835
Like this...

53
00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:48.775
Yes! Just like that!

54
00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:50.455
Where did it come from?!

55
00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:52.105
From that house!

56
00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.945
Akira! Akira!

57
00:04:58.835 --> 00:04:59.715
Akira!

58
00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:00.635
We did it!
We did it!

59
00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:11.775
She's covered in blood!

60
00:05:11.775 --> 00:05:13.005
We have to help her right away!

61
00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:17.625
No! This cat is uninjured!

62
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.375
Which means...

63
00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.225
It couldn't be!

64
00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:24.155
Wait for us, Conan! What's going on?!

65
00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:29.755
Is there something there?

66
00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:30.665
Let me see too!

67
00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:31.405
Me too!

68
00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:50.945
I have to call the police right away!

69
00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.965
Are you the ones who made the call?

70
00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:01.255
Did you really see a corpse?

71
00:06:01.255 --> 00:06:01.755
Yes!

72
00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:02.755
Honest!

73
00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:04.735
There's no question
about it, Inspector.

74
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.585
Conan-kun!

75
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:11.175
Plus, nobody has left the house
since we discovered the body.

76
00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:16.545
In other words,
the corpse is still inside!

77
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.705
Police! Open up!

78
00:06:23.045 --> 00:06:24.665
What's the racket?!

79
00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:29.925
These kids say they saw
a dead body in your house.

80
00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:30.965
A dead body?!

81
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:32.965
We're certain we saw it!

82
00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:34.625
A man in the bathroom!

83
00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.425
He was lying in the bathtub,
covered in blood!

84
00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:41.755
Ridiculous! I was just taking a bath!

85
00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:44.135
See for yourself!
It's that room straight ahead!

86
00:06:44.465 --> 00:06:46.705
I think I'll do just that.

87
00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:47.575
Hey!

88
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:53.845
It's gone! The body is gone!

89
00:06:53.845 --> 00:06:55.525
It disappeared!

90
00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:56.785
That's impossible!

91
00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:03.075
See! No corpses! These brats are
probably just pulling a prank on you!

92
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.755
But we really saw it!

93
00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:08.425
There was a dead body, covered in blood
and lying in the bathroom!

94
00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:10.085
Yeah!

95
00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:12.295
This guy must've hidden it!

96
00:07:12.295 --> 00:07:13.755
What?!

97
00:07:15.755 --> 00:07:20.335
Approximately 15 minutes have passed
from the time you called us

98
00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:22.335
until we arrived here.

99
00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:24.765
That's more than enough
time to hide a body.

100
00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:27.175
This is ridiculous!

101
00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:30.955
Search all you want!
I'm going upstairs to sleep!

102
00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:34.295
You don't mind if we
search without you then?

103
00:07:34.295 --> 00:07:35.755
Fine by me!

104
00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.295
Ransack the place if you want,
there's nothing to find!

105
00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:42.165
If you have any problems,
tell my brother. He'll be home soon!

106
00:07:43.425 --> 00:07:45.925
But the police must be bored to death

107
00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:48.325
if they'll make a fuss over a
bunch of deviant little miscreants!

108
00:07:54.085 --> 00:07:55.835
Bah!

109
00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:59.505
Search! The body's here somewhere!

110
00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:00.925
Search every nook and cranny!

111
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:03.795
Find the body at all costs!

112
00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:08.305
Um...

113
00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:11.265
Did something happen here?

114
00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:13.085
Inspector!

115
00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:15.375
The younger brother has returned.

116
00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:19.505
W-What is this...? What's going on?!

117
00:08:19.505 --> 00:08:23.375
This lad here says he saw
a corpse in your house.

118
00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:25.525
A corpse?!

119
00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.315
Whoops!

120
00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:33.255
What are you doing?!

121
00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:36.295
No, that's alright!
It wasn't worth much...

122
00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:39.755
Hey! Keep it down, will you?!

123
00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:43.835
I take it my brother is upstairs?

124
00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:46.725
Yes. He seems rather angry, too.

125
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:51.585
Pardon my rudeness, but what exactly
does your brother do for a living?

126
00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:53.925
He's a writer, for the time being.

127
00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:57.625
But in reality, he usually stays
at home and does nothing at all...

128
00:08:57.625 --> 00:09:00.925
Here's my card...

129
00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.715
Tanaka Tomofumi...

130
00:09:03.715 --> 00:09:06.255
I see you work for a securities firm...

131
00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:08.905
So just you and your brother live here?

132
00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:10.175
That's right.

133
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.705
Though technically it's my house.
My brother lives here for free.

134
00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:17.455
What's this?

135
00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:19.195
A leaf?

136
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:25.005
Well, we've checked the house
from top to bottom...

137
00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.255
All that's left is your brother's room.

138
00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.725
Yes. I hope he doesn't
get too mad at you...

139
00:09:32.715 --> 00:09:34.925
Brother...?

140
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:35.575
Brother?

141
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:42.465
...the high pressure ridge will
bring clear skies to most of Japan.

142
00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.755
It's alright. It looks like he's asleep.

143
00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:45.985
I see.

144
00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:51.175
...showers starting at around 1 o'clock.

145
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.675
The rain may remain heavy until evening.

146
00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:56.585
Oh? There's a large tree in the backyard.

147
00:09:57.105 --> 00:09:58.085
What can you tell me about it?

148
00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:00.325
Tanaka-san?

149
00:10:01.295 --> 00:10:05.545
Come on! If you're going to sleep,
at least turn the TV off!

150
00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:08.745
It sounds like he heard me...

151
00:10:08.745 --> 00:10:11.635
I believe I've shown you
everything I can...

152
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.375
And no dead bodies whatsoever...

153
00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:16.455
You little scoundrels!

154
00:10:16.455 --> 00:10:19.585
We're not lying!

155
00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:24.065
Say, the body could've been
carried outside by now!

156
00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:28.375
But Conan-kun...

157
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:34.465
Didn't you say no one entered or
left this house before we arrived?

158
00:10:35.875 --> 00:10:37.675
That's what I said,

159
00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:41.125
but I only watched from the
phone booth in front of the house.

160
00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.295
I didn't see the backyard.

161
00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:47.295
But there's a high wall behind the house.

162
00:10:47.715 --> 00:10:50.215
But you saw that big tree, right?

163
00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:53.175
If you tied a body to yourself
and used that tree,

164
00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:54.125
you could get over the wall!

165
00:10:55.835 --> 00:10:57.625
Tanaka residence!

166
00:10:57.625 --> 00:10:58.215
Yes?

167
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:01.545
No, you must have the wrong number.

168
00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:03.625
That's okay!

169
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:04.165
Goodbye!

170
00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:10.045
Wrong number. So what were
we talking about again?

171
00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.755
The tree in the back.

172
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:15.275
Ah, that was originally there
when I bought the place.

173
00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:18.325
Was the ringer off on that phone?!

174
00:11:19.715 --> 00:11:21.675
Hey! Are you alright up there?!

175
00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:22.755
Y-Yes, sir!

176
00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:24.685
Can you climb over it
with someone tied to you?

177
00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:26.925
I think I can...

178
00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:31.755
I can't, Inspector!

179
00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:34.265
I can't get down. The outer side
of the wall is an embankment!

180
00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:37.365
Are there any footholds
or anything of the sort?

181
00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:40.105
There's a walkway
about 40 centimeters wide,

182
00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:41.935
but it would be impossible
to use with a body tied to me!

183
00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:46.175
Even if I could get down, it would
take everything I had just to walk.

184
00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:49.755
There's no corpse inside the house,

185
00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:51.715
and it's impossible to carry one outside!

186
00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:54.445
In other words, you lied.

187
00:11:55.045 --> 00:11:56.115
You can't be serious!?

188
00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:57.915
Let's go, everyone!

189
00:11:57.915 --> 00:11:59.375
Wait, Inspector!

190
00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:00.925
We really saw it!

191
00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:05.045
Even if you did catch that
gang of Italian thieves,

192
00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:07.125
it was still stupid of me to trust you!

193
00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:20.175
How?

194
00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:22.215
How could the body have vanished?

195
00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:28.465
All I can think of at this point is that
the older brother washed the blood off

196
00:12:28.465 --> 00:12:32.275
while the younger brother made
preparations to carry the body out.

197
00:12:40.085 --> 00:12:43.505
It's just like the leaf that
was on the younger brother...

198
00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:47.485
Does this mean that they really did
use this tree to get the body outside?

199
00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:53.145
Oh! Conan-kun!

200
00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:54.625
Hey there!

201
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:56.595
What're you doing here?
Are you stupid?!

202
00:12:56.595 --> 00:12:57.625
You idiot!

203
00:12:57.625 --> 00:13:00.935
We can't let them call our
detective club a bunch of liars!

204
00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:03.285
These guys can be such a pain...

205
00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.775
Oh no! Hide!

206
00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:07.685
Did they see us?

207
00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:11.795
That scary man's still sleeping there!

208
00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:13.925
Now what do we do?

209
00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:17.545
Jeez, he should at least close
the curtain or something...

210
00:13:17.545 --> 00:13:21.505
And doesn't he ever get
tired sleeping like that?!

211
00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:23.125
Wait a second!

212
00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:27.295
Have I been looking at this
the wrong way the whole time?!

213
00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:41.095
Conan-kun!

214
00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:42.665
What's going on?!

215
00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:49.305
I might've figured out the trick
the killer used to hide the body!

216
00:13:50.755 --> 00:13:54.715
Wait here. I'm going inside
to see if I'm right.

217
00:13:54.715 --> 00:13:56.845
Okay! We'll help too!

218
00:13:57.215 --> 00:14:01.635
No! There may be a killer inside!

219
00:14:01.635 --> 00:14:04.855
You guys go wait by
the phone booth outside!

220
00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:06.915
I'll contact you if I find the body!

221
00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.595
If I do, it's your job to
contact the police right away!

222
00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.335
He locked it!

223
00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:18.305
Now for the room upstairs!

224
00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:23.885
This isn't good--he's still awake!

225
00:14:23.885 --> 00:14:25.265
What did he put down?!

226
00:14:30.095 --> 00:14:31.815
A cell phone...

227
00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:35.955
That's it! That trick
could work if you used this!

228
00:14:37.595 --> 00:14:39.825
I've got most of
this case figured out now!

229
00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.865
Conan sure is taking a long time...

230
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:43.465
Yeah...

231
00:14:44.305 --> 00:14:48.095
He said he'd contact us
using these miniature transceivers

232
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.455
if he found the body...

233
00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:52.885
What if he's actually trying to
take all the credit for himself?!

234
00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:54.755
Conan-kun would never
do something like that!

235
00:15:02.675 --> 00:15:03.885
This is the room!

236
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:10.155
I see! So I was right!

237
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:15.665
There's an answering machine
and a VCR in this room!

238
00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:18.125
Uh oh!

239
00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:23.215
That's odd...

240
00:15:23.215 --> 00:15:27.175
I thought I heard something in here.
Must've been my imagination...

241
00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.845
Hey, what's taking so long,
Conan? What're you doing?!

242
00:15:31.215 --> 00:15:34.845
Who's there?!

243
00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:36.085
Oh no!

244
00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:37.505
It sounds like he's been spotted!

245
00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.755
Get out of there, Conan-kun!

246
00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:41.255
There's no use in hiding!

247
00:15:41.255 --> 00:15:43.485
Give yourself up and come out!

248
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:48.805
Dammit! I guess I have no choice now
but to leave my transmitter on!

249
00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:51.395
You're the one who should
give yourself up, Tanaka-san!

250
00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.585
Neither we nor the police
could find the corpse...

251
00:15:55.585 --> 00:16:00.155
But it was in the house the entire time,
right under our noses, even!

252
00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:01.215
That's right.

253
00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:04.995
The corpse I'm referring to is the man
who was sitting in this very room,

254
00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:06.555
watching television...

255
00:16:06.555 --> 00:16:07.995
Your older brother!

256
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.085
Who are you?!

257
00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:16.485
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

258
00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:18.675
A detective?!

259
00:16:19.255 --> 00:16:21.625
This is how your trick worked...

260
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:26.285
Seeing that we had
discovered your brother's body,

261
00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.885
you washed all the blood
off him in the bathroom,

262
00:16:28.885 --> 00:16:31.335
put a bathrobe on him,
sat him in a chair upstairs,

263
00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:35.235
then came down to talk to the police,
who had come in search of the body.

264
00:16:35.755 --> 00:16:39.215
You had boldly disguised yourself
as the brother you murdered.

265
00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:42.185
The two of you have
always looked similar.

266
00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:44.315
Relatives would know the difference,

267
00:16:44.315 --> 00:16:46.155
but everybody else would be
fooled by such a simple disguise.

268
00:16:46.885 --> 00:16:50.465
Then, while the police searched the house,

269
00:16:50.465 --> 00:16:53.895
you jumped from the 2nd floor window
to the tree, and then over the wall.

270
00:16:53.895 --> 00:16:55.885
The outer side of the wall
acts as an embankment,

271
00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:58.635
but there was just enough room
for a single person to walk...

272
00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:02.725
You then returned to the front door
as the younger brother...

273
00:17:02.725 --> 00:17:06.535
...and acted like you had
no idea what had happened!

274
00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:10.805
What? You found the body?

275
00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:12.305
Yeah!

276
00:17:12.305 --> 00:17:13.755
The younger brother was the killer,

277
00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:16.405
and the older brother who
was sleeping was the corpse!

278
00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:20.215
Don't be ridiculous. He was alive.

279
00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:23.305
He turned the TV off
when his brother told him to,

280
00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:27.745
and he even yelled at you
when you broke that jar.

281
00:17:28.305 --> 00:17:32.895
Yes. You tried to make it look
like your brother was really alive.

282
00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.135
And you used the VCR,
the answering machine,

283
00:17:36.135 --> 00:17:39.105
and your cell phone to do it!

284
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:43.885
That shouting was something you had
recorded to the answering machine

285
00:17:43.885 --> 00:17:45.755
before the police showed up.

286
00:17:45.755 --> 00:17:48.345
You played it back on
the answering machine

287
00:17:48.345 --> 00:17:51.015
by using your cell phone's quick-dial
feature at just the right time!

288
00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:56.635
Of course, you turned off the ringers
on all the phones in advance

289
00:17:56.635 --> 00:18:00.255
to make it sound like your brother
was yelling from upstairs.

290
00:18:01.595 --> 00:18:05.675
Hey! Keep it down, will you?!

291
00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:09.005
As proof of this fact, you picked up
the phone, which didn't ring,

292
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:11.215
when a person calling the wrong
number just happened to call.

293
00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:15.105
You probably saw the light on the
phone blink when the phone call came.

294
00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:19.385
If you hadn't picked it up, the
answering machine would've kicked in

295
00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:23.045
and we would have
heard him yelling again...

296
00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:25.375
Yes. Like this.

297
00:18:28.885 --> 00:18:32.805
Hey! Keep it down, will you?!

298
00:18:32.805 --> 00:18:37.555
The TV turned off because you
set the VCR's timer in advance

299
00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:39.435
and then did a little bit
of acting of your own.

300
00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:42.405
Isn't that right, Tanaka Tomofumi-san?

301
00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:47.635
Hurry! Something bad might happen
to Conan-kun if you don't hurry!

302
00:18:47.635 --> 00:18:50.425
Give me a break, will you?
I'm hanging up.

303
00:18:50.425 --> 00:18:52.645
You're one smart kid,
I'll give you that.

304
00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:56.945
That's right...

305
00:18:56.945 --> 00:19:00.455
I killed my brother!

306
00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:06.425
Damn it! Where'd you go?!

307
00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:07.895
Come back here!

308
00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:19.215
I was being taken advantage of!

309
00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:24.505
By my worthless brother, who stayed
in my house and refused to work!

310
00:19:25.845 --> 00:19:30.305
I found these documents
in your room, Tomofumi...

311
00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:33.595
These are illegally-traded stocks, yes?

312
00:19:33.595 --> 00:19:38.225
Don't worry. We're brothers.
I won't tell anyone.

313
00:19:39.135 --> 00:19:43.465
But in return, you'll take care of me
for the rest of my life, right?

314
00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:47.135
I took care of him ever since...

315
00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:50.435
But then he demanded
even more money from me!

316
00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:55.505
So I bashed that parasite's head in!

317
00:19:57.135 --> 00:20:01.845
Little brat! There's no way
for you to understand how I felt!

318
00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:06.095
I loved my brother more than anyone else!

319
00:20:06.095 --> 00:20:11.755
My talented brother, who was
prized as a rising new novelist!

320
00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:17.695
He's disguised as his older brother!
He's really gone insane!

321
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:22.635
I idolized my brother...

322
00:20:23.885 --> 00:20:28.595
I always wanted to be like him...

323
00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:31.345
But then he fell from grace!

324
00:20:31.345 --> 00:20:36.435
The brother I idolized so much
had become a common leech!

325
00:20:37.555 --> 00:20:40.555
I'm taking back that brother
who I looked up to!

326
00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:46.695
Now do you get it? I'm... I'm...

327
00:20:47.965 --> 00:20:50.325
...going to become my brother!

328
00:20:54.095 --> 00:20:55.245
Now I'm mad!

329
00:20:55.935 --> 00:20:59.355
I'll use these Power Kick Shoes
to finish this!

330
00:21:04.925 --> 00:21:09.095
Oh no! My kicks are so strong
that they destroy these vegetables!

331
00:21:09.095 --> 00:21:10.445
Isn't there anything else?!

332
00:21:12.505 --> 00:21:16.385
Now that you've seen through my trick,
I can't let you live!

333
00:21:16.385 --> 00:21:18.995
Sorry, kid! Time to die!

334
00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:16.475
The authorities arrived
shortly afterward.

335
00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:19.675
The inspector's faith in us
was restored once more,

336
00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:23.485
and the case that started as a
"missing cat" investigation came to an end.

337
00:23:24.155 --> 00:23:25.175
And then...

338
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:31.575
No clients as usual...

339
00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:35.925
Dang, not even catching a
murderer seems to have helped...

340
00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:37.745
Um...

341
00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:40.765
My cat disappeared again...

342
00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:47.205
I think this may be tied
to another incident!

343
00:23:47.205 --> 00:23:49.375
Yeah, that's no ordinary cat, you know!

344
00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:51.035
Come on! Let's take the case!

345
00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:53.345
Yeah! Besides, we have nothing else to do!

346
00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:57.285
We found out later that
Hiroki's cat Akira was nothing more

347
00:23:57.285 --> 00:23:59.815
than a mischievous cat who liked
to sneak into all kinds of places.

348
00:24:00.455 --> 00:24:03.745
She never led us
to any further incidents.

349
00:24:20.505 --> 00:24:23.375
Your husband was into
swordsmanship, I take it?

350
00:24:24.295 --> 00:24:27.575
Which means that the killer
