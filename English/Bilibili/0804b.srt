1
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:43,067
Who is it?

2
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:44,467
Yes?

3
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:48,667
Mr. Hosoo. What's up, this early in the day?

4
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,467
Yes. What?

5
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,367
All right. I'll be right over.

6
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,767
What's the matter?

7
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:58,267
Was that call from Mr. Hosoo?

8
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,567
Yeah.

9
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,267
His secretary, Mr. Takahashi, committed suicide.

10
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,767
Mr. Mouri.

11
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:16,567
I asked him to come.

12
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,167
Why did Mr. Takahashi commit suicide?

13
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,867
We're not sure that it's suicide yet.

14
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,367
Excuse me.

15
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:26,767
Mr. Mouri.

16
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:29,767
I heard that you're not sure it's suicide yet.

17
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,267
Why?

18
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,767
This.

19
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,267
What's with that string?

20
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:37,167
It was wound around the electrical fan of the radiator.

21
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,367
And as you can see, it's severed like so.

22
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,767
And?

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,767
It was found around Mr. Takahashi's neck.

24
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,267
His neck...

25
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:48,767
How awful.

26
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,267
If the string hadn't snapped, this side would've...

27
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:54,267
From here, he passed it through the headrest of the driver's seat

28
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,867
and wound it around his neck.

29
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,267
The end was tied onto the steering wheel.

30
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:01,767
I see.

31
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,567
When the engine was started,

32
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:06,867
the string is wound and strangles him.

33
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,467
I'm surprised that he was able to push the starter switch.

34
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,467
I guess he wasn't choked right away.

35
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:13,467
What?

36
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,267
The electrical fan of the radiator

37
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:18,367
doesn't move right after the engine is started.

38
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,067
I see.

39
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:24,667
It takes time before the coolant heats up and the sensor to responds.

40
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,967
Yes, especially because it's cold now.

41
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:32,267
It takes time before the fan starts running.

42
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:35,867
Why? Why deliberately...

43
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,467
Is it from fear?

44
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,367
No, not so!

45
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,667
This is homicide!

46
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,267
I thought so.

47
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:46,467
You don't need time lag to commit suicide, do you?

48
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,367
We occasionally agree on things.

49
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,867
Either way, we've got to investigate the cause of death first.

50
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,067
If worse comes to worst,

51
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:55,667
we may find something strange in his stomach.

52
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,567
You mean something other than strangulation?

53
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,167
That case...

54
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,667
If I remember correctly, it had the two-faced mask inside.

55
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,867
Since when were you here?

56
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,367
I... I wonder since when.

57
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,867
Don't let me repeat myself!

58
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,867
This is not something a child should see.

59
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,667
Wasn't the mask in that case?

60
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,367
Are you listening or what?

61
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,067
I'm listening.

62
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,067
I'm not mistaken.

63
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:29,367
That case is the one that President Yabusaki...

64
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:32,767
I'll take this then.

65
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,967
It's the Kabukiza.

66
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,867
We work for the same company.

67
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,467
You can't, not now.

68
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,767
But...

69
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:41,067
Please cooperate.

70
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,667
Please.

71
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,667
"Yukari Shioji (32), HO Trading accounting secretary"

72
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,267
Miss.

73
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,867
Are you all right?

74
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,067
I'm fine, Sonny.

75
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,967
-Ms. Shioji. -President!

76
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,167
Mr. Takahashi... Is he really...

77
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,467
I see.

78
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,467
Inspector Shiratori, good morning.

79
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,167
Good morning, Conan.

80
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,267
Is the mask missing?

81
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,667
You're quickly informed as usual, aren't you?

82
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,167
"Takuzo Minowa (55), Security guard"

83
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,967
-What's the matter? -They took my fingerprints.

84
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,267
I wonder if they suspect me.

85
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,067
That's not it.

86
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,667
Because all the people who entered this room had their fingerprints taken.

87
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,567
He's right.

88
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,067
If prints other than yours are found,

89
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,867
it'll help move the investigation along.

90
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,567
I see.

91
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,067
I doubt they'll find anything this time, though.

92
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,367
No prints were detected?

93
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:19,967
No, it seems the perp wore vinyl gloves.

94
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,367
According to Mr. Tome,

95
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,967
the unevenness of the surface of the leather would've been left behind,

96
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,067
if it were leather.

97
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,867
Vinyl gloves?

98
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,967
The ordinary easy to get kind?

99
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:32,967
Was the mask found in there?

100
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,167
In Mr. Yabusaki's locker.

101
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,767
He, himself found it in there this morning.

102
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,367
May I ask you something, sir?

103
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,767
What is it?

104
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,167
From here to that staff entrance...

105
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,567
Great detective!

106
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,067
Ebizo.

107
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,967
Did you come up with anything?

108
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,467
About Mr. Takahashi...

109
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,567
Mr. Mouri says it's not suicide.

110
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,767
Yeah.

111
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:35,167
What was thought to be a case of theft turns out to be homicide.

112
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,467
Nothing's for sure yet,

113
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,567
but if it were suicide,

114
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:42,967
it's strange that the two-faced mask is missing from the case, right?

115
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,267
Right.

116
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,167
If Takahashi himself stole it,

117
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,167
it should be in there.

118
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:51,867
It's obvious that a third party took it,

119
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:56,067
either to sell it or to keep it for himself.

120
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:59,467
Someone who knows the value of the two-faced mask.

121
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:03,867
Someone who knew that it was inside the president's locker.

122
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,467
Doesn't that narrow things down quite a bit?

123
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,867
Yes.

124
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,067
Is something bothering you?

125
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:13,867
The locker was violently opened,

126
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,767
but the other locks are in tack.

127
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,967
-The other locks? -Yes.

128
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:22,367
Mr. Minowa went home last night at 23:30.

129
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,367
The entire building's security system was activated

130
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,367
and the front door was locked at the same time.

131
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,967
Although there are many people who have cards,

132
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,967
only Mr. Minowa and the receptionists

133
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,367
have keys to go on ahead.

134
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,667
Which means the perp is an expert at picking locks?

135
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,367
I guess so.

136
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:45,567
The perp broke in without even scratching the newest cylinder type and yet,

137
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:49,467
to break open a simple lock like that of the locker with a bar...

138
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,367
I see, it sure is weird.

139
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:57,867
Somebody who can get a hold of key of this place...

140
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,867
It seems that person also knows the position of the security cameras.

141
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,967
You figured something like that out too?

142
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:08,267
Oh, so you were searching for that route till just a while ago.

143
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,267
Yes.

144
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,167
There's a camera in here too, right?

145
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,167
Although security is tight around the backstage dressing rooms,

146
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,167
so long as I didn't use the elevator,

147
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:21,567
I was able to make into the locker room without being caught on camera.

148
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,467
I guess. You'd be able to.

149
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:30,267
Because there's nothing valuable in the rooms of the presidents.

150
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,167
Can you tell what this is?

151
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,167
What're these figures?

152
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,367
Mr. Minowa said that they're the PIN for the door outside.

153
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,867
He found it on the floor of that room.

154
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,767
Why didn't you give it to the police?

155
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,467
Can you have Mr. Mouri check on it?

156
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:51,667
I'm being suspected by the police, right?

157
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,467
They don't suspect him.

158
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,267
He was serious.

159
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,367
What?

160
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,067
-Look on the back. -The back?

161
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,667
It's the script from our previous performance.

162
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,967
This is a script.

163
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:09,767
We cut used scripts into memo paper.

164
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,767
Playwright Iwami does it.

165
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,067
-Your seatbelt. -Yes, sir.

166
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,667
-Let's go, buddy! -Buddy?

167
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:34,667
Great detective, is Iwami your prime suspect?

168
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,567
No, if he acted alone.

169
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,167
This case started

170
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:44,867
when someone tampered with the brakes of Mr. Hosoo's car.

171
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,667
Next was his secretary, Mr. Takahashi.

172
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,567
Again the car was tampered in a complicated way.

173
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:56,467
And if the small bar that was used to destroy the locker

174
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:00,567
was a wheel spanner that you'd find in an onboard toolkit...

175
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,267
I see.

176
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,967
The perp knows a lot about cars.

177
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,667
It's hard to believe that Mr. Iwami is the perp

178
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,867
because he doesn't have a driver's license.

179
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:14,667
When did you check whether Iwami had a license or not?

180
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,067
It wasn't me.

181
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,667
Pops Kogoro seems to have asked to check on it.

182
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,567
You say so,

183
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:25,567
but I'll bet you're the one solving the cases behind the scenes.

184
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,567
This is no laughing matter.

185
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:47,332
"HO Trading Office"

186
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:55,232
"President's room" -Your bodyguard?

187
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:57,232
My car brakes were destroyed

188
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:59,632
and I was almost killed.

189
00:10:59,632 --> 00:11:03,632
And now my secretary, Takahashi, was really killed.

190
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:08,032
Suicide hasn't been ruled out yet.

191
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,332
He's not the type to commit suicide.

192
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,132
Even when I chewed him out,

193
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:17,132
the following day he would act as if nothing had happened.

194
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:21,032
It's highly likely that they'd come after me again.

195
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:25,032
Okay, I understand. I accept.

196
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,532
I'm glad!

197
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,532
Come in.

198
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:31,232
Excuse me.

199
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,132
Good morning, President.

200
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:35,832
I've got two messages for you.

201
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:39,632
I've just been asked to serve as bodyguard for the president.

202
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,032
Mr. Kogoro Mouri, correct?

203
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:46,032
Yes, I'm a great detective, you see.

204
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,032
What kind of shampoo do you use?

205
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,032
I'd like to talk to the president in private.

206
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:51,132
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:52,432
We'll be done right away,

208
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:54,732
so please wait for me in the meeting area.

209
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:58,532
Who knows where they'd be targeting you from.

210
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,732
I'd like you to introduce me to a sniper

211
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,332
that's such a sharp shooter.

212
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:03,632
What?

213
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:06,532
I'm only joking.

214
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,832
And you are?

215
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:09,632
Yukari Shioji.

216
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,832
I'm in charge of accounting.

217
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:20,032
She knew me.

218
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,732
Kaori Shioji.

219
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:25,032
She smelled nice.

220
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,432
"Poroit Hospital"

221
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,632
This is where they brought Iwami.

222
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:35,232
I'd like to talk to him where it's nice and quiet.

223
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,232
What do you mean?

224
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:38,832
Because you stand out, Ebizo.

225
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,632
How's this disguise?

226
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,232
No darn way!

227
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,032
Really?

228
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,832
Dr. Terajima...

229
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,932
Please return to the medical office.

230
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,232
I repeat.

231
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,332
Dr. Terajima, please return to...

232
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:55,232
It's impossible to erase aura, I guess.

233
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,532
-This floor? -Room 11.

234
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,732
"Shinnosuke Iwami"

235
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,732
No! Mr. Iwami!

236
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,432
No, don't!

237
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:08,132
Somebody! Somebody, help!

238
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:09,432
Iwami!

239
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:11,932
What do you think you're doing?

240
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,632
You!

241
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:20,232
Just what is wrong with you, Iwami?

242
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,532
Ebizo...

243
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,532
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,732
Are you all right, nurse?

245
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:32,632
Yes. He sure is a hard patient to handle, really.

246
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:33,732
Huh?

247
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,432
Dr. Kikuchi.

248
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,132
Not again.

249
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,732
Yes.

250
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:51,032
Maybe it's my fault.

251
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,332
I believed in his gift and chose him.

252
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,832
But maybe for him,

253
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:03,832
it was nothing but pressure.

254
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:08,632
Ebizo.

255
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,532
I'll investigate on my own from here.

256
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,232
And, why?

257
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:19,432
It's tough having to doubt

258
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:21,232
the people you work with, isn't it?

259
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,732
And you're still just a child.

260
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:31,032
But you read people's minds.

261
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,232
You're Ebizo after all.

262
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,232
The doctor injected Mr. Iwami with a tranquilizer

263
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:40,632
and said that he's fine.

264
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:44,732
-Thank you very much. -You're very welcome.

265
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,232
What're you going to do from now?

266
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,032
I'll give you a lift.

267
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,432
Thank you. But I'll be fine.

268
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,232
I go on my own from here.

269
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:55,432
Okay.

270
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,132
I'll tell everybody to answer you honestly,

271
00:14:57,132 --> 00:15:00,632
if you come to investigate on something.

272
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:04,432
Hang in there, little great detective.

273
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:05,832
I will.

274
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,818
"Poroit Hospital"

275
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:31,318
Did Mr. Iwami try to jump yesterday too?

276
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,818
How do you know?

277
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:35,618
Because when the doctor came into the room,

278
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,618
he said, "Not again".

279
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:39,418
Oh, I see.

280
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,518
It was when I went to check the IV at the wee hour of the night,

281
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:45,618
so maybe it was around 3:00.

282
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:47,218
You got to be joking!

283
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,518
I quit, you fool!

284
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,018
-Forget this play! -Mr. Iwami?

285
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:58,518
Look out!

286
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:01,418
Let go! Let me go!

287
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,118
No!

288
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,718
You mean he attempted suicide?

289
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:14,618
Well, it seems like he's kind of acting it out too,

290
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:17,518
but there are patients like that sometimes, so...

291
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:37,518
What're you sniffing around for?

292
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:41,018
What're you doing, sir?

293
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,818
I'm a cameraman.

294
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:46,418
My job is...

295
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,718
to record the next performance.

296
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,018
I've got nothing to do with it, do I?

297
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:56,318
You've already stuck your nose into this.

298
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,718
You may not get off that easily.

299
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,918
Sir, you're not a cameraman,

300
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,218
but rather a detective, right?

301
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:06,318
When you look at people through the viewfinder,

302
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,318
you can really clearly see them inside out.

303
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:14,518
That's why cameramen are paid well.

304
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:18,918
Before the police come to cover the objects with blue sheets,

305
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:22,918
I got this from the roof of a building nearby.

306
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,918
And this.

307
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:28,818
Nice eyes.

308
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,918
Did you find any will?

309
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,818
If this is concluded as suicide, the story ends here.

310
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:38,218
If it were suicide, it would've been done more simply.

311
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:41,018
You understand, don't you, kid?

312
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,218
Thanks.

313
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,918
Be careful.

314
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:46,818
Friend or foe. If you get them wrong,

315
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,518
it may cost you your life.

316
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:53,518
That cameraman...

317
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:56,118
Just what does he know?

318
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:05,618
This is too much.

319
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,218
Thank you for waiting.

320
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,718
Ms. Kaori Shiojiri.

321
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,518
It's Yukari Shioji.

322
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,918
I'd like to talk to you about Mr. Takahashi,

323
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,818
just the two of us.

324
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:16,418
Yes?

325
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:19,018
Mr. Mouri, I have to go to Ginza for a business negotiation,

326
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,918
so please come with me.

327
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,618
Of course.

328
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,118
Come, let's go, Kaori.

329
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:25,718
It's Yukari.

330
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:28,418
Ms. Shiojii has to stay here

331
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:30,818
because she's got accounting work to take care of.

332
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,118
No way.

333
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,918
Mr. Mouri.

334
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:36,618
Yes, sir!

335
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,218
I can't get a hold of Mr. Kaneko.

336
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:52,018
We've got a problem.

337
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:55,418
Mr. Kaneko? You mean the cameraman, right?

338
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:56,418
Yeah.

339
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,918
I met him at the hospital where Mr. Iwami's staying,

340
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,218
just a while ago.

341
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,918
-Really? -Thank you, Conan.

342
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:07,018
Is something wrong with Mr. Kaneko?

343
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:11,018
There are lots of bad rumors going around about him.

344
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:16,518
"Ran Mouri" -Ran?

345
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:20,618
What's the matter, Ran?

346
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,818
Where are you now?

347
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:24,918
You've got something more fun to do

348
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:26,218
than playing soccer with us?

349
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:27,418
Hey, wait.

350
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,618
Ran told us about it, you know?

351
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:32,118
That only you went to a sushi shop in Ichikawa.

352
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,318
That's Pops' comical story.

353
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,118
-You went to the sushi shop with Kanizo! -It's Ebizo!

354
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:38,018
Give it back to me!

355
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,518
I can't go home for a while yet.

356
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:50,718
What's the matter?

357
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:52,818
Did you give it to Mr. Mouri for me?

358
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,018
Yes, I'm going to give it to him from now.

359
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,018
Please do so, okay?

360
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:59,618
I can't sleep like this.

361
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:00,918
Oh, right.

362
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,218
Do you know Mr. Kaneko's cell phone number?

363
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,918
Pops Kogoro told me to ask you.

364
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:11,618
You answer the phone if it's me.

365
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,718
I answered because it was a number I wasn't familiar with.

366
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,618
Or rather you could call it a hunch.

367
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:18,918
I was so sure it was you.

368
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:22,118
Didn't the police call you too?

369
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:25,718
Detectives got to have a keen nose, you see.

370
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:28,918
I'd like to ask you a lot of questions as a detective.

371
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,718
For example?

372
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:35,618
I want to know how you took pictures of Mr. Takahashi when he died.

373
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,318
Sure, great detective.

374
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:42,418
Why would he be in a place like this?

375
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,818
Who is it?

376
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,518
Shoots!

377
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,718
"Next Episode" -The two-faced mask that we borrowed from Mr. Hosoo

378
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,218
had been stolen.

379
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:38,518
However,

380
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:40,718
I can't let that hold me back after I've come this far!

381
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:43,318
I'll need to turn this performance into a success no matter what!

382
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,018
The most unsuspicious one

383
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:49,518
is in fact the most suspicious.

384
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,618
Dad, big trouble!

385
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:53,518
What about the glasses kid?

386
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,918
He's missing?

387
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,218
Next Conan,

388
00:22:57,218 --> 00:23:01,318
"Conan and Ebizo's Kabuki Juhachiban Mystery (Part 2)"

389
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:19,918
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:21,818
"Jacket"

391
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,418
-We are... -All five of us...

392
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,918
Makes 30!
