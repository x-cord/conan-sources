1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,260
As long as modern-day
crimes involve people,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,710
there are no
unsolvable mysteries!

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,960
Today's case is about Conan's origin!

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,000
And the detective from out
west makes a reappearance!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,010
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,220
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,970
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,069
The Holmes Freak Murder Case (Part 1).

9
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:44,869
Sherlock Holmes
Enthusiasts Reception Tour

10
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,249
"A Study in Scarlet"?
Sherlock Holmes
Enthusiasts Reception Tour

11
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,159
Yes...

12
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,039
It is noteworthy as the very first
story Sherlock Holmes appears in!

13
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,889
"The Red-Headed League"
is my favorite!

14
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,639
Mine's "The Sign of Four"!

15
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:01,209
Oh! That one was
internationally acclaimed!

16
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,599
Impressive, my boy!
You can read kanji?

17
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,559
Yeah...

18
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,269
Gimme a break.

19
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:11,239
Why do I have to
go on this stupid tour?

20
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,909
Because Conan-kun
applied for you without asking...

21
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,039
And then I was
unlucky enough to get picked...

22
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,329
Ugh.

23
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,369
Which story do you favor?

24
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,039
Who, me?

25
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,999
Yes.

26
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,909
Good question.

27
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,959
I'd say I prefer
"And Then There Was One."

28
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:33,979
That's "And Then There Were None."

29
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,719
Yoshiaki Fuji (47)
That's "And Then There Were None."

30
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,319
And that novel was
written by Agatha Christie,

31
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,459
Nanako Shimizu (24) - Librarian
And that novel was
written by Agatha Christie,

32
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,139
not my beloved Conan Doyle-sama.
Nanako Shimizu (24) - Librarian

33
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:44,719
My word.

34
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,579
Ikuo Kawatsu (25) - Gym Teacher
My word.

35
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,609
Who let this amateur on the tour?
Ikuo Kawatsu (25) - Gym Teacher

36
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,899
Talk about a real party pooper...

37
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:55,079
I'm supposed to live with
these jerks for three whole days?!

38
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,039
These aren't the only guests.

39
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:58,619
As we speak,

40
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,579
the tour director
is in another car,

41
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,829
taking the other guests
back to the lodge!

42
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:03,959
Oh man...

43
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,909
Oh, come on.
The more the merrier!

44
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:07,579
I'll give you merrier!

45
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,799
Ouch!

46
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:17,139
Welcome, everyone,
to the Mycroft Lodge!

47
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,789
I'm Kanaya, the director of this tour

48
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,099
and this lodge's owner!

49
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,559
Each one of you here today

50
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:29,499
is a superior Sherlockian
that I have carefully selected.

51
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,539
Are you sure you were careful enough?

52
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,789
It seems a complete amateur
who knows nothing about Holmes

53
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,569
is among us.

54
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:35,979
Oh? Is there really?

55
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,119
Maria Toda (43) - Fortuneteller
Oh? Is there really?

56
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,029
Over there. That mustached man.
Maria Toda (43) - Fortuneteller

57
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:40,959
Oh, my.

58
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,789
That's it. I'm out of here.

59
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:46,959
Please wait, Mori-san!

60
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,919
This man I've brought
here today is none other

61
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,959
than the great, modern-day
detective that compares with

62
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,789
our beloved Holmes--

63
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,639
Kogoro Mori-san, right?

64
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,249
I know who he is.

65
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:03,599
I've seen him many a
time on TV and in the papers.

66
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,609
He certainly appears

67
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:06,329
Kento Togano (22) - University Student
He certainly appears

68
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,539
to have a superior intellect,
Kento Togano (22) - University Student

69
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,369
but he clearly doesn't compare
Kento Togano (22) - University Student

70
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:11,359
with Sherlock!
Kento Togano (22) - University Student

71
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:12,209
Certainly not.

72
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,709
Ayako Oki (21) - University Student
ln a real contest,

73
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,829
you probably wouldn't even begin
Ayako Oki (21) - University Student

74
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,859
to compare to him!
Ayako Oki (21) - University Student

75
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,959
I can't let them get
away with saying that!

76
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,869
Now, now.

77
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:22,909
You're being compared with Holmes;
it's to be expected!

78
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:23,619
You shut up!

79
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,789
I refuse to lose to a
stupid fictional character!

80
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:31,249
Besides, this is all because
you signed me up for this tour!

81
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:32,249
Conan-kun!

82
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:33,709
Conan?!

83
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,849
Oh! Your name's Conan?!

84
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:37,839
Truly?!

85
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,429
I like it too!
Isn't it a great name?!

86
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:41,889
It's magnificent!

87
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,849
I guess I didn't
need to worry after all.

88
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,089
Conan-kun's usually cool
and strangely un-childlike.

89
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,819
But as I look at that innocent
face of his, I feel relieved.

90
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:58,699
But Conan-kun's fascination with
Holmes is almost the same as his!

91
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,699
His?

92
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,699
You know who!

93
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,079
He's snobbish and arrogant,

94
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,699
a mystery nerd,
a Holmes freak, and is tone--

95
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,119
...tone-deaf, but a superb
high school soccer player,

96
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,579
and the guy who ran off
during our contest the other day

97
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,209
before I could recoup my losses...

98
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:16,089
...Shinichi Kudo, right?

99
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,549
Hattori-kun!

100
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,869
You're a Holmes fan too?!

101
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,289
Of course not!

102
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,959
The reason I applied for this tour

103
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,429
was 'cuz I thought I might find Kudo.

104
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,139
Besides, Ellery Queen's
much better than Conan Doyle--

105
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,569
On second thought,
maybe Doyle's better!

106
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,739
It's growing late,
so we'll call it a night.

107
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,659
Breakfast is tomorrow
morning at 9:00,

108
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,449
lunch at 1:00, and dinner at 8:00.

109
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,499
And then after dinner is the
annual super-difficult mystery quiz!

110
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:56,459
And those who get a
perfect score on the quiz

111
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,869
will be presented with
Conan Doyle's greatest work

112
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,999
which brought Sherlock Holmes
into this world--

113
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,639
a first-edition copy
of "A Study in Scarlet!"

114
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,539
However!

115
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:13,559
First, I must see proof of
how devoted you are to Holmes!

116
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,519
Proof?

117
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,209
What my maid
is passing out right now

118
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,289
is the Holmes Cult
Test of 1000 Questions!

119
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,499
1000 questions?!

120
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:25,039
You have until dinner tomorrow
evening to turn it in.

121
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,249
Only those who get over 990 correct

122
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,459
will be able to
participate in tomorrow's quiz.

123
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,959
Just to be safe,
if you have a cell phone

124
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,539
or any Holmes-related literature,

125
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,869
please hand them
over to my maid now.

126
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:41,499
There's no point
in trying to hide them!

127
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,659
Placed throughout
the lodge to watch over you

128
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,539
are security cameras
and listening devices!

129
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,599
If you're caught cheating,
you will be asked to leave at once!

130
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:55,749
Hey, now. Do I have
to take that test too?

131
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,289
Certainly not; you're a special guest.

132
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,819
All I ask is that you
give us a lecture later on...

133
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,489
Hey. If I get over 990 right,
can I be in the quiz too?

134
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:06,949
Sure...

135
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:10,959
Let's see...

136
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,869
"What was the exact
date that Holmes fell

137
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:17,249
to the bottom of the valley
with Professor Moriarty?"

138
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:20,249
May 4th, 1891.

139
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,339
This is actually pretty easy!

140
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:23,579
Next one...

141
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,579
"Write down the entire code
from 'The Dancing Men'

142
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
exactly as it appeared."

143
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,059
Conan-kun...

144
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,579
Are you still up?
It's 4 o'clock, you know.

145
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,479
Ugh. No TV, no phones,
no newspapers...

146
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,119
On top of that, there's
not even any air-conditioning,

147
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,459
despite this heat!

148
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,939
A single security
camera is all there is.

149
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,579
This is the best!

150
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,829
That was great!

151
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,789
The owner hasn't
shown up at all, has he?

152
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,039
Go get him and start
grading the tests already!

153
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,469
But I've been told to entertain
you all until he comes...

154
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,099
Kudo ain't here.
I shouldn't have come on this tour...

155
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,909
Damn it! I've had enough of this!

156
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,249
I'm going to my room!

157
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,909
Sir!

158
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,689
Sounds like the rumors were true...

159
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,909
He was lying when he
said he would give away

160
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,459
that first-edition copy.

161
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,209
He finds fault in
people's answers every time,

162
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,869
and makes it so nobody ever wins.

163
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:35,159
He only holds this tour
to show off that book of his!

164
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:37,959
Sorry, but I'm going to sleep too.

165
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,159
Same here.

166
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,999
Um!

167
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,159
This is ridiculous.
I'm going to bed too.

168
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,609
What now, Conan-kun?

169
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,469
I'm going to stay here.

170
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,719
Oh, man. I'm at my limit, too.

171
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:58,829
Come on, Kento.
Let's go back to our room, too.

172
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,689
Be patient! Making a move at
a time like this would mean defeat!

173
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:06,149
Huh? Isn't that the car we came in?

174
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,239
That's the owner! He's driving!

175
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:12,709
See, the mystery
quiz is finally starting.

176
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,199
That's my Kento.

177
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:17,909
Wait!

178
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,959
There's a cliff there!

179
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,509
Oh no! It's speeding up!

180
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,459
Hey, Mister! What're you doin'?!

181
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,879
Stop the car before you drive off!

182
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,759
There's a blanket on the car's panel!

183
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,969
And what's that sound?!
It's not the engine!

184
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:39,209
Hey! Mister! I'm talking to you!

185
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:58,287
What? The owner's dead?!

186
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,207
Yes.

187
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:04,167
He drove off the cliff just
now before our very eyes!

188
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,787
That can't be!
Why would he do that?!

189
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,967
It was a suicide.

190
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:13,467
He probably didn't want to
part with his first-edition book.

191
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:17,087
No, this just might've been a murder!

192
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:21,337
Someone put him to
sleep or killed him in advance,

193
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,627
sat him in the car seat,

194
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:28,357
and put the car in drive to make
it move forward automatically.

195
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:32,327
The killer most likely did
all of that inside that garage.

196
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,287
Then does that
mean one of us is the killer?!

197
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:36,787
Yes, something like that.

198
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,287
That may be, but the car
sped up at one point!

199
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:44,377
There was also a strange
hissing sound coming from inside!

200
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,257
It wasn't the engine!

201
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,497
Oh, that must have
been the air conditioner!

202
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:52,627
The AC was set to on,
so when the engine was started

203
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,217
it kicked in by itself!

204
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:57,377
At any rate,
the body is unrecoverable.

205
00:10:57,377 --> 00:11:00,667
Our only choice is to
contact the police and wait.

206
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,187
But the owner took all our phones...

207
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:05,937
They must be in his room!

208
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,997
Oh? What are you
looking at that tire track for?

209
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,567
Just looking for something...

210
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,127
Ow!

211
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,957
Not you too, Hattori-kun?

212
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,497
Don't look at me!
I was just checking to see

213
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,787
if the AC was really on or not!

214
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,377
And then I run into this kid again--

215
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,457
Wait a minute!

216
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,617
He also collided with me when
I was looking for evidence

217
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,797
during that previous incident!

218
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,427
It's too dark to see well, huh?

219
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,427
Yeah...

220
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,847
How's this, young detectives?

221
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,147
Thanks...

222
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:43,267
Much obliged...

223
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:45,227
The phones have been demolished!

224
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:47,357
Who would do such a thing?!

225
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,277
The first-edition book is gone too!

226
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:53,127
Damn it! I've had enough!

227
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:55,997
Let's take the remaining
car and get out of this place--

228
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,197
Pointless.

229
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:01,627
The car in the garage
had its gas tank punctured

230
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:04,497
and all the gasoline has leaked out!

231
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,497
On top of that,
the battery's been removed.

232
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,667
That car's not going anywhere!

233
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,287
You can't be serious!

234
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:15,097
It would seem the owner
was killed by someone, Detective.

235
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:21,207
What kind of trick the killer
used to speed the car up is a mystery,

236
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,557
but the fact that we're trapped here

237
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:28,897
means that the killer still plans
to continue this murder drama!

238
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,287
Whatever the case,
the killer is in this room.

239
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,737
If we properly investigate
we'll uncover them soon enough!

240
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:43,077
Oh, yeah! The security cameras
might have recorded something!

241
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,037
I'm sorry. Those aren't real.

242
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,417
He puts them up every year for this tour.

243
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,567
With thumbtacks.

244
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,507
Thumbtacks?

245
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,787
Even so,
we know it was around 3:30

246
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:57,597
when the killer put the owner
in the car and sent him on his way.

247
00:12:58,037 --> 00:13:00,287
And that it was
impossible for the five of us

248
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,457
who had been in the living
room for several hours prior

249
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:04,417
to have done it!

250
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,457
Hold on a second.

251
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:09,857
So the killer was one of us
five who weren't in the living room?!

252
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,777
Please refrain from counting me!

253
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:13,707
Hey.

254
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:16,037
Did you find what you
were looking for earlier?

255
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,457
No, not at all...

256
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:18,207
I see.

257
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:23,037
Ayako?

258
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:28,497
I just figured out both
the killer's identity and their trick.

259
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,047
Along with conclusive evidence.

260
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:36,967
What?!

261
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,997
I'll give you ten minutes.

262
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:41,337
If you don't wish to hear
your name from my mouth

263
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:43,927
then you'll come clean before then.

264
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,877
Ayako! Where are you going?!

265
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:46,747
The bathroom.

266
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:49,897
Are you crazy? The killer might
go after you if you're all alone!

267
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,747
Oh, but you'll protect me, won't you?

268
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:54,607
Hey! Wait!

269
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,917
Your big reputation's on the line, huh?

270
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,907
She's probably bluffin'.

271
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:04,247
No! She must have found a clue
we don't know about yet!

272
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:05,707
Yeah, that must be it.

273
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:09,827
Now that you mention it, Ayako-san
was acting odd this afternoon.

274
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:16,007
I ran into her on the way
back to my room after lunch.

275
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:21,467
But when she saw me, she quickly
hid some papers behind her.

276
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:26,427
I think it might've been the Holmes
test that was passed out last night...

277
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:27,387
The test?

278
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:28,307
Don't tell me...

279
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:29,347
...she was cheating?

280
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,207
Talk about low...

281
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,167
Alright! Who's the killer?!

282
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,527
You secretly asked her, didn't you?

283
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,607
Please tell us!

284
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:39,537
She said she wouldn't tell even me

285
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,077
and then shut
herself up in the bathroom.

286
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:44,787
Damn it! How dare she taunt us!

287
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:46,537
Say...

288
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,997
There were other
people besides Ayako-san

289
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:50,997
who skipped lunch, right?

290
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:56,207
Yes. Just Kento Togano-san
and Nanako Shimizu-san.

291
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:03,667
At any rate, the fact that
she's suspected of cheating

292
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,217
means that Ayako
knew from the very start

293
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:09,337
that those security
cameras were mock-ups!

294
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,957
Hey.

295
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:14,957
Did Ayako-san come
to your room this afternoon?

296
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,627
No. I did the rest
of the test in my room,

297
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,237
but nobody came.

298
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:26,587
Which means she did
see it in someone's room!

299
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:29,117
Something significant to this incident!

300
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:31,497
Something that one of those
four alibi-less people had--

301
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,877
--in their room!

302
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,997
Isn't Ayako-san late coming back?

303
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,917
Now that you mention it...

304
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,467
It's been over twenty minutes...

305
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,137
She couldn't be!

306
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,707
Hey! Ayako-san! Ayako-san!

307
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:47,767
What's all the racket?!

308
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:51,787
It's rude of you to gather
around the bathroom, you know!

309
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,977
No, we were worried about you, so--

310
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:59,397
We'd like you to
tell us who the killer is!

311
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,127
Oh, that?

312
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,117
It seems I made a mistake.

313
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:06,577
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:09,787
Bah. So it really was a bluff...

315
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:13,837
Why? Why'd she suddenly
change her attitude?

316
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:17,417
Darn it! And there're so
many things I don't know!

317
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,087
Huh? Where's Ayako-san?

318
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:26,747
She went for a walk outside.

319
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:27,957
We tried to stop her,

320
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,927
but she insisted there
won't be any more murders.

321
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,337
Well, we do have
all four suspects here, so...

322
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,457
Nothing will
happen if we just stay still.

323
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,477
What was that sound?!

324
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,937
It came from the garage!

325
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:42,167
What on earth happened?!

326
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,117
Don't tell me Ayako-san's in there!

327
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:50,447
Ayako! Ayako!

328
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,917
You moron! Jump into that
and you'll only burn to death!

329
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,567
Somebody get an extinguisher!

330
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:56,747
There's one over here!

331
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:59,417
Please! Somebody put it out!

332
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,087
Otherwise that book will be--

333
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,167
Looks like it's out.

334
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,177
Ayako! Where are you?!

335
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,367
Are you there?! Ayako!

336
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:22,787
What is it?!

337
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,127
Ayako?

338
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:33,787
Ayako! Ayako!

339
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:39,787
Judging from her clothes and figure,
there's no question it's her.

340
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,917
And she was perfectly
fine just a short while ago...

341
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:46,297
Come to think of it, she did say
she figured out who the killer was...

342
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,507
So the killer killed
her to keep her quiet?

343
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:54,037
But I believe all the suspects
were in the owner's lodge

344
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,977
when the fire erupted
in this garage.

345
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,417
Then who set it?

346
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,087
It wouldn't just start by itself...

347
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:04,437
No, there is one person who
could have done it!

348
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:05,957
The owner!

349
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:09,787
He drove off the cliff,
but wouldn't everything fit

350
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,367
if he were still alive?!

351
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:17,037
Yes! If it had been a dummy
or something in the car, then...

352
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,087
There was a novel like that...

353
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:23,957
Nope. It was the owner, in the flesh.

354
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:26,547
I saw him too! I don't
think there's any question about it!

355
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:29,587
Then who the hell did this?!

356
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:32,087
Somebody's just killed Ayako!

357
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:33,097
Calm down!

358
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:38,057
In any case, it's painfully clear
that the killer is not one of us ten.

359
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,247
For now, let's retreat to
the house and wait until morning.

360
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,927
Let's stay in the living room.

361
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,527
As if I'd ever mistake
a person for a dummy!

362
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:55,997
But all the suspects
were in the lodge...

363
00:18:55,997 --> 00:18:59,747
Could someone have put a
time-activated detonator in the garage?

364
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,457
No, there was nothing of the sort!

365
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:03,917
Then how did the killer start the fire?!

366
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:06,877
We don't know that,
so that's why we're--

367
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,347
What was Ayako-san doing
in the garage, anyway?

368
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:19,957
It's really coming down...

369
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:23,917
If this downpour keeps up,
there's no leaving come morning...

370
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:26,667
I'm tired from staying up all night,
not to mention hungry...

371
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,287
Shall I make some coffee
and something cold to eat?

372
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,817
I'll help you!

373
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,997
I'll come too!

374
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,337
I'd be worried if you two
girls were all by yourselves.

375
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:37,787
I'll come too.

376
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:42,787
But if the owner really is the killer,

377
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:46,627
why would he pretend
to die and then kill Ayako-san?

378
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,547
He's enjoying his murder!

379
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,457
Have a look at this card!

380
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,757
Had I not been careful
I would've been killed!

381
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:01,587
"If you want the book, then come
to the garage at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

382
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:04,477
I'll put it beneath the back seat."

383
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:09,037
It was past 4:30 when
the fire started in the garage...

384
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:12,907
The back seat?
That's where Ayako's body was!

385
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,667
Say, where did you get this card?

386
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,997
It was stuck in my door when
I returned from dinner last night.

387
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:21,957
That's it! I figured it out!

388
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,207
Listen, Mister!

389
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:27,247
How many times do I have to say it?!
The owner was dead!

390
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,547
Can I really trust what a kid saw?

391
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:30,417
What'd you say?!

392
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:33,167
Judging from where Ayako-san died,

393
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,757
it would seem that she, too,
went to the garage to get the book.

394
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:40,037
Which means the only remaining
mystery of the second incident

395
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:43,937
is how the killer lit the garage
on fire while still in the room.

396
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,587
And it's because
of detectives like you

397
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,247
that so many cases go unsolved--

398
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,397
How rude!

399
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,357
My dad solves his
cases every single time!

400
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,707
He takes a sleeping-like pose
whenever he analyzes things,

401
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:58,417
so everyone fears
him as "Sleeping Kogoro"!

402
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,617
Right, Dad?!

403
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:01,367
Sleeping?

404
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,657
Hey! Come over here!

405
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,327
What are you doing?

406
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,667
Where is he when your
old man starts analyzing?!

407
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,377
Who?

408
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:11,297
You know, the one who's
always hangin' around you guys...

409
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:12,757
This kid!

410
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:15,167
Conan-kun?

411
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,997
Now that you mention it,
he never is around...

412
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:18,127
Yeah?!

413
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,587
Oh, but he often
appears from behind my dad

414
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,127
and helps explain his theories!

415
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,227
From behind him?

416
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,397
You help from behind him?

417
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:29,607
I love to play detective!

418
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,257
A power outage?!

419
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,667
Was it from lightning?!

420
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,837
No! It's just a blown fuse!

421
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,787
Then hurry and reset
the circuit breakers!

422
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:39,867
Damn it! Now, of all times!

423
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:43,197
Here, Miss. Use this light...

424
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,117
An ice pick!

425
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,337
What's going on?!

426
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:53,037
What's that sound?!

427
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:53,617
Glass.

428
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:54,307
Maid!

429
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:55,217
Hurry with the lights!

430
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,297
Fujisawa-san!

431
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,537
How?!

432
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:03,347
Dad! The window glass!

433
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:05,807
Dammit! They smashed
the window and escaped!

434
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:10,727
No! The killer's still in here! And--

435
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:15,497
And now I finally know how
the killer set the garage on fire

436
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,337
while in this room!

437
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:49,907
Perhaps the third incident
wasn't part of the killer's plan?

438
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,957
Conan-kun!

439
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:55,417
But I'm just a kid,
so what would I know?

440
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:59,087
This kid isn't pretending
to be a detective!

441
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,707
He's analyzing!

442
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,957
His voice and body are different,
but he's almost like Shinichi Kudo!

443
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:07,627
Could he really be?!

444
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:09,957
On the next Conan--

445
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:13,167
The Holmes Freak Murder Case (Part 2).

446
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,442
Next Conan's hint:

447
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:16,445
Next Conan's hint:
Holmes' Cult Test.

448
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:18,560
Holmes' Cult Test.
