1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.740
"Toto Tower"

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.940
Is something already happening?

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.540
What is it?

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.140
There's smoke coming out.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.640
I wonder if a bomb was set up here after all.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.940
I'll go ask what happened,

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.740
so you kids wait in the car.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.940
Okay?

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.840
We were scheduled to bring you

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.740
a special on Toto Towers mascot Toto today,

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.840
but due to an accident,

12
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.640
we have inevitably changed the schedule.

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.840
Excuse me. What on earth has happened?

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.340
You see, the thing is...

15
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.940
What? The bomb is inside Toto Tower?

16
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.440
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.940
Just what do you mean? Tell me about it in detail, will you?

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.140
Yes. Just before I got here, there was a small explosion,

19
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.640
and the elevator seems to have stopped.

20
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.540
-What? -It's most likely that

21
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.240
the suspect thinking that the police located the bomb,

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440
used a remote control to set off the explosion.

23
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.840
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

24
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.940
We can't stop the wheel.

25
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.340
It's the same as back then.

26
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.640
I'll go over to the elevator that had stopped and check things out.

27
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.740
No!

28
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.440
That bomb has been set to lure officers there. It's a trap!

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.740
What? A trap?

30
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
I'll be there in 5 minutes, so wait there until I get there.

31
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.540
Understand?

32
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.940
Okay.

33
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.140
Hey, we've got trouble!

34
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
It seems that a girl's been trapped in the elevator that stopped

35
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.640
because of the explosion a while ago.

36
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.540
What?

37
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.940
Officer Sato, a child is in the elevator.

38
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.240
Calm down.

39
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.440
We've still got two hours to go before the predicted time of bombing.

40
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.140
But I'd better go and check things out as soon as possible.

41
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.440
Don't worry.

42
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.740
I'll work something out, so you just stay there.

43
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.440
But...

44
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.240
Listen here, Takagi.

45
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.040
Make sure Miwako stays out of dangerous situations.

46
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.940
I'll rescue that girl. I promise!

47
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.140
But...

48
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.140
Who knows what she might do later.

49
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.440
Understand? This is an order!

50
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.840
You stay there until I get there.

51
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.440
Understand, Officer Takagi?

52
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.740
Hey, Officer Takagi. Can you hear me?

53
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.440
Officer Takagi, answer me!

54
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.140
Hey, Officer Takagi!

55
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140
Officer Takagi!

56
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.540
Please, Officer Takagi! Don't go!

57
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.740
I'm going.

58
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.240
I'm going to check how things are inside.

59
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240
Officer Takagi!

60
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.340
All of you!

61
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.140
I'm going to go inside the tower now,

62
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.940
so you all stay still and wait here, okay?

63
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.240
What?

64
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.040
Understand?

65
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
Yes, sir.

66
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.540
I'll be right back!

67
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.340
I wonder if Officer Takagi is going to be okay.

68
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.340
-Ai, take care of everybody, okay? -What?

69
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.040
-Hey, Conan! -Conan!

70
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.640
What? Are you going too, Conan?

71
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.840
I'm just going to go check how things are.

72
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.940
You guys keep watch and make sure nobody suspicious

73
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.240
comes near this car.

74
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.640
But...

75
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.640
We'll be in big trouble if a bomb is set up on this car again, right?

76
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.540
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

77
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.940
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

78
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.540
Well, I guess.

79
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.040
Leave it to us.

80
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.640
See you!

81
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.340
Be careful, Conan!

82
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.540
According to the report from Officer Takagi,

83
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.840
about 15 minutes ago,

84
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.040
there was a small explosion near the special observatory area.

85
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.640
It seems that one elevator of this observatory is stalled.

86
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.940
Only it hasn't been confirmed whether this explosion

87
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.140
was due to a bomb or an accident.

88
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.340
It much too resembles the case of 3 years ago to be an accident.

89
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.140
True.

90
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.540
There's probably no doubt about it.

91
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.240
Emergency, emergency!

92
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.040
From MPD to all stations.

93
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.640
There is a high possibility that

94
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.340
a bomb has been set at Toto Towers in Minato Ward.

95
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.140
Head to the site on the double

96
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.140
and block off the entrance to Toto Tower.

97
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.540
Secure an evacuation site for the citizens in the vicinity.

98
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.540
Officer Takagi.

99
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.440
Emergency announcement to all visitors.

100
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.140
We are very sorry to announce that we will be closing for the day.

101
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.440
Please follow the instructions of the guide

102
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.940
and leave the tower immediately.

103
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.940
Please remain calm, and move along without rushing.

104
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.840
Excuse me, police. Please let me through!

105
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.940
Please don't panic.

106
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.040
Police! Where's the elevator that stopped?

107
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.540
It's the one at the very end.

108
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.340
Thanks.

109
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.440
Akemi, you'll be fine. Don't be afraid. Come on out.

110
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.040
Police.

111
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.340
This is the elevator that the girl is trap in?

112
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.740
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.340
-It came down from the top floor... -Akemi...

114
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.540
and stopped just before reaching the observatory.

115
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.540
Akemi. What are you doing, Akemi?

116
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.340
Hurry and come out! Come over here!

117
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.840
Akemi!

118
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.340
Only one child was in the elevator

119
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.640
but she's so scared that she won't listen to her mother

120
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.040
telling her to come out.

121
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.640
This space is too small for an adult to get through.

122
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.440
Will you carry me up then?

123
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640
What?

124
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.740
I can make it inside, can't I?

125
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.640
Conan.

126
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.640
We continue to bring you live broadcast news from Toto Tower.

127
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.940
Today, at approximately 9:45 a.m.,

128
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.140
there was an explosion inside Toto Tower.

129
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.940
The cause of the explosion is still unknown.

130
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.740
Fortunately, no casualties have been reported,

131
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.140
but due to the impact of the explosion,

132
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.340
one of the elevators have stopped.

133
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.440
A four years old girl who happened to be on the elevator

134
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.340
is trapped inside.

135
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.040
Presently, while trying to find the cause of the explosion...

136
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.440
Conan, are you all right?

137
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.740
Yes.

138
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.440
Hello, Akemi.

139
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.640
I'm going to go over to you now, so hold on, okay?

140
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.440
Akemi, what a cute teddy bear.

141
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.440
What's its name?

142
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.940
Jam.

143
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.240
What a cute name! Is he a boy?

144
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.140
Yes.

145
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.740
I want to go over and say hello to Jam.

146
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.040
Is it okay?

147
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.540
Yes, it's okay.

148
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.340
I'm going over there, okay?

149
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.440
We just got a report that

150
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.440
a police officer went into the elevator

151
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.940
to rescue the girl that is trapped inside.

152
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.840
What? A child went into the elevator?

153
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.440
It can't be!

154
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.840
And mommy bought me Jam for my birthday.

155
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.040
I see. Since mommy's waiting outside, shall we go?

156
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.240
Yes.

157
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.440
Okay, come. Good girl.

158
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.840
-Mommy! -Akemi!

159
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.140
Mommy!

160
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.640
-Akemi! -Mommy!

161
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.340
Akemi!

162
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.740
-Okay, Conan, now you. -Yes!

163
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.540
Conan!

164
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.840
Gosh!

165
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.140
And? You went off wanting to look cool,

166
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.440
and now you're trapped in the elevator with Conan.

167
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.740
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.940
By the way, are you sure there's no bomb in that elevator?

169
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.340
No, there's nothing that looks like a bomb here in the elevator.

170
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.440
I'm going check the top of the elevator now.

171
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.540
Do you know about where you are now?

172
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.240
Probably...

173
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.440
All the wires seem to have been severed,

174
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.040
so I think with the emergency stop

175
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.040
we are in the middle of the observatory and roof of the tower building.

176
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
Is that right?

177
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.640
I guess I'll have to climb to the ceiling

178
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.940
and wait for the rescue squad.

179
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.040
No, don't climb up to the ceiling!

180
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.640
The mercury lever will operate!

181
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.340
The mercury lever?

182
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.940
Mercury lever?

183
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.140
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

184
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.240
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

185
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.140
Conan, what's a mercury lever?

186
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.940
It's a part of the trigger device of the bomb.

187
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.140
It's a bomb big enough that is capable of

188
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.640
not only blowing up this elevator

189
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.540
but the entire Toto Tower as well.

190
00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:27.862
A bomb?

191
00:10:27.862 --> 00:10:30.562
On the ceiling of this elevator?

192
00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:34.262
Are you sure about that, Conan?

193
00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:39.662
Yes. I saw bombs that looks just like this one on TV.

194
00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:42.762
I heard that if it's just one type of liquid it's okay,

195
00:10:42.762 --> 00:10:44.162
but when it mixes with the other liquid,

196
00:10:44.162 --> 00:10:46.762
it turns into a very strong bomb.

197
00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:48.862
Then, wouldn't it be more the reason

198
00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:51.762
to have the rescue squad come here?

199
00:10:51.762 --> 00:10:55.862
I just said that the mercury lever is set, didn't I?

200
00:10:55.862 --> 00:10:58.762
It's most likely that the switch went on

201
00:10:58.762 --> 00:11:00.662
with the impact of the elevator stopping just a while ago.

202
00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.562
The switch of the trigger device

203
00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:07.362
that will go off with the slightest shake.

204
00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:11.062
So if you climb up to this roof

205
00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:13.362
or if the rescue squad comes down here with a rope,

206
00:11:13.362 --> 00:11:15.662
the minute they set foot on the ground

207
00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:19.362
and even if it shakes just a little bit, it's boom!

208
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:23.962
Is it that strong?

209
00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:25.762
The mercury lever.

210
00:11:27.962 --> 00:11:29.662
Mercury lever...

211
00:11:31.362 --> 00:11:32.962
Just as I thought.

212
00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:34.462
I'm sure that the one who set this up

213
00:11:34.462 --> 00:11:36.962
is the same bomber as three years ago.

214
00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:43.762
Then, don't tell me that...

215
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:49.362
Then, why don't we have them lower a rope from the elevator door above

216
00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:51.362
and we both climb and escape?

217
00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:53.762
I don't think that will work either.

218
00:11:53.762 --> 00:11:54.962
What?

219
00:11:54.962 --> 00:11:59.562
There's wire tap near the bomb.

220
00:11:59.562 --> 00:12:02.062
So, I'm sure that as soon as the bomber

221
00:12:02.062 --> 00:12:04.462
is listening to our conversation from somewhere.

222
00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:07.762
And the minute we leave here and he stops hearing our conversation,

223
00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:10.662
he's planning to turn on the switch and set the bomb off.

224
00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:14.562
Which means we're trapped either way.

225
00:12:14.562 --> 00:12:17.162
No, we still have one way out.

226
00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:23.462
I have to disassemble this bomb.

227
00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:26.862
I need them to lower the bomb disposal tool from above though.

228
00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:31.762
I repeat.

229
00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:33.862
All citizens within the vicinity of Toto Tower,

230
00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:38.262
please follow the instructions of the police and evacuate to safety.

231
00:12:38.262 --> 00:12:41.262
-What? -Are we running away?

232
00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:45.262
Conan and Officer Takagi are still in there.

233
00:12:45.262 --> 00:12:47.962
No need to worry,

234
00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:51.662
because those two are probably heading this way already.

235
00:12:51.662 --> 00:12:55.162
Officer Chiba, please take the children to a safe place.

236
00:12:55.162 --> 00:12:57.362
Okay.

237
00:12:57.362 --> 00:13:01.062
The two are going to dispose of the bomb.

238
00:13:01.062 --> 00:13:03.062
What?

239
00:13:03.062 --> 00:13:05.362
The bomb disposal squad is not even going into the tower

240
00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:09.062
and are waiting for communication,

241
00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.362
so that's what it means, right?

242
00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.162
They'll be okay.

243
00:13:13.162 --> 00:13:15.462
The composition of the bomb is virtually the same as

244
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:20.062
the one that was set up in Beika Central Hospital 3 years ago,

245
00:13:20.062 --> 00:13:22.962
so those two will somehow work something out.

246
00:13:22.962 --> 00:13:24.862
Yes, I guess so.

247
00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:27.862
As long as they don't lend an ear

248
00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:30.662
to the voice of the devil, like 3 years ago...

249
00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:36.562
Let it down slowly.

250
00:13:36.562 --> 00:13:39.262
Easy now, easy.

251
00:13:39.262 --> 00:13:41.562
All right...

252
00:13:44.562 --> 00:13:45.862
Are you all right?

253
00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:47.762
Okay, I got it!

254
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.062
Roger!

255
00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:54.062
We've completed giving the equipment.

256
00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.362
Okay.

257
00:13:55.362 --> 00:13:59.262
Okay, Officer Takagi, let's start.

258
00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:00.562
Yes, sir.

259
00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:02.162
You idiot!

260
00:14:02.162 --> 00:14:05.162
Shape up and stop panicking!

261
00:14:05.162 --> 00:14:08.962
The one who's going to do the actual work is the boy that is with you!

262
00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:11.962
If you get flustered, you may make the boy anxious

263
00:14:11.962 --> 00:14:13.762
and that may call for careless mistakes!

264
00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:14.962
Yes, sir.

265
00:14:14.962 --> 00:14:16.462
Don't worry.

266
00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:18.662
If you take it easy and follow our instructions,

267
00:14:18.662 --> 00:14:20.062
it'll finish in no time at all.

268
00:14:20.062 --> 00:14:21.762
Calm down!

269
00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:23.062
I understand.

270
00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.462
Okay. First of all,

271
00:14:25.462 --> 00:14:27.762
let's start by removing the photosensitive trigger device.

272
00:14:27.762 --> 00:14:29.062
Yes, sir.

273
00:14:29.062 --> 00:14:32.962
We will turn off the elevator lights in a minute from now,

274
00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:35.362
so put on the infrared night scope.

275
00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:42.462
When it gets dark, remove the mercury lever's right side cover.

276
00:14:42.462 --> 00:14:45.162
Be careful not to touch the mercury lever.

277
00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:48.762
First, we remove the cover, right?

278
00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:51.862
Right. We'll turn off the lights now.

279
00:14:53.262 --> 00:14:55.562
Did you get that, Conan?

280
00:14:58.562 --> 00:15:00.762
Conan?

281
00:15:00.762 --> 00:15:03.462
Here it is. The light sensitive tube.

282
00:15:03.462 --> 00:15:06.062
If I cut the cord...

283
00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:11.162
What a relief.

284
00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:13.362
Conan, can you hear me?

285
00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:16.462
Yes! I can hear you, so keep on going.

286
00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:18.462
Yeah.

287
00:15:18.462 --> 00:15:19.862
Let's see.

288
00:15:19.862 --> 00:15:23.362
If you take off the cover, you can see a lot of machines, right?

289
00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:27.162
Just above those machines, you should see a device that moves

290
00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:30.662
when it detects light called a light sensitive tube.

291
00:15:30.662 --> 00:15:33.062
First of all, cut the cord

292
00:15:33.062 --> 00:15:34.562
that is sticking out of the light sensitive tube.

293
00:15:34.562 --> 00:15:36.662
Then, I turn this...

294
00:15:39.362 --> 00:15:41.762
Electricity's flowing!

295
00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:43.862
Watch out, watch out.

296
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.162
Okay, then. I'll place the plastic plate in this space

297
00:15:46.162 --> 00:15:49.062
and use it as a stopper.

298
00:15:49.062 --> 00:15:50.962
Stopper?

299
00:15:50.962 --> 00:15:53.662
Come to think of it, that code...

300
00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:57.462
"No use getting ready a good stopper", that's what it said.

301
00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:02.562
Good stopper probably means earned run average.

302
00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:07.962
But, why a major leaguer?

303
00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:09.862
This is Japan.

304
00:16:09.862 --> 00:16:12.262
He could've just written pro baseball player.

305
00:16:14.462 --> 00:16:16.162
Wait a sec.

306
00:16:16.162 --> 00:16:20.162
Extended game... earned run average...

307
00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:23.162
Turn over... Major Leaguer...

308
00:16:24.062 --> 00:16:27.562
Don't tell me that the other bomb is located at...

309
00:16:30.462 --> 00:16:33.162
There's still a lot of time,

310
00:16:33.162 --> 00:16:35.562
but unless I figure out where it is...

311
00:16:39.862 --> 00:16:41.262
Now listen, Conan.

312
00:16:41.262 --> 00:16:43.062
When you're finished what you're doing, next...

313
00:16:43.062 --> 00:16:45.862
Hey, Officer Takagi.

314
00:16:45.862 --> 00:16:47.662
What is it, Conan?

315
00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:50.862
I have something I want to discuss with you.

316
00:16:55.362 --> 00:16:57.062
Hey, what's going on?

317
00:16:57.062 --> 00:16:59.262
Now, it's the helicopters of the TV stations!

318
00:16:59.262 --> 00:17:02.062
I wonder if something's happened after all.

319
00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:03.962
Hey!

320
00:17:03.962 --> 00:17:04.962
Crap!

321
00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:08.262
We're having a test now. Be quiet.

322
00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:11.062
The time now is 11:40.

323
00:17:11.062 --> 00:17:15.162
There is less than 20 minutes to go before the bomb is to go off.

324
00:17:15.162 --> 00:17:18.962
The boy and the police officer who are trapped together with the bom

325
00:17:18.962 --> 00:17:21.262
have not been rescued yet.

326
00:17:21.262 --> 00:17:23.562
Time is definitely ticking away.

327
00:17:23.562 --> 00:17:27.762
What will become of the boy and police officer?

328
00:17:27.762 --> 00:17:32.862
Will they perish together with the symbol of Tokyo?

329
00:17:34.862 --> 00:17:37.662
What? He can't cut the cord?

330
00:17:37.662 --> 00:17:40.162
There are only three more left!

331
00:17:40.162 --> 00:17:44.162
First, the yellow cord to switch off the liquid crystal panel.

332
00:17:44.162 --> 00:17:47.462
Next, the white cord that is connected to the mercury lever.

333
00:17:47.462 --> 00:17:50.162
And the black telephone cord that is set there

334
00:17:50.162 --> 00:17:53.462
for remote control manipulation.

335
00:17:53.462 --> 00:17:55.862
If you cut it in that order, the bomb will stop completely.

336
00:17:57.062 --> 00:18:00.262
How come you can't do that when you've already gone that far?

337
00:18:00.262 --> 00:18:01.462
Give me that!

338
00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:03.262
Officer Takagi! Just what are you doing?

339
00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:05.762
Hurry! Hurry and cut it!

340
00:18:05.762 --> 00:18:08.562
No. We can't cut it.

341
00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:11.962
What are you talking about? You've only got 10 minutes left.

342
00:18:11.962 --> 00:18:14.462
"To the brave police officer."

343
00:18:14.462 --> 00:18:15.762
What?

344
00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:19.962
"In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize.

345
00:18:19.962 --> 00:18:24.262
A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

346
00:18:24.262 --> 00:18:27.862
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

347
00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:30.262
With best wishes."

348
00:18:30.262 --> 00:18:35.562
Conan says these are the words that are displayed on the LCD panel.

349
00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:39.762
I would at least like to get Conan to evacuate somehow,

350
00:18:39.762 --> 00:18:40.962
but in order to specify the other place where the bomb is set

351
00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:42.362
and to avoid a large number of casualties,

352
00:18:42.362 --> 00:18:44.262
there seems to be no other choice

353
00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:46.662
than for Conan to look at the hint

354
00:18:46.662 --> 00:18:52.362
and for me to relay the location by phone.

355
00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:56.862
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:58.162 --> 00:18:59.862
Officer Takagi.

357
00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:04.462
But you understand, don't you?

358
00:19:07.362 --> 00:19:08.562
Stupid.

359
00:19:11.162 --> 00:19:12.662
4 minutes to go!

360
00:19:12.662 --> 00:19:14.962
There's only 4 more minutes till the bomb goes off.

361
00:19:14.962 --> 00:19:17.562
The timer has not been stopped yet.

362
00:19:17.562 --> 00:19:20.262
Mr. Bomber. If you are watching this broadcast,

363
00:19:20.262 --> 00:19:23.862
please stop the timer, please!

364
00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:27.162
If you have a tinge of conscience left in you.

365
00:19:29.562 --> 00:19:31.062
Heck with conscience...

366
00:19:32.862 --> 00:19:37.262
I still can't believe that it's all working out so well.

367
00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:39.762
Then, why don't you pick the broadcast of the TV on radio

368
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:42.362
and listen to our heroic story?

369
00:19:45.762 --> 00:19:48.462
The timer of the bomb is still moving.

370
00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:51.062
-What? -Mr. Bomber, are you watching?

371
00:19:51.062 --> 00:19:54.762
Don't tell me the remote control didn't work right!

372
00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:58.162
Let them be. We got the money already besides.

373
00:19:58.162 --> 00:20:01.862
I'm going to go tell the police how to...

374
00:20:01.862 --> 00:20:03.162
Hey!

375
00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:04.862
Stop the bomb!

376
00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:06.462
Hey! Wait!

377
00:20:17.162 --> 00:20:18.962
The police...

378
00:20:18.962 --> 00:20:23.162
Those cops took advantage of his conscience

379
00:20:23.162 --> 00:20:25.462
and killed him.

380
00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:29.762
I feel sorry for the brat.

381
00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:31.462
But if the bomb goes off, the police will be blamed

382
00:20:31.462 --> 00:20:33.162
for not being able to save the kid.

383
00:20:33.162 --> 00:20:35.762
If they go chicken and stop the bomb before it explodes,

384
00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:39.362
they lose the hint and a greater number of casualties is inevitable.

385
00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:46.062
I'm going to make this public to the media

386
00:20:46.062 --> 00:20:50.862
and colossal blunder of the police will be exposed in broad daylight.

387
00:20:50.862 --> 00:20:54.662
Either way, the cops are done for.

388
00:21:00.262 --> 00:21:03.962
I see. That code had such a meaning.

389
00:21:05.962 --> 00:21:09.562
If you talk too loud, the bomber will hear us.

390
00:21:11.262 --> 00:21:13.862
But there are more than 400 places in Tokyo

391
00:21:13.862 --> 00:21:16.362
that fit into that category.

392
00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:22.962
Yes. It would be impossible to check all the places from now

393
00:21:22.962 --> 00:21:24.762
without the bomber noticing.

394
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:29.162
If we try to evacuate all the people

395
00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:31.362
that are at the more than 400 locations...

396
00:21:31.362 --> 00:21:33.362
Judging from the bomber's character,

397
00:21:33.362 --> 00:21:36.062
he will probably turn the switch on using remote control.

398
00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:40.962
In other words, to definitely save everybody...

399
00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:42.762
We've no other choice

400
00:21:42.762 --> 00:21:45.262
but to look at the hint pinpoint the location

401
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:48.062
and look for the bomb.

402
00:21:48.062 --> 00:21:52.062
Just like Officer Matsuda did, right?

403
00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.562
Yes.

404
00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:54.962
And besides,

405
00:21:54.962 --> 00:21:58.062
the person that I don't want to let die no matter what,

406
00:21:58.062 --> 00:22:01.562
one who is very precious to me may be there.

407
00:22:03.562 --> 00:22:06.462
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

408
00:22:06.462 --> 00:22:08.562
It's okay.

409
00:22:08.562 --> 00:22:11.062
Hey, Conan.

410
00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:14.762
While you're at it, tell me one more thing, will you?

411
00:22:14.762 --> 00:22:19.362
Who on earth are you?

412
00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:23.362
If you want to know...

413
00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:27.662
I'll tell you...

414
00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:35.662
In the world beyond.

415
00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:38.062
The two have not been rescued yet.

416
00:22:38.062 --> 00:22:39.862
There is only a minute left.

417
00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:41.462
The seconds are ticking away!

418
00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:44.162
Hey! What's going on?

419
00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:47.362
Conan and Officer Takagi are still inside!

420
00:22:47.362 --> 00:22:49.262
Oh, well...

421
00:22:49.262 --> 00:22:51.162
It seems that the members of the riot task force

422
00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.662
has also been ordered to evacuate!

423
00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:56.362
-What? -Take the car back to Toto Tower!

424
00:22:56.362 --> 00:22:58.062
Hey, it's dangerous, dangerous!

425
00:22:58.062 --> 00:23:00.062
Take the car back! Hey, Chiba!

426
00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:01.962
Take the car back! Take it back!

427
00:23:01.962 --> 00:23:04.262
They listened to it.

428
00:23:04.262 --> 00:23:07.762
The same words of the devil, as 3 years ago...

429
00:23:13.862 --> 00:23:16.362
But I know you guys, the Youth Detective Squad,

430
00:23:16.362 --> 00:23:18.862
will be able to take care of things even if I'm not around, right?

431
00:23:18.862 --> 00:23:21.262
Conan!

432
00:23:23.162 --> 00:23:25.262
15 seconds to go.

433
00:23:25.262 --> 00:23:27.762
Are you ready, Officer Takagi?

434
00:23:27.762 --> 00:23:29.062
Yeah.

435
00:23:29.062 --> 00:23:32.562
I wrote all your deductions in the mail.

436
00:23:32.562 --> 00:23:35.262
All I have left to do now is to punch in the hint you're going to read

437
00:23:35.262 --> 00:23:36.662
and send it out.

438
00:23:38.062 --> 00:23:39.662
It's going to be coming out soon.

439
00:23:39.662 --> 00:23:41.362
The first letter is...

440
00:23:41.362 --> 00:23:42.662
The letter...

441
00:23:42.662 --> 00:23:44.262
E...

442
00:23:44.262 --> 00:23:45.762
V...

443
00:23:45.762 --> 00:23:47.262
I...

444
00:23:47.262 --> 00:23:48.262
T...

445
00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:50.462
No!

446
00:23:58.662 --> 00:24:01.562
Get out of there...

447
00:24:01.562 --> 00:24:03.462
Get out of there, Ran!

448
00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:07.162
Shinichi?

449
00:24:09.462 --> 00:24:10.762
Ran!
