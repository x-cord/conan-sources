1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,940
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,640
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,240
Investigation with Aya Ueto!

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,640
The promise Shinichi made with her

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,340
is recollected along with an old lady's sad memory.

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,840
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,209
"Beika Station" -What? Are you serious?

10
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,009
Yeah! It was Suwa and Kobayashi.

11
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,609
-I can't believe it! -Yeah, but it's true!

12
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:02,709
Yuki.

13
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:05,309
You're the guy in the tennis club.

14
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:06,909
Kitada?

15
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,109
Yuki.

16
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,409
Hey!

17
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,909
Kitada!

18
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,809
Kitada?

19
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,609
Kitada.

20
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,909
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"

21
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,609
"Oka High School"

22
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,009
Deduction is all about formula.

23
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,209
As long as I applied the right formula,

24
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,109
I can find the answer.

25
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,009
"Beika Park"

26
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,509
Just like I thought!

27
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,809
You know, I knew you were the one.

28
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,109
Now, this is the right answer.

29
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,109
"Aya Ueto and Shinichi, The Promise from 4 Years Ago"

30
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:36,109
"Kudo"

31
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:38,409
It's a beautiful spring day today.

32
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,609
And a young, pretty girls like us are dusting.

33
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,709
She is evil!

34
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,709
Because your mother-in-law makes you clean her house

35
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,309
while she's out for something! She is evil. She is!

36
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,409
Oh, god.

37
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:54,609
Please, you gotta stop talking about the wife and-mother-in-law thing!

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,509
I'm doing this because I wanted to do.

39
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,409
And also I never asked you to do it either!

40
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,509
Well, yeah.

41
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,309
Anyway, look at them.

42
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,509
They're all books!

43
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,809
It's "The Dark Baron: Night Baron"

44
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:19,409
Yusaku Kudo's books are around here?

45
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,109
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"

46
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,709
It's "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook".

47
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,709
"TV Drama, appearance: Aya Ueto" -I think...

48
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,309
It was on TV before, right?

49
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,509
Yeah, I know! It was a two-hour drama!

50
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,209
It's my dad's work in his early years.

51
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,809
It's kinda cheesy, especially if I read it now.

52
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:40,509
Look.

53
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,309
-Isn't she Aya Ueto? -Oh, that.

54
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,009
She and her manager actually came to talk with Shinichi's parents

55
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,909
because she was going to be starring for the first time.

56
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,809
Yeah, I think you told me that before.

57
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,709
When was it?

58
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:58,709
That was when I was 13 years old, so it was 4 years ago.

59
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,109
I was a fan of hers of Aya,

60
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,409
and Shinichi told me that she's coming to his house,

61
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,309
So I went up to Shinichi's house to get her autograph.

62
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,309
But Shinichi wasn't paying attention to her really.

63
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,209
He was actually playing with a soccer ball.

64
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,209
And I remember that

65
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:17,909
she had a serious look on her face when she looked at him.

66
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,609
So, I asked him what they were talking about.

67
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:22,709
And he said?

68
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,509
Nothing.

69
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,909
But, I'm kinda curious about what they were talking about.

70
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,209
Shinichi.

71
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,809
Maybe he was asking her out?

72
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,609
Sonoko! You!

73
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:38,509
How is that possible?

74
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,409
-Somebody's here! -Yeah.

75
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,409
"Kudo" -Yes?

76
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,909
Is Mr. Shinichi Kudo there?

77
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,309
Me?

78
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:50,209
A young girl?

79
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,209
Shinichi is not home right now.

80
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,409
Excuse me, who is this?

81
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,209
A young girl, huh?

82
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,309
My name is Ueto...

83
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:04,909
I'm Aya Ueto!

84
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,209
What?

85
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,509
Aya Ueto?

86
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:20,809
It's for real!

87
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,209
It's really Aya Ueto!

88
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,809
Do you remember me?

89
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,609
Yes, you are Ran Mouri.

90
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,109
You are Shinichi's friend from childhood, right?

91
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,209
Yeah!

92
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,409
She is my friend...

93
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,109
I'm Sonoko Suzuki!

94
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,009
Nice to meet you!

95
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,109
Nice to meet you too!

96
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,009
And he is Conan.

97
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,209
-Hi, there! -Hello.

98
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,809
Look. Somebody is getting shy!

99
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,409
Shut up!

100
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,809
So, when is Shinichi coming back?

101
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,409
We don't know that actually.

102
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,409
He never came back since he left for the investigation of a criminal case.

103
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,509
You came here to see Shinichi?

104
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,709
Is it about some investigation?

105
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:06,409
Yes, indeed. Is it possible for you to call him?

106
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:10,709
Well, it's always the answering machine when we call him.

107
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:12,609
But let me give a try.

108
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:14,309
Thank you.

109
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,209
He's not gonna answer because I'm here.

110
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,909
Hey! If it's about an investigation, why don't you ask Kogoro Mouri?

111
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,609
I don't think you should!

112
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,409
-Why not? -Because he has been having a major hangover this morning!

113
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,809
Man, he's helpless.

114
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:30,609
It's the answering machine again.

115
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,109
Is that so?

116
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:33,309
Then, what should I do?

117
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,109
Why don't you leave him a message?

118
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:39,509
Shinichi might call you back later. You never know, right?

119
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,009
You're right. Would you like to tell us what happened?

120
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,609
Okay.

121
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,609
There is an old lady named Fumie Koda in my neighborhood.

122
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:52,009
She's 80 years old and living alone.

123
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,609
She's actually a good friend of mine,

124
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:57,609
so I often go to her house on my day off.

125
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:00,409
And just like always, I went to her house this noon.

126
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,709
Grandma! It's Aya! I'm coming in.

127
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,009
Grandma?

128
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,009
I'm came to visit.

129
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,609
Grandma?

130
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,609
It's weird.

131
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,709
Where did she go?

132
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,909
She often leaves her house without locking the door,

133
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,709
and I thought she did it again.

134
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,109
So I waited for her a while, but...

135
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,009
But she didn't come back?

136
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,609
Right. I started worrying about her

137
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,009
So I went to a grocery store near the house.

138
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,109
And asked...

139
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:36,309
She just passed by a while ago.

140
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,809
So I asked her where she was going.

141
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,609
She said she's going to Beika-cho.

142
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:40,709
Beika-cho?

143
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,809
Yeah. She answered me and just left!

144
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,209
She had this serious look on her face

145
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,809
and she was acting strange as well.

146
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,409
I was kind of worried about her.

147
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,309
I was worried so I came to Beika-cho by taxi.

148
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,609
But I don't know why Grandma came to this town,

149
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,609
so I have no clue where to look for her.

150
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:02,309
Suddenly, I remembered about Shinichi.

151
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,309
It was 4 years ago when I met him.

152
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,209
And I just remembered, now he's a famous high school detective,

153
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,609
and he's also living in this town...

154
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:14,209
-That's why you visited here, right? -Right.

155
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,709
Also, he and I had a...

156
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:17,709
What?

157
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,309
No, it's nothing.

158
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,609
Do you know if she has a friend in Beika-cho?

159
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,209
No, I don't know.

160
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,409
Well then, I'll send a text message to Shinichi's cell-phone

161
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,809
about what happened today, just in case, okay?

162
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,609
What else do you know about this old lady?

163
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:35,709
What?

164
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,209
The more information you have, the closer you get to solving the case.

165
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,709
Shinichi used to say that.

166
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,109
Okay. What else...

167
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:49,109
Grandma lost her daughter who fell ill when she was young, I heard.

168
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,809
Lost her daughter?

169
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:56,209
It was half a year ago, that I heard about it from Grandma's best friend.

170
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,309
It was when Fumie was 40 years old, I remember.

171
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:02,909
She had a sick daughter, Ayako, who was only 17 years old.

172
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:07,709
Fumie was a single mother, so she worked and raised Ayako.

173
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,009
That day also, she was working from morning.

174
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,309
While she was away, Ayako's condition turned bad suddenly.

175
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,909
By the time Fumie got to the hospital room,

176
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,609
Ayako was already...

177
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,909
Fumie regretted the fact that she couldn't be with her daughter

178
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,509
at the moment of her death.

179
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,809
"Ayako Koda" -She blames herself for Ayako's death, I think.

180
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,509
I never knew that.

181
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,409
You know, Fumie never talks about this to anyone.

182
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,609
Actually, you look like Ayako somehow.

183
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,409
The name is similar too.

184
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,009
That must be why she took a special liking to you.

185
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,209
I'm home!

186
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,309
Sorry, it took me long. There were so many things to buy!

187
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,409
Welcome back!

188
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,209
Gotta keep it a secret, okay?

189
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,409
Okay.

190
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,809
Grandma was always smiling.

191
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,509
I never knew she went through so much before.

192
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,109
She was 17 years old, that's around our age.

193
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:06,509
It must have been hard for the old lady.

194
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,109
And as well as for her daughter.

195
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,409
If I remember correctly, her daughter loved classical music,

196
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,509
especially Mozart.

197
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,809
I'm not sure whether this old lady's daughter

198
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,109
has something to do with this case.

199
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:21,509
Maybe we need to see this case from a different angle.

200
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,609
The main power of the TV was on

201
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:27,009
when you went in to the living room, right?

202
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:30,209
You think Grandma was watching TV until she left the house?

203
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,709
Yes, I think so,

204
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,409
because the TV schedule in the newspaper was left open.

205
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,309
Was the tea left unfinished?

206
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,809
Then, maybe Grandma was impelled by some kind of sudden thought

207
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,409
while watching TV, and then left the house.

208
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,809
Do you know which channel it was?

209
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,209
Actually, I do know.

210
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,509
While I was waiting for Grandma...

211
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,009
Nichiuri TV.

212
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,909
Nichiuri TV. It was Nichiuri TV, right?

213
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,609
-Yes. -Conan?

214
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:01,609
I was just trying to find out which TV show she was watching.

215
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:04,409
You know, there's no newspaper in Shinichi's house.

216
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,609
So you're gonna call someone and ask, right?

217
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,009
-No! -What do you mean no?

218
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,609
What? You even can do it?

219
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:14,209
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook (Rerun)"

220
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,909
Hey! That's what we were talking about a while ago!

221
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,509
Is this TV drama, "Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"?

222
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,509
They're airing a rerun of it.

223
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,109
-Yeah, you're right! -I didn't know that.

224
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:29,409
The main actor of the TV show didn't know that it was on TV?

225
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:30,609
Wait a sec.

226
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:33,709
I think the shooting of this TV drama was in Beika-cho.

227
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,609
Yeah. It was at Beika Station, Beika Park

228
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,609
and Shunichi Shitara Memorial House also.

229
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,909
Yeah! It was the one in the old western mansion, wasn't it?

230
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,109
Yes.

231
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,109
It was a musician's house 10 years ago, but since he passed away,

232
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,209
his wife who was also a pianist

233
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,709
made it the memorial house of her husband.

234
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,509
Aya, in that episode, you were attacked by the murderer,

235
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,609
and got locked in the basement in the mansion, right?

236
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:55,609
That's right!

237
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,909
But we only used the exterior of the mansion.

238
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,709
We actually used the set when we were shooting inside.

239
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:00,809
You did?

240
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,109
I got it!

241
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,909
I think I know why Grandma came to Beika-cho!

242
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,609
-Yeah? -Are you serious, Sonoko?

243
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:12,109
Yeah. The female high school detective Sonoko Suzuki's deduction is...

244
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,009
Always right!

245
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,109
Is she all right?

246
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,656
Okay, listen.

247
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:31,256
I think Grandma could not distinguish between

248
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,656
TV drama and reality.

249
00:13:32,656 --> 00:13:34,556
-What? -What do you mean?

250
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:37,856
Perhaps, when she was looking at the TV listing in the newspaper,

251
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,656
she found Aya's name.

252
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,856
So she watched this TV drama, from the beginning of the show.

253
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:42,956
"Female High School Detective Yuki's Casebook"

254
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,556
However, she fell asleep in the middle of the show.

255
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:50,456
And then, when she woke up as the show approached the end.

256
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,956
On TV, Aya was being attacked by someone,

257
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,756
and got locked up in the basement of the mansion.

258
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:58,856
Because she just woke up, her brain wasn't functioning properly,

259
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,856
and she thought that it was happening for real.

260
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,456
Thus, she rushed out of her house, to save Aya.

261
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:07,956
That's why she came to Beika-cho!

262
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:11,456
Well, if so, then she wouldn't turn off the TV, would she?

263
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,756
-What? -It's clear that she turned off the TV.

264
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,656
That means, she knew that it was a TV program...

265
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,756
Shut up! Such a minor thing doesn't matter!

266
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:20,956
Here!

267
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:26,156
Anyway, Grandma should be in the memorial house.

268
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,256
She must be!

269
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,956
What do you think, Aya?

270
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:33,556
Man, only Sonoko can make a deduction like that.

271
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:37,356
But in fact, it is true that the old lady was watching the drama.

272
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,956
The reason she came to Beika-cho

273
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,356
should have something with the TV drama.

274
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,056
What was she going to do?

275
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,856
Guys, we should head down to the memorial house,

276
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,956
rather than stay here thinking!

277
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:48,656
That's right, let's go.

278
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,156
Yes, this old lady came here a while ago.

279
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:55,856
See? My deduction was right!

280
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,456
So, she's still inside?

281
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:01,256
No. She left here about 10 minutes ago.

282
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:03,556
-She left? -We just missed her.

283
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:07,556
Maybe she went out to look for you Aya because you weren't here.

284
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,956
Do you remember how did granny look?

285
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,556
Right when she came,

286
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:14,756
she was looking up at the window of the 2nd floor for a while.

287
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:18,956
And then she said to me "May I come in?", so I said "yes".

288
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:21,856
It doesn't sound like she came here to save Aya.

289
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,356
Then, what was it?

290
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:27,856
She left here 10 minutes ago, so she may be around here still!

291
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,756
Do you know which way she went?

292
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,156
Yes, she went that way.

293
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,556
I'll go and look for her!

294
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,656
Wait! We should go with her!

295
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,156
Yeah!

296
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,556
How did she look when she left here?

297
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:42,356
Actually, she looked as if she saw something unbelievable.

298
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,356
I talked to her but she didn't respond and just left.

299
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,356
Thank you!

300
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:51,356
Wait a sec.

301
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,556
Maybe there's some clue left in this house.

302
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:55,956
May I go in?

303
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,356
Sure.

304
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,156
"Music Room"

305
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:16,756
That's...

306
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:18,956
the old ward of Beika Hospital.

307
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:23,856
Her daughter loved classical music, especially Mozart.

308
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,256
Maybe...

309
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,556
Ayako, I'm sorry.

310
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,856
I'll be there soon.

311
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:49,656
It's no good!

312
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,756
Granny! Granny!

313
00:16:58,656 --> 00:16:59,756
Darn!

314
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,056
Maybe Fumie is on her way home.

315
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,156
Yeah.

316
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,256
It's Shinichi!

317
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,656
-Hello? -Ran!

318
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,356
I got your message. Where are you right now?

319
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:17,556
I'm right in front of the Shitara Memorial House.

320
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:20,756
Okay, you need to ask Mrs. Shitara to play Mozart right now, got that?

321
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,056
Mozart?

322
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,356
-Yeah! You need to hurry! -I'll go!

323
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:25,556
Sonoko just went...

324
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:26,856
Okay, now I need to talk to Aya!

325
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,156
What?

326
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,656
It's Shinichi.

327
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:32,356
Excuse me. Hello, it's Aya.

328
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:37,156
Aya, Fumie is right now in front of the old ward of Beika Hospital!

329
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,256
Beika Hospital?

330
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,656
You need to go there!

331
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:42,356
Fumie is trying to kill herself!

332
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:52,056
You have to make it, please!

333
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,556
Aya, the Beika Hospital was where Fumie's daughter

334
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,756
was staying at before she died.

335
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:23,556
Perhaps, she heard Mozart

336
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:27,156
that Mr. Shitara was playing in his house.

337
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:30,456
And that melody was the only thing that could ease Ayako's mind.

338
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:33,056
Fumie used to see Shitara's residence from the window of the Ayako's ward.

339
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:35,656
And it was the same scene that she saw on the TV drama today.

340
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:40,156
Fumie was surprised and panicked.

341
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:43,156
So she got out of her house and headed to Beika-cho.

342
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,156
And there, she saw the old ward of Beika Hospital

343
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,456
from the Shitara Memorial House.

344
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:52,456
Perhaps, she couldn't believe what she actually saw there.

345
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:56,456
Because the hospital ward had been kept just like it used to be.

346
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:58,256
This way!

347
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,956
Fumie left the memorial house and headed to the old hospital.

348
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:03,656
As she stood in front of the old hospital ward,

349
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:07,656
the painful past of having lost her daughter came back to her.

350
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:11,056
She thinks that it was her fault that Ayako died.

351
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:14,756
And now, she is trying to die, to see her daughter in heaven.

352
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,056
There is only one person who can stop her.

353
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,656
Aya, it is you!

354
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,056
Only me?

355
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:27,456
Grandma!

356
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:34,856
Ayako?

357
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:38,356
There is only one person who can stop her.

358
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:40,256
Aya, it is you!

359
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:47,556
Mom, I lived only 17 years, but I was happy.

360
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:48,656
What?

361
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:53,156
I was really happy because you were my mom.

362
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:55,756
I just wanted to tell you that.

363
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,256
Ayako.

364
00:19:57,256 --> 00:20:00,056
So, please don't die now, Mom.

365
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:02,556
You have to live for me, please.

366
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,756
Okay.

367
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:09,156
I will, Ayako. Thank you.

368
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:14,356
Grandma!

369
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,756
Aya?

370
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,156
Grandma.

371
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:21,056
Ayako came here to see me, just now.

372
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:25,956
She came and forgave me.

373
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,656
That's good, Grandma.

374
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:30,156
That's good.

375
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,156
Ran!

376
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,756
You found her.

377
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,056
Shinichi,

378
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:43,956
I think I fulfilled the promise that we made 4 years ago.

379
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:47,756
Yeah. I think I fulfilled my promise as well.

380
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,856
You are good at soccer.

381
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,556
You are gonna be a soccer player?

382
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,056
No, I will be a detective.

383
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:54,156
Detective?

384
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,056
Like Holmes.

385
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,756
You mean Sherlock Holmes?

386
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,356
Yeah, but a high school detective, before that.

387
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,956
It's not nothing like childish play.

388
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:03,756
A real detective's what I'm gonna be.

389
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,556
Do you wanna make a promise?

390
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:11,356
Next time we see each other, maybe 4 or 5 years later.

391
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,656
I will be a real actress,

392
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,256
and you will be a real detective.

393
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,356
Yeah, sure thing.

394
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:23,156
Anyway, how did you grasp the situation only by the text message?

395
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,156
Well, deduction is about formula.

396
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:28,356
I get the answer as long as I applied the right formula.

397
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,656
All right, take care.

398
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,656
Yeah, you too.

399
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,556
Ran!

400
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,856
Conan!

401
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,656
No wonder it took forever to find you guys!

402
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:42,056
Hey, you found the granny.

403
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,056
Kid, what are you doing there?

404
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,856
You can't come up here, can you?

405
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,456
It's so funny.

406
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,456
You!

407
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,156
Ran, Sonoko, thank you.

408
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:56,956
And you too, Conan. Thank you!

409
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,956
You're welcome!

410
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,156
Now, Grandma, shall we go home?

411
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,156
Okay.

412
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,256
Here.

413
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,256
Come and see us anytime.

414
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,256
Yes.

415
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:07,556
-Good bye. -Good bye.

416
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:10,456
Conan! Take care!

417
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,256
Bye-bye!

418
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:15,256
It was fantastic acting!

419
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,956
So the case ended happily.

420
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,056
But ever since that day...

421
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,356
God, not again.

422
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:54,256
What was that promise you guys made 4 years ago? Tell me, Shinichi!

423
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:58,056
There will be no call to Ran for a while.

424
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:02,356
"Next Episode"

425
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:07,156
Which means his father is not near him?

426
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,156
"I thought there was only one fish but there are three."

427
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,156
"How lucky the fish are."

428
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,356
I wonder what in the world happened.

429
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:14,656
I don't understand the fourth mail though.

430
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:18,356
Die like a fish caught in fishing net?

431
00:24:24,156 --> 00:24:29,756
Next Conan, "Pursue the Fish Mail"

432
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,941
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:35,241
"Three fish"

434
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,941
What's the best part of this year's movie episode?

435
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,441
My swimsuit scene!

436
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,687
Was there such scene in it?
