1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to the deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,140
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,940
Today, the case takes place in Osaka.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,240
It's an exciting case at "K3".

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:59,253
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,453
What?

10
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,753
A party for a restaurant's opening?

11
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,353
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:07,853
Actually, it was my mom and dad that got invited,

13
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:10,353
but they both came down with a cold and said they can't go,

14
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:13,653
so I thought I'd invite you guys.

15
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,453
I mean, after all,

16
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:19,353
three famous athletes from America

17
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:22,953
are opening a restaurant here in Japan, everyone here's so excited!

18
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:25,053
-Hey, listen. -What is it?

19
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,053
Where's the party going to be?

20
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,353
Over here, of course!

21
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,353
In Osaka, where else?

22
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,353
I pass.

23
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:34,353
That was fast.

24
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:35,953
Come on, just for a little while.

25
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:39,953
Sorry, but I've got research to do back here.

26
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:42,153
I'm back!

27
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,653
Hi.

28
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,553
Who are you talking to?

29
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:48,253
It's Dr. Agasa.

30
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:52,353
He's repairing some earring mobile phones for me.

31
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:55,253
What's the matter? Did somebody come back?

32
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:58,553
If this is a bad time, do you want me to call you back later?

33
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,553
No, never mind, it's all right.

34
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,553
Are you sure?

35
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,753
Anyway, don't turn me down so fast.

36
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:12,853
You're going to be able to see famous athletes in the flesh.

37
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:15,353
There's pro boxer Ricardo Balera,

38
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:17,753
Mike Norwood the Major Leaguer

39
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:19,153
and...

40
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:30,953
"The 3K's Incident in Osaka (Part 1)"

41
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,053
Look at that, they're all here!

42
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,953
There's Mai Kuraki,

43
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:47,353
Miho Komatsu,

44
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:50,553
and Two Mix

45
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,153
and then, the love of my life,

46
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:56,653
Yoko Okino!

47
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,453
Don't talk so loud, dad!

48
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,153
You're being so obvious.

49
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:06,753
And what about you? You brought an autograph board with you.

50
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:18,253
Are you sure it's all right, Kazuha?

51
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,153
I'm mean there are so many famous people here

52
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,853
and we weren't officially invited, should we be here at all?

53
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,453
Don't worry about it.

54
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,353
Besides, your dad's a famous person, too.

55
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,553
I wonder.

56
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:31,053
I have a bigger problem than that.

57
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,853
Has Heiji done something?

58
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:36,753
He's been acting strange.

59
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,253
What do you mean?

60
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:40,253
He was whispering to someone on the telephone

61
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,053
and he said, "Are you alone now?",

62
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,753
"Are you sure no one's caught on?", and

63
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,853
"If this is a bad time, do you want me to call back later?", things like that.

64
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,553
You don't mean...

65
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:52,153
I do, he's having an affair.

66
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:55,753
I'm sure that Heiji's been taken in by some floozy.

67
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:59,653
Maybe he's told her to come here.

68
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:03,053
That was me, he was talking to me on the phone.

69
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,053
It's finally starting.

70
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:11,753
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting.

71
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:15,953
It is my honor to introduce the three stars of tonight's party

72
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:19,653
who also happen to be the owners of this World Restaurant K3!

73
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,853
First, the undefeated former world middleweight champion!

74
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:28,053
"Ricardo Balera (36)" -Mr. Ricardo Balera!

75
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:31,953
Next the pitcher who received the 160 kilometer Cy Young trophy,

76
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:34,053
Mr. Mike Norwood!

77
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,553
"Mike Norwood (45)"

78
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,853
And the man fearfully known as Europe's steel stronghold,

79
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:42,753
the famous goalkeeper,

80
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:44,353
Mr. Ray Curtis!

81
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:47,553
"Ray Curtis (37)"

82
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,153
This is great!

83
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:50,453
It's the real things!

84
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,553
Well, aren't you glad you came?

85
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:00,053
Yeah.

86
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:04,153
And now I'd like to ask these three men some questions.

87
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:08,053
Why did you decide to open a restaurant in Japan?

88
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:12,253
Why did you choose to open your restaraunt in Japan?

89
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:17,253
The reason is, to the three of us,

90
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,553
Japan is our second home.

91
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,553
He speaks Japanese.

92
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,353
My wife,

93
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:26,153
as well as Mike's,

94
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,753
is Japanese.

95
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:31,953
And as for Ricardo, he's crazy about ninjas and samurais!

96
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:39,353
By the way, about the K in the restaurant's name,

97
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,853
I imagine it stands for king, doesn't it?

98
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,153
No, no. You're mistaken.

99
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,353
The first K stands for knock out.

100
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:48,953
It's the K from K.O.

101
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:52,453
The second K is for strikeout.

102
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,253
K for strikeout.

103
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:59,053
The third K is for goal keeper.

104
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,053
It's the K in keeper.

105
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,053
I see.

106
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:05,753
Haven't you forgotten another one, Ray?

107
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:10,153
You know it very well.

108
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:14,253
It's a Japanese word that describes perfectly men

109
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,753
like you who are smeared with scandal.

110
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:20,253
"Ed McKay (48), Reporter" -K for "kitanai". (Dirty)

111
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,253
Hey, Ed. Watch your language, get out!

112
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:25,253
Mike, what did he say?

113
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:29,053
Hey, it's you who should watch your language.

114
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:33,853
As you can see, I'm a guest here, I had an invitation.

115
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,853
I don't know who sent it to me, but I really appreciated it

116
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:41,053
because I just love sushi.

117
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:45,253
Who the heck is he?

118
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,753
He's as well known American.

119
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,953
He's a reporter that's made a name for himself

120
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,253
by writing about scandals that famous athletes are involved in.

121
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,153
Most of it's made up,

122
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:56,853
but he writes so vaguely,

123
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,853
even if he's taken to court, he's hardly ever charged.

124
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,953
I guess you should be careful then, Heiji.

125
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:04,953
What do you mean by that?

126
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:06,953
Gee, I wonder.

127
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,653
Let's move things along now

128
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,753
and start with the question and answer portion of the presentation.

129
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:13,853
Is there anyone in the audience

130
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,753
who would like to ask these gentlemen a question?

131
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,453
Don't be shy, come on up.

132
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,053
I have one!

133
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,653
A brave young lady has her hand raised!

134
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,253
Please, come up on to the stage.

135
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:37,053
Ran...

136
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:40,153
All right, young lady, ask away.

137
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,253
Well, uh...

138
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:44,053
It's not really a question, I have a favor to ask.

139
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:46,953
Mr. Curtis, may I have your autograph?

140
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,653
What's she doing?

141
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,653
You, won't do it?

142
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:54,653
No, no.

143
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,653
They're not autographing anything today.

144
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:58,153
Okay, it's okay.

145
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:01,953
I'll do it as a special favor for this young lady

146
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:03,953
for brightening up this party, again.

147
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:06,353
Thank you so much.

148
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,953
All right, how about if I sign

149
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,153
one of my uniforms?

150
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,253
Really, will you do that for me?

151
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,453
No, you can't do that.

152
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,353
Those are for the lottery...

153
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:21,153
Don't worry about it. There are still three left.

154
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,953
But...

155
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,953
If you don't mind, could you write in this name?

156
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:28,353
Okay. What's your name, young lady?

157
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,953
Well, not my name.

158
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,653
Shinichi.

159
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:36,053
Could you please sign it "To Shinichi"?

160
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:39,753
-Is he your boyfriend? -Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

161
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,853
Oh, she remembered

162
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:44,953
that I'm Ray's fan.

163
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,053
You better give her a call later.

164
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:52,353
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

165
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:53,853
Isn't it strange though?

166
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:55,053
What do you mean?

167
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,453
The goal keeper usually wears number 1,

168
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,553
why is his number 8?

169
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:02,653
Ray was originally a mid-fielder.

170
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,953
But during the Would Cup Series,

171
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:08,153
both goal keepers were thrown out of the game and the team was in a bind,

172
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,953
so Ray had no choice but to go in as a keeper.

173
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:15,253
He performed super saves one after the other

174
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,553
and the team managed to come in second place!

175
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:18,653
From then on,

176
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,753
even when he was a goal keeper for a league in Spain in the Serie A,

177
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,453
he kept the number 8!

178
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:28,353
And he's continued wearing it even now when he's in the Major League Soccer.

179
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:31,353
Then answer me this.

180
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:33,453
What about the number 99?

181
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,953
He's a pitcher, isn't he?

182
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:37,953
Isn't that too big a number?

183
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,253
That stands for 99 miles.

184
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,753
In Japan, it's equivalent to 160 kilometers.

185
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:44,453
His goal was to pitch balls that fast,

186
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:47,253
that's why he wore the number 99.

187
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:49,453
And what about the number 4?

188
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:53,453
See, it's written on the boxing gloves along with the signature.

189
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,853
That's because Ricardo always scored a K.O. win in the 4th round.

190
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:02,353
So he added the 4 along with his signature.

191
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:04,453
I didn't know that.

192
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:07,253
You should've done your research before you got here.

193
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:08,553
Well, excuse me.

194
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:11,853
Telephone numbers interested me more than uniform numbers.

195
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,953
What's wrong with you? You keep mentioning that.

196
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,153
You figure it out.

197
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,653
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:19,253
Seriously.

199
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:22,253
You did this for some guy who's gallivanting who knows where.

200
00:11:22,253 --> 00:11:24,653
That's my business, not yours.

201
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:25,653
Oh, yes.

202
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:26,753
It's for you, Conan.

203
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,653
It's a ticket for the special game.

204
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:33,353
Ray will be playing in tomorrow at Nagai Stadium.

205
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,553
He gave it to me just now, but it's a secret.

206
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:36,553
You will go, won't you?

207
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:37,753
Of course, I'll go.

208
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,353
Cool.

209
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,053
That was generous.

210
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,453
But I had to agree to their one condition.

211
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,153
Here, look at this.

212
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:47,953
A transceiver?

213
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:51,353
They said they want to surprise everyone.

214
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:56,753
Ray, it's okay. I'm here.

215
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:00,553
No, Ricardo, that's the wrong place.

216
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,953
Left, to the left.

217
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:04,053
Oh, I get it now,

218
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,153
they're trying to form the letter K by turning on the lights

219
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:08,053
in the hotel rooms above the restaurant

220
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:11,153
before the hotel opens!

221
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,453
When the guests come out of the restaurant,

222
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:15,153
they're really going to be surprised.

223
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,153
But they don't have to do it themselves.

224
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:21,653
They thought it up themselves, that's why they want to do it on their own.

225
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:25,653
If even one of them is seen outside,

226
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,353
it would cause quite a commotion,

227
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:31,153
that's why they wanted us to stand outside and see if the letter is formed right.

228
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:34,853
Ran, are the lights I'm supposed to turn on all on already?

229
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,853
The end part of the last row of the K is still off.

230
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,153
Okay. I'm going right now.

231
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:45,653
Mike, open the curtains, open them.

232
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:48,053
Okay?

233
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,153
Okay.

234
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,753
Ricardo, you're good, too!

235
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:52,953
Okay.

236
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,653
Ran, it is on?

237
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:56,053
Let's see.

238
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,253
Yes, it's on!

239
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:00,853
All right!

240
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,353
The K is completed!

241
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,253
The window...

242
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,153
And there were gunshots, too.

243
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,053
What?

244
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,453
What happened?

245
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,153
Is that a shot?

246
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,453
Hey, wait!

247
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,853
Kazuha, tell those three not to leave the rooms!

248
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:23,853
Hey.

249
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,453
Hey! Wait up!

250
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:39,853
-That's the room. -Yes.

251
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:48,853
This is the guy, he's that reporter from the party.

252
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,753
He must've been shot with this gun.

253
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:56,053
He's holding something in his left hand.

254
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:57,353
What the...

255
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,953
A... a belt?

256
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:12,261
The window...

257
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,261
And there were gunshots, too.

258
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,161
Hey, wait!

259
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:20,161
Kazuha, tell those three not to leave the rooms!

260
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,461
-That's the room. -Yes.

261
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:32,161
This is the guy, he's that reporter from the party.

262
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:35,061
He must've been shot with this gun.

263
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:38,961
He's holding something in his left hand.

264
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,961
What the...

265
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,961
A... a belt?

266
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:49,561
The victim is an American living in Chicago.

267
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:52,561
He's a reporter, name Ed McKay, 48 years old.

268
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:53,961
"Inspector Otaki" -He was shot in the chest

269
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,561
and died almost immediately.

270
00:14:56,561 --> 00:15:01,261
The weapon used was a Smith & Wesson revolver.

271
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,361
There are signs of a slight struggle,

272
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,761
so he must have been alive for a short time after being shot.

273
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:11,161
Heiji, do you know what time you heard the shot?

274
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,761
Sure. I'm sure it was a little past 8:05 pm.

275
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:18,061
Kazuha and the rest of us were outside the hotel when we heard it,

276
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:21,861
and we saw the window crack, so I'm pretty sure about it.

277
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,861
What do you mean outside the hotel?

278
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,061
Where you leaving the party so soon?

279
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,461
No, no.

280
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,361
Those three guys asked us to do them a favor.

281
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:32,361
They asked us to check to see

282
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,961
if the lights in the hotel formed the letter K

283
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,561
like they planned.

284
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,061
Those three?

285
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:42,161
Of course. They own the K3 restaurant,

286
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,961
Ricardo Balera, former pro boxer,

287
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,461
major leaguer Mike Norwood,

288
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,861
and pro soccer player, Ray Curtis.

289
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:54,661
And by chance, were they the ones who turned the lights on, too?

290
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,161
Yeah, that's right.

291
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:59,061
Ray was in charge of 5, the first and second rows,

292
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,961
Mike was in charge of 4, the third and fourth rows

293
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,961
and Ricardo was in charge of the two

294
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,061
on the very top fifth row.

295
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,261
So that means its possible for those three

296
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,661
to have committed the murder.

297
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:13,461
It sure is possible.

298
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:16,761
Especially since it seems they all didn't like that reporter.

299
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,761
But they couldn't have done it.

300
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:22,361
This room is in the center of the second row, isn't it?

301
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:26,061
When the shot was fired, the three of them were in different rooms.

302
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,061
Isn't right, Ran?

303
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,461
Do you know which rooms they were in?

304
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:35,161
I'm positive Mike was in the room directly above this one.

305
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,561
He opened the curtains that were partially drawn.

306
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:38,961
Right after that,

307
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:42,161
Ricardo turned off the light in the second room from the left

308
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,161
on the top floor which he'd turned on by mistake,

309
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,461
and right after that,

310
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,861
Ray turned on the light in the room

311
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,961
on the right of the very bottom which he'd forgotten to turn on.

312
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,661
Just when we thought the letter K was complete,

313
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:55,461
we heard the gunshot and the window shattered.

314
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,161
Did you see the three of them at that time?

315
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,261
No.

316
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,061
But only 5 seconds had passed since Mike opened the curtains.

317
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,161
And Ray poked his head out the window,

318
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:08,361
and it was only about 3 seconds later that we heard the gunshot.

319
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,561
And right after that,

320
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,961
all three of them looked outside and asked what was going on.

321
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,661
Then who is the killer?

322
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,661
Mabe it was one of the guests at the party?

323
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:21,161
What?

324
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:24,661
Remember, when Heiji and I got here,

325
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:27,161
the place was crowded with people already.

326
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:31,561
I'm sure the killer was hiding in one of the rooms close by

327
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:35,261
and got away in the midst of the commotion.

328
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:39,761
But if that's true, then all the party guests are suspects

329
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,861
and it's going to take a lot of time to question all of them.

330
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,961
Hey, what's this?

331
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,461
Look, look at this guy's left hand.

332
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:48,961
He's holding on to something.

333
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:51,561
A belt?

334
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:55,161
And look at this man's finger on his right hands.

335
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:58,661
His baby and ring fingers are bent.

336
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,261
Do you think he and the killer were playing paper, rock and scissors?

337
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:02,761
Conan!

338
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,161
Hey, Heiji,

339
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:05,761
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

340
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,761
Yeah. I think that as he was dying,

341
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:11,361
he tried to leave a clue through the belt and the shape of his hand,

342
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,361
it's his dying message.

343
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:15,561
But you don't know for sure

344
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,461
that he was indicating the belt is the clue, right?

345
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,461
He might have meant his pants,

346
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:23,161
he might have wanted to remove his pants and show something.

347
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,461
Fool!

348
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:27,761
If he meant his pants, he'd put his hand on the edge of his pants.

349
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,761
If he meant to take his belt off,

350
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,161
he'd have put his fingers on the edge of the belt, right?

351
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,161
I don't think any guy would clutch his belt Iike that

352
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,561
if he wanted to take it off.

353
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,961
All right then, I'll take this as a hint and keep it in mind

354
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,161
when I question all the guests

355
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,861
who's been waiting in the restaurant downstairs.

356
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:42,561
No, that won't be necessary.

357
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,161
-What? -I've figured it out.

358
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,961
The killer is one of those three.

359
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,861
The belt... that's right,

360
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,161
only one who has fought bravely

361
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:54,261
has the honor of wearing it around his waist,

362
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,461
it proves he is a champion,

363
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,561
which means the killer

364
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,761
is former middleweight champion, Ricardo Baleral.

365
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,161
So what do the fingers mean?

366
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,161
If Ricardo always knocked out his opponent in the fourth round,

367
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,961
shouldn't his fingers indicate four?

368
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,461
All right then, it's Ray, the pro soccer player.

369
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,361
He's played in 3 countries, Italy, Spain and America,

370
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,661
and always led his team to victory.

371
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:21,161
Ray also played in a premier league in England and they became champions.

372
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,761
Oh, I see.

373
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,961
Hey, maybe it doesn't mean 3,

374
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:28,061
maybe it has something to do with baseball.

375
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:30,161
You know, when the pitcher throws his pitch,

376
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,061
he holds the ball with three fingers, doesn't he?

377
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,861
That's it!

378
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:36,361
The killer is a major leaguer, Mike, it's settled.

379
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,961
You don't know anything about baseball.

380
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:40,761
Mike's team never won a championship

381
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:43,961
and even if they did, you don't get championship belts in baseball!

382
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,361
And that goes for soccer, too.

383
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,861
The key to this case is the fingers on his right hand

384
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,461
and the "white band" gripped by his left hand.

385
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,561
I guess we're going to have to solve this puzzle first.

386
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:57,961
-Band? -What?

387
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:01,061
Don't some people refer to a belt as a band?

388
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:04,061
The only people who do are old fogeys.

389
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:08,561
Band, three...

390
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,961
Band three,

391
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:11,061
bandthree!

392
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:14,361
That's it, he meant someone named Bandthree.

393
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:18,061
All right! Locate the guest named Bandthree

394
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,361
and the case will be solved.

395
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,661
Hey, Heiji,

396
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:27,061
are you sure that's the famous "Sleeping Kogoro"?

397
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,661
I know what you mean, I think he's a little drunk tonight.

398
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,261
Well, I guess we don't have a choice,

399
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:33,761
let's forget about the dying message for now.

400
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,261
Shall we start testing everyone for powder burns?

401
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:37,261
I guess you're right,

402
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,661
we'll start with the guests waiting in the restaurant downstairs.

403
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:44,861
And of course those three men waiting in the room.

404
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:57,361
Okay, next.

405
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,761
Excuse me.

406
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,961
-Yes? -Is your name Bandthree, by any chance?

407
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,561
No, it isn't!

408
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,261
Oh, pardon me.

409
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,761
Well? Did anybody test positive, Inspector Otaki?

410
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,761
No, not yet.

411
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,761
How about those three?

412
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:22,061
We tested them first but they all came out negative.

413
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,261
Did you do a body check?

414
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:27,161
Yeah, we did a simple body check but...

415
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,461
Gosh, those managers they have...

416
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,461
They've been giving us a hard time.

417
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:33,961
But never mind that.

418
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,961
Is it true what Mr. Mouri said?

419
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,461
Did those three really hate that reporter?

420
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:41,461
Yeah, seems that way.

421
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:44,061
Ricardo was suspected of throwing about

422
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,361
and forced to retire while he was unbeaten.

423
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:49,761
Ray was thrown out of the European league

424
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,361
on suspicions of drug use.

425
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,961
Mike got divorced because he was having an affair

426
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,661
but he's married to a Japanese girl now,

427
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,561
and they seem to be getting along just fine.

428
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,061
And all of their problems were caused by

429
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:05,061
the murdered reporter's unsubstantiated articles.

430
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:06,261
But Heiji,

431
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:09,261
how do you know they were unsubstantiated?

432
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,361
They took him to court and won.

433
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:15,161
They proved they weren't involved in the scandals.

434
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,461
I see.

435
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:20,961
That's why I don't think they had any motive for killing him.

436
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,961
I think you're right.

437
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,561
Come on, Kudo.

438
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:30,361
What's with you?

439
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:33,561
You're acting kind of strange.

440
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,761
"Next episode" -None of those three

441
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,161
could have committed the crimes in that span of time.

442
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,361
Hey, Kudo.

443
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:13,961
You're acting strange.

444
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:14,961
That's ridiculous!

445
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,661
It's absolutely impossible!

446
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:19,561
And I'll prove it, just you wait!

447
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:22,461
The person working in the restaurant

448
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,261
did say "band" and "wooden sandals"!

449
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:28,661
That reporter Ed knew a lot about Japan!

450
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

451
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"The 3K's Incident in Osaka (Part 2)"

452
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,079
Next Conan's Hint:

453
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,979
"Gun Powder Residue"

454
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,279
In the next episode, the case in Osaka will be solved.

455
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,579
He's going to make a brief appearance?

456
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,179
It's not me, it's the other guy.
