1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,010
Kazuha Toyama and Heiji Hattori came to invite us

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,810
to see the holiday lights everyone's talking about.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,110
While waiting for Ran and Kazuha to finish making dinner,

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,710
Hattori and I went to kill time at Poirot,

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,810
the cafe below the agency.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,710
That's when Beika University drama club members,

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,310
"Meisuke Ozumi (21), Beika University Third-Year" -Meisuke Ozumi,

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,510
"Yui Yamashita (21), Beika University Third-Year" -Yui Yamashita,

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,610
"Tengo Anzai (20), Beika University Third-Year" -Tengo Anzai,

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,310
"Minoru Nagatsuka (20)" -and Minoru Nagatsuka arrived.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,610
Have a seat.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,310
Let's watch Yui's birthday video together.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,310
You finished filming your part, right?

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,210
Yeah. I just sent it to your laptop.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,310
Oh, yeah?

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,010
But Ozumi's not here yet.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,510
He's in the bathroom.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,410
Oh, we're going to make some noise.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,810
Don't mind us.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,310
It's not turning on.

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,410
Is the battery dead?

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,910
Hey, miss.

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,510
Could we borrow an outlet?

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,710
Sure.

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,210
Here you go.

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,210
Thanks.

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,410
No way. A blackout?

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,710
I... I just saw a spark.

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,010
Yeah, from the outlet.

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,310
Azusa, check the breaker.

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,310
Okay.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,310
What?

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,910
Azusa, hurry.

34
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,910
Okay.

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,110
What's all this noise about?

36
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,110
"Coffee Poirot"

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,610
There's no need to call the police.

38
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,510
When he was stabbed,

39
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,510
some blood flew onto my face.

40
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,010
And onto my glasses, too.

41
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,710
His blood must've gotten

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,010
on the culprit's hands or sleeves.

43
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,810
You can't be serious.

44
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,810
Why isn't there any blood on anyone?

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,910
Listen, detectives, you seem to think we did it.

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,610
Couldn't it have been an outsider?

47
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,610
Maybe someone was waiting outside the store

48
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,910
for the blackout and came inside to stab him with night vision goggles?

49
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,610
That seems unlikely.

50
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,410
Why do you say that?

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,210
Immediately after that man was stabbed and screamed,

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,710
I stood in front of the entrance

53
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,210
so no one could get out.

54
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,310
Really?

55
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,510
That's why you were standing next to the door

56
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,610
when the lights came on.

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,210
Yes.

58
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,110
You must have pretty good night vision.

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,210
No.

60
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,210
I just happened to be using my phone to...

61
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,810
listen to music.

62
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,510
I used that faint light.

63
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,910
Music?

64
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,410
Come to think of it, you haven't told us your name yet.

65
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,410
My name?

66
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,510
I'm Shinichi Wada.

67
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,510
I work in medicine.

68
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,510
Shinichi Wada?

69
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

70
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,310
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

71
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,110
A case at the Poirot Cafe is tackled by Heiji, Amuro,

72
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,710
and the mysterious Shinichi Wada.

73
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,310
He sees through the one and only truth.

74
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

75
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,810
His name is Detective Conan!

76
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:38,868
"Solving Mysteries at the Poirot Cafe (Part 2)"

77
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,468
He's got the same name as you.

78
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:46,168
Huh?

79
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:48,868
Conan, isn't your name Conan?

80
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:55,968
No. He meant to say "your favorite Shinichi".

81
00:05:55,968 --> 00:06:00,068
Heiji can be unclear sometimes.

82
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,468
Sorry.

83
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,568
I see...

84
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:07,868
Anyway, Kudo, do you know who did it?

85
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,768
No, not yet.

86
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:14,268
I thought of a trick to avoid getting blood on yourself, though.

87
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,468
You, too?

88
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:19,968
But the person who could've used the trick...

89
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,968
Couldn't have committed the crime.

90
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:26,068
Darn. I gotta solve this quick so we can go to Kinza.

91
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,568
Hey.

92
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,668
Yui Yamashita.

93
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,568
What is it?

94
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:40,668
You said you and Anzai are just childhood friends,

95
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,368
but that's not true, is it?

96
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,168
If there's something going on, could you tell me?

97
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:50,168
It might help us solve the case.

98
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:52,468
Sorry, but I can't say.

99
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:54,268
But...

100
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:55,268
It's...

101
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,068
a secret I have to keep to protect someone.

102
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:02,568
When I was your age,

103
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:05,568
I didn't think I had any secrets either.

104
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,868
Is that so?

105
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:15,968
Honestly, I have way too many secrets at the moment.

106
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,968
Hey, Kudo.

107
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:21,568
You know how late the Kinza lights are staying on?

108
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:23,268
No.

109
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:31,368
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind,

110
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,268
the moonlight shining through is beautiful indeed."

111
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,768
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

112
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,768
I see.

113
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,568
So that's how it is.

114
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,468
I know exactly what happened.

115
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:54,068
Hey, detectives.

116
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,268
Can't we go now?

117
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,068
I'm sorry that Anzai got stabbed,

118
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,768
but none of us did it.

119
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,068
There's no blood on anyone.

120
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,968
I don't think we could've stabbed anyone

121
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,968
in the pitch blackness of the blackout.

122
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,768
You'd need night vision goggles.

123
00:08:11,768 --> 00:08:15,268
I was in the bathroom since before the blackout,

124
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,468
so I couldn't have stabbed him.

125
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,368
The peephole in the bathroom door is made with frosted glass.

126
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,268
I couldn't have known who was sitting where.

127
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,268
"From between long clouds..."

128
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:33,768
"From between long clouds blown by the fall wind,

129
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:37,768
the moonlight shining through is beautiful indeed."

130
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,668
Where did that come from?

131
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,968
One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets?

132
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:46,268
It's a poem by Sakyo no Daibu Akisuke.

133
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:50,268
It means the moon seen through clouds blown

134
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:54,068
by the fall wind is super pretty.

135
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,668
And the culprit also saw

136
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:59,568
who was sitting where through a gap.

137
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:03,768
What are you doing?

138
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:06,768
Oh, nothing. Don't mind me.

139
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,668
Right?

140
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:10,068
The man who was hiding in the bathroom

141
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,568
and secretly watching through the peephole.

142
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:16,168
I'm asking you, Meisuke Ozumi.

143
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:18,368
What?

144
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,668
Hey, Ozumi.

145
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,368
Is this true, Ozumi?

146
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:26,468
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:27,968
Didn't you hear me?

148
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,068
The peephole's made of frosted glass!

149
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,168
Hey, Azusa.

150
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:34,068
Do you have any tape?

151
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,068
Yes.

152
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:38,068
But what do you need this for?

153
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,568
My science teacher told me

154
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:44,868
that if you put tape on the rough side of frosted glass,

155
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,268
it's like normal glass.

156
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,868
Really?

157
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:52,568
Try putting some tape on the peephole and look through it.

158
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:54,868
Okay.

159
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,568
You're right.

160
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,268
I can see through the spot covered by the tape.

161
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:11,268
Can you see me?

162
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:12,868
You're right.

163
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:14,868
I wouldn't call it totally transparent,

164
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:18,668
but you can see who's sitting where.

165
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,468
But why?

166
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:25,168
It's difficult to see through the frosted glass because tiny scratches

167
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,768
on its surface reflect light,

168
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,068
making it appear cloudy.

169
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:32,468
By putting tape over it,

170
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:35,968
the adhesive on the tape fills the scratches in the glass,

171
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,268
flattening the surface and making it transparent.

172
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:43,668
But I don't have any tape on me.

173
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:48,368
There was tape on the birthday present you got for Yui.

174
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,868
After looking through the frosted glass,

175
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:53,368
you could've put it back on the present.

176
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:56,768
Even if I could see the others through the peephole,

177
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,268
I couldn't have stabbed anyone in the darkness.

178
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,568
So you practiced, didn't you?

179
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:05,768
You arranged chairs and tables in your room

180
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:07,668
in the same layout at this Cafe

181
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,168
so you could stab someone in the dark.

182
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,468
If you built a set of identical

183
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:15,168
to this Cafe for your play last year,

184
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:19,668
those measurements must still be in your drama club room somewhere.

185
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:23,268
Even if I knew the exact layout,

186
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:26,268
it'd still be hard to stab someone.

187
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,268
Yes.

188
00:11:27,268 --> 00:11:29,268
From the front, their hands would get in the way,

189
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,068
making it difficult to stab them.

190
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:32,868
But from their blindside,

191
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:35,868
as long as you knew where they were sitting, it would be possible.

192
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:38,968
That's why you came first

193
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:42,568
and put your bag on the booth seat,

194
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,368
knowing your girlfriend, Yui, would sit next to it.

195
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:47,768
I see.

196
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,868
If the booth seats were occupied,

197
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:54,168
the victim would be forced to sit in either of the chairs opposite them.

198
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,168
But... but what about the blood?

199
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,268
Even if I could stab him, I would've gotten blood on me!

200
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,768
You made sure you wouldn't.

201
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,468
Using something

202
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:11,368
you found in the bathroom.

203
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,235
It's so pretty!

204
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,435
It's like Tinkerbell's gonna show up any minute.

205
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:41,135
I know. It's like a dream world.

206
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,235
Hey, Kazuha.

207
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:05,035
Kazuha?

208
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,235
I'm glad

209
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:09,335
it's just the two of us.

210
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,335
What?

211
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,535
If I saw this in person with Heiji,

212
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,735
I might've felt something crazy.

213
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,835
What a relief.

214
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,035
Seriously.

215
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,635
Kazuha!

216
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,135
I love you, too, Kazuha!

217
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:54,335
Heiji doesn't talk like that.

218
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:56,635
Oh, sorry!

219
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,135
But thanks, Ran.

220
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:05,135
Anyway, I wonder what Heiji's doing.

221
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,535
He's not answering his phone.

222
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,635
-Yeah. -You're late.

223
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,235
Sorry, sorry.

224
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:15,735
Anyway, you shouldn't have suddenly changed where we'd meet.

225
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:18,835
I wanted Poirot's sandwiches.

226
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:20,135
You haven't heard?

227
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,235
There's something crazy going on at the Cafe.

228
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,635
Apparently there was a murder.

229
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:25,935
Seriously?

230
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:28,235
Yeah. Some guy was stabbed

231
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,135
and taken to the hospital.

232
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,735
Toilet paper?

233
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:37,635
He used toilet paper to prevent blood from getting on himself?

234
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,635
Yeah.

235
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:40,435
He wrapped it around his arms

236
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,035
like a mummy.

237
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,335
You idiot.

238
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:48,235
You couldn't block all the blood just by covering your arms.

239
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,935
No, that's all you need.

240
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:56,235
You held the cardboard tube around the knife

241
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,935
against his back as you stabbed him.

242
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,435
By holding the tube in place as you pulled the knife out,

243
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,735
you could avoid getting any blood on yourself.

244
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:08,835
That's why you chose a long knife.

245
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:12,635
Otherwise you couldn't have stabbed him through the tube.

246
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:16,835
A little blood's bound to come through the tube,

247
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:20,135
but as long as you don't point the opening towards yourself, you're okay.

248
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,535
Instead, those of us sitting in front of the tube

249
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:25,135
got blood all over us.

250
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,635
Then you returned to the bathroom

251
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,435
and waited for the lights to come back on,

252
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,835
flushed the toilet paper wrapped around your arms,

253
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,235
and stuck the tube you used

254
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,835
back inside the toilet paper.

255
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,435
Then you removed the tape from the peephole

256
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,735
and stuck it back on the gift

257
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:44,935
and came out of the bathroom.

258
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:50,035
No, you may have removed the tape before the lights came on.

259
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,835
By folding the end of the tape over

260
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,535
and making it easier to grab,

261
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,935
you could've removed it in the dark.

262
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:01,835
If the bathroom lights came back on first

263
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,235
and someone saw the peephole,

264
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,935
they might have noticed that

265
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:10,335
there was something stuck to it.

266
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,335
Either way,

267
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:17,735
the middle of the toilet paper was sticking out slightly.

268
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:21,435
That's a sure sign the tube was forced inside it afterwards.

269
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:24,235
Therefore,

270
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:27,335
I think the police

271
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:30,535
would find Anzai's blood...

272
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,535
and your fingerprints on it.

273
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,535
This can't be true, Ozumi!

274
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,935
Ozumi, you'd never stab Tengo.

275
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,835
It annoyed me.

276
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,635
Why do you call your boyfriend "Ozumi",

277
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,235
when you call Anzai by his given name?

278
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:50,335
Because we're childhood friends.

279
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,435
You're not just childhood friends, are you?

280
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,835
There must be some reason for it!

281
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:59,135
I...

282
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,635
See? You can't say it!

283
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:03,435
I'm sure he's your ex or something!

284
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:07,035
But I had to hurt him because you were keeping secrets from me!

285
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,535
Honestly, I was scared since the knife went deeper than I expected.

286
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,935
You're wrong.

287
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,535
They're probably...

288
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:23,135
half-siblings.

289
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,935
What?

290
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:30,935
Yui, you said you were keeping the secret to protect someone,

291
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:34,835
and that you didn't think you had any secrets as a child.

292
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,235
The reason you said "someone" instead of Tengo

293
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,435
is because you meant someone related to Anzai,

294
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:46,135
or in this case, Anzai's father the Dietman.

295
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:48,435
If it wasn't a secret when you were kids,

296
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,835
but became one when you grew up,

297
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:55,935
it means it would be a career-ending scandal for a Dietman.

298
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:59,735
In other words, Yui is his lover's secret lovechild...

299
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:03,735
It's what Heiji said.

300
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,435
Yeah, that's right.

301
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:11,135
Is this true?

302
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:12,435
Yes.

303
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:15,935
While my parents argued overcompensation,

304
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,235
they would leave me and Tengo to play together.

305
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:21,735
We became close.

306
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,635
You're lying.

307
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,635
I don't believe this.

308
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,835
You're not all pulling my leg, are you?

309
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:36,235
"Incoming Call, From Public Phone" -A phone call?

310
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:40,535
-Who is it? -That hurt, darn it!

311
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,335
I'm gonna kill you the next time I see you!

312
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:47,935
Well, my behavior was hardly worthy of praise.

313
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,535
I can see how you got the wrong idea.

314
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:55,135
In any case, I sent Yui's birthday video to your phone.

315
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,735
Check it out.

316
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,135
I was going to turn up the volume

317
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:02,735
so you could hear it in the bathroom.

318
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:03,735
Later.

319
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,735
You'd better come to visit me.

320
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,335
Birthday video?

321
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,235
I have an announcement to make.

322
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,535
Yui and I are actually half-siblings.

323
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,735
Yeah.

324
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,735
Since our dad's election is coming up,

325
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:21,235
Yui said not to say anything,

326
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,735
but I don't care!

327
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:27,435
So take good care of my sister, Ozumi.

328
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:30,035
I mean, brother.

329
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,835
Later!

330
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:37,235
No...

331
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,735
No.

332
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:51,835
Seriously. You should've tried talking to him before stabbing him.

333
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:56,535
Wait, I don't have time for this!

334
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:59,035
I've gotta get to Kinza Block 4!

335
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:01,035
We're not going to Kinza.

336
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,335
We're going to Tokyo Station.

337
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,535
Kazuha!

338
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,935
If we don't hurry, we'll miss our train home.

339
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:11,735
Wait, Hattori!

340
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:15,135
We still need to question him about the case.

341
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:19,135
Well, I guess we can interview the people who are still here.

342
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,735
Wait, what?

343
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:24,035
Shinichi Wada is missing.

344
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,335
Shinichi Wada?

345
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:28,335
He was here until a moment ago.

346
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:30,535
There was a strange man by that name

347
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:33,335
claiming to be a medical professional.

348
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:37,235
That may have been a fake name.

349
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,335
Shinichi told me once that the translations

350
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:43,735
from the Meiji Era of the Sherlock Holmes stories

351
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,535
were set in Japan.

352
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:50,135
Both Holmes and Watson were Japanese.

353
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:54,735
Watson was an army surgeon named Shinichi Wada.

354
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,535
But it's just a possibility.

355
00:20:57,535 --> 00:21:00,435
That's right. And since he called himself Shinichi Wada

356
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:05,035
instead of using Tairoku Komuro, Holmes' Japanese name,

357
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,435
does that mean a Holmes-Esque individual

358
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,735
is standing behind him, that feed him hints...

359
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:16,335
in the form of poems?

360
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:46,635
His reasoning skills lived up to his reputation.

361
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,235
I was impressed.

362
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:50,035
That wasn't a deduction.

363
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,435
You could hear the sound of something

364
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:56,335
being ripped off under the man's scream.

365
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,835
A sound?

366
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,135
Now that you mention it, I thought I heard something.

367
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,435
Anyway, I'm glad

368
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:09,835
that my hint helped Heiji.

369
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:15,535
Though as his future wife,

370
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,135
it's only natural.

371
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,535
Your recitation of the poem

372
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,535
melted my heart.

373
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,935
I'm sorry I didn't do a better job.

374
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:31,435
So, what did you think of Heiji?

375
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:34,635
It's no wonder he caught your eye.

376
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:36,935
His appearance, personality, and reasoning abilities

377
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,835
leave nothing to be desired.

378
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,835
There does seem to be a girl he's interested in,

379
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,435
but she's no match for you, Miss Momiji.

380
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,635
I, Iori,

381
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,935
shall do everything I can to support you.

382
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:53,935
"Muga Iori (30), Otsuka Family Butler"

383
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:57,435
"Next Episode" -Oh, Kichiemon Samizu, huh?

384
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:03,235
All the books in the study were donated.

385
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,835
I keep them here in this room.

386
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:09,035
It looks like an ordinary box to me.

387
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,335
Yes.

388
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:11,935
It's exactly the kind of thing

389
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:14,735
that moonlit magician-thief goes after.

390
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,235
A big jewel.

391
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,635
Next Conan,

392
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:24,335
"Thief Kid and the Trick Box (Part 1)"

393
00:24:25,078 --> 00:24:27,378
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:29,678
"Music Box"

395
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,778
Thank you for another year!

396
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:33,878
Merry Christmas!
