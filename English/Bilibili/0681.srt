1
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.940
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.840
Did you enjoy your New Year Holiday?

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.940
Did you receive a lot of "otoshidama" (New Year's monetary gift)?

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.140
I hope you didn't over eat New Year's dishes

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.240
and get a stomachache.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.640
Thanks to all of you rooting for us,

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.240
the "Detective Conan Series"

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.140
has successfully entered its 18th year of broadcast!

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.740
We'll actively keep solving one case after the other this year too...

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.240
Along with the members of the Youth Detective Squad...

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.940
Please keep rooting for the Detective Conan Series...

12
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.340
As you have thus far...

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.440
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.540
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.240
The curtains are raised after 18 years.

16
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240
Is it a love story of two police officers?

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.740
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:46.295
"A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Start of the Broadcast)"

21
00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.995
Hey, you detective over there!

22
00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:04.595
Yumi.

23
00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:05.795
Are you staking out from now?

24
00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:09.295
No, I finished work early today.

25
00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:12.195
I have some place I have to go now.

26
00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:15.195
Well, I'll come back after just a one night's stay.

27
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.795
Oh, what's that about?

28
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:20.695
Are you going on a hot spring date with Miwako or what?

29
00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:22.395
No.

30
00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:25.395
It's not a date.

31
00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.895
No way. Miwako, even you don't know

32
00:03:28.895 --> 00:03:30.495
where Officer Takagi is going?

33
00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:32.595
Yes, it seems that he told Inspector Megure

34
00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.695
that he had to relay something to somebody.

35
00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.095
Maybe it's your parents or something?

36
00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.495
Maybe he's going to tell them, "Please let me marry your daughter".

37
00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.095
Now, look here.

38
00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:47.095
If that's the case, why did he have to keep it a secret from me?

39
00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:49.195
Besides, my mother lives in Tokyo,

40
00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.695
so there's no need for him to spend the night over.

41
00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:54.495
By the way, who are you?

42
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:56.395
I'm Naeko Miike who was transferred over

43
00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:59.595
from the Haido Police Office.

44
00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:02.595
-Is that right? -But I'm sure

45
00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.395
that Inspector Megure already knows who that person is.

46
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:06.995
It seems like he really hasn't told him anything yet.

47
00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:08.595
He only told him, "I'll tell you about it, after I return

48
00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:11.195
and my feelings are settled."

49
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.095
Something smells fishy.

50
00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:14.495
Right? Don't you think so?

51
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:17.295
Well, I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with love or things like that.

52
00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:20.295
He clearly said that he wasn't going on a date, after all.

53
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:21.795
Geez.

54
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.195
I wonder if he really remembers

55
00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:26.195
Mr. Date's memorial day?

56
00:04:26.195 --> 00:04:29.495
Come to think of it, it has been almost a year.

57
00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.895
He told me that he'd go pay a visit to his grave with me, and yet...

58
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.895
Who are you talking about?

59
00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:37.495
The police detective that used to be Officer Takagi's mentor.

60
00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:40.895
He was a tough guy that you couldn't kill even if you wanted to.

61
00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:44.595
And yet, he was involved in a traffic accident and died just like that.

62
00:04:44.595 --> 00:04:46.795
Then maybe he had something he wanted to report

63
00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.395
to the parents of the detective?

64
00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:52.895
No, Mr. Date's parents also live in Tokyo.

65
00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:56.495
If so, maybe it has to do with a woman or something after all.

66
00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.595
Come to think of it, Officer Takagi

67
00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:01.595
is quite popular in the transportation department.

68
00:05:03.295 --> 00:05:05.895
Well, he's not as popular as Miwako though.

69
00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:07.995
That Takagi...

70
00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:14.495
Darn it, maybe I caught a cold.

71
00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:19.295
Procedures shall begin for passengers

72
00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:22.395
who are boarding Luna Airlines flight number 299 for Tottori

73
00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:26.195
departing at 19:35.

74
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.995
Those who are boarding the plane,

75
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.895
"Meet with parents" -please go to boarding gate number 18.

76
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.695
Officer Sato, I...

77
00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:52.195
I'm losing confidence that I can make you happy.

78
00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:55.195
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

79
00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:56.895
finally did it, didn't we?

80
00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:58.595
"Police Station" -What an honor to be selected as models

81
00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:00.795
for the children crime prevention pamphlet!

82
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.895
Yeah! We did solve a lot of crimes after all!

83
00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:07.695
What should we do? We're going to be famous!

84
00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:10.195
But I wonder if Doc's okay.

85
00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:13.795
He said he'd come right after parking his car in the parking lot.

86
00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:16.595
He was really coughing up a storm, so...

87
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:17.995
I wonder if he has a cold?

88
00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:20.995
Officer Takagi is late, too.

89
00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:24.295
He told me to call him when we get to the MPD,

90
00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:26.395
so that he could take us over to the PR section in charge.

91
00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:28.295
But I can't get through to him at all.

92
00:06:28.295 --> 00:06:32.395
Maybe he's caught up in a lovey-dovey situation again?

93
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:34.995
Maybe he's having a kiss like he did back then.

94
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.495
Even Officer Takagi wouldn't do something like that

95
00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:38.995
during working hours!

96
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:40.295
That's right!

97
00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:41.795
Excuse me.

98
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:44.995
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

99
00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:46.895
What?

100
00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:48.995
Yes, we do. But why?

101
00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.995
I couldn't have asked for better.

102
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:56.095
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

103
00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:59.395
Could you do so for me?

104
00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:03.695
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

105
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:06.695
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

106
00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:07.695
Yes.

107
00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:10.495
She's strong and scary like an ogre though.

108
00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:11.695
Well, well...

109
00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:14.395
But she's very pretty, too!

110
00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:15.395
That's right!

111
00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:18.295
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

112
00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:21.195
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

113
00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:26.195
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

114
00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:30.695
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

115
00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:32.695
He also said that it will be no good

116
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:36.495
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

117
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:38.395
Hey!

118
00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:40.795
Conan!

119
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.695
Okay, I'm counting on you guys.

120
00:07:43.695 --> 00:07:45.395
Who is that guy?

121
00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:47.995
He seems to be an acquaintance of Officer Takagi.

122
00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:50.295
By the way, where are Doc and Ai?

123
00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:52.695
It seems that Doc has a cold after all.

124
00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:54.795
I asked him to go home with Ai.

125
00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:56.495
What?

126
00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:58.595
Well, Doc's acting sick

127
00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:02.795
because he can't allow Ai's picture to be put on the pamphlet.

128
00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:04.695
So, does that mean Ai's not going to appear on it?

129
00:08:04.695 --> 00:08:05.895
That's too bad.

130
00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:08.795
I'm disappointed, too.

131
00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:13.095
I thought that I'd get to see the much rumored Dr. Agasa.

132
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:14.795
Mr. Amuro.

133
00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.995
I heard from Master Mouri

134
00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.295
that the members of the Youth Detective Squad

135
00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:21.395
would be coming over to the MPD on Dr. Agasa's car today

136
00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:24.995
to take pictures to be put on the pamphlet.

137
00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:28.495
I was told to come to the MPD, too.

138
00:08:28.495 --> 00:08:30.495
I've already finished what I had to do though.

139
00:08:30.495 --> 00:08:31.895
Why were you told to come here?

140
00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:35.095
It was about the case back when you were kidnapped,

141
00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:38.795
and I stopped the car that you were in by crashing into it.

142
00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:40.895
They were questioning me again,

143
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.395
saying that I might have gone overboard.

144
00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:44.795
Come to think of it,

145
00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:48.595
Masumi also said that she was told to come to the MPD again.

146
00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:52.595
In her case, she absolutely went overboard.

147
00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:54.595
Well, I also came here

148
00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:56.895
because I had something else to do.

149
00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:58.395
Something else to do?

150
00:08:58.395 --> 00:09:00.895
Don't worry about it.

151
00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:03.995
Because I don't have to do it anymore.

152
00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:05.795
Conan.

153
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.895
Who was the young man?

154
00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:11.195
He's the private detective who became Pop Kogoro's disciple.

155
00:09:11.195 --> 00:09:13.695
A detective?

156
00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:15.895
He's good-looking.

157
00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:18.495
By the way, isn't Officer Takagi here yet?

158
00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:20.895
It seems like he's forgotten.

159
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.095
I can't get through to him either.

160
00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:26.395
Then, why don't we try calling Officer Chiba?

161
00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:27.895
If so...

162
00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:29.795
Let's call Officer Sato!

163
00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:32.495
Since this is perishable.

164
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:35.895
What?

165
00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:38.195
Officer Takagi was in tears while looking at the mini photo

166
00:09:38.195 --> 00:09:40.095
he had attached on his memo pad?

167
00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:41.195
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:44.295
It looked like a cute photo at first glance,

169
00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:47.395
so I asked him if that photo was of you, Officer Sato.

170
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:48.895
Cut the joke!

171
00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:51.595
And he got really angry at me.

172
00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.295
"Cut the joke"?

173
00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:55.195
He told me not to say anything

174
00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:57.495
because he wanted to explain it himself.

175
00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:00.895
Hey! Where is Officer Takagi?

176
00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:04.195
I wonder, too. I haven't seen him yet today.

177
00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:12.295
Yes, hello.

178
00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:13.495
Conan?

179
00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:17.895
Officer Takagi has something for me?

180
00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:20.395
Did the unknown man say that to you?

181
00:10:20.395 --> 00:10:22.795
-Yeah. -Here it is!

182
00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:24.595
What is going on here?

183
00:10:24.595 --> 00:10:26.195
He hasn't even shown up at work yet.

184
00:10:26.195 --> 00:10:28.495
Officer Takagi isn't here yet?

185
00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:30.895
That man told us that it's perishable,

186
00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.895
so he told us to eat it by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

187
00:10:32.895 --> 00:10:36.595
But this tablet doesn't look edible.

188
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.395
It's a tablet.

189
00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:41.395
It could be a video letter, then.

190
00:10:41.395 --> 00:10:44.195
I'm sure he was too embarrassed to tell you in person.

191
00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:47.395
Officer Takagi is shy, you see.

192
00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:49.895
Seriously. If you have something to tell me,

193
00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:51.995
why can't you say it directly to me?

194
00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:56.295
O... Officer Takagi!

195
00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:58.395
There's a rope tied around his neck!

196
00:10:58.395 --> 00:10:59.995
If so, he can't get away.

197
00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:03.795
But if he's just tied up and lying down...

198
00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:05.895
-It switched. -Yes.

199
00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:07.795
It's taken from a different camera angle.

200
00:11:07.795 --> 00:11:09.295
Wait... Wait a second!

201
00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:11.195
If he turns over and falls...

202
00:11:11.195 --> 00:11:13.595
He'll be strangled and get killed!

203
00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:14.995
Get up, Officer Takagi!

204
00:11:14.995 --> 00:11:17.195
Get up and get a hold of your circumstances!

205
00:11:21.795 --> 00:11:23.395
Officer Takagi.

206
00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:27.795
Where...

207
00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:33.095
Where is this place?

208
00:11:41.546 --> 00:11:44.246
Calm down. Calm down.

209
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:46.446
Think. Try to recall

210
00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:48.346
how things turned out this way.

211
00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:51.246
If I remember correctly, I met with that person last night,

212
00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:53.246
and was told that he wanted to show me some scenery,

213
00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:55.546
so he brought me here.

214
00:11:55.546 --> 00:11:58.946
Then, I was suddenly drugged from behind.

215
00:11:58.946 --> 00:12:01.446
But why?

216
00:12:01.446 --> 00:12:04.346
Don't tell me that he wanted to...

217
00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:06.846
Which means that the image on this camera

218
00:12:06.846 --> 00:12:09.046
is being sent to the MPD.

219
00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:10.446
What?

220
00:12:10.446 --> 00:12:13.346
Officer Takagi was kidnapped by someone?

221
00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:16.646
Yes, sir! This is the image of him.

222
00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:19.046
Officer Takagi!

223
00:12:19.046 --> 00:12:21.146
The camera switched over?

224
00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:23.046
There are probably three cameras.

225
00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:27.046
The shots are taken from the front, the side, and below.

226
00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.146
They seem to be streamed randomly.

227
00:12:29.146 --> 00:12:31.546
Can you tell where the images are being sent from?

228
00:12:31.546 --> 00:12:35.246
Yes, if we let the cyber crime department handle this.

229
00:12:35.246 --> 00:12:38.546
I don't think anything can be done right away.

230
00:12:38.546 --> 00:12:39.946
Conan!

231
00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:42.746
The only thing that can be done with that tablet

232
00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:43.946
is to switch the image on and off

233
00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:46.846
by pressing the button on the front of it.

234
00:12:46.846 --> 00:12:48.446
It's made so that everything else including the touch panel,

235
00:12:48.446 --> 00:12:53.446
power switch and the connector to charge it cannot be used.

236
00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:55.246
But Conan.

237
00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:57.346
If we disassemble this tablet,

238
00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:59.946
it can be charged directly from the inside.

239
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.646
The data can also be transferred from the hard disk.

240
00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:04.646
Wouldn't we at least be able to figure out

241
00:13:04.646 --> 00:13:06.146
where the information is being sent from?

242
00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:07.546
What if we aren't able

243
00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:11.746
to view Officer Takagi's footage after we disassembled it?

244
00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:13.946
The culprit has remodeled the button,

245
00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:17.146
and embedded a program to invalidate the functions

246
00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:18.646
of the touch panel and all, you know?

247
00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:20.846
So, it'd be safer to think that this device is rigged

248
00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:23.246
so that the image would be cut off,

249
00:13:23.246 --> 00:13:25.146
and will never boot again if it is disassembled.

250
00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:27.346
Well, we could contact the provider

251
00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:32.646
and trace the tablet without having to go through something so risky.

252
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.146
But culprits that carry out something like this

253
00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:37.246
would most likely be using a server abroad,

254
00:13:37.246 --> 00:13:39.446
so I think it would be difficult to trace the origin of the transmission

255
00:13:39.446 --> 00:13:41.646
in a short time.

256
00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:46.146
That's what Shinichi told me when I discussed this over the phone

257
00:13:46.146 --> 00:13:47.746
with him a while ago.

258
00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:49.846
But if it's possible to trace it,

259
00:13:49.846 --> 00:13:52.346
even if we have to spend some time...

260
00:13:52.346 --> 00:13:55.546
But the time limit is tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, right?

261
00:13:55.546 --> 00:13:57.246
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

262
00:13:57.246 --> 00:14:01.946
The man who gave the tablet to Genta and the others said so.

263
00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:04.746
He told them that it's perishable, so it should be opened quickly.

264
00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:08.146
Otherwise, it'll become no good tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

265
00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:10.146
What... What on earth does that mean?

266
00:14:10.146 --> 00:14:14.646
It probably means that if he's left as is, tied up and all...

267
00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:17.346
Without water or food, he won't make it past the third day.

268
00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:20.846
In other words, we only have until the day after tomorrow.

269
00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:25.446
But why does Officer Takagi have to go through something like this?

270
00:14:25.446 --> 00:14:29.346
He's not the type that would be hated by people.

271
00:14:29.346 --> 00:14:32.146
Being hated is an inevitable trait of any police detective.

272
00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:34.746
You'd never know when and where someone would hold a grudge against you.

273
00:14:34.746 --> 00:14:37.246
Superintendent Matsumoto!

274
00:14:37.246 --> 00:14:40.446
Megure, is it true that Officer Takagi said

275
00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.346
that he'd be staying overnight somewhere to meet someone?

276
00:14:43.346 --> 00:14:44.346
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:46.646
He was concerned about the timetable of the monorail,

278
00:14:46.646 --> 00:14:49.046
so he probably went to Haneda Airport.

279
00:14:49.046 --> 00:14:52.546
Then, contact Haneda Airport and find out if there was anyone

280
00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:55.346
by the name of Wataru Takagi among last night's passengers.

281
00:14:55.346 --> 00:14:56.946
Yes, sir!

282
00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:00.246
Shiratori, go to Takagi's residence,

283
00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.846
check the mails on his computer and his mailbox

284
00:15:02.846 --> 00:15:05.546
and figure out who he was planning to see.

285
00:15:05.546 --> 00:15:09.046
-Yes, sir. -Chiba, keep watch over the tablet.

286
00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:11.746
-Yes, sir! -Don't keep it on for too long.

287
00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:13.746
If we can't charge it,

288
00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.246
it means we can only watch the image

289
00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:16.846
for less than 10 hours.

290
00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:19.046
Turn it on for only 10 minutes per hour,

291
00:15:19.046 --> 00:15:22.146
then record the video while you're checking it.

292
00:15:22.146 --> 00:15:25.446
We have to find something to identify his location.

293
00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:28.146
Yes... Yes, sir! I'll get to it right away!

294
00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:30.446
Superintendent.

295
00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:34.446
-What about... -Sato, go and question the children

296
00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:35.646
who are waiting in the other room.

297
00:15:35.646 --> 00:15:37.046
Yes, sir!

298
00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:38.946
After all, they're vital witnesses

299
00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:41.246
who were in contact with the suspect.

300
00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:43.246
Ask them what the suspect looked like,

301
00:15:43.246 --> 00:15:44.846
his habits and also his usage of words.

302
00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:46.646
Don't leave out anything!

303
00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:47.946
Yes, sir.

304
00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:52.246
Everyone else, go and find all the people whom Takagi came across

305
00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:54.046
during his investigations.

306
00:15:54.046 --> 00:15:56.946
Whether it's the suspects or victims, find everybody, understand?

307
00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:58.246
Yes, sir...

308
00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:05.946
Officer Sato, let's go.

309
00:16:09.346 --> 00:16:12.646
No matter what, I give you my word that I'll rescue you.

310
00:16:12.646 --> 00:16:15.146
Hang on, Officer Takagi!

311
00:16:23.346 --> 00:16:25.546
I see. So that's the story.

312
00:16:25.546 --> 00:16:28.246
That's why that person brought me to a place like this.

313
00:16:28.246 --> 00:16:30.846
If that's the case, even if it's scary,

314
00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:32.746
I've got no choice but to do it.

315
00:16:36.446 --> 00:16:39.246
Then, let me confirm once again.

316
00:16:39.246 --> 00:16:41.046
A man who looked like this

317
00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:43.446
handed that tablet to you?

318
00:16:43.446 --> 00:16:44.546
Yeah.

319
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.946
First, he asked us if we knew Officer Wataru Takagi.

320
00:16:47.946 --> 00:16:49.946
We replied that we do.

321
00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.546
Then, he told us to give it

322
00:16:52.546 --> 00:16:54.946
to Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

323
00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:58.346
Then, it could be someone who holds a grudge against me, too.

324
00:16:58.346 --> 00:17:00.846
I don't think so.

325
00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:04.146
The culprit seems to know Officer Takagi by his first name,

326
00:17:04.146 --> 00:17:08.846
and yet he only knows you as Officer Takagi's girlfriend.

327
00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:10.846
Then, was there anything about his habits

328
00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:12.546
or usage of words that bothered you?

329
00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:14.746
There wasn't anything unusual, right?

330
00:17:14.746 --> 00:17:16.046
-Yeah. -Yeah.

331
00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:17.646
Bad news, Officer Sato!

332
00:17:17.646 --> 00:17:19.746
Officer Takagi...

333
00:17:22.246 --> 00:17:24.046
Officer Sato!

334
00:17:29.646 --> 00:17:32.646
Officer Takagi. Officer Takagi!

335
00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:38.046
What's this situation all about?

336
00:17:38.046 --> 00:17:40.046
Why does it look as if he's about to fall?

337
00:17:40.046 --> 00:17:42.946
I was trying to record the third image we received today,

338
00:17:42.946 --> 00:17:45.346
and then I saw this.

339
00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:46.846
But why?

340
00:17:46.846 --> 00:17:49.946
He has been like this for many hours already.

341
00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:52.546
It's understandable that he'd surrender to despair.

342
00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:55.346
Get a hold of yourself! Officer Takagi...

343
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:04.646
His police memo book.

344
00:18:05.646 --> 00:18:08.546
Hey, if somebody picks that up and reports it to the police,

345
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:11.846
we'll be able to figure out where Officer Takagi is.

346
00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:16.446
It's okay. It seems like Officer Takagi's in control.

347
00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:18.346
You... You're right.

348
00:18:24.946 --> 00:18:27.746
Hey! What on earth's going on?

349
00:18:27.746 --> 00:18:31.146
Wataru Takagi's wasn't on any flight

350
00:18:31.146 --> 00:18:33.446
departing from Haneda last night.

351
00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.246
No clues were found in Takagi's residence either,

352
00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:37.746
and there are no cases

353
00:18:37.746 --> 00:18:40.346
that seem related to what's happening now.

354
00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:43.946
Well...

355
00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:45.446
What is it?

356
00:18:45.446 --> 00:18:47.046
Come to think of it,

357
00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:49.946
I happened to see Takagi coming out from the reference room last week.

358
00:18:49.946 --> 00:18:51.046
What?

359
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:53.546
The thing is, he was in tears.

360
00:18:53.546 --> 00:18:57.746
So I wondered what documents he was looking through.

361
00:18:57.746 --> 00:18:58.946
Okay.

362
00:18:58.946 --> 00:19:02.346
Bring all those documents before me!

363
00:19:02.346 --> 00:19:03.346
Yes, sir...

364
00:19:04.846 --> 00:19:08.346
All the case documents that Officer Takagi was looking through that day

365
00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:09.846
involved cases of women

366
00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:13.246
who hung themselves to death about a year ago?

367
00:19:13.246 --> 00:19:14.846
Yes.

368
00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:16.446
There are three cases in total.

369
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.446
They were all concluded as non-criminal cases,

370
00:19:18.446 --> 00:19:20.946
and were handed over to the district police station.

371
00:19:20.946 --> 00:19:24.046
What were the three cases like?

372
00:19:24.046 --> 00:19:27.246
If I remember correctly, one of them was Ms. Yuko Takugi,

373
00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:30.146
a sixth-year medical student at Tohto University.

374
00:19:30.146 --> 00:19:31.746
The place where she committed suicide

375
00:19:31.746 --> 00:19:33.346
was the living room of her condo.

376
00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.346
It didn't look much like a woman's room,

377
00:19:35.346 --> 00:19:37.546
but it was neat and tidy.

378
00:19:37.546 --> 00:19:39.946
Based on the will that was found near her feet,

379
00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:43.846
it is written that she ran over somebody a few days before that,

380
00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:47.646
and she couldn't bear the guilt any longer.

381
00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:50.846
The second one was a teacher at an English conversation school,

382
00:19:50.846 --> 00:19:54.346
whose mother was American. Her name was Ms. Natalie Kuruma.

383
00:19:54.346 --> 00:19:57.846
Based on what was written on the calendar in her room,

384
00:19:57.846 --> 00:20:01.146
she had been dating her boyfriend every day.

385
00:20:01.146 --> 00:20:04.846
But after being dumped by him, she seemed to have fallen to despair.

386
00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:06.146
She seemed to have planned a date with him

387
00:20:06.146 --> 00:20:08.846
the day she committed suicide.

388
00:20:08.846 --> 00:20:11.746
How could you tell that?

389
00:20:11.746 --> 00:20:13.846
From her cell phone.

390
00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:17.246
The dispatched police squad that got there before us

391
00:20:17.246 --> 00:20:18.946
told us that it was written in the English text mail

392
00:20:18.946 --> 00:20:20.946
that she sent to her mother.

393
00:20:20.946 --> 00:20:23.946
The third woman was Ms. Kyoka Hikoue,

394
00:20:23.946 --> 00:20:27.146
the number-one hostess at a bar in Roppongi.

395
00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:29.046
It seems she was making a lot of money and yet,

396
00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:30.946
she lived in an old apartment.

397
00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:33.846
Her room was filled with empty beer cans.

398
00:20:33.846 --> 00:20:36.146
According to her diary, she found out that the boyfriend

399
00:20:36.146 --> 00:20:38.046
she was helping out financially was a marriage swindler.

400
00:20:38.046 --> 00:20:40.346
So, she hung herself to death in despair.

401
00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:42.446
Was that swindler arrested?

402
00:20:42.446 --> 00:20:46.246
Yes, not under the charge of swindling, but murder.

403
00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:49.346
He seems to have been swarmed with debts

404
00:20:49.346 --> 00:20:50.846
and got into trouble with black market loan sharks,

405
00:20:50.846 --> 00:20:52.146
and ended up stabbing someone.

406
00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:55.946
If I remember correctly, it was Officer Date who arrested him.

407
00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:57.246
Officer Date?

408
00:20:57.246 --> 00:21:00.546
Right. You've never met him, haven't you, Conan?

409
00:21:00.546 --> 00:21:04.046
Officer Date died in a traffic accident

410
00:21:04.046 --> 00:21:07.246
immediately after he arrested that swindler.

411
00:21:07.246 --> 00:21:10.346
Officer Date was trying to pick up a memo book,

412
00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:12.946
when a driver who fell asleep at the wheels ran over him.

413
00:21:12.946 --> 00:21:14.946
That's what Officer Takagi said.

414
00:21:14.946 --> 00:21:17.346
-Officer Takagi said so? -Yes.

415
00:21:17.346 --> 00:21:20.446
Officer Takagi was at the scene, too.

416
00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.146
They were staking out all night

417
00:21:22.146 --> 00:21:24.446
and were on their way home in the morning.

418
00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:27.646
I heard that he was run over when he tried to show Officer Takagi

419
00:21:27.646 --> 00:21:29.146
something in the memo book.

420
00:21:29.146 --> 00:21:32.946
You know, the black memo book that Officer Takagi is always using.

421
00:21:32.946 --> 00:21:36.146
It's a keepsake of Officer Date that was handed over to him.

422
00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:38.646
He worked hard to fill it up until there was no space to write in it.

423
00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:41.446
And he used to say with enthusiasm that he wanted to become

424
00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:43.946
a police detective like Officer Date soon.

425
00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:47.146
Officer Takagi and the other officer got along well, didn't they?

426
00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:48.146
Yes.

427
00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:51.846
Officer Date was Officer Takagi's mentor.

428
00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:55.546
Officer Date used to call the two of them "The Wataru Brothers".

429
00:21:55.546 --> 00:21:57.346
Why were they called "Brothers"?

430
00:21:57.346 --> 00:22:01.346
Because Officer Date's full name was Wataru Date.

431
00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:05.146
His first name was Wataru, the same as Officer Takagi's.

432
00:22:06.046 --> 00:22:07.646
Well, they both had the name, "Wataru",

433
00:22:07.646 --> 00:22:09.946
but unlike Officer Takagi who wasn't very into women,

434
00:22:09.946 --> 00:22:12.246
Officer Date loved to pursue them.

435
00:22:12.246 --> 00:22:14.346
Although he was only a year older than me,

436
00:22:14.346 --> 00:22:16.846
Officer Date looked much older.

437
00:22:16.846 --> 00:22:18.646
Don't tell me that...

438
00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:22.346
Don't tell me that the reason Officer Takagi was kidnapped was...

439
00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:10.146
Is... Is this an earthquake?

440
00:24:10.146 --> 00:24:11.546
Is it abroad?

441
00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:13.246
Get a hold of yourself.

442
00:24:13.246 --> 00:24:15.846
I've got to get out of here somehow.

443
00:24:15.846 --> 00:24:18.546
I have to relay the message to that person!

444
00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:20.646
Was there anyone who was related to Hokkaido

445
00:24:20.646 --> 00:24:23.246
among the three women who committed suicide?

446
00:24:23.246 --> 00:24:24.846
Tell me where Officer Takagi is.

447
00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:28.146
Are you the one?

448
00:24:28.146 --> 00:24:31.246
He was run over by a car and passed away that day!

449
00:24:31.246 --> 00:24:36.946
Next Conan, "A Life Risking Love Broadcast (Crisis)"

450
00:24:52.646 --> 00:24:54.646
Next Conan's Hint:

451
00:24:54.646 --> 00:24:56.846
"Crow"

452
00:24:56.846 --> 00:24:58.446
What's going to become of me?

453
00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:00.046
Don't worry, this happens quite often.

454
00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:02.042
It's not something you'd hope to happen often.
