1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,670
We accompanied Pops to Kokura, Fukuoka,

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,170
for the Japanese Detective League's award ceremony

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,170
so he could accept his Best Detective Award.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,870
"Kokura Station"

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,370
We've arrived in Kokura.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,570
"Kokura Station" -The award ceremony starts at 7 pm,

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,370
so we have plenty of time.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,370
I know. I should give him a call.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,770
Conan, let's visit Munakata first.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,470
Munakata?

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,570
I've always wanted to visit

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,570
Munakata Taisha and Miyajidake Shrine.

13
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,670
He's not answering.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,770
And...

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,670
-Who are you calling? -This camphor tree is huge.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,570
-My senior from the MPD -That might be a good place

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,070
-runs a company in Kokura. -to shop for souvenirs for Mom.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,770
Your senior from the MPD?

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,770
Torazo Fukamachi.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,470
They called him the Tiger of Sakuradamon.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,670
The Tiger of Sakuradamon?

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,770
-He's not answering. -I need to buy souvenirs for Mom,

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,770
-Okay! -Sonoko, and Sera.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,870
-Let's head over to his office -What would

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,370
-and surprise him. -Shinichi...

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,570
What?

27
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,970
Hold on! You promised we'd go sightseeing this afternoon!

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,070
We came all the way to Kokura.

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,770
We can afford to stop by for a while.

30
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,470
Then you should go by yourself.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,170
But...

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,570
I'd like to meet the Tiger of Sakuradamon too.

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,570
But, Conan...

34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,070
And I'd be worried about leaving him alone.

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,270
Let's meet back here around lunch.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
Okay!

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,970
But I wanted to go sightseeing together.

38
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,570
In my eyes are maximum creation.

39
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,270
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

40
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,970
Pops been given a detective award?

41
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,870
Something's happening in Northern Kyushu!

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,270
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,370
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:01,841
"The Northern Kyushu Mystery Tour (Kokura Arc)"

46
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,241
"Wakato Bridge"

47
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,541
"Old Furukawa Mining Wakamatsu Building"

48
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:28,341
"Tiger Tradings"

49
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,141
He was hospitalized for an injury?

50
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,141
Yes.

51
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:37,041
"Eisaku Kiriyama (45)" -A week ago, he hit his head when he fell.

52
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,941
He's still unconscious.

53
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,541
He's unconscious?

54
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,841
How did he fall?

55
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:45,841
Tell us exactly what happened.

56
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:49,441
Izumi, tell them.

57
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,841
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:54,341
"Noriko Izumi (28)" -The president injured his knee several years ago.

59
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,341
As part of his rehabilitation,

60
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:58,941
every morning he takes a walk around the office.

61
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:03,841
"Torazo Fukamachi (63)" -That day, he tripped on a parking block.

62
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,841
I found him on the ground

63
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,341
and called an ambulance immediately.

64
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,941
Which hospital is he staying at?

65
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:16,741
If you're hoping to visit him, don't.

66
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,241
You'd be hindering his treatment.

67
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,541
But...

68
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,541
Pops, don't be unreasonable.

69
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,741
Shut up.

70
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,641
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

71
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:29,941
I heard you're a great detective.

72
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:32,741
Well, I don't mean to brag,

73
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,841
but I was chosen for the Best Detective Award.

74
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:41,341
In that case, could you catch a culprit for us?

75
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,641
A culprit?

76
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,941
You mean his injury wasn't an accident?

77
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,841
No, that's not what I mean.

78
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,941
Someone vandalized our office.

79
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,241
Vandalized?

80
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:03,941
"Tiger"

81
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:05,041
Tiger?

82
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,841
Who found this?

83
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,141
I did.

84
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,541
Who are you?

85
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm the president's driver.

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,141
"Makoto Ukaji (42)" -My name is Ukaji.

87
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,641
"Makoto Ukaji (42)" -Three days ago,

88
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:22,741
this was here when I arrived for work in the morning.

89
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,641
This isn't the only place.

90
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,941
"Tiger" -It's also on the office parking lot,

91
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,341
"Tiger" -the wall of the warehouse,

92
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:33,041
"Tiger" -and even on the front door of my home.

93
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,841
Your front door?

94
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:38,941
Yes. It's clearly meant to threaten me.

95
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,241
What do you mean by threaten you?

96
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,241
The truth is the stockholders' meeting scheduled at 3 pm today

97
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,241
will decide that if President Fukamachi is unable to return to work,

98
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,241
I will become the next president.

99
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:55,541
Torahiko must have heard about it.

100
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,041
Torahiko?

101
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,541
President Fukamachi's son.

102
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,141
He attends a university in Tokyo

103
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:04,441
but we haven't been able to get in touch with him

104
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:07,141
since he heard about the accident and came home.

105
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:11,341
Torahiko was lazy and a handful.

106
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:15,641
In high school, he was suspended for writing similar graffiti.

107
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,041
He also caused an uproar

108
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,941
by using fireworks to build a bomb.

109
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:21,141
He's gotten in trouble with the police

110
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,441
more than a couple of times.

111
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:29,941
He probably assumed he'd take over his father's position.

112
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:32,141
So he's threatening you

113
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:35,341
so you won't become the company president?

114
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:37,041
If we don't do something,

115
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,041
it's possible he'll hurt the director.

116
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,041
Have you told the police?

117
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,741
We did but they said the graffiti alone would only allow them

118
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:48,641
to investigate it as a case of vandalism and trespassing.

119
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:52,941
Do you have proof that Mr. Torahiko did it?

120
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,241
I told you to shut up.

121
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,941
There's a witness.

122
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,441
A witness?

123
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:02,441
The security guard, Mr. Iwata, said that saw the culprit fleeing.

124
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,141
Where is he now?

125
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,641
He should be at the warehouse on the opposite side of the river.

126
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,941
It takes five minutes by boat. I'll take you there.

127
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,341
Thank you.

128
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,341
Mister, I want to go too.

129
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,241
You'd be in the way.

130
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,341
Wait here.

131
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,641
Your necktie is crooked.

132
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,341
Shall we go?

133
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:29,541
-Yes. -Be careful.

134
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,741
"Tiger Tradings"

135
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,741
"Miyajidake Shrine"

136
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,141
"President's Office"

137
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,141
What?

138
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,641
He did?

139
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,041
Yeah. He went to gather information

140
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,241
with the secretary, Ms. Izumi,

141
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,341
in order to find the person who graffitied the buildings.

142
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,941
Should he have accepted that job?

143
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,141
Where are you right now?

144
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,741
Miyajidake Shrine. It's famous for its path of light.

145
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,241
Path of light?

146
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,841
The shrine approach stretches straight to the ocean.

147
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:23,541
Twice a year, the sun sets right over it.

148
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,841
It's supposed to be breathtaking.

149
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:29,541
I went to Munakata Taisha too.

150
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,741
"Munakata Taisha" -It's mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki.

151
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,441
It's one of Japan's oldest shrines.

152
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:45,241
It's famous for its Miare Festival held in the fall.

153
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:49,041
The Sacred Island of Okinoshima

154
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,641
and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region

155
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,641
are inscribed on the World Heritage List.

156
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,341
World Heritage List?

157
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,741
That's amazing.

158
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:01,141
Anyway, let's meet somewhere for lunch.

159
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,241
Okay.

160
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:10,841
So this is President Fukamachi and his son, Mr. Torahiko.

161
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,941
Sonny, this is the president's office.

162
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:47,141
You shouldn't be in here.

163
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,541
Sorry.

164
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:54,041
And don't tell anyone I was sitting in his chair.

165
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,741
Where's Director Kiriyama?

166
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,041
He's visiting the president in the hospital.

167
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,441
But isn't he still unconscious?

168
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:05,141
Today is a special day.

169
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,841
A special day?

170
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,141
You might be too young to understand,

171
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,741
but in a shareholders' meeting at 3 pm today,

172
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:16,041
he will be appointed as the next president.

173
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,641
So he wants to report it to the president

174
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,741
even if it's only as a formality.

175
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:24,641
But he told Pops not to visit him.

176
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:27,541
That's why I said today's a special day.

177
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,041
Today, the director will be taking the president's car

178
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,341
to the shareholders' meeting.

179
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:36,241
I haven't driven his car in a week.

180
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,141
It's a very important day for the company.

181
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:43,441
Where's the parking lot where the president tripped?

182
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,441
Beneath that window.

183
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,941
"Tiger Tradings"

184
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,941
"Wakamatsu Ferry"

185
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:54,941
"Tobata to Wakamatsu"

186
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,241
Mr. Mouri.

187
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,241
Could we keep what I'm about to tell you between us?

188
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:09,541
Of course.

189
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,141
It's a detective's job to keep secrets.

190
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:15,841
The truth is...

191
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,341
"Tiger"

192
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,841
Bloodstains.

193
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,841
So this is where Mr. Fukamachi hit his head.

194
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:39,641
The blocks are approximately two meters apart.

195
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:44,741
Mr. Fukamachi looked surprisingly small in that photo.

196
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,741
If he just tripped on the block,

197
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:49,441
he wouldn't have hit his head here.

198
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,541
It'd be impossible for him to hit his head here

199
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,941
unless he was running.

200
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:57,041
But Mr. Fukamachi's knees were injured so he couldn't run.

201
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,841
Which means...

202
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,741
Director Kiriyama did?

203
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,041
Yes.

204
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,141
The director and president

205
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:10,141
often argued over how to manage the company.

206
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:14,841
In other words, you believe Director Kiriyama pushed Fukamachi.

207
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,241
It's possible.

208
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:22,241
It's possible Torahiko

209
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,341
is trying to get revenge on the director

210
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:27,341
because he learned that.

211
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,841
Revenge?

212
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:44,391
"Tiger Tradings"

213
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,091
"Genichiro Iwata (63)" -Yes, I saw someone run

214
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,791
three days ago in the morning.

215
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,391
You're sure it was Torahiko?

216
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:55,191
When I worked as a fireworks maker,

217
00:13:55,191 --> 00:14:00,291
Torahiko stole some gunpowder from the workshop.

218
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,291
It reminded me of how he looked then.

219
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,491
Mr. Iwata and the president are childhood friends.

220
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:11,191
It's the reason he knows Torahiko so well.

221
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,991
I saw him from behind,

222
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,391
but he had blond hair.

223
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,591
I'm fairly certain it was him.

224
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:22,591
Don't you remember what you said in the ambulance?

225
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,291
The ambulance?

226
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,991
Are we finished?

227
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,391
I need to take the president's car for cleaning.

228
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,791
Sorry to have interrupted your busy schedule.

229
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,991
What did he mean about the ambulance?

230
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,191
Inside the ambulance,

231
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:55,991
"Kokura Castle" -the president was barely conscious.

232
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:57,391
Then,

233
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:00,491
"Kokura Castle - Toraccha" -he only said the word "tora" (Tiger).

234
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,691
Tiger?

235
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:07,891
Apparently, the EMTs heard him say "dorako".

236
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,691
"Dorako"?

237
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:12,391
"Kokura Castle Gardens" -Maybe he was trying to say

238
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,691
"dora musuko" (lazy son).

239
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,691
Whether it was tiger or lazy son,

240
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:20,691
he must have been really worried about Torahiko.

241
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,491
It's not like that.

242
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,191
What?

243
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,991
Mr. Iwata believes Torahiko

244
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,091
may have pushed the president.

245
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,891
He what?

246
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,891
Mr. Iwata thinks he's threatening the director

247
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,491
in order to keep him quiet because he found out about it.

248
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:42,591
"Tiger"

249
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:49,091
Is Torahiko that bad of a guy?

250
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:54,591
Ms. Izumi, do you have any idea where Torahiko might be?

251
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,891
There's a cafe near Mojiko

252
00:15:56,891 --> 00:16:01,591
called Airs Cafe where he worked part time in high school.

253
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,891
"Three months ago"

254
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:08,591
"Two months ago"

255
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,391
"One months ago"

256
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:11,791
"Three days ago"

257
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,691
There he is. It's Mr. Torahiko.

258
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,491
Three days ago in the night?

259
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,391
That's after the buildings were graffitied.

260
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,791
Huh?

261
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:29,291
Mister, what are you doing?

262
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:33,091
Isn't this President Fukamachi's car?

263
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:36,591
Yeah. It's my job to clean it.

264
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,491
That's Toraccha, right?

265
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:41,291
Kokura Castle's mascot.

266
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,091
Who are you?

267
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:44,591
I'm Conan.

268
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:47,591
I came here with Pops Kogoro.

269
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,391
Kogoro? Do you mean Detective Kogoro Mouri?

270
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,291
Yeah. Do you know him?

271
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,191
He was just at the warehouse asking about the graffiti.

272
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:00,591
So you're the witness, Mr. Iwata.

273
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:01,691
Yeah.

274
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,991
Hello?

275
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,691
What? In the president's office?

276
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,591
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

277
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,691
I just cleaned the car,

278
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,191
so don't make it dirty.

279
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,191
Okay.

280
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,391
The president's office?

281
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,991
Where should we go now?

282
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,591
This is no fun alone.

283
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:55,891
Conan?

284
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,091
I'm at Mojiko Retro right now.

285
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:03,491
There are lots of tasty looking shops serving baked curry.

286
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,491
Conan want to come?

287
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:09,091
I'll wait for the Pops a little longer.

288
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:13,091
What? Aren't you hungry?

289
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,391
No, I'm fine.

290
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,591
Eat lunch without me.

291
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,191
Okay.

292
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:27,991
This was supposed to be a fun trip.

293
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:34,591
"Lovers' Bridge"

294
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,091
"Blue Wing Moji"

295
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,391
I'm so lonely.

296
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,991
Sorry, were you waiting long?

297
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:54,091
Huh?

298
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,291
Sorry but could you be my girlfriend for a while?

299
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,391
What?

300
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,591
I'm being followed by bad men.

301
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,691
I just need 10 seconds.

302
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:06,791
What?

303
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:15,691
Darn it!

304
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,391
Let's go!

305
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,191
Hey.

306
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,391
Thanks. You saved me.

307
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,591
"Tiger Tradings"

308
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:37,791
"President's Office"

309
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,991
What's this?

310
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:06,991
"Old Moji Mitsui Club"

311
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,491
Torahiko Fukamachi?

312
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,591
"Torahiko Fukamachi (21)" -Funny name, right?

313
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,891
My dad loves tigers.

314
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:23,091
Was your dad known as the Tiger of Sakuradamon at the MPD?

315
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,391
What? How did you know?

316
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,791
My dad worked with your dad.

317
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,791
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

318
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,691
Kogoro Mouri?

319
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:49,691
"Mojiko Retro Observation Deck" -Someone must be talking about me again.

320
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,491
Torahiko was here three ago in night.

321
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,791
Three days ago?

322
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,791
That's the night the buildings were vandalized.

323
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:03,091
Huh? Ran?

324
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,191
What? Torahiko?

325
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:09,391
Could it be?

326
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,491
What is it?

327
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:14,491
I saw Torahiko just now, but he's with...

328
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:16,891
No, that can't be.

329
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,791
You saw Torahiko?

330
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,091
I'm not sure it was him,

331
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,391
but I may or may not have seen him with a young woman

332
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:25,691
who looks like my daughter.

333
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,491
Ran and Mr. Torahiko?

334
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:30,991
I see. Your dad's a detective.

335
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,791
He's been hired to investigate some vandalism case

336
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,291
at Mr. Fukamachi's office.

337
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,891
It's my dad.

338
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,691
Ran, where are you?

339
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,191
Where am I?

340
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,191
A place called Mojiko Retro.

341
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:50,591
What? You're not with Torahiko, are you?

342
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:52,691
What? How did you know?

343
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,991
I knew it. What are you thinking?

344
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,791
What are you so angry about?

345
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,491
Torahiko is Mr. Fukamachi's son.

346
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:03,291
I know that!

347
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,691
Do you have any who he is?

348
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,991
I told you, he's Fukamachi's son...

349
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:10,191
Stop!

350
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,691
Let go!

351
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,791
Stop resisting!

352
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,191
What are you doing?

353
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,991
Stay out of the way!

354
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:23,291
Ran, what's wrong?

355
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,891
What happened?

356
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:25,991
Ran!

357
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,291
"Next Episode"

358
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,391
It's an emergency!

359
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,391
Something must've happened to Ran!

360
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:01,191
Who are you?

361
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,191
Did you write the graffiti, Torahiko?

362
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,791
It wasn't me.

363
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,391
If you're innocent,

364
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:10,391
my father will protect you.

365
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,891
Ran, listen closely.

366
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,091
That Toraccha...

367
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:17,191
Next Conan,

368
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:21,391
"The Northern Kyushu Mystery Tour (Moji Arc)"

369
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:24,176
Next Conan's hint:

370
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,376
"Stuffed animal"

371
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,176
We still haven't grasped any information.

372
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,176
Catch a tiger by the toe!

373
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,876
Not that.
