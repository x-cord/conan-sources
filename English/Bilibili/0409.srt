1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,640
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,340
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,040
The heroine is kidnapped.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,540
Only a few hours are left until the curtain opens.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,540
Let's get at it, The Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,825
Be quiet!

10
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:03,425
"Taketori Story" -Wait! Freeze!

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,525
Stop there!

12
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,625
Thief, give up!

13
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,625
Oh, no! Please forgive me!

14
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:17,925
Thank you, sir.

15
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,525
Okay! Stop there!

16
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:23,525
"Tamanosuke Ito (17), Tamanosuke Theatre Troupe Director"

17
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:25,725
Everyone's pretty good!

18
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,225
Really?

19
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:30,525
"Megumi Ito (7)" -Especially Conan!

20
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,525
Oh, thank you. I'm very happy!

21
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:37,125
Hey, wait a minute. The two of you...

22
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,225
Hey, Mr. Tamanosuke.

23
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,225
What?

24
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,625
Are you sure you really want amateurs like us?

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,825
Of course.

26
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:53,425
This is a special performance different from our show,

27
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,525
the problem is not you but...

28
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:56,525
What?

29
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,125
I bought it yesterday.

30
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,625
What are you slacking off for?

31
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,125
You don't need a stage to rehearse!

32
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,625
Sorry, director.

33
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,225
"Renge Kataoka (17)" -Renge!

34
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,925
Don't open the script now!

35
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,925
When do you think we started rehearsing?

36
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,325
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,925
Don't apologize so easily!

38
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,925
If you're not proud of your acting, quit being an actress!

39
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,025
I'm...

40
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,625
No, I mean, yes!

41
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,225
Scary, seems like a different person.

42
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,825
No, Genta. That's what an actor is like.

43
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:33,025
Impressive.

44
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:37,425
By the way, don't you think Ms. Renge is a bit like Ran?

45
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,925
What?

46
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,025
Okay! Rehearsal begins!

47
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:44,525
Tamanosuke Ito.

48
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,925
This young director leading the traveling theatrical troupe,

49
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:51,125
comes to our town again and performs.

50
00:03:54,725 --> 00:04:00,525
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 1)"

51
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,525
"Mouri Detective Agency"

52
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,925
Ran! Hurry up!

53
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,925
Tamanosuke's rehearsal will end!

54
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:14,325
But, I have to make lunch for my dad.

55
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,925
Leave it...

56
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,825
He's going to fall asleep drinking, right?

57
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,425
Hey, Sonoko!

58
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,825
Did I catch a cold?

59
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,925
Or is it...

60
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,325
That?

61
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:38,125
You think the detective maniac will mind?

62
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,225
What?

63
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,725
Come to think of it...

64
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:44,725
Tamanosuke does resemble him a little.

65
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,825
I'm talking about Shinichi.

66
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,525
Really? I don't think so.

67
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,225
By the way, the title is "Taketori Story".

68
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:57,825
It's about Princess Kaguya, right?

69
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,025
Right!

70
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:03,625
And The Emperor that falls in love with Princess Kaguya is Tamanosuke.

71
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,125
I want to be Princess Kaguya!

72
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,225
Sonoko.

73
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:22,025
What an expensive car.

74
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,325
Who is it?

75
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,225
This way, president.

76
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:35,125
Gosh.

77
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,325
Watch it! Excuse you!

78
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,625
No, that isn't right!

79
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,325
No way.

80
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,225
I came for you, Renge.

81
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,325
Come on! Come home with me!

82
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,625
I'm not going home! I'm staying here!

83
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,725
Renge!

84
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,525
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

85
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:10,825
Let's go, Ms. Renge.

86
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,025
No!

87
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,325
Let go of me!

88
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,825
Ms. Renge!

89
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:20,225
What happened? What's it about?

90
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:23,325
That girl plays Princess Kaguya.

91
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,725
Wait a minute!

92
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:30,325
What is this? Who are you?

93
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,625
"Hanshiro Kataoka (60)" -I am Hanshiro Kataoka.

94
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,025
The father of Renge Kataoka.

95
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,125
What?

96
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,625
"Hikoemon Bando(50)" -Kataoka...

97
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,225
"Kikuno Ichimura(40)" -Hanshiro...

98
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,625
Isn't he...

99
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,225
He's the founder of the Kataoka Concern

100
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,525
and is the current president.

101
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,525
What? Then...

102
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,825
She's a lady from rich family.

103
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:54,125
Amazing!

104
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:58,625
Renge, you didn't say a word of this to anyone.

105
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,725
But...

106
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,325
That has nothing to do with this!

107
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:06,325
This has nothing to do with me wanting to act!

108
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,825
That's...

109
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,625
By any chance, Renge...

110
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,725
Did you run away?

111
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,825
I haven't heard from her for six months.

112
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:22,025
I asked Ohnuki to look for.

113
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,325
"Mataroku Onoue (35)" -What a surprise.

114
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:26,325
"Yoichi Azuma (28)" -Well, we're not much different from you.

115
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:29,725
This profession makes it hard to do anything for our parents.

116
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,925
"Kantaro Sawamura (23)" -True...

117
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:35,125
But I think it's not good to make them worry, after all.

118
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,825
-Ohnuki. -Yes, sir.

119
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,225
"Shuichi Ohnuki (38)" -Let us go, Ms. Renge.

120
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,125
I don't want to! I'm not going home.

121
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,825
-I'm definitely won't be going home! -Ms. Renge!

122
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,025
Ohnuki!

123
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,625
Yes, sir. Sorry to have troubled you.

124
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:53,325
We would like to do what is appropriate for everyone here.

125
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,325
I don't want anything from you.

126
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,125
I have no business doing so.

127
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,825
Director!

128
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:03,225
Go home now, Renge.

129
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:11,325
Renge! Go home once and come back after you talk things over.

130
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,325
Wait a minute, director!

131
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,325
There won't be time for the rehearsal and plan.

132
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:23,025
The first day is three days from today.

133
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,925
True, it won't do.

134
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:29,225
But it won't do to leave things like this.

135
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,625
You're right.

136
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,225
Go home now, Renge.

137
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,125
-Wait! -Ms. Renge!

138
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,825
Please wait, director! I...

139
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,925
Ran, can you come here?

140
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,025
What? Okay...

141
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,525
Someone bring the costume for Princess Kaguya and the props!

142
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,925
Hey, hey, come on.

143
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,325
Are you kidding?

144
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:58,525
Ran is going to substitute for Ms. Renge!

145
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,225
No, no way!

146
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:04,525
You're right, we need Kaguya for the rehearsal and planning.

147
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,825
To make it in time for the first day.

148
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,125
So until then?

149
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,325
Well, it can't be helped.

150
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:12,625
True.

151
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,525
Okay, let's do the rehearsal!

152
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,325
Ms. Renge!

153
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:33,225
Wasn't that a little cold...

154
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,525
Who the director?

155
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,525
True.

156
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,025
You're wrong.

157
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,825
The director believes in Renge that she will return.

158
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:45,125
That's right, that is obvious.

159
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,525
So pretty, Ran.

160
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,325
She's really pretty!

161
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,525
She should actually act out in the play!

162
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,025
I agree.

163
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,225
Hey...

164
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,425
But I don't think that's such a good idea.

165
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,525
See.

166
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,125
What?

167
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,725
A love scene!

168
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,425
Maybe this...

169
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,225
Ran and Tamanosuke...

170
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:17,625
Not good...

171
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:22,925
I'm glad the detective maniac isn't watching.

172
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,025
I'm watching.

173
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:28,125
Hey, besides that, why isn't it me?

174
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,725
But Ms. Renge did not return.

175
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:41,125
And the first day of the performance arrives.

176
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,525
"Taketori Story"

177
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,925
Three more hours...

178
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:56,925
We have come too far not to open the curtain.

179
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,925
Without the protagonist?

180
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,925
Director...

181
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,225
What are we going to do?

182
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,925
I'm going to go get her.

183
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,825
Go and get her...

184
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:12,425
Renge?

185
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,225
It's going to be difficult with that father...

186
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:19,025
Maybe she changed her mind and doesn't want to come back.

187
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:22,725
No way... What's going to happen to this play?

188
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,525
We will have to cancel it.

189
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,125
I haven't heard of a "Taketori Story" without Kaguya.

190
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,025
I'm going.

191
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,325
Director!

192
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,125
Wait, Mr. Tamanosuke!

193
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,125
What?

194
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,725
I have something to say to Ms. Renge as a substitute.

195
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,425
Mr. Driver, please hurry!

196
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,025
"Kataoka"

197
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,325
Conan!

198
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,325
Hey, Officer Takagi...

199
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,825
Hey, you two!

200
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,225
How come you're here?

201
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:27,825
Dad?

202
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,425
Officer Takagi.

203
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:30,825
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:33,325
There's no knowing where the culprit could be watching

205
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,725
so I had to let them in.

206
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:36,725
Culprit?

207
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,525
It's you. What do you want?

208
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,625
There's only one thing!

209
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,225
Where is she? Where's Renge?

210
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,125
I...

211
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,925
I was thinking she is at your place.

212
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,425
What?

213
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,625
I don't know where she is since last night.

214
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,825
She said she was going shopping.

215
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,425
What?

216
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,425
Dad, what's going on?

217
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:10,125
You keep out of this!

218
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,825
Conan!

219
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,525
Hey, stop it!

220
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,725
"Ransom money".

221
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,725
"1,500,000 yen"?

222
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:25,225
Ms. Renge!

223
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:27,125
"Divide the money with Imai Electronics,"

224
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:33,525
"Kato Network and Nakao Media accordingly"

225
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:36,225
"Have the money ready by 2 pm"

226
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,825
"And let a secretary carry it"

227
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:41,225
"To the parking lot at first block of Yoshioka."

228
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,125
Ransom...

229
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,325
Is it...

230
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,925
Kidnapping!

231
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,889
Then... It was just an hour ago?

232
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,689
That they sent this blackmail letter was sent?

233
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:03,889
Yes.

234
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,389
Originator?

235
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,389
This is quite some trouble.

236
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,289
This is used in international crimes

237
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,089
and the method has become a problem all over the world.

238
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,889
Mr. Kataoka.

239
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,989
The demand of this division of the ransom...

240
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,089
Ohnuki.

241
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,189
Yes.

242
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:28,289
All the three companies in demand has had recent transaction with us.

243
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,789
But why these three companies?

244
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,189
That is...

245
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,989
It's okay, explain.

246
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,289
Yes.

247
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:41,989
Well, the managers of these three companies have all asked

248
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:45,189
for a hand in marriage with Ms. Renge.

249
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,889
Well, that's like...

250
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,989
That's right! Snow White!

251
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:07,189
Dad! You mean Princess Kaguya!

252
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,689
Yeah, that's right. Some people call her that, too.

253
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:12,189
That's the only name people call her.

254
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,689
What is it?

255
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,189
Something is bugging me.

256
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:19,989
Excuse me.

257
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,589
Tell them to leave!

258
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,189
I don't want to hear any excuses!

259
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:40,489
What's wrong?

260
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:44,789
As a matter of fact, one of the suitors I mentioned,

261
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,889
due to situations at the company can't get the ransom ready.

262
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,389
That's a lie!

263
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,889
They just don't want any trouble and scandal!

264
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,389
How dare, they weigh my daughter, Renge's life,

265
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,689
with that of the company's reputation.

266
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:03,089
-I won't forgive them! -But, what will happen to the ransom money?

267
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,089
I already have it ready.

268
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,789
I have their company name on the outside.

269
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,289
But I'm not giving my daughter away to them!

270
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:14,989
Drop out from the wooing race?

271
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:16,889
This is becoming more and more...

272
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,689
Please forgive me.

273
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,289
Snow white...

274
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,789
Princess Kaguya!

275
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,289
That's it!

276
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:37,189
Meanwhile, we have received the money from the other two.

277
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:40,589
As soon as it's time, I will carry it to the destination.

278
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:45,089
We must agree with their terms.

279
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,889
And see what they will do afterwards...

280
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,589
We, the police will go about the investigation

281
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,789
with the rescue of your daughter as top priority.

282
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,389
Thank you.

283
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,689
What?

284
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,689
This is...

285
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,289
The image was cut once probably

286
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,689
to make the halation disappear.

287
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,089
The kidnapper stopped the camera and closed the window.

288
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:24,789
No, wait. This is...

289
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,089
There's something there.

290
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,089
Is that spider web?

291
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:34,989
No, then the position isn't right.

292
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,789
This place...

293
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,589
This place looks familiar.

294
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,389
-What? -Hey!

295
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:46,189
How many times do I have to tell you, you brat?

296
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,589
Dad!

297
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,789
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,689
Darn it, I almost made it.

299
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,089
Kidnapped?

300
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:01,589
Ms. Renge?

301
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,489
I'll have to be here for awhile.

302
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,089
Ayumi, how is it down there?

303
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,889
Everyone doesn't know what to do.

304
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:11,289
There's only one hour until the curtain goes up...

305
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,189
What should we do, Conan?

306
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,589
Do something...

307
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,089
Sonoko?

308
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:19,389
Gosh...

309
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,689
You shouldn't go off on your own here and there.

310
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:25,989
Get rid of the cobweb yourself!

311
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,789
I'm asking you because I can't do it myself!

312
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:31,689
I hate spiders!

313
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,989
Myself? I can't do it myself...

314
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,889
That's it, I got it!

315
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,289
False kidnapping?

316
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,389
Renge did it herself?

317
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,989
Why would she want to do that...

318
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:26,389
Maybe she wanted to ruin the talk about marriage?

319
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,689
What's that supposed to mean?

320
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,789
I don't really know

321
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,689
but probably the reason for asking for ransom

322
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,489
from the people who proposed to her...

323
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,189
Was her way of wanting to relate how she felt to her father

324
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,989
in accordance to the story of Princess Kaguya?

325
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,989
Right, I think so too!

326
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:46,189
But that's no excuse for her to do such a thing!

327
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,389
Little one!

328
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:50,089
Renge is at the warehouse, right?

329
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,889
Yes, probably...

330
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:52,989
It's probably there!

331
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,689
-What? -Let's go!

332
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,489
-Wait up! -Tamanosuke!

333
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:20,689
This is the storage warehouse for the costumes and props that we rented,

334
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,489
Renge should have the key too.

335
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,789
This place must be it.

336
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,589
Don't you think we should tell dad?

337
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:39,189
But there's no sign of anyone.

338
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:44,389
Renge!

339
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:46,989
Ms. Renge!

340
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,289
I knew it...

341
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:02,889
This!

342
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,389
Renge!

343
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:12,089
And at this instant, the false kidnap became a real one!

344
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:20,989
Somehow, Ms. Renge really got kidnapped.

345
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,089
The culprit is probably

346
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:28,189
the other person who helped with her false kidnapping!

347
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:38,889
I'll be going.

348
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,289
What? Where's Ran and the others?

349
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,589
Where did they go?

350
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:50,989
Inspector, they're going.

351
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,189
Okay.

352
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,189
And the case moves on...

353
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,389
The curtain for the play has also gone up!

354
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,489
"Next Episode" -Once upon a time,

355
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,989
there was an old man who harvests bamboo.

356
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,189
Let me do it!

357
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:07,389
-Ran... -Ran.

358
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,589
They got away!

359
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,789
Don't let him get away!

360
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,689
We are definitely going to find Ms. Renge!

361
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,689
I found her, Conan!

362
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,889
Please hurry back, Ms. Renge, Tamanosuke!

363
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:29,677
Next Conan, "Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 2)"

364
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,316
Next Conan's Hint:

365
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,616
"Phone call from the culprit"

366
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,316
In the next story, I am the Princess Kaguya.

367
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:38,016
-Thank you for your hard work! -Thank you for your hard work!

368
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:39,416
What?
