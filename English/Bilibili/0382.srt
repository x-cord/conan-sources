1
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,840
The answer lies behind the message.

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Who is to win? God only knows.

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,140
His name is Detective Conan!

6
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,525
Somebody visited us to invite us to the final game of the high school

7
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,825
baseball tournament and Takarazuka Revue show, all the way from Osaka.

8
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:03,525
It was Heiji and Kazuha.

9
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,825
However, after finding out that both events will be on the same day,

10
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,425
the people from Osaka started to have a fight.

11
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:13,725
In order to decide which one to watch, Pops comes up with a suggestion.

12
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,025
A deduction battle begins.

13
00:02:18,325 --> 00:02:24,225
"The Deduction Battle (Part 2)"

14
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,125
Kazuha.

15
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,025
What's wrong, Kazuha?

16
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:33,625
I'm just confused. This dying message is killing me.

17
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,825
If we can't figure out what it means, we're going to lose this battle.

18
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,625
No Takarazuka show. I just don't want to lose.

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,825
Battle...

20
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:52,825
Come on, there are no winners or losers in deduction.

21
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,525
Because...

22
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:59,625
what we have to do is to find the one and only truth.

23
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,725
That's true.

24
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,025
Hey, Hattori.

25
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,925
You got it too, right?

26
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,425
The true meaning of the dying message.

27
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:12,325
Nope. Not at all.

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:18,825
How come we don't have the actual blocks that have the ink spots on them?

29
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,725
If these were the actual blocks, not the pictures,

30
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,725
we could've looked at them like this.

31
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,925
Maybe there was something hidden behind them.

32
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,825
Well, too bad we can't see the backside of the blocks

33
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:34,425
because these are pictures.

34
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,425
I see. This guy...

35
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,525
It seems that the president

36
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:53,025
was having a hard time putting the ink on the blocks, huh?

37
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,425
His hands were tied behind his back.

38
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:58,525
Plus, he had to read the characters on the blocks with his fingers

39
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,625
in order to choose the right ones, right?

40
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,125
Look at those blocks. Each of them has different characters

41
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,525
and also a picture of an animal on it.

42
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:11,025
I would be confused and pick the wrong block for sure.

43
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:14,025
If it wasn't blocks but pieces of Japanese chess,

44
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:15,525
it would be so much easier

45
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,825
because there's only one character on each backside of the piece.

46
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,525
Kudo.

47
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,325
Only one character on the backside?

48
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:26,625
That would be even harder, stupid.

49
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,925
The pieces are not big enough to see

50
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:33,225
whether it was the victim's dying message or not.

51
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,125
Are they?

52
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:42,725
Yes. Maybe the president just dropped the pieces on the ink accidentally.

53
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,225
Maybe the dying message is actually on the...

54
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:53,225
So you did find the motive to kill

55
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,525
from the four workers who found the victim.

56
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,825
Yes.

57
00:04:56,825 --> 00:05:00,025
First, about the accountant, Nao Aiko.

58
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,725
She was the former wife of President Tsujiya.

59
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:05,125
She had an affair with another man and got divorced.

60
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,425
They were having problems with alimony.

61
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,925
Atsushi Hasami, the sales clerk.

62
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,525
He had been told by the victim that he would be fired

63
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:16,225
if this year's revenue goes below last year's.

64
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,625
The planner, Isao Nakagami had been told the same thing.

65
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,225
Also, there had been a lot of conflict between him and the victim

66
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:25,425
because of the design of their new toys.

67
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,025
Lastly, the vice president, Hajime Iwatomi

68
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,725
was not having a fight or anything with the president.

69
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,925
But actually, he is supposed to be the next president

70
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,925
if anything happens to President Tsujiya.

71
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:37,925
So all of them have a decent motive for murder.

72
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,725
A, u, e, o, u, i.

73
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:47,025
There you go. You're almost there.

74
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:51,725
There had been a lot of conflict between the president and the workers.

75
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,125
I'm curious what kept this company going so long.

76
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,725
The workers had been drinking in Mr. Iwatomi's house,

77
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,825
complaining about their boss and stuff.

78
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,525
On June 29th, which was the day of the murder,

79
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07,525
the three workers went to Mr. Iwatomi's house to drink,

80
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,825
and stayed over night.

81
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,825
On the next day, all four workers came to the office together

82
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:14,225
and found the dead president.

83
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,725
One more thing.

84
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:19,625
This may have nothing to with the case.

85
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,625
But each worker has a strange obsession.

86
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,325
Obsession?

87
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:27,625
Ms. Aiko gets cold easily so she has 50 pairs of gloves.

88
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,925
She brings at least three pairs when she goes fishing.

89
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,225
Mr. Hasami is a movie lover and has 30 sunglasses.

90
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,725
Those actually include the limited models

91
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:40,025
which some famous actors used to wear.

92
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,725
Mr. Nakagami has at least 40 hats.

93
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:47,125
He wears them when he goes to the turf, just for good luck.

94
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,525
Mr. Iwatomi was the victim's golf friend, had 30 pairs of white golf shoes.

95
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,425
These are all expensive brand shoes.

96
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:57,025
He polishes them all once a week.

97
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,325
And lastly. The victim, President Tsujiya was obsessed with idols.

98
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,125
It seems he had been collecting a lot of idol goods.

99
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:09,825
I found a lot those idol goods in the president's room over there.

100
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,325
That! See the one on the desk?

101
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:16,225
Pens and pen stands with the idol's picture on them and stuff.

102
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,425
I see.

103
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:21,725
Hey, Kudo. Have you noticed it?

104
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,825
You mean the unnaturalness of the desk?

105
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,325
But it's not only that.

106
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:31,325
Right. There's one more thing that's kind of bugging me.

107
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,925
I suppose this calendar is also the president's stuff, right?

108
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:38,825
Yes. That calendar is actually his favourite,

109
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,025
so he kept it even after that month passed.

110
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,425
Hattori.

111
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:52,325
Did you buy it? The novel.

112
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:55,625
My mom also got me one first thing in the morning today.

113
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,525
Have you figured out something, Kazuha?

114
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,925
Kazuha?

115
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,725
Sorry, Ran. I can't talk right now.

116
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,525
I think I'm just about to solve it.

117
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:11,425
What is it now? What time do you think it is?

118
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,925
Don't you tell me you are still suspicious about us?

119
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,225
Well...

120
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:20,625
I heard some money matters were involved in this murder.

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,425
It's all because of our vague alibis. We have no proof as to it.

122
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,825
But what can I do? I was really at the turf that day.

123
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:33,125
I was at a golf course, watching the final round of the tournament.

124
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,925
I was watching movies. Actually, three movies in a row.

125
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:40,925
I was out fishing. I just happened to go by myself.

126
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:41,925
All right.

127
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,125
So who found the dead body first?

128
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,425
Who is this boy?

129
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,225
Could you just tell me more about it, please?

130
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:53,825
It's me who found him first.

131
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,625
I was going to sit at my desk when I found him lying on the floor.

132
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,225
I screamed.

133
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,225
As we heard Mr. Iwatomi's scream,

134
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:04,725
we all came here and called the police.

135
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,025
Right.

136
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,825
Before I forget, is it your president who rips the pages off the calendar?

137
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:16,425
Yes. The president gets upset if we do it because we might ruin it.

138
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,625
So Mr. Tsujiya always rips it off.

139
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,325
And he keeps it in his room like some kind of precious treasure.

140
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:26,725
Was he also the one who wrote the schedule on the calendar?

141
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:33,525
We were all supposed to play some golf together next Sunday.

142
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,925
I can't believe this actually happened.

143
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:40,125
Anyway, we've got to go to look for something.

144
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,425
You guys do the talking, okay?

145
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,825
All right. Let's do it.

146
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,625
Yes.

147
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,925
The fact the video camera was at a blind spot

148
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:59,825
from the victim's point of view,

149
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:02,425
and the unnaturally neat desk.

150
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:07,025
The bloodstain on the leather coat the murderer was wearing.

151
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,725
The suspects' strange obsessions.

152
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,625
And the president's dying message.

153
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,025
Right.

154
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,725
Now, all we need is that thing.

155
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:20,425
The thing that connects the pieces of the mystery all together.

156
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:23,825
What? One of the suspects got a solid alibi?

157
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:28,025
Yes. I'm at the TV station, checking the footage.

158
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,525
I see him.

159
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,925
Clearly.

160
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,525
Kudo.

161
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,025
Ran.

162
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,725
I found it.

163
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,725
It's the June calendar.

164
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:47,225
There's a thin bloodstain, but I can still see it.

165
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,625
That must be it.

166
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,625
The murderer is...

167
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,925
I got it.

168
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,525
Ran, I think...

169
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,425
I got the answer.

170
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:05,688
Seriously? You really got the answer?

171
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:10,288
The dying message the president left at the murder scene.

172
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:14,188
Yes. The four building blocks with the ink spots, right?

173
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:17,888
That looked like a hidden secret code,

174
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:20,888
but it was simply indicating the murderer.

175
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,488
The murderer?

176
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:26,488
I don't think there's any person that looks like a building block.

177
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,388
No! It's the name.

178
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,488
Name?

179
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,688
None of the four names are related to "o", "mo", "chi", "ya" though.

180
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,288
Heiji mentioned it earlier. Remember?

181
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,788
The victim might have just put the blocks on the ink,

182
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:41,088
and not because he wanted us to read what's with the ink spots.

183
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,088
In other words, the backside of the ink spotted character

184
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:46,588
is the true dying message.

185
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,588
I understand. But we can't see what behind those characters.

186
00:11:50,588 --> 00:11:54,488
I can ask the forensic officers to bring them here.

187
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,388
No, you don't have to do that.

188
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:57,788
Look.

189
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:00,788
The blocks of "o" character

190
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:04,088
would look like this if I were to unfold it.

191
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,288
U, e, o?

192
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:10,188
You all know what kind of character will be in the blank space, right?

193
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,888
Just in case, I checked the blocks over there.

194
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:16,188
As I expected,

195
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:21,388
the characters are lined up in the correct order.

196
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,288
Ms. Aiko, am I right?

197
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:27,088
Yes. Each block contains five characters with the same consonant

198
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:31,088
and an animal picture in the same order.

199
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:39,488
If you know which character is on which side, it is no longer a hustle.

200
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:41,888
The backside of "o" is "i".

201
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:46,388
Accordingly, "mo" is "mi" and "chi" is "to".

202
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:50,788
Right! So the real dying message is "i", "mi", "to"...

203
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,988
And what's the last one?

204
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,588
It doesn't make sense.

205
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:59,788
According to Kazuha, the last block "ya" is supposed to be "yu".

206
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,088
But I actually see "yo" on it.

207
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,588
That block is special.

208
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:08,388
Look. You see "wo" on the right side of "yo"?

209
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:14,388
That means this block consists of "ya", "yu", "yo", "wa", "wo" "n".

210
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:19,188
If we put those characters in the same order, the animal part will be "n".

211
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:20,788
That's it!

212
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,788
According to the same rule, "ya" is "wa".

213
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,688
So the dying message is

214
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,388
"i", "mi", "to", "wa", right?

215
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:33,088
-So that's... -Imiwato.

216
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,588
Iwamito...

217
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:37,088
-Iwato. -Iwato.

218
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,088
That's right.

219
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:41,088
That's what the president wanted to tell us before he was killed.

220
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,188
The vice-president, Mr. Iwatomi.

221
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:47,288
It was your name.

222
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:48,588
I see.

223
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:52,588
You wanted to kill your president and take over the company, didn't you?

224
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:54,188
No, I...

225
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:55,788
Kazuha, that was amazing!

226
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:58,088
You actually solve the case before Hattori.

227
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,588
We won this deduction battle!

228
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:01,988
So that means...

229
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:05,288
We can go to the Takarazuka show.

230
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:06,888
Sorry, Kazuha.

231
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,788
Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer.

232
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:13,488
I had a phone call from Chiba.

233
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,988
The 29th of last month around 5pm, when the murder occurred,

234
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,488
Mr. Iwatomi was in fact on TV.

235
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,488
-No way. -Why?

236
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:24,088
Don't ask me why.

237
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:25,888
You have a twin brother?

238
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,088
No, I don't.

239
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:34,088
Sorry to tell you this, but Kazuha's idea was wrong.

240
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,088
Oh, no.

241
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,988
No. She was right.

242
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,288
The four blocks are really the dying message

243
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:47,388
the president Tsujiya left before he was killed.

244
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,788
Heiji.

245
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:52,188
But Hattori, Mr. Iwatomi has an alibi.

246
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,288
Of course he has an alibi.

247
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:56,888
Because Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer at all.

248
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,588
What?

249
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:03,188
You just said that it was the real dying message, didn't you?

250
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:05,988
Yes. For sure, I did.

251
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,688
But I didn't say the message was correct, did I?

252
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:12,188
Hey, hey. What are you talking about?

253
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:13,688
Hey, don't you remember?

254
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,688
How did President Tsujiya leave a message on the blocks?

255
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,388
Try to remember that.

256
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:24,288
Well, I think he was tied down on the floor behind the desk.

257
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,388
He picked the building blocks

258
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:29,988
and put them in the puddle of ink on the floor, something like that.

259
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:30,988
You got that right.

260
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:34,888
The problem is the ink stain that's on the president's back.

261
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,488
What's wrong with it?

262
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:40,888
He got that ink stain when he was fighting the murderer, right?

263
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,888
That's what I thought at first.

264
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,888
But I noticed the unnaturalness on this desk.

265
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,488
Unnaturalness?

266
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,188
It's weird.

267
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:00,388
The chair just hit it lightly, but the pen stand fell.

268
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:04,488
Well, the ink bottle fell off the desk because people were fighting

269
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,288
and hitting the desk hard, right?

270
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,388
Right.

271
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:10,588
Then how come the pen stand did not fall during the fight?

272
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:12,388
That is certainly strange.

273
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,188
This just sounds like

274
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:18,588
the murderer spilled the ink on the floor on purpose.

275
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:22,288
No way. Why would he do that?

276
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,588
That's like he's giving the president

277
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,788
a chance to write something about him.

278
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:28,788
Maybe...

279
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,488
It was on purpose.

280
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:36,188
That's right. The murderer deliberately spilled the ink on the floor

281
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:39,088
to compel the president to leave a dying message about him.

282
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:43,088
But it's dangerous. The president could leave the murderer's name.

283
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:46,788
That's only if he saw the murderer's face.

284
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:50,788
Why don't you lie down on the floor like the president was?

285
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,588
What? Okay.

286
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:58,488
Maybe you'll get to experience how the president felt.

287
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,288
How he felt?

288
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,788
I got it! Shoes.

289
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:08,788
It's the shoes!

290
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,988
The murderer narrowed the victim's scope with this desk

291
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,888
and made him determine who he was only by looking at his shoes.

292
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:18,388
So, the murderer wore white shoes

293
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:22,688
to make him leave a fake dying message about the murderer.

294
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:28,388
That's why the video camera was set up in the victim's blind spot.

295
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:31,188
The murderer was watching the president on the monitor

296
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,588
to make sure that the president wrote the desired dying message.

297
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,188
And then, he killed the victim.

298
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,088
But who did it anyway?

299
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,488
Hey, look.

300
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:40,588
What?

301
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,988
I found this strange calendar in the president's room.

302
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:44,988
See?

303
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,888
I thought you might know what this is.

304
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:53,988
Well, it's got a little stain, but other than that...

305
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,788
Don't you get it?

306
00:17:56,788 --> 00:18:00,388
It's been wiped off, but it's a bloodstain.

307
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,188
Also, don't you think it's strange

308
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:07,888
that the president was murdered on June 29th,

309
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:11,188
but the June calendar at the murder scene was already ripped off?

310
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:16,288
In fact, there's a schedule written down on the 30th of the June calendar.

311
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:20,788
Who in the world would do that without any reason?

312
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,088
Hey...

313
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:27,588
The June calendar was ripped, because someone had to hide the bloodstain.

314
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:31,288
We got something that's got the same bloodstain on it.

315
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:34,388
The coat the murderer was wearing!

316
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,788
The bloodstain on the shoulder looked kind of rubbed.

317
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:41,088
That's why I made the four workers stand in front of the calendar.

318
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,688
Hey!

319
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,288
The only person who is tall enough

320
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,988
to touch the top of the calendar with his shoulders...

321
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:47,788
You moron.

322
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:49,388
It is you,

323
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:50,988
Mr. Hasami!

324
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,188
No one else could do it.

325
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:55,488
Good job.

326
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,788
When the president came back to the office,

327
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,688
you attacked him from behind with a golf club.

328
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,988
Wearing Mr. Iwatomi's white shoes and setting up the video camera,

329
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:10,288
you made sure that the president left behind the fake message.

330
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:14,588
You probably were relieved after killing the president,

331
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,488
and leaned against the wall.

332
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:21,388
That's when you got the bloodstain on the calendar.

333
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,188
You didn't notice it until the next day.

334
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:25,188
That's why you didn't dump it right away.

335
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:30,188
In fact, it's easy to steal the white shoes from Mr. Iwatomi's house.

336
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:33,888
People came and drunk at Mr. Iwatomi's house so often.

337
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,988
You had a lot of chance to steal them.

338
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,888
But the height of his shoulders is not enough evidence

339
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,188
to accuse him for the murder.

340
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,988
Actually, the evidence are those shoes.

341
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:47,188
You were wearing Mr. Iwatomi's shoes until the president left the message.

342
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,888
It's quite a long while.

343
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,488
The smell of your feet are definitely on them.

344
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,688
The police dog will sense your smell right away, right?

345
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:59,088
I guess you had a decent reason for wearing those shoes

346
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:02,488
until they smelled of your feet.

347
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:05,488
You can tell us about it if you want.

348
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:10,088
I wanted to kill the president by framing Mr. Iwatomi up for the murder.

349
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:13,488
I wanted him out of the toy production.

350
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:15,188
That's all.

351
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:16,788
Why me?

352
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:19,188
I don't think I ever mistreated you or anything.

353
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:21,688
It's not me that you mistreated.

354
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,088
It's the children.

355
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,088
The children who are going to be playing with the toy

356
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:29,188
that you and the president were trying to sell.

357
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,688
I don't get it.

358
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,888
Here, look at this building block.

359
00:20:33,888 --> 00:20:35,788
See how the corner have been smoothed off.

360
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:41,288
But to cut down the cost, they told us not to do it.

361
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,788
That includes not only the blocks but the other toys, too.

362
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:46,688
They certainly look more appealing and could be more profitable,

363
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:49,088
but are dangerous for children.

364
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,988
I disagreed with the idea, but we were going to be fired

365
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,888
if we did not follow their plan.

366
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,388
But you didn't have to kill him.

367
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,488
This company is having a hard time.

368
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,988
Hard time?

369
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:03,688
Guess what President Tsujiya said?

370
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,388
Iwatomi! You want money?

371
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:11,188
I got tons of it. I'm not lying, just look in the safe!

372
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,088
-What? -He had money?

373
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:17,388
Yes. I have no idea what and how he did it though.

374
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:18,388
But it doesn't matter.

375
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:23,688
I just didn't want to see the poorly-made toys and deceive kids.

376
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:58,688
You really got that trick. I'm impressed.

377
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:01,388
It's because of the novel.

378
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:07,688
The title of the novel my mom got me gave me the idea of that trick.

379
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:10,088
You better thank your mom.

380
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,888
You won this deduction battle because of it.

381
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:15,288
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

382
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:16,788
Congratulations, Heiji.

383
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,088
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

384
00:23:20,188 --> 00:23:23,288
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

385
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:25,788
Kazuha, wait.

386
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:31,288
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

387
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:34,188
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

388
00:23:34,188 --> 00:23:36,388
You are actually half the winner, right?

389
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:38,388
Forget it.

390
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:40,888
What I really wanted to see

391
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,388
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

392
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:50,188
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

393
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:55,488
Where did I go wrong?

394
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:58,288
You stupid.

395
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,388
"Next Episode"

396
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:02,888
It's the Koshien Stadium!

397
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:11,488
What's going on? Why not come here and get it?

398
00:24:11,488 --> 00:24:15,488
I guess that person doesn't care whether we catch him or not.

399
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,688
Right.

400
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:21,088
He said he's going to die if we can't find that thing before the game ends!

401
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:23,588
Maybe he's still around here.

402
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:29,488
Next Conan Special, "High School Ball Game, Invisible Summer Devil"

403
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,515
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,615
"Retired Number"

405
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,615
The next episode of Conan is a two hour special Christmas present!

406
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:38,315
We'll be at the Koshien Stadium. Of course, I'm the hero!

407
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,515
What? You are gonna be playing?
