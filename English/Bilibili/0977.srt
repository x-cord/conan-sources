00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,660
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,410
Damn you! You tricked us!

3

Kitamura Mitsuru (58)
Hardware Store Manager

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,390
What you did was swindle us!
Kitamura Mitsuru (58)
Hardware Store Manager

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,460
Give us back our money!
Kitamura Mitsuru (58)
Hardware Store Manager

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,540
Give us back our money!

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,920
Bando Atsuko (42)
Housewife
Give us back our money!

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,590
Swindle? Don't make such
disreputable accusations.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,010
Tsuchida Yoshihiro (48)
Investment Company President
Swindle? Don't make such
disreputable accusations.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,110
Swindle? Don't make such
disreputable accusations.

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,930
You entrusted our company with your precious
money after signing a contract with us.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,930
You're lying! You never
intended to return our money!

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,710
Invest in goldfish, huh?

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,210
I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,540
Step back. Step back, please.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:44,890
Nagase Ayako (28)
Office Worker

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,160
Please calm down, Kitamura-san.
Nagase Ayako (28)
Office Worker

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm sorry, everyone, but
please leave for the day.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,910
Kajiura Yuto (35)
Tsuchida's Secretary
I'm sorry, everyone, but
please leave for the day.

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm sorry, everyone, but
please leave for the day.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,730
We'll get in touch with you at a later date.

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,550
Nozomi. I'm almost finished
with work. Wait outside.

23
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,020
Makimura Nozomi (24)
Kajiura's Girlfriend
Nozomi. I'm almost finished
with work. Wait outside.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,100
Nozomi. I'm almost finished
with work. Wait outside.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,050
Okay.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,480
As you saw, those people come every day.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,790
Lately I've been fearing
for my personal safety.

28
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,990
I see. That's why you hired
me to be your bodyguard.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,990
President Tsuchida, do your
actions not violate the law?

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,400
The law?

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,960
It's their fault for being greedy
and handing over their money.

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
What do you think? I'll pay you generously.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,590
Let's go, kid!

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,420
Mori-san!

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,930
You've misjudged me!

36
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,060
Mori Kogoro isn't rotten enough
to sell his soul to the devil!

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,680
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,470
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,320
A crooked company president
is practically a conman!

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,300
Incurring someone's hatred leads to a case!

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,920
Always determining the one truth

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,620
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,000
his name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:02,877
The Broken Fishbowl

45
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:05,037
"The Broken Fishbowl"
The Broken Fishbowl

46
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,927
The Broken Fishbowl

47
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,367
Mister, that was cool of you.

48
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:18,857
"I'm not rotten enough to
sell my soul to the devil!"

49
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,357
I'm always cool.

50
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,357
Anyway, the bus sure is late.

51
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:31,587
The job sucked, and the bus isn't coming.

52
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,197
It's one misfortune after another.

53
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:36,747
Give me a break.

54
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:42,707
What was that?!

55
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:56,477
What's wrong?

56
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,897
Th-That...

57
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,647
It's no use. He's dead.

58
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,437
They used a statue wrapped in a towel.

59
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,407
Yeah.

60
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:20,257
They prevented the victim's
blood from getting on them.

61
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:23,957
This towel...

62
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,707
Hey.

63
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,087
Over there, too.

64
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,467
It's no use.

65
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:38,177
I don't believe it. Two of them...

66
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:40,597
Yuto-san!

67
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:44,137
No... Yuto-san...

68
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,497
Stay back.

69
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,137
No! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

70
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:49,357
You mustn't!
No! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

71
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:49,977
No! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

72
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,217
Hello? Yes.

73
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,337
Goldfish?

74
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,487
Yes, goldfish.

75
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:21,207
The victim President Tsuchida lied about
importing rare goldfish from abroad,

76
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,857
and gathered a large sum of money.

77
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,607
In other words, he was
running an investment scam.

78
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:31,167
Yes. The investors were furious.

79
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,617
I believe the culprit may
be one of his clients.

80
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,907
Got it, Mori-kun.

81
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,497
We'll follow that lead.

82
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,257
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,907
Hey, kid! Don't come in here.

84
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,667
Sorry.

85
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:47,767
Jeez.

86
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,417
Oh, Inspector.

87
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,657
This is his office worker Nagase Ayako-san.

88
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:55,177
You were the first one
to discovered the bodies.

89
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:56,227
Yes.

90
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:59,527
When I returned after buying the
items the president requested,

91
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,677
President Tsuchida was...

92
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,857
Then there's Makimura Nozomi-san.

93
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:08,187
She was the girlfriend of the
other victim Kajiura-san.

94
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,197
At the time of the murders, where were you?

95
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:15,207
Waiting outside for Yuto-san.

96
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:18,697
That's when I heard a scream.

97
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:23,077
Whoa!

98
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,757
Miss, use this.

99
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,087
Thank you.

100
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:29,417
Are you okay?

101
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:30,957
Yeah.

102
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,767
Why don't you rest in the other room?

103
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:39,097
It's all right. I'd like to
help with the investigation.

104
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:44,567
But even if the president Tsuchida-san
had incurred the hatred of his clients,

105
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,567
why kill Kajiura-san, too?

106
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,207
Let go!

107
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,107
I have nothing to do with this!

108
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:55,737
What's going on, Takagi-kun?

109
00:07:55,977 --> 00:08:00,737
They were in the building, so I had
them come as potential witnesses.

110
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,837
This is Kitamura Mitsuru-san, the
proprietor of Kitamura Hardware,

111
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:07,417
and housewife Bando Atsuko-san.

112
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,167
You!

113
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,917
Damn you! You tricked us!

114
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,967
What you did was swindle us!

115
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,427
Give us back our money!

116
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:18,687
Yes.

117
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,057
I heard they were related to President
Tsuchida's goldfish investment.

118
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:29,937
And 30 minutes earlier
when the murders occurred,

119
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:34,997
Kitamura-san was at a bicycle
parking lot near this building.

120
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:38,947
Yeah, I parked my scooter there.

121
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,377
When I tried to leave, I
found that my tire was flat.

122
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,947
I called a bike shop and
was waiting for them.

123
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,697
Can anyone verify that?

124
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:48,957
No!

125
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,457
Bando-san, how about you?

126
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,297
Me?

127
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,987
I...

128
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,037
In other words, neither of you have alibis,

129
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:02,967
but you have clear motives.

130
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,547
Motive? In that case, let me be clear!

131
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,737
Tsuchida took the entirety of
my store's working capital!

132
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:13,857
That trash deserved to be killed!

133
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:18,127
I had all my son's tuition
money taken from me!

134
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,487
It's only natural that he was killed!

135
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,717
But I swear I didn't do it!

136
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:26,157
Me neither! I have nothing to do with this!

137
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:31,917
In the first place, did anyone
see me at the crime scene?

138
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,667
Well?

139
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:39,127
See? I've got nothing to do with this!

140
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:44,887
But I was waiting for Yuto-san at
the convenience store parking lot

141
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,407
across from this building.

142
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:52,377
I think I saw someone through
the window while I was there.

143
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,397
You saw someone through the window?

144
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:58,367
Yes, someone heading towards
the president's office.

145
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:02,157
The president's office! That's where
President Tsuchida was murdered.

146
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,917
Was it a man or a woman?

147
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:07,167
It was too far to see that much.

148
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,667
Besides, it may have just been my mistake.

149
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,287
That's it!

150
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,167
What is it, Mori-kun?

151
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,777
Inspector, I've got it.

152
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:22,957
I know how the culprit entered the office

153
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:27,587
and why they had to kill Kajiura-san
after killing President Tsuchida.

154
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:33,377
First the culprit entered
through the front entrance.

155
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:37,567
They crossed the window
facing the convenience store

156
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,487
and headed towards the president's office.

157
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:44,297
We know that from Nozomi-san's testimony.

158
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,947
When the culprit entered the president's
office at the end of the hallway,

159
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:55,997
they bludgeoned the detestable President
Tsuchida with all their rage.

160
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:01,087
They tried to flee immediately.

161
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:04,087
But that's when another tragedy occurred.

162
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:12,097
Yes, they were discovered by Kajiura-san,

163
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:14,027
who entered from the main office.

164
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:18,477
The culprit rushed at Kajiura-san

165
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:23,307
and used their knife to kill the
fleeing Kajiura-san in this office.

166
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,127
Huh?

167
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:42,667
I see. Which means Kajiura-san was...

168
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:46,357
Killed because he happened
to see the culprit.

169
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,927
In other words, collateral damage.

170
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:52,937
Collateral damage? N-No...

171
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:15,924
Oh?

172
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,974
What's wrong, ma'am?

173
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,424
Isn't this boy sick?

174
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:24,054
This boy? You mean the goldfish?

175
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:29,124
Yes. This boy can't be put in
a tank with other goldfish.

176
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:34,064
I'm sorry. I put him in there
since his tank was broken.

177
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:38,064
Then there must have been
medicine in the broken tank.

178
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:39,594
Medicine?

179
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,444
That over there. A disinfectant.

180
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:44,944
Disinfectant?

181
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,204
Ma'am, you know a lot about goldfish.

182
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:51,704
I sure do. I've loved
them since I was a child.

183
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:56,364
Maybe that's why I fell
for this investment scam.

184
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,334
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

185
00:13:09,244 --> 00:13:10,594
Bando Atsuko-san,

186
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,604
your alibi has been verified.

187
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,604
What? My alibi?

188
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,724
Yes.

189
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:19,794
While gathering information,

190
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:23,614
we heard you were borrowing money at a
friend's house when the murders took place.

191
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,284
Yes.

192
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:29,614
The truth is, I was too
embarrassed to say anything.

193
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:35,454
Jeez. But now you're innocent, which means...

194
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,904
M-Me?

195
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:39,774
You said you'd kill him.

196
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:41,834
No! I didn't do it!

197
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,754
About that.

198
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,914
It was difficult to read beneath the blood,

199
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:50,724
but on the towel discovered
in the president's office...

200
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:55,554
Isn't this the name of the store you operate?

201
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:57,934
It's damning evidence.

202
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,894
You killed President Tsuchida?

203
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:03,694
No! I didn't kill Tsuchida!

204
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,604
We'll discuss this at the station.

205
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:06,194
What?

206
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,264
Could you come with us?

207
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,954
I don't know anything! I didn't do it!

208
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:11,914
It wasn't me!

209
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:14,154
Hey, Detective Takagi.

210
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,724
That towel was wet, wasn't it?

211
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,954
Do you know what the water was?

212
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,354
It was ordinary water.

213
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:24,814
But there was a type of
disinfectant mixed into it.

214
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,134
A disinfectant...

215
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,204
I didn't do it!

216
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,844
Yes, we understand. Now come this way...

217
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:49,534
Hold on, everyone.

218
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:54,784
There it is, Mori-san! Has your
deduction so far been incorrect?

219
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:59,794
What? No. There was just one
thing I wanted to confirm.

220
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:03,294
Confirm? What do you mean, Mori-kun?

221
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:09,784
Yes. Every crime has a motive,
an order, and a result.

222
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,434
Yes, if you approach this case normally,

223
00:15:14,944 --> 00:15:17,684
the culprit must've hated President Tsuchida.

224
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,314
It's the reason he was killed,

225
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:24,184
why Kajiura-san got caught up in it,

226
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:29,294
and why the culprit is Kitamura-san.

227
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:35,704
Considering the towel left at the crime
scene, that's a reasonable deduction.

228
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:36,634
Yes.

229
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:43,204
But what if the truth was the opposite
of every reasonable deduction?

230
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:44,334
The opposite?

231
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,584
What do you mean, Mori-kun?

232
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:53,434
First, the true culprit stole a towel
embroidered with the name of Kitamura-san's shop

233
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:58,114
and punctured his scooter's tire
so he wouldn't have an alibi.

234
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:03,854
After entering the company's office,
they first headed to the main office.

235
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:05,054
Main Office

236
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,634
They went to the main office first?
Main Office

237
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,234
Yes.
Main Office

238
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:08,534
Yes.

239
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,594
Once they were invited inside,

240
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:16,704
they killed Kajiura-san with a knife.

241
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:31,504
Next they headed to the president's office,
where they killed President Tsuchida.

242
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:41,814
Naturally, they left the stolen towel
in order to frame Kitamura-san.

243
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:45,684
After committing both murders,

244
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:49,564
they returned to the front
entrance and left the office.

245
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:55,284
Hold on, Mori-kun. Do you have any evidence?

246
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:59,534
Of course. First, there's the location
where Kajiura-san collapsed.

247
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:05,244
If Kajiura-san was attacked by and fled from
the culprit leaving the president's office,

248
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:09,044
he should have collapsed
in the opposite direction.

249
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:15,014
Then there's the towel discovered
in the president's office.

250
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,414
Detective Takagi.

251
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:17,514
Y-Yes?

252
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:22,764
When it was discovered, the towel was
wet not only with blood, but also water.

253
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,084
Have you determined its exact composition?

254
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:31,314
According to the forensic report, it
was water mixed with a disinfectant.

255
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,934
Could this be that disinfectant?

256
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:37,534
It's for fish.

257
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:43,784
Yes. In the main office was a small
tank in addition to the large one.

258
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,794
It was for a goldfish that had become sick.

259
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:54,294
Kajiura-san knocked one of them over, and
the water spilled on the culprit as well.

260
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:59,924
That's why disinfectant was
found on the culprit's towel.

261
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:04,354
If they had killed Kajiura-san
after killing President Tsuchida,

262
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:07,814
there would be no fish
tank water on the towel.

263
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:09,314
I see.

264
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:15,314
They probably brought with them the
knife they used to kill Kajiura-san,

265
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:19,984
but the sculpture they used to kill Tsuchida
was already in the president's office.

266
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:26,074
If they truly did intend
to kill President Tsuchida,

267
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,584
instead of leaving the knife
in Kajiura-san's body,

268
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:33,084
they would have used it to
kill the president as well.

269
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:35,194
Hold on, Mori-kun.

270
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,214
Doesn't that mean...

271
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,294
In other words,

272
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:43,974
the true culprit's intended target was
not President Tsuchida, but Kajiura-san.

273
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:45,724
Yuto-san?

274
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:49,244
And in order to hide their true intention,

275
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:54,734
the culprit murdered President
Tsuchida, who was hated by everyone.

276
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,004
But what about Nozomi-san's testimony?

277
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:04,724
Yes. I saw someone heading to the
president's office through the window.

278
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:08,994
What if that testimony were a calculated lie?

279
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:11,344
A calculated lie?

280
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:15,254
Yes, one meant to mislead us.

281
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:20,754
Makimura Nozomi-san, you're the true culprit!

282
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,984
What?

283
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,104
I killed Yuto-san?

284
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,704
No! That's not possible!

285
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:34,274
Conan told me. You don't
have a handkerchief, do you?

286
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:40,484
When you killed Kajiura-san, did you use it
to prevent his blood from getting on you?

287
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,124
Have you already disposed of it somewhere?

288
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:48,684
And the area around your
hips is stained, isn't it?

289
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:53,164
That stain is from that.

290
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:54,004
Conan!

291
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:55,504
Here.

292
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:57,024
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

293
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:59,924
It's from these letters. It happened then.
Invest in Goldfish For a Happy Life!

294
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:00,874
Yuto-san! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

295
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:01,954
Stay back.
Yuto-san! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

296
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,514
Yuto-san! Yuto-san! Yuto-san!

297
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:03,924
You mustn't!

298
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:07,734
Your body was wet with water then.

299
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:13,114
That's why the letters on this poster
bled and stained your clothes.

300
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:18,274
The true culprit was soaked
by the water in the fish tank.

301
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:22,574
If disinfectant were
discovered on her clothes...

302
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,824
That would put her at the crime scene.

303
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,734
Yes.

304
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:31,694
Nozomi-san, that is the definitive evidence
that proves you're the true culprit!

305
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:36,024
Get the forensics team.
Have them examine her clothes.

306
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,014
Could it be?

307
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:41,464
But why kill Kajiura-san?

308
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:47,354
I gave Kajiura-san everything.

309
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:52,164
Before he got a job, for years and years.

310
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:56,964
But once he began working
for President Tsuchida,

311
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,984
he started making a lot of money.

312
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:04,194
Then he said he didn't love me anymore.

313
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:09,544
On top of that, he told me to leave.

314
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:13,434
He hit me and kicked me.

315
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:22,004
So I took revenge so I wouldn't get caught.

316
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:28,764
That's enough!

317
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:33,514
That doesn't make it right to kill someone!

318
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:40,904
And killing a bystander in order to conceal
your guilt is absolutely atrocious!

319
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:18,284
Mister, that was cool of you.

320
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:22,294
I'm impressed you realized
the target was the other person.

321
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:26,224
That was a piece of cake for me.

322
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:30,804
Not that I remember it very well.

323
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:33,424
Anyway, the bus is late.

324
00:23:34,564 --> 00:23:34,704
To Beika City

325
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,154
Huh? To Beika City?
To Beika City

326
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:37,694
To Beika City

327
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:41,174
Are we at the wrong bus stop?

328
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:44,434
Oh, no! We're at the wrong one!

329
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:47,404
Mister, pull yourself together!

330
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:50,204
Wait!

331
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:53,344
Stop!
