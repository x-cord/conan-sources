1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,310
Dragged along by Ran, Sonoko and Sera

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,510
so they could buy new swimsuits to go to the pool,

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,510
I arrived at the department store.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,110
But, once I was there...

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,010
The victim is

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,610
"Ritsuko Sashihara (41)" -the president of a cosmetic company,

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,610
Ms. Ritsuko Sashihara.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,710
The index finger and thumb of the left hand of the corpse was erect.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,710
On the nail of her right hand,

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,310
her own red lipstick was painted on.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,910
But, why?

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,510
What on earth was it for?

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,810
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,210
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,210
The shape of the fingers and red lipstick.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,410
The mysterious case and Sera's secret.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,510
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,867
so I took her over to the fitting room.

21
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,767
Did you see the white sandals in question back then?

22
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,367
I think it was already in front of the fitting room to the very right.

23
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:30,167
And, the next was Ms. Sashihara.

24
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,367
She went into the fitting in the middle that was vacant.

25
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,867
I see.

26
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,667
So Ms. Nitsuka went in last?

27
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,767
Yes.

28
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:43,467
She went in a while after Ms. Sashihara entered.

29
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,767
She was quite annoyed

30
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,367
because the fitting room wouldn't empty out for a while.

31
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,367
According to Conan,

32
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:51,867
it seems Ms. Sashihara said something upsetting to you?

33
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,367
Yes.

34
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,367
But, my superior told me,

35
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,867
"I was repeatedly told obnoxious remarks too."

36
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:01,067
So to not be bothered about it.

37
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,267
Hey, the president who died said that

38
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:09,767
she met the salesclerk for the first time today.

39
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,067
I don't recognize you. Are you new here?

40
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,167
But, isn't it a fact that you saw her a week ago?

41
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,267
Yes.

42
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,067
When Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room,

43
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,867
she came here together with Ms. Yamaki.

44
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:26,967
Are the black pumps you're wearing and those white sneakers

45
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,067
the only shoes you have?

46
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,167
Yes.

47
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,867
I leave my pumps in the locker here.

48
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,967
And when I commute to work I wear these sneakers.

49
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,567
Are you sure you only use those two pairs of shoes?

50
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,067
If you think I'm lying,

51
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,267
I don't mind if you search the entire store.

52
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,967
Then, Ms. Nanbu,

53
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,067
will you please draw a picture of the white sandals

54
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,067
that you said you saw over here?

55
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,867
A simple drawing would do, so please draw it.

56
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,867
Okay.

57
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:54,867
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Yes.

58
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,867
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Like the salesclerk said,

59
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,267
I think the white sandals were there

60
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:03,067
before I entered the fitting room.

61
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,767
After that, President Sashihara went inside the fitting room

62
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,967
next to the one you were in.

63
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,867
Did you hear any strange sounds or something?

64
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,667
No, nothing in particular.

65
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,367
Isn't it a fact that you went into the fitting room

66
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,467
saying something like "May I help you take off your clothes?"

67
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,667
Why should I do something like that!

68
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,667
I'm not her servant!

69
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,767
But, she said she paid back your debts for you

70
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:29,767
and got you a job in her company and so forth, right?

71
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:34,667
Yes. It's true that I owed her a lot but...

72
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,867
You saw the president's clothes, didn't you?

73
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,767
They weren't clothes that she needed help in removing, were they?

74
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,167
You're right.

75
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,367
By the way,

76
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,767
the box that's inside your bag,

77
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,767
is it a gift for someone?

78
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,767
Yes. It's for the president of this shop.

79
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,567
It's a new item that our company has marketed

80
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,267
and I was told by President Sashihara to give it to a salesclerk here

81
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,467
to hand it over to the president.

82
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:01,167
If you want to, you can open it and confirm for yourself.

83
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,567
It's just perfume.

84
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:06,367
Yes, if it's all right with you, we'll do so later.

85
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,667
And please draw a picture of the white sandals

86
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,567
that we talked about before.

87
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,067
Just a simple drawing will do.

88
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,067
All right.

89
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,267
"Tomoyo Nitsuka (43)" -Yes, that's right!

90
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,867
A week ago, I fainted in the fitting room here!

91
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,567
Because of the dog hair that the person called Sashihara

92
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,367
scattered all over the place.

93
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,667
I see, you're allergic to dogs.

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,567
According to forensics,

95
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,967
there were quite a lot of dog hair on the floor of the crime scene.

96
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,167
I see.

97
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:39,067
And? Do you know when the owner of the white sandals in question

98
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,767
came out of the fitting room?

99
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,467
Between 2:43 pm to 2:44 pm.

100
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,967
Because I went to check every minute

101
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:51,167
to see if the fitting room to the very right was empty!

102
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,467
Why did it have to be the room on the very right?

103
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:57,967
Because the middle room was the room full of dog hair of that President.

104
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,767
Her worker was in the room to the left, right?

105
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,767
Her worker may also have dog hair on her too, right?

106
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,767
Which means you knew that the victim went into the fitting room

107
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,267
in the middle?

108
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,567
Yes. I guess.

109
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,067
What is that light brown case looking thing?

110
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,667
Oh, this?

111
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,667
This is a portable folding slipper!

112
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:22,067
Because I was scheduled to go to China after this.

113
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:28,267
Didn't you rig those slippers to make them look like white sandals?

114
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,367
What?

115
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,967
Take a good look! These are beige!

116
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:35,367
I saw white sandals that were of a totally different shape too!

117
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,367
Hey, you!

118
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,967
Lend me a paper and pen!

119
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,267
I'll draw you what it looked like!

120
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,367
All three drew similar pictures.

121
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:50,567
It seems that there actually was a customer who wore white sandals.

122
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,367
Inspector Megure.

123
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:56,167
Forensics say they found a scissors, remnants of cellophane tape,

124
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,467
a straw and its cut pieces in the trash can

125
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,767
near the fitting room.

126
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,267
Does it have anything to do with the case?

127
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,067
Hold on...

128
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,467
You still haven't figured out who the perp is?

129
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:12,367
No. The perp is probably...

130
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,267
That person!

131
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,967
No way! You've already figured it out?

132
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:17,967
Yeah.

133
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:22,667
But we don't know how the perp went into the fitting room

134
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,167
without her causing a commotion yet.

135
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,967
That's probably because the victim was wearing a face cover!

136
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:31,767
You know, the disposal masks to cover your face

137
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,467
to avoid makeup getting on the merchandise!

138
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:36,667
You can't see well when you're wearing those.

139
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,867
But, it's not that you can't see at all,

140
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:41,367
so if someone comes in, you can tell, you know?

141
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:46,067
Are they left in the fitting room?

142
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,667
Well, some shops hand them out before you enter the fitting room.

143
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,167
But there are quite a few shops that have them in the fitting room too.

144
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,367
They're inside what looks to be a big tissue box.

145
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,467
I see.

146
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:01,067
So, that's what happened.

147
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,067
This wasn't the first.

148
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,267
But the second attempt at murder!

149
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,867
Inspector Megure!

150
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,467
We checked the security cameras in the shop,

151
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,867
but many of the customers' feet weren't in view.

152
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:26,167
We weren't able to confirm whether anyone was wearing the white sandals

153
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,867
that the three women said they saw in front of the fitting room

154
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,467
to the very right at the time of the murder.

155
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:35,767
If so, the perp could be the one who was wearing the white sandals

156
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:37,867
and have already fled.

157
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,267
Or it could be the one who first found the body,

158
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,667
the salesclerk of this shop, Ms. Reia Nanbu.

159
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:48,667
Or the one who was using the fitting room on the very left

160
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,267
even before the victim who went into the fitting room in the middle,

161
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:55,067
Ms. Ayami Yamaki, who is also an employee of the victim.

162
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:59,267
Or after the customer who wore the white sandals left the fitting room,

163
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,267
the one who used that fitting room on the very right,

164
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,967
the woman allergic to dogs, Ms. Tomoyo Nitsuka.

165
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:11,567
The thing is how did the perp make it into the fitting room?

166
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,898
Yeah. If someone came into the fitting room,

167
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,934
Yeah, the perp tried to commit this crime a week ago,

168
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,234
but back then as you said,

169
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,634
before the victim entered the room,

170
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,934
Ms. Nitsuka entered the room, so the plan failed.

171
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:28,134
In other words, this was the second time she committed the crime!

172
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:32,334
Are you saying that Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room a week ago,

173
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,034
not of dog allergy,

174
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,634
but because she sniffed chloroform.

175
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:40,434
But how did the perp leave the middle room open?

176
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:43,934
Although the perp were to enter one out of the three rooms,

177
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,634
how would the other room be blocked off?

178
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:51,634
The perp put the white sandals in front of the other fitting room.

179
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,734
Yes, the only person who could've done this

180
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,634
is the one who was in the fitting room to the left

181
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:59,334
before the victim entered the fitting room in the middle.

182
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,334
Ms. Ayami Yamaki!

183
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,934
It was you!

184
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,534
Hey, hold it!

185
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:12,834
I didn't have any white sandals on me, did I?

186
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,134
Besides, the white sandals were there

187
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:17,334
before I went into the fitting room!

188
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:18,934
Isn't that right, salesclerk?

189
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,734
Yes.

190
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,734
Conan!

191
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,134
I bought it!

192
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:27,334
Insoles, cellophane tape and a white ribbon!

193
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,634
Thank you!

194
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:31,934
But what would anyone use something like this for?

195
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:36,234
We're going to make the other customer!

196
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,934
The other...

197
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,334
Customer?

198
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,134
First of all,

199
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:47,534
place the white ribbon

200
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,734
against the heel of the insole.

201
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,834
Then cross both edges of the ribbon under the insole

202
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,834
and tape it in place.

203
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:59,334
Then cross the ribbons loosely over the top.

204
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:03,134
After that, wrap both ends again around the back and tape in place.

205
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,534
There! The white sandal is completed!

206
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:09,934
-Amazing. -You're pretty good, kid.

207
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,434
I'm good at arts and crafts.

208
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,334
And you make two of these...

209
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:19,334
Then, you place it in front of the fitting room.

210
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:22,334
To make it look as if a customer is inside, see?

211
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:26,734
But wouldn't it be obvious because they have no heels and are flat?

212
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:32,734
But if you raise the heels by placing a cell phone under them...

213
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,734
See? They look like sandals from above!

214
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,434
Fantastic!

215
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,734
You had one, didn't you?

216
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:42,834
A gift that was wrapped with a white ribbon.

217
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:48,634
If you made the white sandals beforehand and kept them in your bag,

218
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,534
all that would be left after the murder

219
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:54,434
would be the tape you used to make the sandals.

220
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,834
You could wrap the ribbons around the gift

221
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:00,934
and put the insole inside the shoe that you're wearing and hide it!

222
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,234
I see.

223
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,234
The bits of tape we found with the straw and scissors

224
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,334
were from the trash can that was made

225
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,834
when she removed the ribbon from the insole.

226
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,634
Since the tape is hard to peel off unless with your bare hands,

227
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,734
fingerprints should be left behind.

228
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:18,434
In other words, you committed the crime in this order.

229
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:22,534
First, after confirming that three of the fitting rooms were empty,

230
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:26,534
you placed the white sandals in front of the fitting room to the right

231
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:31,234
then told the salesclerk that you forgot where the fitting room was

232
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,934
and had her take you there and made her see the white sandals

233
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:35,834
in front of the fitting room to the very right.

234
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,334
Then after the salesclerk went back to her post,

235
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,934
you went into the fitting room in the middle,

236
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,934
and soaked the chloroform that you had in the straw

237
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:46,134
onto the face cover and put it back in the box.

238
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:48,434
Then if you go into the fitting room to the left,

239
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,134
you're all set to go!

240
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,834
You looked out the curtain

241
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,634
and waited for the victim to come to the fitting room.

242
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,634
Then you listened for the sound of the victim to fall on the floor

243
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,934
after inhaling the chloroform on the face cover.

244
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,234
And after confirming that nobody was around

245
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,834
you entered the middle fitting room where the victim was.

246
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,634
Then you wrapped the rope that you brought around the victim's neck

247
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,934
and strangled her to death!

248
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:18,134
You waited for Ms. Nitsuka, who had been watching the fitting room,

249
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:21,034
to go back to the floor,

250
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:23,634
stretched your hand out from the space between the curtain

251
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:27,134
and retrieved the white sandals and the cell phone.

252
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:31,234
After confirming Ms. Nitsuka going into the fitting room to the right,

253
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:34,234
you went back into the fitting room to the left.

254
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,734
Then you removed the ribbon from the white sandals

255
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,534
and wrapped it onto the gift box.

256
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:42,334
You put the insole that remained into your own shoe.

257
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,434
You actually wanted to leave the fitting

258
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,634
and get away from the crime scene

259
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:49,634
but the salesclerk found the victim's body

260
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,534
before you could do so, right?

261
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:57,434
So what was the shape that the victim made with both her hands?

262
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,434
Oh. She put lipstick on the thumb of her right hand

263
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,334
and made a fist...

264
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,634
To make a flag!

265
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:04,734
Flag?

266
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,534
Yep! The flag of China!

267
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:12,634
The victim originally had manicure with five stars on them.

268
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,334
She colored the area around the stars red with her lipstick

269
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,534
to make it look like the flag of China, maybe?

270
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:21,734
But, why China?

271
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:26,134
The way they use their fingers to count in China is a bit odd.

272
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:28,734
They count from one to ten with just one hand.

273
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,334
One hand?

274
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:33,834
From one to five, it's counted the same way as in Japan.

275
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,834
But six is this, and seven is this.

276
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,734
And eight is this!

277
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,834
Hey. That's...

278
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:46,634
Oh, I see! So this would make...

279
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,134
The eight as is Ms. Yamaki's name in kanji character!

280
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,834
I see. Since the victim traveled worldwide,

281
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:59,634
she also knew how they counted in China.

282
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:02,134
Well, if there were a lot of dog hair

283
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,734
on the floor of the site of the crime,

284
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:07,034
if you check the soles of Ms. Yamaki's feet,

285
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:09,434
there should be a few of them stuck on.

286
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:12,134
The hair of the dog that the victim owned.

287
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:21,034
You don't have to check because I have dog hair on me.

288
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:25,334
I seem to have been the president's pet, you see.

289
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,834
Pet?

290
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,334
A few months ago,

291
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:31,634
I came here to buy clothes with the president.

292
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:35,334
The president and I coincidentally happened to try on the same clothes.

293
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,634
Oh, my?

294
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:40,234
Are you thinking of wearing that to the next party?

295
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:45,834
Yes. But if you're going to wear it, I'll wear something else.

296
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,934
Oh, no problem!

297
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,734
I'm not going to wear it.

298
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:51,634
You go ahead and wear it.

299
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:53,634
Thank you!

300
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,034
She's a good president.

301
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,534
True.

302
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:01,334
The president didn't wear that outfit

303
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:07,534
but she had it remade into an outfit for her dog.

304
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:09,534
Oh, no. Ms. Yamaki.

305
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:12,034
You're wearing the same clothes as my dog.

306
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,734
That choker looks like a collar too.

307
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,734
Would you like me to get a leash for you?

308
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:26,334
You're going to be my pet to eternity.

309
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,634
I thought about going to some other companies too

310
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:37,134
but since I had debts that I owed the president I couldn't.

311
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,734
That's why I killed her, before she killed me.

312
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:44,334
So she couldn't own me till I died.

313
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:15,334
Case closed.

314
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:19,434
A case like that is duck soup with Conan and me around!

315
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:20,734
Right, Conan?

316
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:24,934
All I did was make sandals using ribbons.

317
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,334
Just as would be expected of The High School Girls' Detective Squad!

318
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,734
You're a high school detective too, aren't you, Sonoko?

319
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:32,034
You call yourself the Deduction Queen after all.

320
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:36,534
Well, the thing is, I don't get inspirations at all recently.

321
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:40,534
I used to feel a tingling feeling by my neck before

322
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:44,434
but I haven't fired the tranquilizer gun at Sonoko for a while now.

323
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:49,934
But, I didn't know that Germany and France counted like this.

324
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,434
Oh, Shinichi used to do that a lot too!

325
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:56,634
He said it's because his mother had a habit of counting that way.

326
00:21:56,634 --> 00:22:01,434
Yeah. That's right, because Mom used to favor fashionable French people.

327
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,834
Hey, kid!

328
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,334
Is the number three shaped like this in Europe?

329
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:11,234
No. I saw on TV that even in Europe, there are exceptions.

330
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,434
Britain counts the same way as Japan

331
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:15,934
and to gesture the number three,

332
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:21,134
they erect the index finger, middle and ring finger in that order!

333
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,834
I though so! Right!

334
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:29,734
Come to think of it,

335
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:32,834
back during the case of "Red Woman", Sera...

336
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:35,734
It sure is a thin bat, though.

337
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,134
Can you hit balls with that?

338
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,934
She was saying something like that but...

339
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:42,634
Maybe she was referring to cricket,

340
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:45,234
a sport popular in Britain.

341
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,634
Because the bats of cricket

342
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,434
unlike baseball bats are flat and thick.

343
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,434
Besides, when eating,

344
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,934
in American table manners, after cutting the food with the knife,

345
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,434
the fork is re-held in the right hand!

346
00:22:56,434 --> 00:23:01,334
In Japan and Britain, the fork is not re-held in the right hand.

347
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:02,834
Wait a second.

348
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,634
Sera also said...

349
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:11,434
I can also tell that Conan is pretty good at playing football too.

350
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:15,734
In America, they don't call soccer as "football".

351
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,134
Which means there's no mistake about it!

352
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:22,634
Sera studied abroad, not in America, but in Britain.

353
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,334
But, why is Sera hiding the fact that she went to Britain?

354
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:31,034
Hold on...

355
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,134
Britain...

356
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:37,534
Britain...

357
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:42,634
Britain...

358
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:46,734
I see!

359
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:51,334
I remember it now!

360
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,334
"Next Episode"

361
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,134
Thanks for coming.

362
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:00,734
I was waiting for you.

363
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:04,734
Hey, didn't you just see something yellow?

364
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,934
I saw it! But it disappeared right away.

365
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:11,534
The master said that a ghost appears.

366
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,334
So, that's the story.

367
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:24,234
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad and the Haunted House"

368
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,277
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:29,277
"Greenhouse"

370
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:31,277
-Did you recall anything? -Yep, a beach.

371
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:32,577
When and where was it?

372
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:34,077
It's a secret.
