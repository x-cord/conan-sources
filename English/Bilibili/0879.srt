1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,310
Dragged along by Ran, Sonoko and Sera

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,510
so they could buy new swimsuits to go to the pool,

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,510
I arrived at the department store.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,110
But, once I was there...

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,010
The victim is

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,610
"Ritsuko Sashihara (41)" -the president of a cosmetic company,

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,610
Ms. Ritsuko Sashihara.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,710
The index finger and thumb of the left hand of the corpse was erect.

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,710
On the nail of her right hand,

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,310
her own red lipstick was painted on.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,910
But, why?

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,510
What on earth was it for?

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,810
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,210
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,210
The shape of the fingers and red lipstick.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,410
The mysterious case and Sera's secret.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,010
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,510
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:46,145
so I took her over to the fitting room.

21
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:49,023
Did you see the white sandals in question back then?

22
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:52,610
I think it was already in front of the fitting room to the very right.

23
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:57,448
And, the next was Ms. Sashihara.

24
00:02:57,448 --> 00:03:00,618
She went into the fitting in the middle that was vacant.

25
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,120
I see.

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,914
So Ms. Nitsuka went in last?

27
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,040
Yes.

28
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,711
She went in a while after Ms. Sashihara entered.

29
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:12,046
She was quite annoyed

30
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,631
because the fitting room wouldn't empty out for a while.

31
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,633
According to Conan,

32
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:19,137
it seems Ms. Sashihara said something upsetting to you?

33
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,638
Yes.

34
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,641
But, my superior told me,

35
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:25,143
"I was repeatedly told obnoxious remarks too."

36
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:28,312
So to not be bothered about it.

37
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,525
Hey, the president who died said that

38
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:37,029
she met the salesclerk for the first time today.

39
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:40,324
I don't recognize you. Are you new here?

40
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,411
But, isn't it a fact that you saw her a week ago?

41
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,537
Yes.

42
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:47,331
When Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room,

43
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:50,126
she came here together with Ms. Yamaki.

44
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:54,213
Are the black pumps you're wearing and those white sneakers

45
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,340
the only shoes you have?

46
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,425
Yes.

47
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:00,136
I leave my pumps in the locker here.

48
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:03,222
And when I commute to work I wear these sneakers.

49
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,808
Are you sure you only use those two pairs of shoes?

50
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,310
If you think I'm lying,

51
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,521
I don't mind if you search the entire store.

52
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:12,231
Then, Ms. Nanbu,

53
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,317
will you please draw a picture of the white sandals

54
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,319
that you said you saw over here?

55
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,113
A simple drawing would do, so please draw it.

56
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:21,115
Okay.

57
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,116
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Yes.

58
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:24,118
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Like the salesclerk said,

59
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:26,537
I think the white sandals were there

60
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:30,333
before I entered the fitting room.

61
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,044
After that, President Sashihara went inside the fitting room

62
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,213
next to the one you were in.

63
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:38,132
Did you hear any strange sounds or something?

64
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:39,926
No, nothing in particular.

65
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:43,638
Isn't it a fact that you went into the fitting room

66
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:45,723
saying something like "May I help you take off your clothes?"

67
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:47,934
Why should I do something like that!

68
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,936
I'm not her servant!

69
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:53,022
But, she said she paid back your debts for you

70
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:57,026
and got you a job in her company and so forth, right?

71
00:04:57,026 --> 00:05:01,948
Yes. It's true that I owed her a lot but...

72
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:04,116
You saw the president's clothes, didn't you?

73
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:08,037
They weren't clothes that she needed help in removing, were they?

74
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,413
You're right.

75
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:10,623
By the way,

76
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:13,042
the box that's inside your bag,

77
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,044
is it a gift for someone?

78
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:18,047
Yes. It's for the president of this shop.

79
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:20,841
It's a new item that our company has marketed

80
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:23,511
and I was told by President Sashihara to give it to a salesclerk here

81
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,721
to hand it over to the president.

82
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,432
If you want to, you can open it and confirm for yourself.

83
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,810
It's just perfume.

84
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,646
Yes, if it's all right with you, we'll do so later.

85
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:35,940
And please draw a picture of the white sandals

86
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,817
that we talked about before.

87
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:40,319
Just a simple drawing will do.

88
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,321
All right.

89
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,531
"Tomoyo Nitsuka (43)" -Yes, that's right!

90
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:47,118
A week ago, I fainted in the fitting room here!

91
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,829
Because of the dog hair that the person called Sashihara

92
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:51,622
scattered all over the place.

93
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:54,917
I see, you're allergic to dogs.

94
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,836
According to forensics,

95
00:05:56,836 --> 00:06:01,215
there were quite a lot of dog hair on the floor of the crime scene.

96
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,425
I see.

97
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,345
And? Do you know when the owner of the white sandals in question

98
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:09,015
came out of the fitting room?

99
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:12,727
Between 2:43 pm to 2:44 pm.

100
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:15,229
Because I went to check every minute

101
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,441
to see if the fitting room to the very right was empty!

102
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,736
Why did it have to be the room on the very right?

103
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:25,239
Because the middle room was the room full of dog hair of that President.

104
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,033
Her worker was in the room to the left, right?

105
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,036
Her worker may also have dog hair on her too, right?

106
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,039
Which means you knew that the victim went into the fitting room

107
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,540
in the middle?

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,834
Yes. I guess.

109
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:41,339
What is that light brown case looking thing?

110
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,923
Oh, this?

111
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,926
This is a portable folding slipper!

112
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:49,347
Because I was scheduled to go to China after this.

113
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:55,519
Didn't you rig those slippers to make them look like white sandals?

114
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,646
What?

115
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:59,231
Take a good look! These are beige!

116
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:02,610
I saw white sandals that were of a totally different shape too!

117
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,611
Hey, you!

118
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,237
Lend me a paper and pen!

119
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,531
I'll draw you what it looked like!

120
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:13,621
All three drew similar pictures.

121
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:17,833
It seems that there actually was a customer who wore white sandals.

122
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,627
Inspector Megure.

123
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:23,422
Forensics say they found a scissors, remnants of cellophane tape,

124
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,716
a straw and its cut pieces in the trash can

125
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:29,011
near the fitting room.

126
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:31,514
Does it have anything to do with the case?

127
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,308
Hold on...

128
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:36,727
You still haven't figured out who the perp is?

129
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:39,647
No. The perp is probably...

130
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,524
That person!

131
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:44,235
No way! You've already figured it out?

132
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:45,236
Yeah.

133
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:49,949
But we don't know how the perp went into the fitting room

134
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,409
without her causing a commotion yet.

135
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,246
That's probably because the victim was wearing a face cover!

136
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:59,041
You know, the disposal masks to cover your face

137
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,710
to avoid makeup getting on the merchandise!

138
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,921
You can't see well when you're wearing those.

139
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,132
But, it's not that you can't see at all,

140
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,634
so if someone comes in, you can tell, you know?

141
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:13,347
Are they left in the fitting room?

142
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:17,935
Well, some shops hand them out before you enter the fitting room.

143
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:21,439
But there are quite a few shops that have them in the fitting room too.

144
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,649
They're inside what looks to be a big tissue box.

145
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,736
I see.

146
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,320
So, that's what happened.

147
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,325
This wasn't the first.

148
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:36,537
But the second attempt at murder!

149
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:47,673
Inspector Megure!

150
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:51,302
We checked the security cameras in the shop,

151
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,679
but many of the customers' feet weren't in view.

152
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,974
We weren't able to confirm whether anyone was wearing the white sandals

153
00:08:56,974 --> 00:09:00,686
that the three women said they saw in front of the fitting room

154
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:03,272
to the very right at the time of the murder.

155
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:06,567
If so, the perp could be the one who was wearing the white sandals

156
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,694
and have already fled.

157
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,071
Or it could be the one who first found the body,

158
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,492
the salesclerk of this shop, Ms. Reia Nanbu.

159
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:19,492
Or the one who was using the fitting room on the very left

160
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,078
even before the victim who went into the fitting room in the middle,

161
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:25,874
Ms. Ayami Yamaki, who is also an employee of the victim.

162
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:30,086
Or after the customer who wore the white sandals left the fitting room,

163
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,088
the one who used that fitting room on the very right,

164
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:36,759
the woman allergic to dogs, Ms. Tomoyo Nitsuka.

165
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,390
The thing is how did the perp make it into the fitting room?

166
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,725
Yeah. If someone came into the fitting room,

167
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:48,730
Yeah, the perp tried to commit this crime a week ago,

168
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,024
but back then as you said,

169
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,442
before the victim entered the room,

170
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,737
Ms. Nitsuka entered the room, so the plan failed.

171
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:58,948
In other words, this was the second time she committed the crime!

172
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:03,119
Are you saying that Ms. Nitsuka fainted in the fitting room a week ago,

173
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,829
not of dog allergy,

174
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,457
but because she sniffed chloroform.

175
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:11,252
But how did the perp leave the middle room open?

176
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:14,756
Although the perp were to enter one out of the three rooms,

177
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:17,425
how would the other room be blocked off?

178
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:22,430
The perp put the white sandals in front of the other fitting room.

179
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,557
Yes, the only person who could've done this

180
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,435
is the one who was in the fitting room to the left

181
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:30,146
before the victim entered the fitting room in the middle.

182
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:33,149
Ms. Ayami Yamaki!

183
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,734
It was you!

184
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:40,323
Hey, hold it!

185
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:43,660
I didn't have any white sandals on me, did I?

186
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,954
Besides, the white sandals were there

187
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:48,122
before I went into the fitting room!

188
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:49,749
Isn't that right, salesclerk?

189
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,543
Yes.

190
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,545
Conan!

191
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,921
I bought it!

192
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,132
Insoles, cellophane tape and a white ribbon!

193
00:10:58,132 --> 00:10:59,425
Thank you!

194
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,720
But what would anyone use something like this for?

195
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,058
We're going to make the other customer!

196
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,726
The other...

197
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,144
Customer?

198
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:14,941
First of all,

199
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,319
place the white ribbon

200
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,530
against the heel of the insole.

201
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,658
Then cross both edges of the ribbon under the insole

202
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:25,618
and tape it in place.

203
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:30,123
Then cross the ribbons loosely over the top.

204
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,918
After that, wrap both ends again around the back and tape in place.

205
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:37,338
There! The white sandal is completed!

206
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,758
-Amazing. -You're pretty good, kid.

207
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:43,219
I'm good at arts and crafts.

208
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,140
And you make two of these...

209
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,143
Then, you place it in front of the fitting room.

210
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,146
To make it look as if a customer is inside, see?

211
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:57,525
But wouldn't it be obvious because they have no heels and are flat?

212
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:03,531
But if you raise the heels by placing a cell phone under them...

213
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:06,534
See? They look like sandals from above!

214
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:08,244
Fantastic!

215
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,538
You had one, didn't you?

216
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:13,625
A gift that was wrapped with a white ribbon.

217
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:19,422
If you made the white sandals beforehand and kept them in your bag,

218
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:21,341
all that would be left after the murder

219
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,219
would be the tape you used to make the sandals.

220
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,639
You could wrap the ribbons around the gift

221
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,726
and put the insole inside the shoe that you're wearing and hide it!

222
00:12:31,726 --> 00:12:33,019
I see.

223
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,023
The bits of tape we found with the straw and scissors

224
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,150
were from the trash can that was made

225
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,652
when she removed the ribbon from the insole.

226
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:43,446
Since the tape is hard to peel off unless with your bare hands,

227
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,531
fingerprints should be left behind.

228
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,243
In other words, you committed the crime in this order.

229
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:53,331
First, after confirming that three of the fitting rooms were empty,

230
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:57,335
you placed the white sandals in front of the fitting room to the right

231
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:02,048
then told the salesclerk that you forgot where the fitting room was

232
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,758
and had her take you there and made her see the white sandals

233
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,636
in front of the fitting room to the very right.

234
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,138
Then after the salesclerk went back to her post,

235
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,724
you went into the fitting room in the middle,

236
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,726
and soaked the chloroform that you had in the straw

237
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,938
onto the face cover and put it back in the box.

238
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:19,232
Then if you go into the fitting room to the left,

239
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,942
you're all set to go!

240
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,652
You looked out the curtain

241
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,446
and waited for the victim to come to the fitting room.

242
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,449
Then you listened for the sound of the victim to fall on the floor

243
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,743
after inhaling the chloroform on the face cover.

244
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:35,039
And after confirming that nobody was around

245
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,626
you entered the middle fitting room where the victim was.

246
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:42,422
Then you wrapped the rope that you brought around the victim's neck

247
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,757
and strangled her to death!

248
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,928
You waited for Ms. Nitsuka, who had been watching the fitting room,

249
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,848
to go back to the floor,

250
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,434
stretched your hand out from the space between the curtain

251
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,937
and retrieved the white sandals and the cell phone.

252
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,024
After confirming Ms. Nitsuka going into the fitting room to the right,

253
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,027
you went back into the fitting room to the left.

254
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:07,530
Then you removed the ribbon from the white sandals

255
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,323
and wrapped it onto the gift box.

256
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:13,119
You put the insole that remained into your own shoe.

257
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,246
You actually wanted to leave the fitting

258
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,457
and get away from the crime scene

259
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,460
but the salesclerk found the victim's body

260
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,336
before you could do so, right?

261
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:28,259
So what was the shape that the victim made with both her hands?

262
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,220
Oh. She put lipstick on the thumb of her right hand

263
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,139
and made a fist...

264
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,432
To make a flag!

265
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,558
Flag?

266
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,352
Yep! The flag of China!

267
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:43,441
The victim originally had manicure with five stars on them.

268
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:46,152
She colored the area around the stars red with her lipstick

269
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,322
to make it look like the flag of China, maybe?

270
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,533
But, why China?

271
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:56,954
The way they use their fingers to count in China is a bit odd.

272
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,540
They count from one to ten with just one hand.

273
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,125
One hand?

274
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,629
From one to five, it's counted the same way as in Japan.

275
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,632
But six is this, and seven is this.

276
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:10,551
And eight is this!

277
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,638
Hey. That's...

278
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:17,433
Oh, I see! So this would make...

279
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,936
The eight as is Ms. Yamaki's name in kanji character!

280
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:26,651
I see. Since the victim traveled worldwide,

281
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:30,446
she also knew how they counted in China.

282
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,949
Well, if there were a lot of dog hair

283
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,535
on the floor of the site of the crime,

284
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,829
if you check the soles of Ms. Yamaki's feet,

285
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,248
there should be a few of them stuck on.

286
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:42,959
The hair of the dog that the victim owned.

287
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:51,843
You don't have to check because I have dog hair on me.

288
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:56,138
I seem to have been the president's pet, you see.

289
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,640
Pet?

290
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,141
A few months ago,

291
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:02,436
I came here to buy clothes with the president.

292
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:06,148
The president and I coincidentally happened to try on the same clothes.

293
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,441
Oh, my?

294
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:11,028
Are you thinking of wearing that to the next party?

295
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:16,659
Yes. But if you're going to wear it, I'll wear something else.

296
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,744
Oh, no problem!

297
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,538
I'm not going to wear it.

298
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,456
You go ahead and wear it.

299
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,458
Thank you!

300
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,836
She's a good president.

301
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:28,337
True.

302
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:32,133
The president didn't wear that outfit

303
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:38,347
but she had it remade into an outfit for her dog.

304
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,349
Oh, no. Ms. Yamaki.

305
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,852
You're wearing the same clothes as my dog.

306
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,521
That choker looks like a collar too.

307
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:48,524
Would you like me to get a leash for you?

308
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:57,158
You're going to be my pet to eternity.

309
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,457
I thought about going to some other companies too

310
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,919
but since I had debts that I owed the president I couldn't.

311
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,547
That's why I killed her, before she killed me.

312
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,134
So she couldn't own me till I died.

313
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,142
Case closed.

314
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:50,229
A case like that is duck soup with Conan and me around!

315
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,522
Right, Conan?

316
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:55,735
All I did was make sandals using ribbons.

317
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,154
Just as would be expected of The High School Girls' Detective Squad!

318
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,531
You're a high school detective too, aren't you, Sonoko?

319
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,825
You call yourself the Deduction Queen after all.

320
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:07,329
Well, the thing is, I don't get inspirations at all recently.

321
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:11,333
I used to feel a tingling feeling by my neck before

322
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,254
but I haven't fired the tranquilizer gun at Sonoko for a while now.

323
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:20,760
But, I didn't know that Germany and France counted like this.

324
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,221
Oh, Shinichi used to do that a lot too!

325
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:27,433
He said it's because his mother had a habit of counting that way.

326
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:32,229
Yeah. That's right, because Mom used to favor fashionable French people.

327
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,648
Hey, kid!

328
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:37,151
Is the number three shaped like this in Europe?

329
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:42,031
No. I saw on TV that even in Europe, there are exceptions.

330
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,241
Britain counts the same way as Japan

331
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,744
and to gesture the number three,

332
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:51,957
they erect the index finger, middle and ring finger in that order!

333
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,629
I though so! Right!

334
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,549
Come to think of it,

335
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,636
back during the case of "Red Woman", Sera...

336
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,555
It sure is a thin bat, though.

337
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,933
Can you hit balls with that?

338
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,726
She was saying something like that but...

339
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,437
Maybe she was referring to cricket,

340
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:16,023
a sport popular in Britain.

341
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:17,441
Because the bats of cricket

342
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:20,236
unlike baseball bats are flat and thick.

343
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,238
Besides, when eating,

344
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,740
in American table manners, after cutting the food with the knife,

345
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,243
the fork is re-held in the right hand!

346
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:32,122
In Japan and Britain, the fork is not re-held in the right hand.

347
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,624
Wait a second.

348
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,418
Sera also said...

349
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:42,258
I can also tell that Conan is pretty good at playing football too.

350
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:46,554
In America, they don't call soccer as "football".

351
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:48,931
Which means there's no mistake about it!

352
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:53,435
Sera studied abroad, not in America, but in Britain.

353
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:57,147
But, why is Sera hiding the fact that she went to Britain?

354
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,819
Hold on...

355
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:02,945
Britain...

356
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,325
Britain...

357
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,455
Britain...

358
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,543
I see!

359
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:22,131
I remember it now!

360
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,136
"Next Episode"

361
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,930
Thanks for coming.

362
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,557
I was waiting for you.

363
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:35,519
Hey, didn't you just see something yellow?

364
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,731
I saw it! But it disappeared right away.

365
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:42,359
The master said that a ghost appears.

366
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,155
So, that's the story.

367
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:55,039
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad and the Haunted House"

368
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:58,083
Next Conan's Hint:

369
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,085
"Greenhouse"

370
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,087
-Did you recall anything? -Yep, a beach.

371
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,380
When and where was it?

372
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,882
It's a secret.
