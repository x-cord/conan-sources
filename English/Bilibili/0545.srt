1
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,524
Oh, no.

2
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,724
The fog's getting thicker.

3
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,124
True.

4
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,624
I can virtually only slightly see the guardrail,

5
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:21,224
and I can't see the mountains in the distance or anything for that matter.

6
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:23,024
It can't be helped.

7
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,424
I saw on TV that at this time of the year,

8
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:28,524
Mt. Fyuna is enveloped in thick fog

9
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:31,324
because of something involving the temperature and humidity.

10
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:33,124
TV again?

11
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,124
Study a little more.

12
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:36,524
He is!

13
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:39,824
Conan's tests all score 100!

14
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:41,124
Right?

15
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:44,324
Of course.

16
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,324
Because inside, I'm an 11th grader.

17
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:48,624
If I knew things were going to turn out this way,

18
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:52,224
we shouldn't have had dinner at the client's house.

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,624
I wasn't counting on spending the night there and leaving in the morning.

20
00:00:55,624 --> 00:01:00,124
It's because you drank too much and got drunk, isn't it, Dad?

21
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,524
Well, since you both got school today,

22
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:04,124
I'll get you home even if I have to speed back.

23
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:07,224
Speed... speed through this fog?

24
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,824
Don't worry.

25
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:12,324
There's nobody driving through a fog like this,

26
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:15,224
so there's no worry of on-coming traffic either.

27
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:19,324
But I don't think you should speed.

28
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,324
See, over there!

29
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,024
What? A checkpoint?

30
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:29,724
Your license, please.

31
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,024
Is anything wrong?

32
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:33,624
Okay...

33
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:37,824
You can let male drivers through.

34
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:41,324
Because after all, we're trying arrest...

35
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:43,324
a witch!

36
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:44,424
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:48,324
You're Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department!

38
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,824
It's you, Mr. Mouri!

39
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,824
It's been such a long hula-hula time!

40
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,824
Come off that hula-hula stuff.

41
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:00,824
What brings you to a place like this, Officer Yamamura?

42
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:05,124
Come on. Did you forget, Ran?

43
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:08,224
I'm no longer an ordinary officer.

44
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,524
I'm an inspector!

45
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:12,624
Please call me Inspector Yamamura!

46
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:15,324
Are they going to be okay? The Gunma Prefectural Police.

47
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:21,324
And? Was there a homicide or something, Detective Yamamura?

48
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:29,624
Inspector Yamamura.

49
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,924
In fact, I have a very important duty to carry out!

50
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:33,924
Important duty?

51
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:35,724
I'm on a witch hunt,

52
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:37,524
hunting for a witch!

53
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,124
Witch... witch hunt?

54
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:41,724
Witch?

55
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:45,024
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

56
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,724
Saturday nights are for mystery.

57
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,224
What is the true identity of the eerie woman

58
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:51,624
who appears in the foggy ridge?

59
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:53,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

60
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

61
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,324
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

62
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 1)".

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,860
Just what do you mean by witch hunt?

64
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,260
Haven't you ever heard about it, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,560
About the legendary woman driver

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,760
that was boisterously going around here

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,160
in Mt. Fuyuna about four years ago.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,760
Legendary woman driver?

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,160
You know that this place is the Holy Land for street racers, don't you?

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
It's said that just as the street racers finished their race

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
and were starting to head home,

72
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,660
she suddenly appeared from within the fog

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,260
and outraced all of them.

74
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,060
Together with the unique sound of the exhaust

75
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,260
and tires rubbing against the road,

76
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,760
they say it really sounded like a woman was closing in while screaming.

77
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,260
She was therefore, nicknamed The Silver-white Witch of Mt. Fuyuna!

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,360
Silver-white Witch?

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,460
Why Silver-white?

80
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,060
It seems it was because the car that the witch was driving was a white FD.

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,760
But how can people tell that she was a woman?

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,260
Could they see her?

83
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,860
There was car that spun when battling with her car.

84
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,660
At that time, she came out of her car

85
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,160
and asked the driver, "Are you all right?"

86
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,760
It's said that she was a super beauty!

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,960
And? Why are you trying to arrest her?

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Well, the witch recently appeared again

89
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,760
challenging the street racers, causing a series of car accidents.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,860
The other day,

91
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,260
a racer crashed through the guardrail,

92
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,960
fell over and is in critical condition now.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,460
Hold on!

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,060
Why are investigators from the crime unit handling this?

95
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,560
Traffic accident should be handled by the traffic department.

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,860
I encountered that witch too!

97
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,760
No joke?

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,560
I was asked by one of my superiors to go get the car

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
that he used to stake out with.

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
When I was driving the car,

101
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,360
the witch's car came out of the fog!

102
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,660
How did you know she was a witch?

103
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,160
Her hand.

104
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,060
The hand that came out of the car was so witchy.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,060
Witchy? Weren't you driving the car?

106
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,360
Well, to be exact,

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,160
it was my grandmother.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
She came out from the country

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,760
and I went to pick her up at the station with the car.

110
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,660
Then she told me that she'd drive for me,

111
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,360
since I'm tired from work,

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,860
so to go to sleep in the passenger's seat.

113
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,260
And?

114
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,060
Don't tell me that your granny battled with that witch.

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,760
Of course, she went all out!

116
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,860
Granny loves the F-1 races and car chase movies!

117
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,860
But she gave up part way.

118
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,360
Her opponent is superhuman.

119
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,060
She said she didn't stand a chance.

120
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,660
Super human?

121
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,860
Yes, that's what granny said.

122
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,060
She said that car, like a superhuman,

123
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,060
sped over the fog where there was no street.

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,460
Over... over the fog?

125
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,860
Yes. Granny said she thought it strange,

126
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
stopped the car and got out.

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,560
That person also got off the car and was standing on the fog.

128
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
When granny waved her hand,

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,460
she said that the woman also waved back.

130
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,060
Do you expect us to believe a story like that?

131
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,660
I guess not.

132
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,860
That's why after I'm finished with the work of the first precinct,

133
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm helping out at this checkpoint over here, you see.

134
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,460
Well, it seems she only appears early in the morning when the fog is thick,

135
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,960
so I do this only on my days off.

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
My next day off is...

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,160
next Saturday.

138
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Would you like me to help you too?

139
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,760
It's okay! Because granny could've seen wrong.

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,360
And no matter how famed a detective you are,

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,060
you could probably never catch a witch that walks on fog, right?

142
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,460
Maybe she'll come again to see me

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,560
because I've got a pure heart.

144
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,260
Is that so?

145
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,860
The Silver-white Witch of Fuyuna Pass?

146
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,460
I know! I know!

147
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,260
I heard that she recently appeared again,

148
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,760
but what about her, Ran?

149
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,960
The fact is

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,160
Dad is all out to catch the witch.

151
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,060
A white FD! FD!

152
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,760
He's calling all his friends who are driving,

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,060
but all he knows is that the driver is a woman driving a white FD.

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,560
I thought that maybe since you're in the transportation division,

155
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,960
you might know something more, Yumi.

156
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,360
My jurisdiction is Tokyo, so...

157
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,560
Do you know anything, Miwako?

158
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,560
A woman street racer who rides a white FD.

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm not too keen with cars, so...

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,260
The car I'm riding now is a hand-me-down of my father's too.

161
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,960
I thought so.

162
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm sorry, Ran,

163
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
that I'm of no help.

164
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,160
FD... I wonder if it's a foreign car?

165
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,560
Hey, Dad, let's go home already.

166
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,760
We've made two round trips already.

167
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,260
You idiot!

168
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,560
I rented a Lancer Evolution, just to hunt the witch!

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,660
I can't quit now!

170
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,860
But, if she's really a witch, I'm scared.

171
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,560
I told you not to come along, didn't I?

172
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,460
But Conan...

173
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,660
I wanted to see the witch!

174
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Today is Saturday, so there's no school either.

175
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,360
But since she's not appearing

176
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,060
even if we're running around like this,

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,460
maybe she's taking time off too.

178
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,760
Darn, I guess there's nothing that can be done.

179
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,060
Let's head on home.

180
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Come on, Ran, what's with that weird voice?

181
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm not speeding all that much.

182
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,660
It's not me! I didn't say anything.

183
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,960
Is it the sound of tires?

184
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,260
Tires rubbing against the ground that sound like a woman's scream.

185
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,760
Besides, response that seems to bust out at once to the red zone.

186
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,860
A unique sound of the engine

187
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,060
that sounds like the shrill voice of a woman.

188
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Don't tell me that...

189
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,360
Hey, Ran! Look behind!

190
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
-Is something coming? -Behind?

191
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,160
No.

192
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,160
Pops, beside you, beside you.

193
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,060
It... it's coming!

194
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,360
The white FD!

195
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Sign of battle?

196
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,260
Just great!

197
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,360
Wanna have it out with me?

198
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,560
No, Dad, don't!

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,660
Shut up!

200
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,960
I'm not going to cop out from somebody picking a fight with me!

201
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,960
I'll take you on!

202
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,360
She's already so far away.

203
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,560
Darn!

204
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,060
Another curve!

205
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,460
You're not getting away!

206
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
Pops! Stop! The brakes! Quick!

207
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,560
Stop.

208
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,660
Just what do you think you're doing?

209
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,460
Pops, which way were thinking of turning just now?

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,260
Left, you hear left!

211
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,860
Because that car turned left.

212
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,360
But Pops,

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,060
there's no road to the left.

214
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,360
What?

215
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,960
Don't... don't be ridiculous!

216
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm sure that the car went left.

217
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,860
What the hell's going on?

218
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
A witch that speeds over the fog of Fuyuna Pass.

219
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,760
Very interesting!

220
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,898
Really?

221
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,198
Maybe you saw wrong, Dad?

222
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,798
No, I didn't see wrong.

223
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:10,398
The white FD turned left

224
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,798
and sped over the fog.

225
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:16,198
The red tail lights of that car tilted for a second.

226
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:19,398
I saw it turn the left curve with my very eyes.

227
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,498
I didn't see wrong!

228
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,998
I saw it too.

229
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,298
I heard the sound of the tires at the curve too.

230
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:28,398
The guardrail was closing in in a strange way,

231
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:31,298
so I pulled the side brakes and stopped the car but...

232
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,898
Then, it's the witch after all!

233
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,798
She was probably using some kind of frightening witchcraft

234
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,298
to ride above the fog,

235
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:40,798
and lured us so that our car would get into an accident!

236
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:42,398
Inspector Yamamura's grandmother

237
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:46,498
seems to have seen that person stand on the fog too.

238
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,098
The hand that came out of that car

239
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:51,198
was really witchy and felt eerie.

240
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,698
Maybe it's true

241
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,398
that the car is something we humans shouldn't be meddling with.

242
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,698
Two people.

243
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:01,498
There were two people inside that car, weren't there?

244
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:05,698
You... you mean you saw inside the car?

245
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:08,398
I couldn't but you can tell, can't you?

246
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:11,498
That FD is a Japanese car, but the steering wheel is on the left.

247
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:15,398
The driver couldn't possibly stick his arm out the passenger's seat, right?

248
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:19,498
But if she's a witch, she could stretch her arm.

249
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:24,298
Then, why don't you ask him, Inspector Yamamura, to check it out?

250
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,898
Why do you have to bring out the name of that klutz?

251
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,498
Because he said he was going to be

252
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,998
at this checkpoint again this Saturday, right?

253
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,098
If you call him right away,

254
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:35,498
he may be able to stop that car, right?

255
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:37,098
True.

256
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:39,298
The model is a FD and the color is white.

257
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,098
If more than two people are riding,

258
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,098
the targets narrowed down quite a bit.

259
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,898
Let's not!

260
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,298
If we go after her

261
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,998
and she casts a spell on us or something,

262
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:49,098
what are you going to do?

263
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,898
Don't worry!

264
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:53,398
Speeding the car over the fog

265
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:55,398
and standing on the fog

266
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,398
are both things that can be proven logically.

267
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,398
The only place that witches and curses exist in this world

268
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:03,898
are only in fantasy stories.

269
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:06,798
Conan.

270
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:11,498
I mean, I'm sure Shinichi would say something like that.

271
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,798
I guess so.

272
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:18,598
Stop the white FD that has more than two people riding in it?

273
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:22,798
We are checking every white FD that we see.

274
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,798
But since none look suspicious, we're letting them through.

275
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,498
Letting them through?

276
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,798
You mean you saw a white FD?

277
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:31,398
Yes, about five of them.

278
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,498
What? Five?

279
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:37,498
All of them seem to like the Silver-white Witch.

280
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:41,298
White FDs seem to be very popular now.

281
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:42,598
But, don't worry.

282
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,798
We only let the male drivers through,

283
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:47,198
and no women have come by yet.

284
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,398
You idiot!

285
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,498
Stop the men too!

286
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,998
The woman that got off the witch's car four years ago,

287
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:57,998
may have just happened to be riding the car!

288
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,698
Anyway, stop all the white FDs that come by until I get there!

289
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,298
Judging from the location of that checkpoint,

290
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,398
I'm sure that the witch hasn't passed by yet!

291
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,398
Okay.

292
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,098
"Checkpoint"

293
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,898
So these three are the three white FDs

294
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:18,898
that got stopped at the checkpoint after I called?

295
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:22,098
Yes, all three had two people inside.

296
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,698
Well, I'm sure that the last car that was stopped at the checkpoint

297
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:26,898
is the witch's car.

298
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:30,498
I haven't overtaken any other cars.

299
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:33,598
But I don't think the order they came in is reliable.

300
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:34,798
The only car that came directly here

301
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:38,098
without stopping over anywhere is this car.

302
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,298
The other two cars stopped over partway

303
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,198
and were overtaken by several cars.

304
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:45,298
Come to think of it,

305
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:48,598
several cars went by

306
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:50,598
when Dad was on the phone with Inspector Yamamura.

307
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:52,598
Which means, we can't tell

308
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:56,098
whether the FD is the witch's judging just by the order in which they came.

309
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,698
Well, I did try asking,

310
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,498
but there seems to be no witch among them.

311
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,498
What did you ask?

312
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:06,898
Of course, I asked, "Are you a witch?"

313
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:09,098
What a dope.

314
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:12,598
Why don't you ask them too, Pops?

315
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,298
After all, we did see the witch's hand.

316
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:17,798
Yeah, true.

317
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:19,698
And? Who came first?

318
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:22,298
That FD with two men inside.

319
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,898
"Raito Egashira (25)" -How rude!

320
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:25,998
We're telling you we're not warlocks!

321
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,298
"Akira Mafune (26)" -Well, it's true that we're riding a white FD

322
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,898
thanks to her, though.

323
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:35,298
Speeding through this pass is easy when riding this FD, so...

324
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:36,898
Speeding through is easy?

325
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:40,798
Because the mediocre street racers all panic and make way for us.

326
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,398
Excuse me.

327
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:45,598
Were you guys going fishing?

328
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,198
See! The things in the backseat, aren't they fishing equipment?

329
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:53,498
Yeah, because we get to fish for black bass in Lake Fuyuna.

330
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:57,098
Will you show me that rod?

331
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,998
Okay, but don't break it,

332
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,998
because it's a good rod.

333
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:02,998
Here.

334
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,398
It sure is a good rod.

335
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,498
And? Is it really true

336
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,998
that you didn't overtake anyone until you came here?

337
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:18,598
Yeah, because he was at the wheels today.

338
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,498
He may not look it, but he's a safe driver.

339
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,798
Shut up.

340
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,498
Hey.

341
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:28,298
You're sure wearing some ring.

342
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:32,398
Yeah. Thanks to it, when I tried to fasten my seatbelt, it got stuck

343
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:34,698
and I'm still bleeding.

344
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,798
Come to think of it,

345
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,498
I think the witch was also wearing a ring like this.

346
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:39,698
Really?

347
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:44,598
The reason I'm driving a white FD?

348
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:47,798
"Rumi Hando (23)" -Why else? Because I adore the witch!

349
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:50,198
"Haruka Kawai (24)" -She's charismatic, that's why!

350
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:54,398
And? It seems that somebody overtook you on your way here?

351
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:58,298
Yeah, I got a call while I was driving,

352
00:18:58,298 --> 00:18:59,598
so I pulled over to the side.

353
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,898
And that's when two to three cars overtook me.

354
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,798
Were they white FDs?

355
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,198
Well, I don't remember.

356
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,298
There was a thick fog too.

357
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:12,898
Was that call by any chance from one of your golfing friends?

358
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:13,898
Yeah.

359
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:15,698
Who's this boy?

360
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:18,598
Because there are three golf bags inside.

361
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:20,298
That's why I thought so.

362
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,398
I'm asking you, who's he?

363
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,098
Well, this boy is...

364
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:28,198
Huh, what happened to your fake nail?

365
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,698
Your middle fingernail is gone.

366
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:34,098
When I shifted gears a while ago,

367
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,698
it got stuck and disappeared.

368
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:38,698
Come to think of it, the nails of a witch are also long.

369
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:41,398
Look closely!

370
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,298
Haruka's is pink!

371
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,498
Don't witches have black nails?

372
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:50,398
By the way, is it okay to check inside your golf bags?

373
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,098
Yes, go ahead.

374
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,898
"Jinya Enda (31)" -You mean the witch that frequently appears here

375
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:00,198
is riding a white FD?

376
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,998
"Yasue Taira (28)" -I didn't know.

377
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:04,098
I'm just driving this because I like the color white,

378
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,598
as well as the wave-like design.

379
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:11,698
Were you overtaken by another white FD?

380
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:13,398
Out of all the three FDs,

381
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:16,798
yours was checked the last, right?

382
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,398
Yes, I was buying canned coffee along the way, when I was overtaken,

383
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:23,798
but I don't remember what model car it was.

384
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,998
While drinking coffee in the car,

385
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:30,398
we were all talking excitedly about Lakeside Park where we were headed.

386
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:33,598
That's why you brought along floats and rubber boats?

387
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:34,898
Right.

388
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:39,098
We can use boats, go rafting and play at the pool there, you see.

389
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:42,398
But if you bloat it up like this in the car,

390
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:43,898
you can't get it out, can you?

391
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:46,398
She told me so just a while ago too.

392
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,098
She said for me to put air in it after we reached our destination.

393
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:52,198
Which means that you were the one driving, miss?

394
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,598
Yes.

395
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:54,798
I was sitting in the passenger's seat

396
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,998
and navigating her while looking at the map.

397
00:20:57,998 --> 00:20:59,798
What the...

398
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,398
A little too plum for a witch.

399
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:06,898
Well, we'd like to check your rubber boat and float for now then.

400
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,398
Hey, Misao.

401
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,898
Granny!

402
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,998
"Misae Yamamura, Yamamura's Grandmother" -I told you to stay in the car.

403
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:16,698
You... you brought your grandmother along?

404
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:17,698
Yes.

405
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,998
She wouldn't listen to me saying that

406
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:23,098
she would be able to recognize the witch she saw back then.

407
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:26,598
Well, she isn't in there.

408
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:29,198
How do you know that she's not there?

409
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:31,498
Well, because back then,

410
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:37,098
the one who got off the car on top of the fog and waved back at me

411
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,398
had a halo around her.

412
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:43,198
She looked more like a goddess than a witch to me.

413
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:46,898
They don't have halos around them, do they?

414
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,798
What's with that old lady?

415
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,598
Granny!

416
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:54,698
I... I guess you can leave for today.

417
00:21:54,698 --> 00:21:56,298
If we need anything more,

418
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,398
we'll call you from the station.

419
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,898
Silver-white Witch.

420
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,998
The legendary witch driver who street raced

421
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,198
all over Mt. Fuyuna four years ago.

422
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:10,098
Driving on the fog.

423
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:12,398
Standing on the fog and waving her hand.

424
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,098
What kind of trick did she use anyway?

425
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,698
Can somebody really do something like that?

426
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,098
There are three pairs of suspicious drivers.

427
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:28,298
Mr. Raito Egashira and Akira Mabune.

428
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:32,098
Ms. Rumi Hando and Ms. Haruka Kawai.

429
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:36,198
Mr. Jinya Enda and Ms. Yasue Taira.

430
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,998
Just wait and see, Silver-white Witch.

431
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:42,998
I'll disclose your true identity for sure!

432
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:05,898
"Next Episode" -You idiot!

433
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:07,898
The ending song for today's drama

434
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:12,398
is "Midnight Mirage" sung by Yoko Okino!

435
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:14,398
Mirage?

436
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:17,298
I thought of a simple trick like that too,

437
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,498
but that doesn't explain what's going on!

438
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,998
Standing on top of the fog, that is!

439
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:25,398
Then, why don't we ask the one who's doing it to solve the mystery?

440
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,298
The Silver-white Witch!

441
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,398
Next Conan,

442
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:33,498
"Witch Enshrouded by Fog (Part 2)".

443
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:51,942
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:53,942
"Mirage".

445
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,942
Shinichi is over there!

446
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,542
That's only a mirage!

447
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,788
Because you see, I'm right here.
