00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,610
Ah, a loaf of bread.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,740
Wait, we don't have a toaster.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
I'll get these instead.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,160
Curry Roll

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,250
He's buying a lot of stuff.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,730
Yeah. Is he going to eat all that himself?

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,970
Unlikely. There must be some reason for this.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,830
Yeah.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,280
Looks like we were mistaken.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,410
It looks like he came here to
hang out at a friend's place.

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,740
Seriously? It wasn't anything after all?

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
I don't think so.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,270
What?

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,530
How can you tell?

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,040
Take a look at this.

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,350
This apartment building was built recently.

18
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,170
No one lives here yet.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,690
I see.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,590
The question now is which floor is
Detective Chiba staked out on?

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,520
The button with the most scratches on it is...

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,060
This one. He's on the fourth floor.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,960
If we find a room with a lot of
scratches on its doorbell, then...

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,710
In other words, this room.

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,770
There.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,640
Hey!

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,540
What?

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,680
What is it, Chiba?

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
Hey, Detective Takagi is here, too.

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,430
Hello.

31
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,340
We spotted Detective Chiba,
so we decided to follow him.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,590
You're on a stakeout, right?

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,970
We'll help.

34
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,360
What?!

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,220

00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,650
the Detective Boys get involved in a case!

his name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,440
Conan-kun, you're not supposed to be here.

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,770
You brought all your friends, too.

47
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,900
How did you know we were on a stakeout?

48
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,990
We happened to see you doing a lot
of shopping at a convenience store.

49
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,530
It seemed unnatural, so we followed you.

50
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,250
When you entered this apartment building,
you stopped to look behind yourself.

51
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,000
You seemed interested in the
apartment building across the street.

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,420
That's the location you're staking out, right?

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,140
Well, yeah. But we don't have
time for you kids right now.

54
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,840
You can't stay here. We're working.

55
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,580
What?!

56
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,590
The professor will come pick us up soon.

57
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,930
Can't we stay until then?

58
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,980
Uh... What should we do?

59
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,710
We don't have a choice.

60
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,400
You can stay until the professor arrives.

61
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,690
All right!

62
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,570
You can have some drinks and snacks.

63
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,740
Thank you!

Rooms 301 and 305 are unoccupied.

69
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,510
First, there's the resident of room 302.

70
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,830
Next, room 303.

71
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,110
Nobody's home right now. Have they gone out?

72
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,050
Finally, room 304.

73
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,910
Currently there's a single woman inside.

74
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,280
Why are you only watching the three
middle rooms on the third floor?

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
What?

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,020
Oh, we're on a stakeout
because we're looking

77
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,540
for the person who robbed a jewelry store.

78
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Did that happen last week?

79
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,150
I saw on the news that a robber entered
a jewelry store in Haido City

80
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,460
and ran off with their jewels.

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,740
When the robbery took place,

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,970
the residents living on either end were in the
hospital or traveling, so they have alibis.

83
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,470
So, which of the residents of
those three rooms did it?

84
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,230
We're on a stakeout
because we don't know yet.

85
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,730
How did you know the culprit lives
in the apartment across the street?

86
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,980
Because...

87
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,950
Several days ago,

88
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,870
a serial burglar was caught red-handed.

89
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,050
Inside the burglar's bag were rings
stolen from the jewelry store.

90
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,260
They found four total: one ruby, one sapphire,
one onyx, and one diamond.

91
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,920
The burglar testified that they
burglarized all the third floor rooms

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,340
in the apartment building across
the street and stole the rings.

93
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,560
But he couldn't remember which
room the rings came from.

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,800
I see.

95
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,630
Sounds like a greedy burglar.

96
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,080
Is he afraid of the phone?

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,880
That's Kuwai Tsunahiko-san of room 302.

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:27,890
That's Kuwai Tsunahiko-san of room 302.

Resident of Room 302
He's been acting like that ever since we started the stakeout.

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,340
Kuwai Tsunahiko (50)
Resident of Room 302

102
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,590
Of all the suspects,
he moved here most recently.

103
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,100
Of all the suspects,
he moved here most recently.
Incoming Call

104
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,240
We don't have much information on him.

105
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,110
The person living in room 303 has returned.

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,610
That's Hanai Mitsuki-san of room 303.

107
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:50,770
Hanai Mitsuki (25)
Resident of Room 303

108
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,150
Hanai Mitsuki (25)
Resident of Room 303
He's a salaryman who
works at a trading company.

109
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,410
Hanai Mitsuki (25)
Resident of Room 303

110
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,240
He returned home after buying
dinner at a nearby supermarket.

111
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,820
He returned exactly when he usually does, too.

112
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,380
That's odd. Who goes out onto their
balcony as soon as they come home?

113
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,650
Normally you'd ask your
mom what's for dinner first.

114
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,610
Genta-kun, don't you mean
you wash your hands first?

115
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,860
What? Oh, right.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,390
Look!

117
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,690
Could it be?

118
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,730
Kids, move back.

119
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,110
He's on his guard.

120
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,900
No way. Do you think he noticed us?

121
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,240
Genta-kun, shush.

122
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,570
Sorry.

123
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,990
Could it be? But that's not possible.

124
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,370
Come to think of it, Hanai-san
went out onto his balcony

125
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,490
as soon as he got home yesterday as well.

126
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,620
You're right.

127
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,560
Hanai-san went back inside.

128
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,000
His neighbor is back in her living room, too.

129
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,380
Amano Kasumi-san of room 304.

130
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,840
She works as—

131
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,260
She works as—
Amano Kasumi
Resident of Room 304

132
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,280
Amano Kasumi
Resident of Room 304
I know! She's a yoga teacher!

133
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,260
Amano Kasumi
Resident of Room 304
Correct.

134
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,360
Correct.

135
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,190
Looks like she has a visitor.

136
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,520
We've never seen him before.

137
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,690
Maybe that's her boyfriend.

138
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,840
He's probably the eel deliveryman.

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,690
Nah, I guess not.

140
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,760
But how can we find evidence
indicating who is the culprit?

141
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,280
The robber must've taken
items other than the rings.

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,210
It's hard to imagine that they sold
everything in such a short amount of time.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
The robber is probably panicking
because they were burglarized.

144
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,470
They probably want to get rid of
the remaining evidence quickly.

145
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,840
We'll just have to wait for them
to give themselves away.

146
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,810
What? There's no telling when that will happen.

147
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,490
I can't help that.

148
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,580
Any ideas?

149
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,510
Good idea.

150
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,320
Let's do it.

151
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,900
Conan-kun, why don't we get going?

152
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,700
What? But we wouldn't want
to miss the professor.

153
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,990
Then you wait for the professor.

154
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,460
It's late for us, so we're going to go.

155
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,960
Will you three be okay on your own?

156
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,210
Yeah. Excuse us.

157
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,880
Be careful on your way home.

158
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,470
Sure. Later, Conan.

159
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,070
Uh, later...

160
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,540
Hello?

161
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,520
I know.

162
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,150
Today I'll do whatever it takes.

163
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,040
Takagi-san.

164
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,710
They're all getting ready to go out.

165
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,760
Perhaps they're making a sale.

166
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,890
I can't believe they're all
going out at the same time.

167
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,940
We can't follow all three of them.

168
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,460
Should we call for backup?

169
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,890
I don't know if they'd make it in time.

170
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,900
Damn. Isn't there anything we can do?

171
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,070
In any case, get in touch with Inspector Megure.

172
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Huh? What are they doing?

173
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,540
Conan, can you see us?

174
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,320
Let us handle this.

175
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,550
What are you doing?

176
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,030
Get back here immediately!

177
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,480
We'll be fine.

178
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,290
We're just going to check
out the rooms a little bit.

179
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,580
We have an idea.

180
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,320
What?

181
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,560
Genta!

182
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,610
Get back here!

183
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,150
There's someone standing in front of room 302.

184
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,530
Hey, I know you're in there!

185
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,820
Open up!

186
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,030
Who are you?

187
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:09,150
Um, my ball is on the balcony of that room.

188
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,240
I see. You came at exactly the right time.

189
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,920
You're going to help me.

190
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,790
What?

191
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,960
Damn. I can't hear him clearly.

192
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,830
Genta-kun entered the room.

193
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,430
What?

194
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,440
What's going on? Are they arguing?

195
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,560
They're saying some pretty ominous
sounding stuff about "dead lines."

196
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,670
I'm going to look around for the jewels.

197
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,330
Nichiuri Publishing Company

198
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,260
Nichiuri Publishing Company
What's that?

199
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,950
Nichiuri Publishing Company

200
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,860
That's it.

201
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,460
Kuwai-san is probably an
author, and that's his editor.

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,290
I see.

203
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,710
Genta-kun misunderstood what they said,

204
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,840
and the room doesn't feel lived in because...

205
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,590
He's renting it for work.

206
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,730
He packed that suitcase because
he was dissatisfied with his job

207
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,710
and was planning to run away.

208
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,640
Huh?

209
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,950
What is it?

210
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,730
Mitsuhiko-kun is missing.

211
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,980
Mitsuhiko, get back here!

212
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,490
Excuse me.

213
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,170
My Frisbee is on your balcony.

214
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,880
What? Frisbee?

215
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,250
Give me a second. I'll go check.

216
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,250
Wait a minute.

217
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,270
Enough, Mitsuhiko-kun!

218
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,250
What? I'll go get it for you.

219
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,060
Are you perhaps worried about something?

220
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,760
Mitsuhiko!

221
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:54,520
I saw you looking around
from your balcony earlier.

222
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,650
Come in.

223
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,900
Will he be all right?

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,670
Um...

225
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,660
Uh...

226
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,740
What's the real reason you came here?

227
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,410
What? Um...

228
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,410
Do you...

229
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,900
know something

230
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,030
about my Daiya?

231
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,040
What did you see on my balcony?

232
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,960
This isn't good!

233
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,220
We have to distract him somehow!

234
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,710
Uh...

235
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,710
What's that light?

236
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,390
Run, Mitsuhiko-kun!

237
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,770
Large Sunflower Seeds

238
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,640
So that's what happened.

239
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,220
What do you mean?

240
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,700
When did Daiya-chan go missing?

241
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,790
Could you tell me about it?

242
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,060
That's it. I figured it out.

243
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,730
What?

244
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,050
I know why Hanai-san was cautiously
looking out from his balcony.

245
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,160
Three days ago.

246
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,850
I was cleaning Daiya's room.

247
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,560
I carelessly allowed him to fly away.

248
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,720
Something probably scared
him, but it was my fault.

249
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,270
I wonder where he is right now.

250
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,150
I hope he's not hurt.

251
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,570
I hope he's not hungry.

252
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm so worried about him.

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,910
That's why you scattered food
on the railing of your balcony

254
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,080
and were waiting for him to come home.

255
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,520
Yeah.

256
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,260
Maybe I'm just doing it to ease my mind,

257
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,810
but I'm doing it in the hope
that it'll bring him home.

258
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,380
But Daiya still hasn't come back.

259
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,890
I was just on my way out to
look for him again today.

260
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,700
You'll find him.

261
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,810
No, I'm sure he'll come home.

262
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,680
Thanks.

263
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,740
By the way, did you see that
light across the street just now?

264
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,400
Oh, that's a new building.
It's probably still under construction.

265
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,080
Great.

266
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,800
He managed to play it off.

267
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,660
Ayumi-chan, too?!

268
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,070
Ayumi-chan!

269
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,450
Conan-kun, can you hear me?

270
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,580
That man might not be that lady's boyfriend.

271
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,120
It sounds like they're
arguing in her apartment.

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,340
Can you hear them?

273
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,740
Could you stop doing that?
I'm a rush to sell them, too!

274
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,610
I'm the one finding you a buyer!

275
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,770
Sell? Buyer?

276
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,050
Coming!

277
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,220
Oh, my.

278
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,110
Good evening. My stuffed
animal fell on your balcony.

279
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,500
Were you on your way out?

280
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,860
Huh? Uh, yeah, for work.
It's all right, though.

281
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,800
Work? Is that man planning on
going with her to her lesson?

282
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,120
He could be her manager or business partner.

283
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,750
Wow.

284
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,700
You have so many yoga mats.

285
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,380
Don't!

286
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,380
Try not to touch anything.

287
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,220
I use those for work.

288
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
I sell them.

289
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,390
So, you know.

290
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,390
They're yoga mats designed and produced by her.

291
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:26,810
Koda Go (30)

292
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,020
Koda Go (30)
She's on edge because she's
worried whether they'll sell or not.

293
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,610
She's on edge because she's
worried whether they'll sell or not.

294
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,400
Go easy on her.

295
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,140
I see.

296
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm sorry I touched them
without knowing the full story.

297
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,730
Oh, so that's what it is.

298
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,750
He's her business partner?

299
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,160
Seems that way.

300
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,160
Is this your stuffed animal?

301
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,120
Here. Make sure you don't lose it again.

302
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,300
Thank you.

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,020
It's late. You should hurry home.

304
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,760
Okay.

305
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,470
Not here either?

306
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,590
I didn't see anything particularly suspicious.

307
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,770
Enough, guys. Get back here immediately.

308
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,020
Roger that.

309
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,650
Got it.

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,030
Let's continue with the stakeout
and see how things go.

311
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,650
Ayumi-chan?

312
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,710
What was that voice?

313
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,960
What is this thing? I thought I heard a voice.

314
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,540
It sounded like a kid.

315
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,300
That's the feeling I got.

316
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,350
Conan-kun, stay here!

317
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,250
This doesn't look like a child's toy.

318
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,600
To be on the safe side,
should we take care of it?

319
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,480
Take care of it? What
are you going to do to it?

320
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,860
Dunking it in water will probably break it
or prevent it from picking up anything.

321
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,240
Hey!

322
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,200
Why are you running?

323
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,750
What did you come here to do?

324
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,500
What's going on?

325
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,690
Why don't you tell us why you came here?

326
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,760
Police!

327
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,320
You're under arrested for robbing a jewelry—

328
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,420
Stay back!

329
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,270
Don't you care what happens to the kid?

330
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,770
Help!

331
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,570
Ayumi-chan!
Ayumi!

332
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,220
Detective Chiba!

333
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,910
Catch Ayumi-chan!

334
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,360
What? You got it!

335
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,040
Go!

336
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,030
Ayumi, are you okay?

337
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,430
Thank you, Detective Chiba.

338
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,730
Great.

339
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,730
Ayumi-chan, are you hurt?

340
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,350
I'm fine. I'm not in any pain.

341
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,350
Are you okay?

342
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,740
My back hurts a little, but I'm fine.

343
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,990
Great.

344
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,960
Ayumi-chan!

345
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,500
Conan-kun!

346
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,950
Great.

347
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,570
I'm home.

348
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,520
Several Days Later

349
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,100
Melon Roll for Everyone
Red Bean Roll for Detectives

350
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,660
Melon Roll for Everyone
Red Bean Roll for Detectives
Welcome.

351
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,450
Melon Roll for Everyone
Red Bean Roll for Detectives

352
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,940
You can never have too many of these.

353
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,860
Huh? What?

354
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,250
We saw you.

355
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,870
Red bean rolls and milk.

356
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,810
You must be on a stakeout.

357
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,220

Yes...

are to celebrate solving the case.
