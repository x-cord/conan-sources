1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.940
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.840
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.440
The contact is a matter of life and death this time.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.040
What will Gin and Vodka do?

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.167
After getting a clue from Mr. Itakura who had been murdered

9
00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:45.067
of how to get in contact with the Black Organization,

10
00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:48.667
Dr. Agasa and I came to his villa.

11
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.367
While we were there, we get a call from Vodka.

12
00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:00.167
Hey, what's going on?

13
00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:02.367
You're there, aren't you?

14
00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:05.367
I know you're at the villa.

15
00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.767
Hurry up and answer me,

16
00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.967
Mr. Itakura.

17
00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.267
Hey!

18
00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.167
Oh, sorry. It's so dark in here

19
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.567
that I was having trouble picking up the phone.

20
00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:21.767
I pretended to be Mr. Itakura

21
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.467
and talked Vodka into making me promise to meet him

22
00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.367
at the coin locker located in the basement

23
00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.367
of the Kenbashi Subway Station.

24
00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.467
All right, I got them.

25
00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:36.467
But on our way there,

26
00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.967
Dr. Agasa's car went flat on a mountain path.

27
00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:44.467
So, we got a car that was passing through to give us a lift,

28
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:47.767
and was somehow able to make it to Tokyo, but...

29
00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.667
Strange.

30
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:55.467
There's something fishy about them.

31
00:02:56.867 --> 00:02:58.167
Don't tell me that...

32
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:02.467
Don't tell me that they're...

33
00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:10.067
"Contact with the Black Organization (Desperate Battle Edition)"

34
00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.367
We're almost there, you guys.

35
00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:17.567
Your destination, Kenbashi Station.

36
00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:21.067
But isn't that place still under construction?

37
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.567
The train won't come even if you go there.

38
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.767
We live near the station.

39
00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.767
How convenient.

40
00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.467
I guess so.

41
00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:34.467
Hey, Shinichi, are you really going to go?

42
00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:35.967
Yes.

43
00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:40.767
I've come up with something I gotta do before that, though.

44
00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.067
I don't know what you're up to,

45
00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:49.067
but will you cut out talking secret in my car.

46
00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:51.767
Oh, I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.567
Hey! I told you not to smoke!

48
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.567
Oh, that's right.

49
00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.167
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:59.867
I'll throw it away right away.

51
00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.967
Hey. Don't throw litter out of the window.

52
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.867
Throw it away in the ashtray.

53
00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:12.867
You got loose change mixed with cigarette butts and ash.

54
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:14.667
No matter how rich you are,

55
00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.267
you'll be punished for doing something like this.

56
00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:18.467
I guess it can't be helped.

57
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.767
Because these two people

58
00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.567
are robbers.

59
00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:26.767
What?

60
00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.767
Just what do you mean, Shinichi?

61
00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:40.467
This is probably not his car.

62
00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.267
They probably abandoned the car

63
00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:44.967
they made their getaway with in the mountains,

64
00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:47.967
and stole this car from somebody who happen to pass by.

65
00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:51.767
The legal owner of this car probably doesn't smoke,

66
00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:54.867
so the owner probably kept his loose change in the ashtray

67
00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:57.267
to pay highway tolls with ease.

68
00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:01.167
He put his cigarette butt inside the ashtray without realizing this,

69
00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.867
so even after he did,

70
00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.967
he probably kept using it as an ashtray.

71
00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:09.267
Until they gave us a lift, that is.

72
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.567
No way, sonny.

73
00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:13.267
I put the coins in there to spite him

74
00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:15.567
because I hate smokers.

75
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:19.567
There's still other evidence that this car is not his.

76
00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:22.067
You drove from where you could

77
00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:23.367
judge your position from the driver's seat

78
00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:24.667
because you're not used to driving cars

79
00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.367
with steering wheels on the left, right?

80
00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:30.367
That's why you were driving near the center line

81
00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:32.867
and got honked at a time and again.

82
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.967
When you backed the car up,

83
00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.667
you looked to the left, which is more difficult to see behind,

84
00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.067
and that's probably the same reason

85
00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.367
why you were having trouble shifting gears with your right hand.

86
00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.167
Moreover, when turning the curve

87
00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:49.367
you turned on the wipers instead of the blinker, right?

88
00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:53.667
You forgot that foreign cars with the steering wheel on the left,

89
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.667
have blinkers and wipers on the opposite side

90
00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.467
as that of Japanese cars.

91
00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:00.767
There's still more.

92
00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:03.067
When we first got into this car...

93
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:07.867
If you opened the left door, I could've got in right away,

94
00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.267
but I was wondering why you let me in

95
00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:11.667
from the door on the side of the road.

96
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.767
But I figured out why at the checkpoint

97
00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:16.367
after what Officer Yamamura said.

98
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:20.867
The seat that you're sitting on right now

99
00:06:20.867 --> 00:06:24.367
is stained with the blood of the other robber,

100
00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:28.167
the man who was shot in the leg and sitting there till a while ago.

101
00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:33.267
And that other man is probably in the trunk.

102
00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.667
He's probably hiding there

103
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:37.467
so you could get through the checkpoint.

104
00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:41.167
Then why did they give us a lift?

105
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.467
Of course if they were just some ordinary car thieves,

106
00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:46.267
they wouldn't have done so.

107
00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:50.467
But they did so to help them get through the checkpoint.

108
00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:52.567
They can throw the police off guard into thinking

109
00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:55.067
that it's a family trip or something,

110
00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:57.467
if a boy and an old man are with them, right?

111
00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:01.367
That's how I figured out who they were.

112
00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:03.767
The only people who would give us a lift

113
00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:07.267
despite stealing somebody else's car

114
00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:11.267
had to be the jewelry shop robbers on the run.

115
00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:27.467
Sonny, you're pretty smart, aren't you?

116
00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:31.967
I'm not all that sure if being too smart at your age

117
00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:33.867
is all that great.

118
00:07:35.267 --> 00:07:37.567
Shinichi.

119
00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:43.367
Well, now that you know, we've got no choice.

120
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:47.167
We're going to need you to stick around with us a while longer then.

121
00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:57.367
So the problem now is,

122
00:07:57.367 --> 00:08:00.867
where we get rid of this old man and kid?

123
00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:05.067
How about Kenbashi Station that's under construction

124
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.967
that they wanted to go to?

125
00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:10.167
There's nobody there.

126
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.267
Besides, the construction workers

127
00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:14.767
won't be coming until after daybreak.

128
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:18.067
By the way, sonny, why didn't you tell the police

129
00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:20.567
about us at the checkpoint?

130
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.567
You already knew by then

131
00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:25.667
that we were the jewelry shop robbers, didn't you?

132
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.267
I didn't want to lose time.

133
00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:33.167
If I turned you in to the police at that time,

134
00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:34.567
we would have to go through questioning

135
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.067
because we were riding the same car.

136
00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:38.667
Then, I would be late for my important appointment.

137
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:41.667
Besides, we could catch you anytime anyway.

138
00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.767
Sonny, you sound pretty confident, don't you?

139
00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.167
I like people like you.

140
00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:51.267
Talk as cheeky as you like while you can.

141
00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:53.167
Even if you cry for help,

142
00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:55.467
I'm not going to forgive you. Don't you forget that.

143
00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:01.967
Hey?

144
00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:03.467
He won't be getting up for a while

145
00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:05.367
because I fired an anesthetic needle into him.

146
00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:07.267
Anesthetic needle?

147
00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:09.067
Hang on!

148
00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:25.867
You brat, what a thing to do!

149
00:09:25.867 --> 00:09:27.267
Cut it out.

150
00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:29.267
You may have been able to deceive the jewelry shop

151
00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:30.767
with a dingy model gun like that,

152
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.967
but you can't fool me.

153
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:36.067
What? Who are you, anyway?

154
00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:40.467
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

155
00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:42.167
Detective?

156
00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:45.267
Oh, right, be careful over there.

157
00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:48.367
It's a ball firing belt.

158
00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:52.267
Gas is inside a special rubber and it turns into a soccer ball.

159
00:09:52.267 --> 00:09:55.267
But this rubber is very elastic.

160
00:09:55.267 --> 00:09:57.867
When you move the dial to maximum,

161
00:09:57.867 --> 00:10:00.567
it inflates a large as an advertisement balloon.

162
00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.167
I'll be on my way, then.

163
00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.567
Dr. Agasa, please call the police and tell them

164
00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:13.467
that you caught the jewelry shop robbers.

165
00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:17.467
Hey, are you really going to the place of the deal?

166
00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:19.067
Don't worry!

167
00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:21.967
Since this is one station away from Kenbashi Station,

168
00:10:21.967 --> 00:10:23.267
even if the police were to come,

169
00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:26.167
they won't call off the deal.

170
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:30.567
No, that's not what I'm worried about.

171
00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:31.767
See you, then!

172
00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:35.767
If something comes up, I'll contact you with the detective badge,

173
00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:39.367
so don't come near Kenbashi Station till then!

174
00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:41.267
Hey, Shinichi!

175
00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:48.967
It's almost time.

176
00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.367
Is everyone in position?

177
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:55.667
Okay, don't let one mouse get through.

178
00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:14.147
"Coin Locker"

179
00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:23.647
Hey, Itakura.

180
00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:31.747
Itakura, that rat's not here yet.

181
00:12:49.547 --> 00:12:51.447
A check?

182
00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:58.947
This is the same amount we paid Itakura.

183
00:13:03.347 --> 00:13:07.147
This is the system software that we asked Itakura to make.

184
00:13:07.747 --> 00:13:09.647
What an idiot.

185
00:13:09.647 --> 00:13:11.247
He gives back the money we paid him,

186
00:13:11.247 --> 00:13:13.847
and went chicken leaving just the stuff behind.

187
00:13:16.247 --> 00:13:18.247
Okay, I got him!

188
00:13:18.847 --> 00:13:20.747
Yes, it's me.

189
00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:24.847
That Itakura should be somewhere nearby.

190
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:27.447
Go get him and bring him here!

191
00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:31.347
What? The only ones who entered the station

192
00:13:31.347 --> 00:13:33.547
are a drunkard and a kid?

193
00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:35.847
It can't be! Look for him!

194
00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:43.647
Just what are you up to?

195
00:13:43.647 --> 00:13:44.847
Boss.

196
00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:46.547
Gin.

197
00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:49.947
The deal's supposed to be midnight tomorrow.

198
00:13:49.947 --> 00:13:53.347
He complained that tomorrow wasn't good for him,

199
00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:55.247
so the time was changed.

200
00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:58.847
So, you exchanged e-mails with him

201
00:13:58.847 --> 00:14:02.347
and he used you to his advantage.

202
00:14:02.347 --> 00:14:05.847
No, I'm the one who set the time.

203
00:14:05.847 --> 00:14:08.747
He received the e-mail at his villa

204
00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:11.947
and said that there was a black-out

205
00:14:11.947 --> 00:14:13.547
so I talked to him directly on the phone.

206
00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:19.747
I couldn't get rid of him

207
00:14:19.747 --> 00:14:22.647
but got a hold of what we were after.

208
00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:25.247
And besides, he's got a pretty bad heart.

209
00:14:26.647 --> 00:14:29.247
He'll croak over soon either way...

210
00:14:30.247 --> 00:14:33.547
Why do you think this was stuck on with tape?

211
00:14:35.447 --> 00:14:38.347
To get your fingerprints.

212
00:14:38.347 --> 00:14:41.947
You can't take off the tape with gloves on, you see.

213
00:14:44.447 --> 00:14:46.347
And...

214
00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:48.447
if the one you're waiting for doesn't show up,

215
00:14:48.447 --> 00:14:51.847
you get irritated and light cigarettes.

216
00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:55.347
If the saliva on this is checked,

217
00:14:55.347 --> 00:15:00.147
they'd even be able to find out your blood type.

218
00:15:02.447 --> 00:15:04.847
Boss.

219
00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:06.947
He's even trying to track down

220
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.547
the location of the base of our operations.

221
00:15:09.547 --> 00:15:13.347
Look. There's a communicator on the inside of the CD case.

222
00:15:13.347 --> 00:15:16.347
He sure is some sly fox.

223
00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:19.147
That Itakura.

224
00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:21.347
No, it's not Itakura.

225
00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:25.047
In a place where there is a drastic difference in temperature,

226
00:15:25.047 --> 00:15:26.947
the sympathetic nerves are stimulated

227
00:15:26.947 --> 00:15:29.547
and a great load is placed on the heart.

228
00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:31.047
I don't think a guy with heart problems

229
00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:32.747
will go out of his way to a villa

230
00:15:32.747 --> 00:15:35.547
in the mountains in the blizzard.

231
00:15:35.547 --> 00:15:39.847
Then... then, who was the guy that I talked to on the phone?

232
00:15:40.847 --> 00:15:44.147
Probably some wiz that he hired or something.

233
00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:47.847
But he made one mistake.

234
00:15:49.147 --> 00:15:50.747
This case.

235
00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:52.847
The fingerprints seem to have been wiped off,

236
00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:55.347
but it's still warm.

237
00:15:55.347 --> 00:15:57.047
Which means...

238
00:15:57.047 --> 00:16:01.747
Yes. He should still be hiding somewhere nearby.

239
00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:06.447
This is bad.

240
00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:28.147
If things keep up as is, they'll find me.

241
00:16:28.147 --> 00:16:29.747
What now?

242
00:16:29.747 --> 00:16:31.347
What can I do?

243
00:16:38.947 --> 00:16:40.847
The only place left is there.

244
00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:44.847
A sly fox is no more than a cornered rat now.

245
00:16:45.647 --> 00:16:48.647
Cut out your blabbering.

246
00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:19.947
Boss.

247
00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:22.447
There's nobody here.

248
00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:25.847
So, what now?

249
00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:38.047
Boss?

250
00:17:41.547 --> 00:17:43.247
Boss?

251
00:17:53.047 --> 00:17:57.047
There's no way a grown adult could hide in a place like this.

252
00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:01.347
Nevermind.

253
00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:03.247
We'll change our appearance and get out of here.

254
00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:06.047
He may have called the police.

255
00:18:06.047 --> 00:18:07.547
What?

256
00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:11.347
You mean the guy who Itakura hired?

257
00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:12.647
Yes.

258
00:18:12.647 --> 00:18:16.347
Be careful, there's no next chance.

259
00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:20.547
It seems that some rat is snooping around us.

260
00:18:21.847 --> 00:18:24.847
A fox detective.

261
00:18:27.547 --> 00:18:30.747
What now? Should I go after them?

262
00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:32.147
No, it's too early yet.

263
00:18:32.147 --> 00:18:35.647
They may be lying in wait after pretending to leave.

264
00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.247
But what is it?

265
00:18:37.247 --> 00:18:39.947
What are those guys trying to do anyway?

266
00:18:41.747 --> 00:18:44.747
Ai said that they made her make queer drugs,

267
00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:47.247
but Mr. Itakura is a system engineer.

268
00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:51.247
He has nothing to do with drugs.

269
00:18:51.247 --> 00:18:54.947
A software that he abandoned making for the sake of mankind.

270
00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:58.547
What on earth...

271
00:18:58.547 --> 00:19:02.447
what on earth is it about?

272
00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:16.347
Well, good work, Dr. Agasa.

273
00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:19.147
Yes, well, I guess.

274
00:19:19.147 --> 00:19:20.147
I'm sure you're tired,

275
00:19:20.147 --> 00:19:22.547
but I'm going to have to ask you to come to the station with me

276
00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:23.947
for questioning.

277
00:19:23.947 --> 00:19:24.947
Yes.

278
00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.347
Inspector, excuse me.

279
00:19:27.347 --> 00:19:28.847
I'll see you later, then.

280
00:19:28.847 --> 00:19:30.147
What is it, Officer Chiba?

281
00:19:30.147 --> 00:19:33.347
About the wound of the suspect...

282
00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:37.747
Shinichi.

283
00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:39.747
What's going on?

284
00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.247
Shinichi.

285
00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.047
Footsteps?

286
00:21:24.047 --> 00:21:26.347
Somebody's...

287
00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:28.347
somebody's coming.

288
00:21:33.047 --> 00:21:36.047
Darn. My body...

289
00:21:36.047 --> 00:21:37.547
It won't move.

290
00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:46.847
Ai?

291
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:49.147
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

292
00:21:49.147 --> 00:21:51.147
What?

293
00:21:51.147 --> 00:21:53.247
What are you doing here yourself?

294
00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:57.047
Both Dr. Agasa and you didn't come back even after morning came,

295
00:21:57.047 --> 00:21:59.947
so I used your spare pursuit glasses and came looking for both of you.

296
00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:02.147
It... it's morning?

297
00:22:02.147 --> 00:22:05.547
Little lady, did you find your friend?

298
00:22:05.547 --> 00:22:06.547
Yes.

299
00:22:06.547 --> 00:22:08.447
Okay then, you're getting in the way of work

300
00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:10.247
so out you go.

301
00:22:12.647 --> 00:22:14.447
Hey, wait, Shinichi.

302
00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:29.547
I see.

303
00:22:29.547 --> 00:22:33.047
I fainted in there because of lack of oxygen.

304
00:22:33.047 --> 00:22:35.047
And?

305
00:22:35.047 --> 00:22:37.947
Just what are you doing in a place like this?

306
00:22:39.147 --> 00:22:42.947
I didn't get to sleep, so I was sort of taking a snooze.

307
00:22:44.047 --> 00:22:47.347
Do you think that's answering my question?

308
00:22:47.347 --> 00:22:49.747
Oh, well, what's the difference?

309
00:22:49.747 --> 00:22:51.947
Let's hurry home and get some grub.

310
00:22:51.947 --> 00:22:53.647
I'm starved.

311
00:22:53.647 --> 00:22:55.047
Hey!

312
00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:56.747
Where's Dr. Agasa?

313
00:22:56.747 --> 00:23:00.047
Dr. Agasa's fine. He's at the police station.

314
00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.747
Now for the next news.

315
00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.347
Yesterday at about 5 pm,

316
00:23:03.347 --> 00:23:07.147
the body of a man was found at Hotel New Baker.

317
00:23:07.147 --> 00:23:09.247
The body was identified as that of a computer graphic designer,

318
00:23:09.247 --> 00:23:12.547
Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45.

319
00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:15.547
Don't tell me...

320
00:23:21.947 --> 00:23:23.547
Hey, what's up?

321
00:23:26.247 --> 00:23:27.847
It's nothing.

322
00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:45.547
"Next Episode" -While you're at it, that old man

323
00:23:45.547 --> 00:23:46.847
is the minister of the left

324
00:23:46.847 --> 00:23:49.047
and belongs on the fourth step to the very right.

325
00:23:49.047 --> 00:23:50.747
So don't get it wrong.

326
00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:53.847
You know so much despite being a boy.

327
00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:54.947
Yes.

328
00:23:54.947 --> 00:23:58.647
I helped Ran a lot when I was a kid.

329
00:23:58.647 --> 00:24:02.247
It seems that grandma is not the only one who disappeared.

330
00:24:02.247 --> 00:24:05.747
Look, the hanging scroll of the Thunder God is gone, too.
