1
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.790
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.690
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.390
Today's case is a special one with tricks.

4
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.290
It is a large scaled, fun-packed episode.

5
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.790
He sees through the one and only truth.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.690
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

His name is Detective Conan!

"The Fury Of The Gigantic Goddess Statue"

10
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.239
"Mt. Tenbu, Goddess Statue" -For many hundreds of years,

11
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.039
the goddess of Mountain Tenbu,

12
00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.539
was worshipped by the villagers,

13
00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.639
and protected the peace of the village.

14
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.939
However, those who enraged the goddess

15
00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.939
died a ruthless death.

16
00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.339
So, it has been told!

17
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.539
What a dreadful thing to do,

18
00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.639
digging a tunnel through the rocky mountain

19
00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.439
where the goddess stands.

20
00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.139
The curse of the heavens

21
00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.639
are sure to fall upon them!

22
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.839
That must be the statue of the goddess?

23
00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.039
Right!

24
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:46.139
And that hideous ropeway is in clear view, too.

25
00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.939
Where are you headed for?

26
00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.439
Well, we're not all that sure...

27
00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.939
We're going to that hideous ropeway, you see.

I take it that you are Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

30
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.539
Yes! What a beauty.

31
00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.439
So, you ve come to pick us up?

32
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.539
Yes, we've been expecting you.

"Ayaka Yoshino (23)" -I'm Doumoto Tours' vice president's secretary

Ayaka Yoshino.

35
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.039
I'm really sorry to have brought the kids along with me.

36
00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.939
I am Ran Mouri and this is Conan, who staying with us now.

37
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.139
Hello.

38
00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.239
Hi! Nice to meet you, Conan.

39
00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:38.739
It sure is bustling.

40
00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.539
Well, they are trying to restore the town from tourism.

41
00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.239
It as really an honor to have you,

42
00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.839
the famous Detective Mouri,

43
00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.139
to attend the opening ceremony tomorrow.

44
00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.739
No problem, Ms. Bunny.

45
00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.739
There are people who are against the ropeway, I see.

46
00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.039
It seems that you not only called me

47
00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:13.639
to attend the ceremony, am I right?

48
00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.939
Yes, the president will tell you more about it.

49
00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.739
"Mountain Tenbu Ropeway Resthouse"

50
00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:24.839
The highly reputed name of the renown Detective Mouri

51
00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.939
is well known throughout this rural village, too.

52
00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.239
"Eizo Doumoto (65)" -Now, I am positive that

53
00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:32.739
the opening ceremony will be considered a grand occasion.

54
00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:36.339
No problem, if I can be of service, it is my pleasure.

55
00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.339
"Yasunori Doumoto (40)" -There is actually another reason

56
00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:41.139
why we've asked you to come, Mr. Mouri.

57
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.539
There are many who are against the opening of the ropeway,

58
00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.439
so you'd like to see to it that the ceremony proceeds safely, right?

59
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.439
"Junpei Doumoto (30)" -Just as expected of you.

60
00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.439
The only ones who are happy about it

61
00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.939
are the local shop owners and those who will gain profit from it.

62
00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.439
Since the way my father does things is very aggressive,

63
00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.939
he has a lot of enemies.

64
00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.739
That's why I went independent at an early age,

65
00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:04.339
and started an import and export business handling miscellaneous goods.

66
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.839
And since your business is not doing well,

67
00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.239
didn't you come ask dad for financial help again today?

68
00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:11.239
What?

69
00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:14.539
I'm home! Long time no see, dad!

70
00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.339
Did you just arrive here from Tokyo?

71
00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.039
Yes! It's a grand event for you after all.

72
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.639
"Rina Doumoto (24)" -I'd come no matter what.

73
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.239
Oh, come on.

74
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.439
After leaving home, you went

75
00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.739
and did what you wanted to do to your heart's content

76
00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:27.139
for one whole year.

77
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.239
I'll bet you just came to ask for a loan or something?

78
00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:31.539
How rude!

79
00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.839
What about you?

80
00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.039
"Tourist business" my eye! After all the snickering and bickering over it.

81
00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.239
Stop it! By the way, Rina, who is he?

82
00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.339
He is Tetsuya Aoyagi, a freelance journalist.

83
00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.939
He says he'd like to write an article about this.

84
00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.639
"Tetsuya Aoyagi (28)" -I'm Aoyagi.

85
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.639
I've heard what you've been through

86
00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.539
as to the opening of the ropeway from Rina.

87
00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.139
I hear a lot of things happened

88
00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.539
when the tunnel was under construction.

89
00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.839
Are you Mr. Aoyagi?

90
00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.439
I see, so you're the one trying to get it going good with Rina, right?

91
00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.139
Yes, I believe I talked to you over the phone.

92
00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.739
Just a second, what is this about?

93
00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:10.639
I wonder if he has something he doesn't want others to know about.

94
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.739
Vice president,

95
00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.739
what do you say we have Mr. Mouri and his party

96
00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:17.539
test ride the ropeway in preparation for tomorrow's ceremony?

97
00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.939
Oh, that sounds good. Let's do that!

98
00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.639
Let's have you take a look at the splendid landscape from the terminal

99
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.939
at the top of the mountain which is the pride and joy of Doumoto Tours.

100
00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.139
That sounds just great.

101
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.739
Oh, come to think of it Pops is...

102
00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.239
One sheep, two sheep...

103
00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:45.039
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me you can't take high places?

104
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.639
I'm fine, so long as I don't look below.

105
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.039
How nice.

106
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.439
It is about 3,000 meters to the summit,

107
00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.739
and we'll be there in about 10 minutes.

108
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:54.939
What's that?

109
00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:57.539
It's an esplanade.

110
00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.639
It's closed until we open it to the public.

111
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.839
After going to the summit with the ropeway,

112
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.339
everyone will be walking back down

113
00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.039
while enjoying breathing in the fresh air of the greenery.

114
00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.039
In other words,

115
00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.939
the protest of the inhabitants was settled by financial guarantee?

116
00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.439
However, we still get blackmails and crank calls

117
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:18.639
demanding cancellation of the opening of the ropeway.

118
00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.239
Do you have any idea who is doing this?

119
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.439
It's not just one or two people, so...

120
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:26.839
Besides, there is a priestess called

121
00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.039
Shizu Kamiya who resides in a temple nearby

122
00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:33.539
making a fuss saying that the gods will be angered.

123
00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.639
The local papers wrote an article,

124
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.739
"Does The Curse Of The Goddess Exist?"

125
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:39.639
And this is stirring fear among the inhabitants,

126
00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:41.339
that we are in quite a fix.

127
00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:50.139
Huh? That cable car that is headed down is empty, isn't it?

128
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.639
When one cable car moves, so does the other.

129
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.639
It runs like a well bucket going up on two stays,

130
00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.339
and is called the "back and forth type".

131
00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:01.339
Oh, I see.

132
00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:13.539
What is that?

133
00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:15.639
They are the 500 disciples of Buddha who have attained Nirvana.

134
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:17.539
In other words, we'll be taking a tour

135
00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.439
inside the womb of the goddess that is above here.

136
00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.139
A tour inside the womb?

137
00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:23.839
Does it mean that we can attain good luck

138
00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:25.939
if we go through the body of the goddess?

139
00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.839
Well, I guess you could say so.

140
00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.939
Come to think of it, that man called Aoyagi mentioned something

141
00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:34.139
about the construction of this tunnel, hadn't he?

142
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.639
I'll bet he's thinking of conjuring up a scandal or something

143
00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:39.739
in order to suck money off of our company.

144
00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:41.939
My sister should've been more careful, too.

145
00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:44.139
Why'd she have to tell a guy like that about it?

146
00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:45.739
About it?

147
00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.339
What is it about?

148
00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:50.739
Oh, it's nothing but family business that is not worth mentioning.

149
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.539
We'll be out of the tunnel in about 30 seconds.

150
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.439
See, when the ropeway comes up to here,

151
00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:05.839
the top half of the goddess statue comes into view.

152
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:07.439
The rock mountain was carved

153
00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:10.239
in the shape of the goddess about 800 years ago.

154
00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:14.739
Her right hand stuck out in front is called the form of the Yoganin.

155
00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:17.339
In her left hand, she is holding the Nyoihoju,

156
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:20.739
a crystal ball that will get rid of disasters and unhappiness.

157
00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.739
For those who want to take a good look at it,

158
00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.739
there is an observatory that can be accessed from the promenade.

159
00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:33.139
I sort of understand why the priestess was all upset.

160
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.539
"Mountain Tenbu Station"

161
00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:42.139
What a fantastic view!

162
00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:44.639
You don't get to see Iandscape like this everyday.

163
00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:48.439
People seem so tiny when you see something as grandiose as this.

164
00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:51.039
Yes, but those tiny people are the ones who work

165
00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.839
with grandiose nature such as this,

166
00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:55.639
and develop it into tourist sites.

167
00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:03.039
This?

168
00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:04.239
This is a keepsake of my mother.

169
00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:07.239
It's a broche made out of jade beads.

170
00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.839
That's not it. Your broche is nice, too.

171
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:13.239
But I just thought you look a lot like that goddess statue.

172
00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:16.339
-Me? -Yes, kind and refined.

173
00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:19.539
Thank you. It makes me happy even if you're just flattering me.

174
00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.539
I'm not flattering you. Right, Conan?

175
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.639
Right.

176
00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:25.339
-Ms. Yoshino. -Yes?

177
00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:28.439
Will you please see Mr. Mouri to his hotel?

178
00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:29.539
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:30.839
What are you going to do?

180
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.139
I'm going down the promenade to do final checks

181
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.939
on the condition of the facilities, then come back.

182
00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:38.639
I'll see you at the ceremony tomorrow afternoon, then.

183
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.339
He's the vice president and yet very diligent, isn't he?

184
00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:42.839
Of course!

185
00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.439
The life of the company is on his shoulders.

186
00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:53.339
"Hotel Doumoto"

187
00:10:56.839 --> 00:10:58.539
Just great!

188
00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:01.139
Dad, I think you've already had enough.

189
00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:05.139
Well, they got a suite room, you know!

190
00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:09.039
I want to enjoy it with my entire heart and soul, so don't lose out.

191
00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:12.139
Well, I guess it is a glamorous room.

192
00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.239
I wonder if it's okay.

193
00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:15.139
They must be loaded with cash!

194
00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:16.339
You don't have to worry about it!

195
00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.639
But it seemed like the second son, Junpei

196
00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:22.339
and the oldest daughter, Rina had financial problems.

197
00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:24.139
Yes, it seemed so.

198
00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:27.039
And they didn't seem to be getting along well either.

199
00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:28.739
When it comes time to inherit the estate,

200
00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:30.839
I'll bet they'll go through soemthing worse.

201
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.639
It'll be so bad that bloody rain is likely to fall.

202
00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:37.539
Cut it out, dad! What a thing to say!

203
00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:41.139
I wonder why the opening ceremony

204
00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:43.439
is going to be held in the afternoon?

205
00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:03.864
Mr. Machida, shouldn't we be holding interviews,

206
00:12:03.864 --> 00:12:05.764
rather than sitting here?

207
00:12:05.764 --> 00:12:07.564
Hold your horses.

208
00:12:07.564 --> 00:12:10.564
I didn't come here to write up a flop.

209
00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.364
Where the heck is Conan?

210
00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:15.064
He told me he had to go to the men's room.

211
00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:18.864
Conan, it's going to start soon.

212
00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.264
Okay.

213
00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:21.964
Preparations are perfect.

214
00:12:21.964 --> 00:12:24.764
Nobody has noticed anything.

215
00:12:24.764 --> 00:12:27.164
Your "perfect" can never be counted on!

216
00:12:27.164 --> 00:12:32.064
You can't even get rid of a hyena blackmailer like Aoyagi.

217
00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:33.564
But that's...

218
00:12:33.564 --> 00:12:35.264
Don't talk back to me!

219
00:12:35.264 --> 00:12:37.664
In business, all that matters are results!

220
00:12:37.664 --> 00:12:40.564
The way you are, I can't leave the company to you!

221
00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:44.964
President, let's start making preparations.

222
00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:55.964
Ladies and gentlemen, the central figure of the formal opening

223
00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:59.364
of the Mountain Tenbu ropeway, President Eizo Doumoto of Doumoto Tours,

224
00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:01.864
will present his speech.

225
00:13:11.464 --> 00:13:13.664
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today

226
00:13:13.664 --> 00:13:15.764
on this memorable event.

227
00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:18.664
We, at Doumoto Tours, who are the leaders of the tourism industry

228
00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:22.464
have always tried to preserve cultural heritage from the days...

229
00:13:22.464 --> 00:13:25.064
You darn sinners!

230
00:13:25.064 --> 00:13:26.964
The curse of the heavens

231
00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:29.564
will fall upon all of you present here today!

232
00:13:29.564 --> 00:13:30.764
You idiot! Just what are you doing?

233
00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:33.264
-Take pictures! -Oh, shoots.

234
00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:35.864
To do something as outrageous as to dig a tunnel

235
00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:37.664
under the lotus pedestal of the holy goddess

236
00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:39.264
is totally abominable!

237
00:13:39.264 --> 00:13:41.964
All of you, know thy shame!

238
00:13:41.964 --> 00:13:45.464
May the curse of the heavens fall upon Eizo Doumoto!

239
00:13:45.464 --> 00:13:49.064
We seem to have had a guest here that was not invited,

240
00:13:49.064 --> 00:13:51.264
but please do not concern yourselves over her.

241
00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:53.864
Even the papers have irresponsibly written gibberish

242
00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:55.764
about that statue of the goddess!

243
00:13:55.764 --> 00:13:58.264
However, I, Eizo Doumoto

244
00:13:58.264 --> 00:14:02.964
shall scatter all such nonsense away for you!

245
00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:05.164
That is why we have with us here today,

246
00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:07.064
among our honored guests,

247
00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:10.564
the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri!

248
00:14:13.964 --> 00:14:17.564
Well, hello. Everyone, I am Kogoro Mouri!

249
00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:19.864
Thank you, thank you!

250
00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.964
Mr. Machida, this is really something!

251
00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:24.164
Kogoro Mouri is here!

252
00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:26.464
Don't you think there's something fishy going on?

253
00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:29.864
What? You mean it's not him, but a look alike?

254
00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:32.264
Oh, never mind.

255
00:14:32.264 --> 00:14:36.064
Why on earth did Eizo Doumoto call us here for?

256
00:14:43.664 --> 00:14:47.664
The Mountain Tenbu will now begin its first trial run.

257
00:14:47.664 --> 00:14:51.064
The second group of people will get on the second cable

258
00:14:51.064 --> 00:14:54.964
that will arrive after the first cable car reaches the top.

259
00:15:01.664 --> 00:15:02.764
Huh?

260
00:15:02.764 --> 00:15:04.864
The two there are journalists from Tokai Nippo,

261
00:15:04.864 --> 00:15:08.164
the agency that is attacking Doumoto Tours.

262
00:15:08.164 --> 00:15:10.264
Why would they be here before all the other agencies

263
00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:12.764
and take the trial run?

264
00:15:24.364 --> 00:15:26.564
You fools.

265
00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.564
Look, Aoyagi. The view is fantastic.

266
00:15:35.564 --> 00:15:37.064
How do you like it, Mr. Machida?

267
00:15:37.064 --> 00:15:40.464
Why not try writing some good things about us for a change?

268
00:15:40.464 --> 00:15:42.664
Are you trying to bribe me?

269
00:15:42.664 --> 00:15:46.764
If you do, I'll make an article of that, too.

270
00:15:46.764 --> 00:15:50.264
I wonder how long you'll be able to stay obnoxious like that.

271
00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:14.664
Hey, Mr. Machida. Take a look at that!

272
00:16:14.664 --> 00:16:16.864
The statues of the 500 disciples of Buddha who attained Nirvana?

273
00:16:16.864 --> 00:16:20.464
You mean you made things like that using the power of money?

274
00:16:20.464 --> 00:16:24.064
I'd rather you take me to be a religious man.

275
00:16:24.064 --> 00:16:26.464
I'm sure that this would become the talk of the town

276
00:16:26.464 --> 00:16:28.764
and we'll have visitors avalanching in.

277
00:16:28.764 --> 00:16:30.564
Wanting to worship and pray to the statue of the goddess

278
00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:32.464
as well as the statues of the 500 disciples of Buddha.

279
00:16:32.464 --> 00:16:34.964
In other words, I have every reason to be given gratitude

280
00:16:34.964 --> 00:16:38.864
from the statue of the goddess, and no reason to be cursed by it.

281
00:16:40.464 --> 00:16:42.464
What's up?

282
00:16:42.464 --> 00:16:44.764
What's up? Is it a black out?

283
00:16:44.764 --> 00:16:46.564
Hey, just what do you think you're doing? Don't!

284
00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:47.664
You're...

285
00:16:47.664 --> 00:16:49.564
Somebody! Somebody, give us light!

286
00:16:50.964 --> 00:16:52.464
Use the flash of the camera!

287
00:16:52.464 --> 00:16:53.964
Oh, that's right.

288
00:16:58.564 --> 00:16:59.664
Use the flash once more!

289
00:16:59.664 --> 00:17:01.264
Okay!

290
00:17:07.364 --> 00:17:08.664
What the...

291
00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:09.764
This is...

292
00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:11.664
This is absurd!

293
00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:13.464
The president...

294
00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:15.764
He's gone!

295
00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:17.464
The windows cannot be opened!

296
00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:20.264
The two journalists are by the door to the left!

297
00:17:20.264 --> 00:17:22.164
By the door to the right is Ms. Ayaka!

298
00:17:22.164 --> 00:17:24.964
The ceiling only has a small ventilation hole!

299
00:17:24.964 --> 00:17:26.164
What about the emergency exit?

300
00:17:26.164 --> 00:17:27.764
It hasn't been used yet!

301
00:17:27.764 --> 00:17:30.064
Then, where did he disappear to?

302
00:17:30.064 --> 00:17:32.464
What is with this talisman?

303
00:17:32.464 --> 00:17:34.064
The principle of "cause and effect"?

304
00:17:34.064 --> 00:17:35.664
"Cause and effect"?

305
00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:38.264
You will pay for your sins?

306
00:17:38.264 --> 00:17:40.164
Dad is over there!

307
00:17:41.164 --> 00:17:42.764
What?

308
00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:48.364
That is indeed Mr. Eizo Doumoto!

309
00:17:48.364 --> 00:17:50.264
It looks like something was stabbed into his chest!

310
00:17:50.264 --> 00:17:52.464
Contact somebody with the cell phone immediately!

311
00:17:52.464 --> 00:17:55.164
We can't because there are no antennas in this area yet!

312
00:17:55.164 --> 00:17:57.364
There's a phone once we get to the top though.

313
00:17:57.364 --> 00:17:58.964
This is ridiculous!

314
00:17:58.964 --> 00:18:00.864
Can something like this really happen?

315
00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:17.795
Something happened to the president!

316
00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:20.495
Get the police and let the people below know about this right away!

317
00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:22.395
-Yes, sir! -We'll head down...

318
00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:24.395
to the statue of the goddess using the hiking path!

319
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:25.495
This is Machida!

320
00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:27.295
Please leave one page of the evening news open!

321
00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:29.095
There's been a curse!

322
00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:30.695
Eizo Doumoto has been stabbed

323
00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:32.795
on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

324
00:18:35.895 --> 00:18:38.895
Ms. Ayaka, what's wrong? Are you okay?

325
00:18:38.895 --> 00:18:40.495
I just felt a little dizzy.

326
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.295
Never mind me, check on the president.

327
00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:44.095
Yes. I'll go on ahead, then.

328
00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:46.295
-Let's go, Conan! -Okay.

329
00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:03.595
Mr. Mouri, the statue of the goddess is up these stairs!

330
00:19:16.895 --> 00:19:18.795
It takes 15 minutes to get up here!

331
00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:37.295
He's been stabbed right in the chest and is dead.

332
00:19:37.295 --> 00:19:39.095
Dad!

333
00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.095
It can't be! You've have to be joking

334
00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:44.195
saying that he's dead, right, Mr. Mouri?

335
00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:47.895
I understand how you feel but he's dead.

336
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.595
It can't be...

337
00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:53.495
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.

338
00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:59.095
Vice president, please get a hold of yourself!

339
00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:01.695
Huh? Ms. Ayaka, are you all right?

340
00:20:01.695 --> 00:20:03.495
Yes, I'm fine.

341
00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.095
I won't be able to do my job as a secretary,

342
00:20:05.095 --> 00:20:06.895
being rendered helpless at a time like this.

343
00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:21.295
I finally reached it!

344
00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:24.795
Hi, so it's you?

345
00:20:24.795 --> 00:20:28.095
Oh, Mr. Mouri! Not you again?

346
00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:30.495
Just what do you mean? Am I supposed to be the god of death?

347
00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:34.295
If so, have the statue of the goddess help you out this time.

348
00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:35.895
Oh, no!

349
00:20:35.895 --> 00:20:39.595
I'm just delighted that I get to hear your superb deduction again.

350
00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:42.495
Don't tell me that this is some kind of curse, though.

351
00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:44.795
There are rumors of that sort going around.

352
00:20:44.795 --> 00:20:45.995
No such thing!

353
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:49.695
The killer is among the ones who were in the ropeway!

354
00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:51.495
What? Is that true?

355
00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:53.695
Which means the killers are among those people, right?

356
00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:56.595
Before Eizo disappeared from inside the cable car,

357
00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:58.895
there was a sound of someone fighting.

358
00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:02.195
Moreover, a strange talisman was found pasted to the window.

359
00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:04.895
The killer must have some way pushed Eizo

360
00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:08.795
from the ropeway onto the tunnel below.

361
00:21:08.795 --> 00:21:12.395
But no one who was in the cable car got off

362
00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:15.295
until it reached the top, right?

363
00:21:15.295 --> 00:21:18.695
It is likely that an accomplice was inside the tunnel.

364
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:20.995
I think that is highly unlikely.

365
00:21:20.995 --> 00:21:24.195
You! Keep your big mouth shut!

366
00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:25.795
Wait a second, Mr. Mouri.

367
00:21:25.795 --> 00:21:27.995
Conan, just what do you mean?

368
00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:31.595
Well, it takes the ropeway only 30 seconds

369
00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:33.295
to get through the tunnel.

370
00:21:33.295 --> 00:21:34.795
Even if there were to be an accomplice,

371
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:37.495
I wonder if it would be possible to move the victim from the tunnel up

372
00:21:37.495 --> 00:21:39.895
to the palm of the statue of the goddess in just 30 seconds?

373
00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:44.295
Ms. Ayaka, aren't there any secret elevators or something

374
00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:46.395
that can get you from the tunnel to this observatory?

375
00:21:46.395 --> 00:21:48.595
There is no such thing.

376
00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:50.795
Of course, for maintenance purposes,

377
00:21:50.795 --> 00:21:53.295
there is a path leading from the tunnel,

378
00:21:53.295 --> 00:21:54.795
to part way of the stairs of the observatory.

379
00:21:54.795 --> 00:21:58.095
That's it! The killer used that route and killed Eizo.

380
00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:00.895
But to get from the tunnel to the observatory,

381
00:22:00.895 --> 00:22:04.495
it would take even a man who runs at least three minutes.

382
00:22:04.495 --> 00:22:05.995
Three minutes?

383
00:22:05.995 --> 00:22:07.695
Wait a second.

384
00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:10.895
From the time of the black out to the time we found Eizo

385
00:22:10.895 --> 00:22:12.095
in the palm of the statue of the goddess,

386
00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:14.895
it took about 30 seconds.

387
00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:18.095
So, if it takes three minutes...

388
00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:20.795
No, I think it takes even more time.

389
00:22:20.795 --> 00:22:22.295
It's unthinkable that Mr. Eizo Doumoto

390
00:22:22.295 --> 00:22:24.995
would stay quiet being kidnapped.

391
00:22:24.995 --> 00:22:27.995
Which means he would have had to been killed right away.

392
00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:30.295
However, if someone were to carry the corpse on his back

393
00:22:30.295 --> 00:22:32.095
and go from the tunnel to observatory,

394
00:22:32.095 --> 00:22:34.095
it would take double the time which is six minutes, not three.

395
00:22:34.095 --> 00:22:36.595
No, it would probably even take more.

396
00:22:36.595 --> 00:22:37.695
That's right.

397
00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:39.295
It's more unimaginable than the fact

398
00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:42.595
that the victim disappeared from within the ropeway is that thing.

399
00:22:42.595 --> 00:22:44.995
It's a curse!

400
00:22:46.395 --> 00:22:48.695
What a sight having to display a corpse

401
00:22:48.695 --> 00:22:51.195
in the palm of the statue of the goddess.

402
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.795
It sure is rightful punishment from the heavens

403
00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:57.795
for Eizo Doumoto who has turned money hungry!

404
00:23:09.395 --> 00:23:14.095
It's too impossible to be called a homicide.

405
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:20.195
Don't tell me that this is really some kind of curse?

406
00:23:20.195 --> 00:23:24.095
That it really is the fury of the goddess?
