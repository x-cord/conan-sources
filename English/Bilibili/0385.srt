1
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
Today's stage is a musical family's mansion.

2
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.740
A famed musical instrument plays the melody of murder.

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.840
That befalls the violinist.

4
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.425
What? The area code for Tottori Prefecture?

8
00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.525
What's up?

9
00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.325
I mentioned it before, didn't I?

10
00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:04.025
During the incident that happened in Okinawa,

11
00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:07.125
that I was concerned about the phone call that Mr. Motoyama was making.

12
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.625
He called a place is Tottori called "Kurayoshi"

13
00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.925
And in the incident before that.

14
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:15.425
Police Detective Yamamura called a place in Tottori

15
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:18.125
where his grandmother lives called "Yazu"

16
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.725
What they both have in common

17
00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.625
is that their area code is "0858".

18
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.325
Which means...

19
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.225
I have a feeling it's the same...

20
00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:34.325
as the mail address that Bellmot sent to her people.

21
00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:35.325
What?

22
00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:37.725
Besides, I don't think it's just some ordinary person.

23
00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:39.425
If I remember correctly, I heard,

24
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.125
the words that she mumbled back then was...

25
00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:44.825
"Okay, boss".

26
00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.525
Then, don't tell me that the number is...

27
00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.925
Yeah, this number 0858 may be

28
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.525
the mail address that connects

29
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.625
to the boss that controls all of them.

30
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:57.825
But...

31
00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:01.425
Only the top four numbers seem to be the same.

32
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:04.025
Besides, although the numbers are the same 0858,

33
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:07.425
I feel there is some very slight difference.

34
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:08.725
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home.

35
00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.625
Hi.

36
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.325
Hey, Ran, do you know what this melody is?

37
00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:17.525
What's that?

38
00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.725
Oh, a quiz that's the talk of the town now.

39
00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:29.125
"Fa, mi, re, mi" right?

40
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.625
Maybe it's "so-fa-mi-fa?"

41
00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.925
It's "ti-la-so-la"

42
00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.225
although I'm a bit off.

43
00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:36.925
My, you're really confident, aren't you?

44
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.525
Then try singing it.

45
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.525
Do re mi...

46
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:51.425
Fa so la ti do.

47
00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:53.325
-Wow, talk about off key. -Two horses away, no three.

48
00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:55.525
-But, I'm definite that it's ti-la-so-la. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

49
00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:57.125
-No, it's Fa-mi-re-mi. -Aozora Hikarin is in the lead.

50
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.025
Come off it! Cut out the noise!

51
00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:00.825
I'll ask those people later for you,

52
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:02.625
so cut out the noise.

53
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.525
Ask who?

54
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:08.525
The people that I'm going to see after this is a family of musicians.

55
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:13.625
And there's a composer with perfect-pitch among them.

56
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.125
Perfect pitch.

57
00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:23.725
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Prelude!"

58
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:29.425
Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

59
00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:33.525
I don't see Mr. Shitara having an appointment with anyone by that name.

60
00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:38.325
Well, I was asked to come here by his granddaughter Hasuki Shitara.

61
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:40.725
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward for the Shitara family" -I see.

62
00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:45.025
Hasuki is at the annex practicing right now.

63
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:47.025
See, you can hear her playing?

64
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:50.625
So the music that's been playing all this time

65
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.625
was a live performance.

66
00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.325
How fantastic.

67
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.725
I don't know what kind of appointment you have,

68
00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.425
but please make sure you do not get in the way of her practice,

69
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:04.125
because she has an important concert performance tonight.

70
00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:07.625
Which means tonight is some special occasion?

71
00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:11.325
It is Mr. Shitara's 72nd birthday.

72
00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.025
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter"

73
00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:30.025
Hasuki.

74
00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:32.325
This is Mr. Mouri here to see you.

75
00:05:33.925 --> 00:05:37.825
Yes, I'm glad. You really did come.

76
00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:43.325
Well, of course, if for a beautiful lady like you.

77
00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:48.925
Are you the one with the perfect-pitch, Miss?

78
00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:51.725
That's not me.

79
00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.925
Hey, hey, are you sure it's okay, Hasuki,

80
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.425
to slack off practice?

81
00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:59.025
"Genzaburo Shitara (60)" -You're the one who's performing tonight, right?

82
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.625
"Choichiro's younger brother" -Using the you know what...

83
00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.125
Yes.

84
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:05.625
If you goof, you're going to get it from big brother.

85
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:08.525
Genzaburo, I would really like you to let us know beforehand

86
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:11.625
if you're coming home.

87
00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.125
Come on.

88
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:17.125
I came all this way after leaving in the middle of the orchestra meeting.

89
00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:21.325
I'd like to take a snooze for a while.

90
00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:24.625
Will you wake me like always when the birthday party starts?

91
00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.725
I hope you haven't touched anything in my room without my permission?

92
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:33.525
No, because I don't want to be yelled at by you like your late wife.

93
00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:34.625
I see.

94
00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:41.925
Miss, is that man the person with the perfect-pitch?

95
00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:46.425
Nope. Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is a famous conductor,

96
00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:49.225
but he says he does not have perfect pitch.

97
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:50.725
The one who has perfect pitch is...

98
00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.025
Ti-so-ti-so.

99
00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:55.825
Ti-so.

100
00:06:55.825 --> 00:06:58.725
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Oops, I went flat on "ti".

101
00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:02.125
Sorry, an ambulance just went by.

102
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.525
About yesterday's music,

103
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:08.825
could you make the BPM from 120-130.

104
00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:10.625
I want it to be a bit more lively.

105
00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:11.625
Right, right.

106
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.525
Could it be him?

107
00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:16.525
Yes, he's the one with the perfect-pitch.

108
00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:20.425
He is a genius composer and in charge of soundtracks for several dramas.

109
00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:23.325
He's Kyosuke Haga, my uncle.

110
00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:31.625
Are you talking about me?

111
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:34.625
Yes?

112
00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:38.125
Can you tell me what the notes are?

113
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.125
Uncle.

114
00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.525
How did you like what I played?

115
00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:46.825
It was good, although you were 1/4th pitch flat on a note.

116
00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.225
I prefer it that way, though.

117
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:51.025
Thank you!

118
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:55.225
Yes, hello.

119
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.625
You mean that piece.

120
00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:00.525
I'd like to break the notes up a bit more.

121
00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:02.725
Can you handle it?

122
00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:04.525
What I'm trying to say is...

123
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.825
Furuto!

124
00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:09.225
Where are you?

125
00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:10.425
Furuto!

126
00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:13.125
Grandmother?

127
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.625
I hear the sound of the violin playing.

128
00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.225
"Ayane Shitara (68)" -Furuto, don't hide

129
00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:18.825
"Choichiro's wife" -and come out here.

130
00:08:18.825 --> 00:08:20.825
Grandmother, not again.

131
00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:23.525
Father passed away last year today,

132
00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:25.025
have you forgotten?

133
00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:26.525
Last year today?

134
00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:29.425
No, Furuto is still...

135
00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.925
Hey, Ayane, how unsightly!

136
00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.125
Grandfather.

137
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:36.425
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Going after the shadow of the dead for so long.

138
00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:39.225
"The head of the Shitara family" -Our son Furuto has returned to dust.

139
00:08:39.225 --> 00:08:41.425
Don't you understand after all this time!

140
00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:45.325
Grandfather, you were told by the doctor not to walk around.

141
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.025
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes.

142
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:50.925
I'm sorry but I'm going to take care of the two for now,

143
00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.525
so I'll meet you at the main house later.

144
00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:54.525
I'd like to talk to you there.

145
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:56.525
I've got something I'd like to show you.

146
00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:29.425
This violin seems to have been used over a long period of time.

147
00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:33.625
Yes, it's been made about 300 year ago.

148
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:36.425
This sure is some antique then.

149
00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:43.825
The one who made it is an Italian

150
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:46.025
by the name of Antonio Stradivari.

151
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:49.725
Stradivari...

152
00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:51.025
You mean that famous...

153
00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.625
Just as I thought.

154
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.025
Stradivarius?

155
00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:58.825
Doesn't this cost several billion yen?

156
00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:02.425
The legendary and famed musical instrument.

157
00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:04.825
Let go of it, Dad, quickly!

158
00:10:04.825 --> 00:10:07.225
My body's frozen in place that I,

159
00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:08.925
I can't let go of it.

160
00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:11.925
-What? Oh come on. -Yes. Yes.

161
00:10:18.225 --> 00:10:19.325
And...

162
00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:22.525
what about this legendary musical instrument?

163
00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:23.525
Well...

164
00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:28.125
This violin is what Danjiro Shitara,

165
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:30.925
Uncle Kyosuke Haga's father had given as a gift

166
00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:35.525
to Grandfather Choichiro, his older brother.

167
00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:37.825
Despite being the son of blood-related brothers,

168
00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:40.125
why is his last name Haga?

169
00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:43.025
Yes, the thing is unfortunately, on the day of his birthday,

170
00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:45.125
Danjiro was attacked by a robber.

171
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:46.625
Robber?

172
00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.725
Grandfather Choichiro and the others

173
00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:51.225
gave in quietly and was tied up so they were fine,

174
00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:53.725
but Danjiro resisted

175
00:10:53.725 --> 00:10:55.925
so he passed away a few days later

176
00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:59.125
because of the blow he incurred during the robbery.

177
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.025
Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind,

178
00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:03.125
was adopted by the family on his mother's side

179
00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.825
and took after the surname Haga.

180
00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:07.425
I see.

181
00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:10.725
But, it's a amazing that this wasn't stolen.

182
00:11:10.725 --> 00:11:15.025
I mean the robber was probably after the Stradivarius.

183
00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:17.325
The robber seems to have taken the wrong violin.

184
00:11:17.325 --> 00:11:19.925
Since the Shitara Family has been musicians for generations.

185
00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:22.725
There were many violins.

186
00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:25.625
It all happened 30 years ago though.

187
00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:28.825
Don't tell me that you want me to find out

188
00:11:28.825 --> 00:11:31.625
who the robber that broke in here 30 years ago was?

189
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.825
No, what I'd like to ask you to do is...

190
00:11:33.825 --> 00:11:35.825
to solve the shuddering incidents,

191
00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:38.225
that have happened within the last two years.

192
00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:44.525
The first one is the incident that happened the year before last.

193
00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:48.025
Uncle Genzaburo's wife who had been very athletic,

194
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:51.325
tripped on the stairs and passed away.

195
00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:54.025
The other one is an incident that happened last year...

196
00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:58.125
My father, Furuto leaned against a corroded fence of the veranda.

197
00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.025
It's unlikely that my father who was a very careful person

198
00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:01.725
would fall to his death like that.

199
00:12:01.725 --> 00:12:04.225
I just can't make myself think that something like that could happen.

200
00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:06.825
I would like you to solve these hideous cases, Detective Mouri.

201
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:11.825
Maybe those two incidents were accidents...

202
00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:16.325
No! Both of them passed away on Grandfather's birthday!

203
00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:17.725
Moreover, at this time,

204
00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:20.325
the two played this Stradivarius.

205
00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:22.125
It is as if they were cursed by the incident

206
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:24.125
that occurred 30 years ago.

207
00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:26.825
And, this year, I'm going to be playing it...

208
00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:29.525
I'm sure that something bad will happen to me too.

209
00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.525
Then, don't play it.

210
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:33.925
I want to play it!

211
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:38.425
But, if you can take it out freely like this anytime,

212
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.525
you can play it any time you like, can't you?

213
00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:42.525
I can't take it out freely.

214
00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:46.325
I borrowed it from Grandfather just for today

215
00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:48.925
for this special occasion so I can practice.

216
00:12:48.925 --> 00:12:50.025
That's why...

217
00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:57.625
See, I'm sure he's watching me.

218
00:12:57.625 --> 00:12:59.425
Then, you mean the violin that I played

219
00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.325
a little a while ago wasn't supposed to be...

220
00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:03.025
Of course it's a secret.

221
00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:06.925
And, what would you like me to do?

222
00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:09.225
I want you to undo the curse of this Stradivarius

223
00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.925
before I begin playing it.

224
00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.025
A curse is not something

225
00:13:14.025 --> 00:13:17.225
that a detective like me can solve, you see.

226
00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:21.625
What? I thought that detectives solve anything.

227
00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:24.725
It somehow seems to be bright outside.

228
00:13:24.725 --> 00:13:27.525
Are you going to have some birthday fireworks or something?

229
00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.825
No, there are no such plans...

230
00:13:35.425 --> 00:13:36.825
The annex!

231
00:13:36.825 --> 00:13:38.025
It's on fire!

232
00:13:49.938 --> 00:13:52.438
Grand-Uncle Genzaburo is there.

233
00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:56.338
Fire! Open the curtains and look!

234
00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:01.538
Where's your uncle's room?

235
00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:04.338
It's on the 2nd floor right up the stairs.

236
00:14:06.238 --> 00:14:08.438
Hey, uncle, can you hear me?

237
00:14:08.438 --> 00:14:09.438
Hey!

238
00:14:09.438 --> 00:14:12.238
Darn. The door is locked.

239
00:14:12.238 --> 00:14:14.238
We've got no other choice.

240
00:14:23.938 --> 00:14:25.838
-Great Uncle! -Don't go inside!

241
00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:27.438
It is impossible to help him.

242
00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:31.438
Ayane. Ayane...

243
00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:32.538
Grandfather!

244
00:14:35.638 --> 00:14:38.738
Ayane is still upstairs.

245
00:14:38.738 --> 00:14:40.638
What? Grandmother is upstairs.

246
00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:42.338
Where is the room upstairs?

247
00:14:42.338 --> 00:14:44.438
The room at the very end of the 3rd floor

248
00:14:49.438 --> 00:14:50.938
This is impossible, unless we have a fire-proof suit or something.

249
00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:51.938
Oh no.

250
00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:07.038
I can't help myself for being the way I am.

251
00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:08.538
Take care of everyone else, will you?

252
00:15:09.638 --> 00:15:10.638
Uncle.

253
00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:15.038
Pops, please park your car below that window, quick!

254
00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:16.038
Do that, okay?

255
00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:18.338
Hey, you! Wait, it's dangerous.

256
00:15:28.038 --> 00:15:29.438
Are you all right?

257
00:15:29.438 --> 00:15:31.438
Grandfather, please get a hold of yourself.

258
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.438
Hey, Dad, wait, just what do you think you're doing?

259
00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:41.638
Beats me!

260
00:15:45.938 --> 00:15:49.338
That kid told me to park my car here.

261
00:15:49.338 --> 00:15:51.838
How come I'm listening to that kid?

262
00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:25.438
What?

263
00:16:30.838 --> 00:16:32.838
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Aunty!

264
00:16:32.838 --> 00:16:33.838
Mrs. Shitara!

265
00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:41.038
I see, he wanted to reduce the distance of the fall with the car

266
00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:42.638
and used the roof as cushion.

267
00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.838
Just what a kid would think of.

268
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.238
We were lucky that we got a wagon

269
00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:48.738
because they had nothing else.

270
00:16:48.738 --> 00:16:50.638
It's a rental car, you know!

271
00:16:50.638 --> 00:16:53.538
Who knows how much we're going to have to pay for repair.

272
00:16:54.738 --> 00:16:57.538
The fire engines soon arrived at the scene but...

273
00:16:57.538 --> 00:17:01.438
the annex of the Shitara family kept on burning for a while.

274
00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:06.938
As if it were grieving the postlude of the conductor Genzaburo Shitara.

275
00:17:14.238 --> 00:17:16.238
No!

276
00:17:16.238 --> 00:17:19.538
But, we've got to treat you at the hospital either way.

277
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.238
No, no!

278
00:17:21.238 --> 00:17:25.138
I'm sorry, but could you let her have her way, please.

279
00:17:25.138 --> 00:17:28.938
A year ago, our son was taken away on the ambulance

280
00:17:28.938 --> 00:17:31.738
and never came back.

281
00:17:31.738 --> 00:17:34.638
I guess she doesn't want to ride the same vehicle.

282
00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:39.338
Could you please treat her at home just for today?

283
00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:45.438
Thank you, sonny.

284
00:17:45.438 --> 00:17:47.338
I'm sorry for what you had to go through too, Kyosuke.

285
00:17:47.338 --> 00:17:48.738
Thank you.

286
00:17:48.738 --> 00:17:49.838
No problem.

287
00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:54.038
Little Kyosuke, are you all right?

288
00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:55.338
I'm fine.

289
00:17:55.338 --> 00:17:58.438
Will you please cut out that "Little" when calling me?

290
00:17:58.438 --> 00:18:00.838
30 years have gone by all ready.

291
00:18:04.138 --> 00:18:05.938
The steward, Ms. Tsumagari

292
00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:09.838
was originally working at Uncle Kyosuke's house.

293
00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:13.038
But, 30 years ago after that robbery,

294
00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:15.038
when Danjiro and his wife passed away,

295
00:18:15.038 --> 00:18:16.738
and Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind

296
00:18:16.738 --> 00:18:18.738
took after the Haga family name,

297
00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:20.638
we had Ms. Tsumagari come to work for us,

298
00:18:20.638 --> 00:18:22.438
and she's been with us since.

299
00:18:22.438 --> 00:18:26.038
Kyosuke's father was not the only one who passed away?

300
00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.138
No.

301
00:18:27.138 --> 00:18:31.538
His mother Chiha, was not a very healthy person to begin with,

302
00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:34.538
but she watched over her husband Danjiro without sleeping...

303
00:18:34.538 --> 00:18:38.238
As a result, she fell ill of extreme fatigue and...

304
00:18:38.238 --> 00:18:41.338
And, what about your mother, Hasuki?

305
00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:43.638
She got a divorce and went back to her parental home,

306
00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:47.038
just before Grandfather's birthday 2 years ago.

307
00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:51.938
That's why Great Aunty Eimi ended up playing for his birthday,

308
00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:54.238
since it was Grandfather's 70th birthday

309
00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:56.538
as well as to encourage Father.

310
00:18:56.538 --> 00:19:00.538
She was to play that Stradivarius that had been sealed for 30 years.

311
00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:02.438
That famed musical instrument was sealed?

312
00:19:02.438 --> 00:19:05.638
Yes. When Grandfather received it from Danjiro,

313
00:19:05.638 --> 00:19:08.238
he was very happy but...

314
00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:13.138
My father who borrowed it when he was 18 years old,

315
00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:14.438
and performed in a contest

316
00:19:14.438 --> 00:19:16.438
experienced the strings snapping apart twice on stage,

317
00:19:16.438 --> 00:19:18.338
and was disqualified.

318
00:19:18.338 --> 00:19:19.538
Yet, on another occasion,

319
00:19:19.538 --> 00:19:23.238
my aunt who was scheduled to perform on a certain TV program,

320
00:19:23.238 --> 00:19:27.138
came down with a high fever right before show time.

321
00:19:27.138 --> 00:19:30.138
And, Great Uncle Genzaburo, who was on his way to a concert abroad,

322
00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:33.038
came down with a serious case of tenosynovitis during practice.

323
00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:36.838
I see. I can see why you'd want to seal it.

324
00:19:36.838 --> 00:19:40.238
You think the violin's okay?

325
00:19:40.238 --> 00:19:42.838
It was left on the desk in the room as is.

326
00:19:44.638 --> 00:19:46.638
If this fire was a case of arson,

327
00:19:46.638 --> 00:19:48.538
it could've been taken during all this commotion.

328
00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:50.138
No, it wasn't.

329
00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:53.438
I put it back in the storage room right away.

330
00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:56.138
Or, do I look like an incompetent steward

331
00:19:56.138 --> 00:19:59.838
who would leave such a famed musical instrument unattended in a household

332
00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:01.738
where outsiders are walking around?

333
00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:03.738
Oh, well... No.

334
00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:06.038
Besides, the fire was not caused by arson,

335
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.238
but rather, smoking while sleeping.

336
00:20:08.238 --> 00:20:09.438
It seems that the area around the ashtray

337
00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:11.838
that was in that room is where the fire started,

338
00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:14.338
and the door was torn off with the key locked.

339
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.638
You're the one who broke it down, right?

340
00:20:16.638 --> 00:20:18.838
If so, the room was locked

341
00:20:18.838 --> 00:20:20.438
and arson would be impossible.

342
00:20:20.438 --> 00:20:22.138
Oh, is that right.

343
00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:25.838
Well, please be extremely careful when smoking.

344
00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:28.738
It's best not to smoke though.

345
00:20:28.738 --> 00:20:30.838
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:20:32.138 --> 00:20:34.938
But, even if everything were to be a coincidence,

347
00:20:34.938 --> 00:20:36.438
it sure is frightening.

348
00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:37.638
To think that something would happen

349
00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:39.038
on the same day for three consecutive years.

350
00:20:39.038 --> 00:20:40.438
Yes.

351
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:46.638
Including Kyosuke's father who died in the robbery 30 years ago,

352
00:20:46.638 --> 00:20:48.738
it comes up to a total of four all together.

353
00:20:48.738 --> 00:20:49.938
Taking this into consideration,

354
00:20:49.938 --> 00:20:55.538
I think you should stop celebrating Choichiro's birthday from next year.

355
00:20:55.538 --> 00:20:58.238
I tell you, he's already smoking.

356
00:20:58.238 --> 00:21:00.938
Well, it'll turn out that way anyway,

357
00:21:00.938 --> 00:21:02.738
because Uncle has bad lungs

358
00:21:02.738 --> 00:21:05.838
and has only a half a year to live.

359
00:21:05.838 --> 00:21:07.338
Really?

360
00:21:07.338 --> 00:21:11.638
Yes. I wanted to at least celebrate today with him.

361
00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:13.438
We can't anymore,

362
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.238
because he's already gone to bed.

363
00:21:16.238 --> 00:21:19.638
The Mrs. has already been treated and has also gone to bed.

364
00:21:19.638 --> 00:21:23.338
So, since this doesn't seem to be a case or anything,

365
00:21:23.338 --> 00:21:25.338
we'll start off home too.

366
00:21:31.938 --> 00:21:34.538
Who's cigarette butt is this?

367
00:21:34.538 --> 00:21:37.438
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

368
00:21:37.438 --> 00:21:39.538
That brand is the one...

369
00:21:39.538 --> 00:21:41.938
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

370
00:21:41.938 --> 00:21:43.338
Come to think of it,

371
00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:46.738
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

372
00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.538
If so, then...

373
00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:49.838
this is...

374
00:21:53.738 --> 00:21:54.838
Conan?

375
00:21:58.038 --> 00:22:00.438
Kid, where do you think you're going?

376
00:22:16.038 --> 00:22:17.738
Just as I thought.

377
00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:24.838
This is not an accident, but murder.

378
00:22:24.838 --> 00:22:27.938
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

379
00:22:27.938 --> 00:22:29.938
the next target is...

380
00:23:58.438 --> 00:24:02.838
"Next Episode"

381
00:24:02.838 --> 00:24:06.338
This could be a serial murder case.

382
00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:08.538
What?

383
00:24:08.538 --> 00:24:09.938
Wait!

384
00:24:09.938 --> 00:24:12.238
D-E-F-G...

385
00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:16.038
then the next target is Hasuki with the initial H.

386
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:19.138
Oh no! She shouldn't be left alone!

387
00:24:22.838 --> 00:24:24.438
Next Conan,

388
00:24:24.438 --> 00:24:28.338
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Interlude!"

389
00:24:29.165 --> 00:24:31.665
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:31.665 --> 00:24:33.665
"Initial"

391
00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:36.065
-Conan, I'm sure the murderer is the mother. -Why do you say that?

392
00:24:36.065 --> 00:24:38.269
I'm certain it's mother and child.
