1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.400
The world's largest conch pearl, Fairy Lip.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.610
In order to face off against
Kid, whose target is the jewel,

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.160
Hattori and I came to Suzuki
Jirokichi's Suzuki Museum.

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.280
Also there to take on Kid was
Inspector Morofushi Takaaki

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.840
of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.180
But despite that,

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.920
Kid was able to steal the pearl
frozen inside a block of ice.

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.920
Find the question that solves the mystery!

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.960
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

10
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.980
Both Kid and Heiji are targeting lips!

11
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.200
Where will the missing jewel
and their love end up?

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.810
Always determining the one truth

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.640
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.200
his name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:33.468
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part Two)

16
00:02:33.468 --> 00:02:37.638
"Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips, Part Two!"
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part Two)

17
00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:38.968
Kid vs. Komei: The Targeted Lips
(Part Two)

18
00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:41.718
The fairy's lips are mine
Kaito Kid

19
00:02:41.718 --> 00:02:42.478
Damn it!

20
00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:45.848
I knew the ice wasn't enough to keep it safe!

21
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:47.228
But what are all these rings?

22
00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:50.228
The fairy's lips are mine
Kaito Kid
But what are all these rings?

23
00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.108
It's a floral ice performance.

24
00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:54.028
What?

25
00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:56.908
It's an art that involves drilling
holes with an electric drill

26
00:02:57.228 --> 00:02:59.738
and using food coloring to stain the ice

27
00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:04.908
to make it appear as though there
are real flowers inside the ice.

28
00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:09.168
Kid simply used that method to
create rings instead of flowers,

29
00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:13.668
with unimaginable speed,
in order to throw us off.

30
00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:17.608
But this room was pitch black.

31
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:18.928
How did he do it?

32
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.808
You guys inside didn't see anything?

33
00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:23.018
Nah.

34
00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:25.828
Like the old man said, it was pitch black.

35
00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:26.598
Yeah.

36
00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:29.308
Maybe he went under the sheet.

37
00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:33.818
The clear sheet over the ice
was stained black by the ink.

38
00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:38.398
He could've drilled the holes by
slipping inside and turning on a light.

39
00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:42.828
There are tools next to the
ice, so that must've been it.

40
00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:44.098
I see.

41
00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:46.098
That would allow him to
secretly drill the holes.

42
00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:47.208
You're right.

43
00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:50.338
Since the light couldn't
get out, we didn't notice.

44
00:03:50.588 --> 00:03:52.548
I've had enough of this farce.

45
00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:53.338
What?

46
00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:56.088
You're the only ones who entered this room.

47
00:03:56.088 --> 00:04:00.088
I know one of you is Kid!

48
00:04:00.398 --> 00:04:03.138
You're going to be stripped
and thoroughly searched.

49
00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:04.098
Prepare yourselves!

50
00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:05.598
B-But...

51
00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:07.888
Help, Heiji!

52
00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:13.778
He's going to strip me naked!

53
00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:16.528
I-I wouldn't want you to be naked...

54
00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:17.868
I know.

55
00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:21.248
What about the sensor inside the ring?

56
00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:24.818
If someone exits through
those doors with the ring,

57
00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:26.538
the sensor triggers an alarm, right?

58
00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:27.788
That's right.

59
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:33.418
Then wait to search us until
after the alarm has sounded.

60
00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:34.298
Good thinking, Heiji!

61
00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.548
We're leaving the room, okay?

62
00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:44.058
If the alarm goes off,
I'm arresting both of you.

63
00:04:44.318 --> 00:04:46.188
Fine by me.

64
00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.308
No...

65
00:04:58.308 --> 00:04:59.388
Impossible!

66
00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:01.358
Then how did he...?

67
00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:03.118
How did he get the ring outside?

68
00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:06.238
Heiji, thanks!

69
00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.618
G-Get off of me.

70
00:05:08.388 --> 00:05:10.038
Kazuha-chan's being so bold.

71
00:05:10.618 --> 00:05:15.188
I-In any case, this means
neither of us are Kid.

72
00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:16.558
Yeah.

73
00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:19.468
This guy is too easy!

74
00:05:19.888 --> 00:05:21.968
F-Fine...

75
00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:24.508
Time to finish this off.

76
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.618
Oh, no!

77
00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:33.348
Because of the commotion over Kid, I forgot
to get my phone from the glass box.

78
00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:34.858
You're hopeless.

79
00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:36.958
Hey, Inspector.

80
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.478
Is her phone over there somewhere?

81
00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:41.648
Jeez...

82
00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:43.738
Is this it?

83
00:05:44.108 --> 00:05:45.588
Thanks.

84
00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:46.648
Here.

85
00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:49.158
So cold.

86
00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:51.458
It really is too cold in here.

87
00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:53.708
The AC is too cold.

88
00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:56.568
Hey, the ring's already been stolen.

89
00:05:56.568 --> 00:05:58.438
We don't need the ice anymore.

90
00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:00.228
Tell them to turn off the AC.

91
00:06:00.228 --> 00:06:00.968
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:04.468
We need to start collecting fingerprints.

93
00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:10.668
But, Inspector, we still don't
know how Kid stole the ring.

94
00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:13.808
Should we really melt the ice?

95
00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:15.608
Right, Inspector Morofushi?

96
00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.538
Don't you agree?

97
00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:22.738
No. Let's abandon the ice since
Kid managed to get around it.

98
00:06:23.188 --> 00:06:26.018
For now, we should search
every inch of this room

99
00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:30.238
to determine how he entered
and where he went.

100
00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:32.618
If you say so...

101
00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:34.758
All right. It's perfect.

102
00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:36.038
Hey, Kazuha-neechan.

103
00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:39.128
Do you need to use the bathroom?

104
00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:42.798
You've been keeping your knees together
and crouching this whole time.

105
00:06:42.998 --> 00:06:46.888
Th-That's right. I'm a
little cold from the AC.

106
00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:49.648
Hey, you shouldn't ask girls that.

107
00:06:49.648 --> 00:06:52.468
If you're going to the
bathroom, I'll go with you.

108
00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:55.308
I want to wash this ink off my face.

109
00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:57.108
Y-Yeah.

110
00:06:57.108 --> 00:06:58.558
In that case, see you later.

111
00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:03.438
But now that the jewel has been stolen,

112
00:07:03.608 --> 00:07:03.858
Torigoe Naeji (45)
Gemstone Broker

113
00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:06.828
I'm going to take what's mine.
Torigoe Naeji (45)
Gemstone Broker

114
00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:07.028
Torigoe Naeji (45)
Gemstone Broker

115
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.698
The substantial compensation I'm owed.

116
00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:12.028
I know.

117
00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:20.168
Kansuke-kun, why are you calling so late?

118
00:07:20.338 --> 00:07:20.408
Nagano Prefectural Police HQ

119
00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:22.418
Don't give me that!
Nagano Prefectural Police HQ

120
00:07:22.418 --> 00:07:28.648
Komei, you said you'd call once you
caught that Kaito whatever thief.

121
00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.248
It's way past when he said he'd come.

122
00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:32.888
Why haven't you called?

123
00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:33.808
That's right.

124
00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:37.048
Everyone's waiting at the station for you.

125
00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:39.438
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:45.108
The thief left a card saying "the
jewel is mine" and vanished.

127
00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:47.768
Seriously? He beat you?

128
00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.088
What?!

129
00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:52.118
You don't seem very disappointed, though.

130
00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:59.378
"A commander neither delights in
victory nor despairs in defeat."

131
00:08:00.018 --> 00:08:01.948
A commander does not become
overjoyed when he wins,

132
00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.388
nor does he become dejected when he loses.

133
00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:07.378
More sayings?

134
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.908
Besides, this battle isn't over yet.

135
00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:14.698
More importantly, what
about that other thing?

136
00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:17.148
What about the package
really addressed to you?

137
00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:20.018
I'm planning on picking it up tomorrow.

138
00:08:20.478 --> 00:08:23.098
I suppose it's already tomorrow
since it's past midnight.

139
00:08:23.098 --> 00:08:27.598
But you don't remember
the name of the officer

140
00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:29.428
who left the envelope in your locker, right?

141
00:08:29.428 --> 00:08:32.798
No, but despite being rather blurry,

142
00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:36.488
the name written on the
note stuck to the envelope

143
00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:39.288
could be read as my mine.

144
00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:42.418
But do you know anyone in Tokyo?

145
00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.298
Didn't you have a younger brother at the MPD?

146
00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:47.378
Yes.

147
00:08:47.378 --> 00:08:52.298
Perhaps my brother knows the
officer who had the package.

148
00:08:52.518 --> 00:08:56.258
Why don't you have your
brother check it out, then?

149
00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:58.718
He left the force a long time ago.

150
00:08:58.718 --> 00:09:03.038
I haven't heard anything from him
since he said he found another job.

151
00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:09.428
I have no idea where he
is or what he's doing now.

152
00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:15.948
Well, since Kid already came and
left, let's take a taxi home.

153
00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:16.868
What?

154
00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:18.868
Taking a taxi would be a waste.

155
00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:22.038
But there's still about four hours
before the trains start running.

156
00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:26.858
Then let's take a nap in
the museum somewhere.

157
00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.098
Yeah.

158
00:09:28.098 --> 00:09:31.298
I'll go ask Jirokichi-san.

159
00:09:31.298 --> 00:09:33.428
I'll go with you.

160
00:09:34.848 --> 00:09:37.888
Despite everything, those two sure are close.

161
00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:38.808
I know.

162
00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:42.768
No, Heiji-niichan's sticking
by her so she doesn't escape.

163
00:09:42.768 --> 00:09:44.188
Escape?

164
00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:48.068
That Kazuha-neechan is actually Kaito Kid.

165
00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:51.488
What?!

166
00:09:51.488 --> 00:09:52.448
Seriously?

167
00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.438
I'm sure of it.

168
00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:58.068
She's been bending her knees this whole time,

169
00:09:58.068 --> 00:10:01.998
and the real Kazuha-neechan
refers to herself as "atashi,"

170
00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:04.958
but that one calls herself "uchi."

171
00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:07.688
He's right.

172
00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:10.718
Then why is he still here?

173
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:15.138
There's only one possible reason.

174
00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:21.478
It's so soft.

175
00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:25.478
I bet you could sleep soundly on this couch.

176
00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:26.848
You're right.

177
00:10:26.848 --> 00:10:29.128
Then let's go get Ran-chan and the others.

178
00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.478
But I don't like AC units.

179
00:10:31.478 --> 00:10:33.488
I doubt I can sleep without a fan.

180
00:10:34.018 --> 00:10:37.708
If you can't sleep, I'll sleep next to you.

181
00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:39.788
Wh-What are you talking about?

182
00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:41.728
Just kidding.

183
00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:43.708
That would make it harder to sleep.

184
00:11:04.908 --> 00:11:06.908
Enough already.

185
00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:11.028
Everything you've been saying is ridiculous.

186
00:11:11.368 --> 00:11:12.148
What?

187
00:11:12.668 --> 00:11:14.608
Looks like I'll have to cover
that ridiculous mouth...

188
00:11:15.148 --> 00:11:18.528
in order to keep you quiet.

189
00:11:18.818 --> 00:11:20.028
What?

190
00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

191
00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.628
Wait!

192
00:11:27.098 --> 00:11:28.158
Wait!

193
00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:32.018
Wait!

194
00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.685
Looks like I'll have to cover
that ridiculous mouth...

195
00:11:44.185 --> 00:11:48.445
in order to keep you quiet.

196
00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:49.945
Whoa.

197
00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:51.445
Whoa.

198
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:52.945
Whoa!

199
00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:54.695
Wait...

200
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:56.195
Wait!

201
00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:59.365
Wait!

202
00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:03.235
Wha...

203
00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:08.445
Wh-What's all the noise for?

204
00:12:09.035 --> 00:12:10.855
Y-You surprised us.

205
00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:15.925
W-We came in a hurry since we were so sleepy.

206
00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.795
That was close.

207
00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:23.185
I can't believe Hattori hasn't
noticed that's Kid in disguise.

208
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:26.415
Come to think of it, he did
become a crap detective

209
00:12:26.415 --> 00:12:30.315
when Kazuha-chan got involved at
Ebisubashi Bridge in Osaka.

210
00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.195
Hey, this room is pretty big.

211
00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:36.945
There's even a soft couch.

212
00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:40.995
I wouldn't mind sleeping in here until noon.

213
00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:43.905
After all, I am the Sleeping Kogoro.

214
00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:46.495
Seriously?

215
00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.645
It's been about four hours since then.

216
00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:09.375
Should be ready soon.

217
00:13:13.155 --> 00:13:16.925
Hey, it's melted quite a bit.

218
00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:19.695
I was worried since it was
around three meters tall,

219
00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:22.325
but it has been hot lately.

220
00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.965
I'm going to go make my report.

221
00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:27.035
Is something the matter?

222
00:13:27.485 --> 00:13:31.545
I seem to have dropped a
contact inside the glass box.

223
00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:34.135
Could I go in and get it?

224
00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:35.445
Sure.

225
00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:36.655
Thanks.

226
00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:39.605
The floor is wet from the
melted ice, so be careful.

227
00:13:39.605 --> 00:13:40.805
Okay.

228
00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:44.805
Where was it?

229
00:13:46.215 --> 00:13:47.765
Let's see.

230
00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:52.895
All right!

231
00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:59.655
The world's largest pearl is mine!

232
00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:04.705
"One hundred saw-wings are
no match for one raptor."

233
00:14:04.905 --> 00:14:06.075
Wh-What?

234
00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:08.585
Saw-wings refers to sparrows,

235
00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.205
and the raptor refers to the hawk.

236
00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:14.185
In other words, even if a
hundred swallows come together,

237
00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:17.175
they cannot defeat a single hawk.

238
00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:19.425
It seems you attempted to throw us off

239
00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:23.035
by making countless rings appear in the ice,

240
00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:26.255
and drilled a large hole through the middle

241
00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:31.295
to make us believe you'd
stolen the real ring.

242
00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:34.055
But you can't fool my eyes.

243
00:14:34.765 --> 00:14:41.365
One hundred fake rings can't compare
to the beauty of a true conch pearl.

244
00:14:41.635 --> 00:14:42.955
I see.

245
00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:46.245
You knew, so you were
waiting to see what I'd do.

246
00:14:46.525 --> 00:14:47.475
Yes.

247
00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:51.335
I thought I'd try to catch you in the act.

248
00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:56.965
Then naturally, you knew
this was my disguise.

249
00:14:57.235 --> 00:14:58.195
Of course.

250
00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:01.635
Your first person pronoun switched
from "atashi" to "uchi,"

251
00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.865
and you were crouching to
make yourself appear shorter.

252
00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:08.315
The rest of you noticed as well, right?

253
00:15:08.315 --> 00:15:08.955
Uh...

254
00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:09.605
Yeah...

255
00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:10.085
Of—

256
00:15:10.085 --> 00:15:11.105
Of course!

257
00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:13.185
Seriously?

258
00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:15.645
But if you knew all that,

259
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.905
you should've retrieved the real ring.

260
00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:26.075
It's all white this time.

261
00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:28.655
Don't panic. It's just a smoke screen.

262
00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:31.295
We can vent all the smoke.

263
00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:35.085
Since the entrance is sealed, he'll
be caught like a rat in a trap.

264
00:15:36.695 --> 00:15:38.675
The smoke is clearing, and...

265
00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:41.025
What's that hole?

266
00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:42.095
When did that get there?

267
00:15:42.365 --> 00:15:45.055
So that's his escape route.

268
00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:46.895
You knew?

269
00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:50.285
Yes, but I chose to ignore it.

270
00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:55.605
I heard Kaito Kid returns the jewel to
its owner if it's not the one he wants.

271
00:15:55.765 --> 00:16:00.295
Ah, then it'll be returned to me later.

272
00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:05.175
If you're the real owner of the jewel.

273
00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:06.315
What?

274
00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:08.395
Didn't you say the pearl was
found inside a giant oyster

275
00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:13.615
sleeping at the bottom of
Mie Prefecture's Ago Bay,

276
00:16:13.615 --> 00:16:17.755
and that you were drawn to the
pearl's unique orient effect?

277
00:16:18.065 --> 00:16:19.565
Y-Yeah.

278
00:16:19.565 --> 00:16:20.625
But real conch pearls are only
harvested from pink conches

279
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:25.085
Gulf of Mexico
Caribbean Sea
But real conch pearls are only
harvested from pink conches

280
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.105
in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.
Caribbean Sea
Gulf of Mexico

281
00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:27.135
Gulf of Mexico
in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.

282
00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:27.195
in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea.

283
00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:30.635
And it's not the rainbow "orient
effect" that defines conch pearls,

284
00:16:30.815 --> 00:16:35.225
it's their beautiful "flame
pattern" wavy lines.

285
00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:37.115
In other words,

286
00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:41.315
you're not the real owner of that jewel.

287
00:16:41.665 --> 00:16:42.315
It belongs to that girl who said her
grandfather received it as a gift

288

290
00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:48.195
from a wealthy Caribbean man.

291
00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:52.215
You can tell us all about it later.

292
00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:54.455
Oh, um, actually...

293
00:16:54.955 --> 00:16:59.925
You noticed that gemstone
broker was suspicious, too?

294
00:16:59.925 --> 00:17:03.955
Yeah, at least I noticed this
one was fake right away.

295
00:17:03.955 --> 00:17:06.795
What do you mean, "this one?"

296
00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:12.725
Heiji, are you saying you didn't
notice Kid was disguised as me?

297
00:17:13.175 --> 00:17:14.055
Y-You idiot!

298
00:17:14.055 --> 00:17:16.915
I noticed right away, but I was
waiting to see what he'd do!

299
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:18.355
Tell me, then!

300
00:17:18.595 --> 00:17:20.275
What was different?

301
00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:22.875
I-It was...

302
00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:25.275
What?

303
00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:27.525
Th-The seaweed!

304
00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:31.355
The fake Kazuha didn't have
any seaweed in her teeth!

305
00:17:32.765 --> 00:17:35.035
Ran-chan, I knew it was seaweed!

306
00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:39.975
A-Anyway, I wonder where that thief went.

307
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:44.545
It's likely he sped things up because
he was suspicious of the jewel's owner,

308
00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:47.045
so he's probably...

309
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.555
I'm sorry, Grandma.

310
00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:55.555
I wish you could've taken the jewel you
got from grandpa to heaven with you.

311
00:17:55.905 --> 00:17:57.645
But I couldn't get it back.

312
00:17:58.225 --> 00:18:00.955
I wish I'd asked you more
about that pink pearl

313
00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.705
while you were alive.

314
00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:06.995
Exactly 50 years ago,

315
00:18:06.995 --> 00:18:10.745
while a wealthy Caribbean man was
traveling around the world by boat,

316
00:18:10.745 --> 00:18:15.575
his pregnant wife suddenly went into labor.

317
00:18:16.155 --> 00:18:19.355
By chance, your grandfather who was a surgeon

318
00:18:19.355 --> 00:18:21.835
happened to be on that same
boat on his honeymoon.

319
00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:23.925
Though it wasn't his specialty,

320
00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:27.585
he used his medical knowledge
to help with the birth

321
00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:32.685
And it was with gratitude
that the Caribbean man

322
00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.975
gave this Fairy Lip to your grandfather.

323
00:18:35.735 --> 00:18:37.595
Yamamoto Moena-san.

324
00:18:38.745 --> 00:18:39.975
Y-You're...

325
00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:42.325
Kaito Kid!

326
00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:49.515
The details of the event were written
on the son's blog in Spanish.

327
00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:54.745
That broker probably plotted to
steal your jewel after reading it.

328
00:18:55.155 --> 00:19:01.245
Unfortunately, this jewel doesn't
seem to have been the one I wanted.

329
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:06.955
May I add a touch of color to your
grandmother's cruise through the afterlife?

330
00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:15.095
Yes.

331
00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:20.875
Of course.

332
00:20:44.115 --> 00:20:47.725
What? A package was found
in Date-san's locker?

333
00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:49.215
Yeah.

334
00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:53.005
To be precise, inside the
package sent to Date-san

335
00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:58.115
was an envelope with a note asking that
it be sent to an inspector in Nagano.

336
00:20:58.855 --> 00:21:03.575
We'd left there it since he passed away
in a traffic accident one year ago.

337
00:21:04.005 --> 00:21:07.625
The writing on the note had bled,
so it was pretty hard to read.

338
00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:12.985
Was the sender's name blurry, too?

339
00:21:12.985 --> 00:21:14.755
There wasn't one written.

340
00:21:15.215 --> 00:21:17.555
Look, there's only a circle.

341
00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:21.575
I can't believe it was left in
his locker for a whole year.

342
00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:23.545
I can.

343
00:21:23.545 --> 00:21:28.025
It was stuffed full of things he
should've thrown out like photos

344
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:29.565
and things from his police academy days.

345
00:21:29.715 --> 00:21:30.705
Huh?

346
00:21:30.705 --> 00:21:34.815
Sato-san, you don't have good
memories of the police academy?

347
00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:37.675
Of course not.

348
00:21:37.675 --> 00:21:42.625
Because Date-san and his
class were so unruly,

349
00:21:42.625 --> 00:21:47.625
they were unbelievably
strict on my class only.

350
00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:51.005
Matsuda-kun was in that class, too.

351
00:21:51.605 --> 00:21:55.445
Come to think of it, weren't Date-san
and Matsuda-san in the same class?

352
00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:57.925
Why do you only refer to
Matsuda-san as Matsuda-kun?

353
00:21:58.255 --> 00:22:03.685
Because unlike Date-san, I became a
police officer before Matsuda-kun.

354
00:22:04.215 --> 00:22:05.305
Is there a problem?

355
00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:07.375
No.

356
00:22:09.435 --> 00:22:11.185
This is the envelope.

357
00:22:11.435 --> 00:22:14.035
You're sure it's addressed to you?

358
00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:14.815
Yes.

359
00:22:15.245 --> 00:22:16.665
It is surely addressed to me.

360
00:22:16.665 --> 00:22:19.045
Then let's check its contents.

361
00:22:19.045 --> 00:22:19.695
All right.

362
00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:23.435
This...

363
00:22:24.805 --> 00:22:26.205
It's a phone.

364
00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:28.705
There's a hole through the middle, though.

365
00:22:29.075 --> 00:22:30.475
That's definitely a hole.

366
00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:32.355
What's it from?

367
00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:35.965
There's a black stain around
the inside of the hole,

368
00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:41.045
and on the back is a uniquely written
H made to look like a scratch.

369
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:46.725
"With life comes death, and life is short."

370
00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:47.905
What?

371
00:22:47.905 --> 00:22:50.085
"People cannot avoid death."

372
00:22:50.085 --> 00:22:53.015
"Our short lives are destined to end."

373
00:22:53.015 --> 00:22:56.105
It's what a Chinese general once said.

374
00:22:56.965 --> 00:22:59.375
This phone belonged to my younger brother.

375
00:22:59.835 --> 00:23:04.115
He said he quit the force,
but if this was delivered here,

376
00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:06.955
then he was probably working
for the Public Security Agency

377
00:23:06.955 --> 00:23:09.865
and lost his life while working undercover.

378
00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:13.895
After all, this is probably a bullet hole,
and this black stain is probably blood.

379
00:23:15.505 --> 00:23:16.815
Right?

380
00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:19.145
Morofushi Takaaki-sama

381
00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:20.135
Bro,
starting today,
I'm a cop too!

382
00:23:20.995 --> 00:23:22.065
Hiromitsu...

383
00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:24.715
Metropolitan Police Department

384
00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:27.655
Thank you for today.

385
00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:29.565
Not at all. Thank you for coming.

386
00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:39.355
Bro!

387
00:23:40.145 --> 00:23:42.865
I made a friend in Tokyo.

388
00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:45.595
His nickname is Zero.

389
00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.655
Pretty cool, right?
