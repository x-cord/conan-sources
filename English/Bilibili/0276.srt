1
00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:05.724
Officer Takagi made a mistake.

4
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:07.724
The Youth Detective Squad to the rescue.

5
00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.324
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:11.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.924
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.011
Hey, everyone! Something has happened!

9
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.311
What? Officer Takagi?

10
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:12.011
Where is he now?

11
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:13.311
He's over there in that park.

12
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.711
Yes, really he's trying desperately to find something.

13
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.711
Is he finding evidence of a case?

14
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:42.511
No, he isn't, because he isn't wearing gloves.

15
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.611
I got it. I've got what he's looking for.

16
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.311
-What? -What?

17
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:49.911
That should be here somewhere.

18
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:51.911
It cannot be anywhere but here.

19
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.311
It's you...

20
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:57.411
We're ready to help you.

21
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.011
Well, you'd do the same for us if we were in trouble.

22
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.711
I know, I know.

23
00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:04.011
You lost something like this, right?

24
00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:06.211
How do you know about it?

25
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.411
Don't you know we're the Youth Detective Squad?

26
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:12.111
I can see everything you are doing.

27
00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:13.611
If you don't find it,

28
00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:14.811
you're in big trouble, aren't you?

29
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:16.611
Of course I am.

30
00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.311
It comes second only to a police life. It is very important.

31
00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:24.211
What you lost is...

32
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:26.211
Maybe not your purse, but...

33
00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:30.011
You lost your police notebook?

34
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.211
Don't speak so loud.

35
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:36.211
This is no good at all.

36
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:43.211
"The Policeman's Missing Notebook Case"

37
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.411
This morning I realized that I had lost my notebook.

38
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:50.511
And I looked through my room but couldn't find it.

39
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:53.811
Are you sure you were carrying it on your duty yesterday?

40
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:56.111
Yes, I'm sure.

41
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.611
And then, on the way home,

42
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:01.511
I happened to pass in front of this park.

43
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.511
Shut your mouth! You, liar!

44
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.011
Hey, cut it out!

45
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.011
What're you doing?

46
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:12.111
Cheat. I ought to blow you away here and now.

47
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.111
-Help. I'm choking. -Hey, hey! Hold on, you guys!

48
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.411
Break it up, you two.

49
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:19.111
Step off! Don't mess with me!

50
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:20.311
I'm a police officer

51
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:21.811
and am telling you to stop fighting right now!

52
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:28.011
I must have lost it then.

53
00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.611
So, you're looking for it around here.

54
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:34.211
Do you think that maybe one of them picked up the notebook?

55
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.411
That's right.

56
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:38.911
I think that's very likely.

57
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.311
So, do you remember those two men's names?

58
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.411
Or what about their addresses?

59
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.511
Wait, calm down.

60
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.311
Why can't you believe me, Hanzaki?

61
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:55.211
Hanzaki.

62
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.611
The younger one's name was Hanzaki.

63
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:00.011
Anything else you remember about them?

64
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:03.711
How can I believe you?

65
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:06.811
I'm going to tell you, my manager, that I'm still a struggling singer

66
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:08.911
because all those jobs that you got were always crap for me!

67
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:10.911
The truth is that you have to pay your dues

68
00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.311
in Enka (Japanese Ballad) business. You know that!

69
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.511
Have a little more patience, please.

70
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.411
How many times are you going to say that?

71
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:21.211
I know you've deceived me for a long time.

72
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:23.111
Give me back my time up to now

73
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.111
and the money you owe me, you punk!

74
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:28.711
Hey, hey! Hold on, you guys!

75
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.711
So, he's a struggling singer.

76
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.711
Don't you remember what kind of shoes they were wearing?

77
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.011
That reminds me...

78
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.911
The man named Hanzaki was wearing sandals.

79
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:46.411
I see.

80
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.711
Perhaps he lives nearby.

81
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.211
Yeah. Okay, then.

82
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:54.211
Let's look for him together.

83
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:58.011
But what if that man hasn't picked it up?

84
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.211
Why don't we divide into teams of two?

85
00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:02.711
One is to go find the man named Hanzaki,

86
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:05.111
and the other is to look for the notebook in this park.

87
00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:06.611
Alright!

88
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:08.811
Four One-Two-Three. Go.

89
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:12.011
Sorry to leave you here. Hang on, see you.

90
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.211
No good, there is no name of that person.

91
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:22.911
What about asking the record companies?

92
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.611
I'm afraid that's impossible.

93
00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:27.711
There're an awful lot of big and small record companies.

94
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.911
Okay, then we've got to go around asking one by one.

95
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:35.011
Excuse me, but do you know the man named Hanzaki?

96
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:37.711
He is a singer and supposed to live around here somewhere.

97
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:40.011
Pardon me, sir.

98
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:44.011
The police handbook.

99
00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:46.411
Yeah. That's right.

100
00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:50.511
I wonder what if he can't find it.

101
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.811
Perhaps he is in a pathetic state.

102
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.711
Idiot!

103
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:56.211
You lost your police notebook, which is supposed to be

104
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.111
an extension of a police officer's soul and mind?

105
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:00.311
Get out! You're fired!

106
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:02.511
Officer Takagi... What a real pity.

107
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.511
Hey, you!

108
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:07.811
This is not the time for a snack. Help me, you two.

109
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:08.811
Sorry.

110
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:10.811
They came back.

111
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:15.511
Hey, how did it go? Did you find the man?

112
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:16.611
No, we didn't.

113
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:19.911
We can't find him by name and looks.

114
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.011
We can't find it either.

115
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:23.711
Hey, Officer?

116
00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:28.011
"Jiro Hanzaki (30), Enka Singer" -What're you doing here?

117
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:31.111
You are here!

118
00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:32.611
You, yesterday...

119
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:36.011
I'm sorry for the trouble last night.

120
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:38.711
So is this the man everyone is talking about?

121
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:40.511
-Mr. Hanzaki! -Mr. Hanzaki!

122
00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:42.611
Why now?

123
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:45.011
I just wish you had walked by earlier than you actually did.

124
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:48.911
Mr. Hanzaki, did you pick up anything last night?

125
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:50.711
My stuff... like this.

126
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:53.911
No, I didn't.

127
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.711
Perhaps neither did the manager, I think.

128
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.911
Okay, you didn't.

129
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.911
You lost your thing like this, right?

130
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:03.111
I am going to find it with you.

131
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:06.711
Thanks but you don't have to do that.

132
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:09.311
Just want to repay you for your kindness.

133
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.111
Last night, thanks to you,

134
00:08:11.111 --> 00:08:14.311
the manager and I could get back together soon.

135
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:18.311
So, today, we were supposed to have a lunch meeting together, but...

136
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:23.011
I was waiting for him at my apartment, but he didn't come.

137
00:08:23.011 --> 00:08:27.811
I guess he is getting drunk at his house, by now. He always boozes.

138
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:30.311
You know. That's the trouble.

139
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:38.611
I called him several times but the manager didn't pick up the phone.

140
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:41.911
That means he is now falling down drunk at his house.

141
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:43.011
I assure you.

142
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:45.111
If you think he doesn't show up no matter how long you wait,

143
00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:47.911
then why don't you go to his house yourself?

144
00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:50.211
Because it takes one and a half hour

145
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.011
to get to the manager's house even if I drive at top speed.

146
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.811
I think that's a bother.

147
00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:58.511
Something is attached to you.

148
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:04.011
It's a shampoo.

149
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.911
A little while ago when I cleaned my bathroom,

150
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.711
I accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle.

151
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.211
By the way, do you have the time, Officer?

152
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.211
1:00 pm. It's just 1:00 pm.

153
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:21.511
It's already 1:00 pm?

154
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.211
We'd better hurry and find it.

155
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:26.011
All right already. You don't have to help me anymore.

156
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:27.211
But...

157
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:31.211
So then, let me buy your lunch, please?

158
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:33.211
Just 2,000 yen and all you can eat for two hours!

159
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.211
Come on, come on.

160
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:37.811
No thanks, I'll pass on that one.

161
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:41.911
I understand but you don't have to be so modest.

162
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:46.111
All right, I'll eat as much as I can for two hours!

163
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:47.911
See you, Officer.

164
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:51.511
-What a strange man. -He's too weird.

165
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.911
If they hadn't picked it up,

166
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.711
then it must be still here somewhere.

167
00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:59.811
That man, Hanzaki... I suspect he's up to something,

168
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:01.011
Yeah.

169
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:05.011
I wonder why he bothered to ask what time it was.

170
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:10.411
Yeah, it's hard to think that someone in this neighborhood

171
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.111
doesn't know that clock.

172
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:16.711
Yet, he bothered to ask Officer Takagi, what time was it?

173
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:18.511
What for?

174
00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:19.611
I got it.

175
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:23.211
Have you found it?

176
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:26.911
No, not yet. I mean... it isn't about the notebook.

177
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:30.611
-All right. -Then what did you get?

178
00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:33.011
Everyone, gather around.

179
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:38.611
What? That man named Hanzaki killed the manager?

180
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.611
Mitsuhiko, are you sure?

181
00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:44.011
I'm 100 percent sure about it. And also he killed him just now.

182
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.011
Hanzaki seemed to think that he's still a struggling singer

183
00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:49.111
because of the manager and to hold a grudge against him for it.

184
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.911
So far as I know now, he has a motive.

185
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:52.011
But...

186
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:55.011
The droplet of shampoo clung the bottom of his trousers, right?

187
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.211
Yeah, he said, he accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle

188
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:58.811
while cleaning his bathroom.

189
00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.311
First of all, I wondered why he lied about it.

190
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:02.511
Did he lie?

191
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:05.511
It goes without saying that you should roll up your pants

192
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:08.811
so as not to get it wet while cleaning your bathroom.

193
00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:10.411
And if he rolled up his pants,

194
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:13.811
the shampoo shouldn't stick to the bottom of it.

195
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:17.711
That is, he was not cleaning his bathroom,

196
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:21.211
but he was in the bathroom for another purpose.

197
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:23.411
Wait a second, Mitsuhiko.

198
00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:25.211
And then?

199
00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:29.211
This morning, Mr. Hanzaki called the manager to come to his apartment,

200
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.611
saying that he wanted to make up with him.

201
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.011
That's enough.

202
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:37.911
I can't drink that much.

203
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:46.511
He skilfully encouraged the manager, a heavy drinker to drink Sake.

204
00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:49.611
After waiting for the time to be right, at just before 1:00 pm.

205
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:52.211
He carried him to his apartment's bathroom

206
00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.111
and had him drown in the bathtub.

207
00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:56.811
Then he accidentally stepped on the shampoo bottle.

208
00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:02.611
And he dashed out of the apartment then came to the park,

209
00:12:02.611 --> 00:12:04.511
to set up his alibi.

210
00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:07.711
To set up his alibi?

211
00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:08.911
Yeah.

212
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:11.611
He's going to carry the body

213
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:14.311
out of his apartment in secret, perhaps tonight

214
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:18.911
and sink the body in the bathtub of the manager's house.

215
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:23.311
In doing this, the police will treat it

216
00:12:23.311 --> 00:12:25.411
as an accidental death

217
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.711
and even if they treat the case as a homicide,

218
00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:30.611
his estimated time of death

219
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.011
was around one this afternoon.

220
00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:35.611
Yes.

221
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:38.711
By the way, do you have the time, Officer?

222
00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:43.511
1:00 pm. It's just 1:00 pm.

223
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:47.711
At the time when the manager was supposed to be killed at home,

224
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:52.111
Hanzaki was here.

225
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:57.611
As the real police officer, Officer Takagi proves his alibi,

226
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.211
nobody doubts Mr. Hanzaki.

227
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.211
That's the perfect crime.

228
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:05.811
Well done, Mitsuhiko. Perfect reasoning.

229
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:08.811
I think it's far from perfect.

230
00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:11.311
Officer Takagi... What a pity.

231
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.411
He lost his police notebook

232
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:16.611
and he was even used to set up the murderer's alibi.

233
00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:22.411
Mitsuhiko, Did you say,

234
00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:23.911
"Everybody knows that he or she should roll up their pants

235
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:26.011
when cleaning the bathroom."

236
00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:28.111
That's just a matter of common sense all over the world.

237
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:32.111
Mr. Kogoro doesn't pull up his pants because he thinks it's a bother.

238
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.311
It's a...

239
00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:36.411
Incidentally Dr. Agasa also doesn't.

240
00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:39.411
That means there was a possibility

241
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:40.911
that he was really cleaning his bathroom.

242
00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:42.611
And Officer Takagi came here

243
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.711
to search for his police notebook

244
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:46.411
because he happened to lose it.

245
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:48.311
It's very difficult to suppose that Mr. Hanzaki relied on such a chance

246
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:51.211
to establish his important alibi. What do you think, Mitsuhiko?

247
00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:52.711
It's...

248
00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:54.911
Your guess was far off the mark.

249
00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:58.211
I won't take it.

250
00:13:58.211 --> 00:13:59.511
Ayumi.

251
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:02.011
Cut it out, Ayumi.

252
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:04.011
Because, I can never forgive that man.

253
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:08.411
That man tried to use such a nice guy, Officer Takagi.

254
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:11.511
But, my reasoning was wrong, so...

255
00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:16.411
What does that mean anyway?

256
00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:17.511
What is what?

257
00:14:17.511 --> 00:14:19.111
Look at that.

258
00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:26.611
How strange...

259
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:28.711
He isn't eating anything yet.

260
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:30.411
Yeah, it's true.

261
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.311
Why?

262
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:36.311
That man... Is he still up to anything?

263
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.961
He's still not eating anything.

264
00:14:47.961 --> 00:14:49.261
That's a waste.

265
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:51.761
But he cares only about what time it is.

266
00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:52.861
Yeah.

267
00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:55.661
He's only watching the clock.

268
00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.961
How strange.

269
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:58.161
If he didn't get hungry,

270
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:02.061
why did he enter the All-you-can-eat-restaurant for two hours, at all?

271
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:03.661
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:15:03.661 --> 00:15:04.661
How come?

273
00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:08.761
I remember he said...

274
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:12.561
I am going to find that square thing with you.

275
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:15.661
So then, let me buy your lunch at that restaurant, please?

276
00:15:16.861 --> 00:15:20.961
He relentlessly tried to be with him.

277
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.761
So that explains it.

278
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.461
Mitsuhiko, your reasoning isn't entirely true but half true.

279
00:15:26.461 --> 00:15:27.861
What do you mean "half true"?

280
00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:32.861
As you suspected, that guy is trying to kill the manager.

281
00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:36.161
So, he entered this restaurant and is now passing himself off

282
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:37.561
as a customer in order to establish his alibi.

283
00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:39.961
To establish his alibi?

284
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:41.561
If Officer Takagi hadn't sent him away,

285
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:45.261
he would have wanted to establish an alibi

286
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:47.661
by continuing to find the police notebook.

287
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:51.361
But you said Officer Takagi happened to come to the park today.

288
00:15:51.361 --> 00:15:55.361
No. He knew Officer Takagi would be sure to come to find it,

289
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.161
perhaps because he picked it up last night.

290
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:01.361
You mean that man still has the notebook?

291
00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:05.161
No. Unfortunately I'm afraid he's already thrown it out.

292
00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:09.961
Yeah. There's no reason to keep such a dangerous thing around.

293
00:16:09.961 --> 00:16:11.461
I see.

294
00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:14.061
I said Mituhiko's reasoning was half correct.

295
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.261
What was wrong is the manager's death time.

296
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.461
The time isn't 1:00 pm, but even later,

297
00:16:18.461 --> 00:16:20.161
around from two to two thirty or so.

298
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.761
But, it's just past 1:00 pm.

299
00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:28.861
Yeah. The plot to kill the manager is now going on steadily.

300
00:16:28.861 --> 00:16:32.661
Perhaps in the bathroom of his apartment.

301
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:35.061
That's why he cares about the time like that.

302
00:16:50.161 --> 00:16:54.261
Anyway, it may not be too late now to save the manager's life.

303
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:56.661
-Yes! -But, wait, do you know

304
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.061
where is that guy's apartment?

305
00:16:58.061 --> 00:16:59.461
Oh, no.

306
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:02.961
He'll never tell us if we ask.

307
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.361
Let's split up and find it.

308
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:06.561
-Yeah! -Yeah!

309
00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:14.561
Even the Youth Detective Squad gave up on me.

310
00:17:14.561 --> 00:17:15.861
Oh, man..

311
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:32.161
That struggling singer.

312
00:17:32.161 --> 00:17:33.561
He's quite a character.

313
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.861
Last night, he was picking up concrete blocks there.

314
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:39.161
Whatever, but that's not what we want to know.

315
00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:41.361
Instead, where does he live?

316
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:44.561
Well, I have no idea.

317
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.261
Hanzaki. His name is Hanzaki.

318
00:17:46.261 --> 00:17:47.861
He's an Enka singer.

319
00:17:47.861 --> 00:17:50.361
He must be living around here.

320
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:53.161
Like I care. I don't like Enka at all.

321
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.661
-See you. -Hey! Wait!

322
00:17:57.161 --> 00:17:58.561
Let's go over there.

323
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.561
Yes.

324
00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:06.261
Hello, hello? Do you copy? We've got his address.

325
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:08.661
-Really? -Good!

326
00:18:08.661 --> 00:18:12.961
The second floor of the Park Side Height, third room. Over.

327
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:16.161
Roger. We'll be there soon.

328
00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:18.461
I'm going to get Officer Takagi.

329
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:19.561
Good idea.

330
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:21.461
Hopefully, if he can prevent the murder,

331
00:18:21.461 --> 00:18:25.261
it'll help to offset the blunder of losing his police notebook.

332
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:26.761
Yeah.

333
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:29.061
The shop owner said that Hanzaki bought a big block of ice

334
00:18:29.061 --> 00:18:31.561
at the store today.

335
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:34.561
And concrete blocks he picked up.

336
00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:37.161
I got it. I saw through his trick.

337
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:55.661
And only if Hanzaki leaves the body laying on the stairs,

338
00:18:55.661 --> 00:18:57.861
he can make it look like the manager himself

339
00:18:57.861 --> 00:18:59.661
loses his footing and dies in his drunken state.

340
00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:01.861
Good Heavens! We must hurry!

341
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:06.561
What? Murder case?

342
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:07.561
Not yet, but...

343
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.961
if you ask me, I mean... he's going to be killed soon.

344
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:12.361
I don't get what you're saying.

345
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:15.561
Sorry, but I have to find my notebook.

346
00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:18.161
-But... -Leave it to me!

347
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:19.361
Hey, the man named Hanzaki

348
00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:22.361
actually picked up your notebook yesterday.

349
00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.361
Did he actually pick it up?

350
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:25.561
And he said, "I keep it in my apartment,

351
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:27.461
so please come to pick it up."

352
00:19:27.461 --> 00:19:29.461
Where? His apartment!

353
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:32.361
Conan!

354
00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:35.861
I managed to get a master key from the landlord!

355
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:38.761
Hey!

356
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.561
Conan!

357
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:41.761
-Is this his room? -Yeah.

358
00:19:42.861 --> 00:19:44.861
Where? Where?

359
00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:47.161
Where? Where? Where?

360
00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:49.061
Where is my notebook?

361
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:10.061
-Way to go! -Way to go!

362
00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:15.361
Now I'm going to untie you.

363
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:19.361
Thank you for your help.

364
00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:21.361
It's you, yesterday?

365
00:20:21.361 --> 00:20:23.361
"Seiichi Sugiyama (52), Hanzaki's manager" -Yes. My name is Sugiyama.

366
00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:26.261
You helped me both yesterday and today.

367
00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:28.361
Thank you, Mr. Takagi.

368
00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.261
How do you know my name?

369
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:32.361
I don't think I told you yesterday.

370
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:36.361
I saw your name on your notebook.

371
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:40.561
Yes, this is it. I've found it.

372
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.161
You did it. You found it at last.

373
00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:45.361
It would seem that that Hanzaki guy

374
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:47.061
didn't pick up the notebook himself,

375
00:20:47.061 --> 00:20:49.461
but just saw him pick it up.

376
00:20:49.461 --> 00:20:52.361
Yes. So it seemed.

377
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:55.061
What a relief it is.

378
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:07.361
Why are you here?

379
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.061
That's what I want to know about Hanzaki.

380
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.261
I've gone along with you a long time

381
00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:15.661
because I believed you had a special talent.

382
00:21:15.661 --> 00:21:18.361
Why didn't you believe in me until the end?

383
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:19.561
Hanzaki!

384
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.361
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:23.461 --> 00:21:25.061
I'm Takagi, an officer of the Criminal Investigations Division 1

386
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:27.061
of the Metropolitan Police.

387
00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:31.961
Mr. Hanzaki. Please follow me to the police station.

388
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:33.061
Yes.

389
00:23:07.961 --> 00:23:09.261
Mr. Takagi.

390
00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:12.461
I heard you prevented a murder.

391
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:14.061
Yes, sir.

392
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:15.361
Well done.

393
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:16.761
You did a great job and appreciate your hard work.

394
00:23:16.761 --> 00:23:17.761
Yes, sir.

395
00:23:17.761 --> 00:23:21.861
By the way, how are you feeling now? Is your headache gone?

396
00:23:21.861 --> 00:23:24.661
Did you run a high fever of 39 degrees? What is your temperature now?

397
00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:28.361
Did you have a stomach ache then?

398
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:30.661
Did you stumble and sprain an ankle?

399
00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:33.761
And you couldn't move because of your nausea, could you?

400
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:38.961
Officer Takagi pretended to be sick in order to find his lost notebook.

401
00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:42.161
-Looks like it. -He played hooky from work.

402
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:43.561
You idiot!

403
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:46.261
Shame on you as a police person for pretending to be sick.

404
00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:48.361
Go to your police station, now!

405
00:23:48.361 --> 00:23:50.461
Yes, sir!

406
00:23:50.461 --> 00:23:51.861
Double Time!

407
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:53.461
Yes.

408
00:23:53.461 --> 00:23:57.461
Please wait, Inspector Megure!

409
00:24:00.761 --> 00:24:03.461
After all, he ended up being scolded by him.

410
00:24:05.161 --> 00:24:09.561
"Next Episode"

411
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:12.461
That woman at that time...

412
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:17.761
What?

413
00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:31.061
Next Conan,

414
00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:35.161
"English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective (Part 1)"

415
00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:38.679
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:38.679 --> 00:24:40.079
"Curtain"

417
00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.379
Their identity in the next episode is...

418
00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:45.279
I'm Jodie. Detective from the west, who is that?
