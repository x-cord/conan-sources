1
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:04,529
Okay!

2
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:06,425
It's done!

3
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,876
Amazing!

4
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,982
It looks fantastic!

5
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:13,703
Well, the design is just a duplicate of the detective badge though.

6
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:19,476
Hey, kites need tails, you know.

7
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:22,682
They'll just keep spinning around in circles without tails.

8
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:25,793
As for that, I've already made them!

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,837
Moreover. It includes a message too. See!

10
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:33,824
"If you got a case on your hands,

11
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:37,911
contact the Detective Squad at Teitan Elementary class 1-B."

12
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:39,372
Wow.

13
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:42,715
Jobs will come pouring in.

14
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,922
Good idea, don't you think?

15
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:47,422
What about the other tail?

16
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:51,152
I was planning on unrolling this after arriving at the site.

17
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,999
"If you're looking for useful inventions,

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,889
Contact Hiroshi Agasa of 2-22 Beika City."

19
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:05,147
You've even got your website address on the back.

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,106
It's okay, isn't it? Because I helped you make the kite.

21
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:14,812
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,709
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

23
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:18,710
A kite flying event in a spacious lot by the river.

24
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,569
An ingenious trick that looks to be an accident.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,409
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,149
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,569
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:13,069
"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 1)"

29
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:21,715
-But I wonder if it'll be okay? -What about?

30
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,955
Kite tails flap a lot in the wind,

31
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:27,770
so the messages won't be readable.

32
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,244
All we need to do is win an award at the kite contest.

33
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:35,394
-An award? -What do you mean?

34
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,799
Kites that fly the highest

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,673
and kites with unique designs that win awards

36
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:44,878
will be decorated at the city hall for a month.

37
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:47,756
It'll be a super effective method of advertisement.

38
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,462
-Really? -Great!

39
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:53,016
Let's do our best, Ai!

40
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,800
Ai?

41
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,255
What? Oh, sorry.

42
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,681
-What is it? -Let's do our best

43
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:03,826
at the kite flying contest.

44
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,162
Yes.

45
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,754
-Kites! -Oh, how magnificent.

46
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,626
Okay, I'll give it my all!

47
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,963
"Eight Teimuzu River Kite Flying Event"

48
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,300
What? The music Haibara's listening to?

49
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,685
She hums a tune sometimes looking happy.

50
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:36,521
I'd like to know what's making her feel that way.

51
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,606
Wasn't it some anime song?

52
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,250
It did sound like Yoko Okino's song.

53
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,328
It sounded like classical music to me.

54
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,455
Why don't you just ask her?

55
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:55,709
Of course, I did, but she said, "It's a secret".

56
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,967
Nothing to be concerned about.

57
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:01,679
It's probably some dumb song that's popular now.

58
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,673
Well, I'm sorry.

59
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,983
It's some dumb song that��s popular now.

60
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,608
Haibara.

61
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:13,583
Why don't you stop keeping them in suspense and tell them already.

62
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:16,233
I want to know too.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,565
No way. Absolutely not.

64
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,890
-What? -What?

65
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,105
Hey, Haibara!

66
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,506
If you want to know that badly

67
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,506
why don't you deduce what it is, Mr. Detective?

68
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,737
What?

69
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:43,290
Deduce?

70
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:48,258
Hey! Your turn's coming up!

71
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,191
Hey, Doc.

72
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,216
Do you know what song Haibara's been listening to recently?

73
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,327
What?

74
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:59,026
It could be the opening theme song of a drama she's hooked on now.

75
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,383
She doesn't watch many dramas,

76
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:08,906
but she watched the Big Osaka special on Higo several times.

77
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:14,998
She was watching the program when the soccer team that he captained

78
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:19,435
finished 2nd in the high school soccer tournament.

79
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,435
He's said to be considerate of his juniors

80
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:25,499
and still goes to watch the games held at his alma mater when he has time.

81
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:32,328
Well, the baseball team of his school seems to be more popular these days.

82
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:36,448
Higo went to a high school in Kanto?

83
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,479
Oh, that's right.

84
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,393
Come to think of it, on that special,

85
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:44,334
his teammate Sanada came on.

86
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,923
He revealed Higo's unusual hobbies and all.

87
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,734
-Doc, stop right there. -What?

88
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,314
Too bad. Go suffer forever.

89
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,258
That jerk.

90
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,738
I wonder if it has something to do with Higo after all.

91
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,084
Ai is a great fan of his too.

92
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:12,262
But Higo's favorite song isn't listed on his website.

93
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:15,020
Maybe it's just not posted yet.

94
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,810
Then we'd never find out.

95
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:21,303
No. There's still a way.

96
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,055
We'll just wiretap.

97
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,920
Wiretap?

98
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,309
You boot the record app of the cell phone like this

99
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,254
and darken the display.

100
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:43,147
See? Even if she were to see it, she wouldn't know.

101
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:48,213
Ayumi, put this in your pocket and approach Haibara.

102
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,226
While Mitsuhiko, Genta and I, are flying the kite

103
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,988
and when Haibara is off her guard

104
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,448
and starts humming the song,

105
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:04,494
the identity of the song will be made as plain as day.

106
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,153
Conan, your face looks kind of scary.

107
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:13,330
It's not a deduction.

108
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,934
It seems more like a crime.

109
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,329
Next up, Detective Squad Team, Cafe Renno Team.

110
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,972
Teams Detective Squad and Cafe Renno, please get ready.

111
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:30,568
-That's us. -It's finally come.

112
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:34,266
-We're counting on you, Ayumi. -Yep.

113
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,106
Okay, let's go!

114
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,258
How's this?

115
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:45,830
A little more behind so the wind hits in from the front!

116
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,934
-Okay! -Got it!

117
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,751
Don't step on the tails of the kite!

118
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:53,737
-The time's finally come. -You can do it!

119
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,895
Are you curious about this song too?

120
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,400
Yep.

121
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,768
Okay, if you promise not to tell Conan, I'll tell you.

122
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,642
This song is...

123
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,539
No! Don't tell me!

124
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,413
Because it's wrong to secretly record a girl's secret after all!

125
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,755
Secretly record?

126
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:30,206
-Don't tell me he... -Yep.

127
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:34,599
Conan told me to record your humming.

128
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:39,011
-That dirty detective. -What?

129
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,902
Okay! Now!

130
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,769
We did it!

131
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,550
-Amazing! -It's flying pretty high!

132
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,336
What?

133
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,084
Oh, no!

134
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,800
-The tail... -It tore off!

135
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,379
Darn!

136
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,549
It's falling!

137
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,168
-No joke? -Our kite?

138
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:45,175
What?

139
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,049
Hey, watch out!

140
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:48,700
"Ryota Renno (39)" -Gosh.

141
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,929
"Kite Flying Event Participant" -What's going on? Are you with somebody?

142
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:55,790
Brats, just brats. They dropped their kite.

143
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,921
I told you that I was going to a kite-flying contest this afternoon.

144
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,326
I wonder about that.

145
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,788
How am I supposed to trust...

146
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:06,040
"Takami Renno (35)" -a husband that lies to his wife...

147
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,835
"Ryoto's Wife" -and having an affair with some woman?

148
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,140
What woman are you talking about?

149
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,505
Bring her to me, will you?

150
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,947
What's with you? Venting your guilt out on me?

151
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,682
You couldn't even if you wanted to.

152
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,769
What?

153
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:22,738
Because my younger sister cut her wrist in the tub last night

154
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:27,639
and is lying unconscious in serious condition on a hospital bed right now.

155
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,669
She may be a stupid girl who believed you when you told her

156
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:34,615
that you'd leave your wife and marry her...

157
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,682
but she's still my dear younger sister.

158
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:42,215
"Yuitoshi Kakura (41)" -Come see me after this is over.

159
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,937
"Kite Flying Event Participant" -I could

160
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,805
settle things right now if you want.

161
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:52,197
Hey, Renno! What're you doing?

162
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,093
Not over there!

163
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,308
Farther back, back!

164
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,286
Sorry.

165
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,923
Well, be careful.

166
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:07,372
Your partner Yatsukoshi was also head over heels over her.

167
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:08,607
"Takeshi Yatsukoshi (34), Kite Flying Event Participant"

168
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,167
Fly your kites as high as you can!

169
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:15,607
Each team has 15 minutes!

170
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:19,961
No cell phone has been turned in at lost and found.

171
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:25,086
Did you really drop it in front of this make-shift restroom?

172
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,878
I think so.

173
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,708
It felt like I dropped something after I used the bathroom

174
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:31,614
and took out my handkerchief.

175
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,958
Why didn't you pick it up right away then?

176
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:37,018
Because...

177
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:39,914
I heard the announcement say

178
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:41,464
that it was our team's turn.

179
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:42,785
I see.

180
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:46,364
Then, do you remember anybody back then that was near you?

181
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:52,157
Somebody tripped behind me.

182
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,367
I didn't see their face, though.

183
00:12:55,951 --> 00:13:01,010
They may have thought that they tripped and dropped the cell phone

184
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,991
and picked it up.

185
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,464
If they tripped, they must've been in a hurry.

186
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,218
Most probably so.

187
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,345
If so, maybe that person flew his kite

188
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:15,512
at the same time as the boys.

189
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,260
Then, when they come back,

190
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,383
we can try and ring the cell phone.

191
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,323
No good.

192
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,283
The bamboo stick of the frame broke.

193
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:31,708
This won't fly even if we replace the tail.

194
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,168
Darn.

195
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,990
-Maybe... -What?

196
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,695
We're being punished by heaven.

197
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,561
Punished? For wiretapping?

198
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:44,212
Hey, what're you doing?

199
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,449
If you move back any farther...

200
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:50,696
What?

201
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:11,362
-Hey, that man... -He fell into the Teimuzu River!

202
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:14,496
-Mitsuhiko, call an ambulance! -Okay!

203
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,487
This is bad! He can't swim!

204
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,082
Somebody. Please help him!

205
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,056
This way. Hang on!

206
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,687
-You'll make it. -An accident?

207
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,387
Dear?

208
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,112
What's up, Dear? Dear!

209
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,956
Hey, answer me! Dear!

210
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:42,052
No, this is...

211
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,228
not an accident.

212
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,174
If you move back any farther...

213
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,886
What?

214
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:14,621
-Hey, that man... -He fell into the Teimuzu River!

215
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:17,391
-Mitsuhiko, call the ambulance! -Okay!

216
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,022
This is bad! He can't swim!

217
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:25,411
Somebody. Please help him!

218
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:34,364
This way. Hang on! You'll make it.

219
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,919
-An accident? -Dear?

220
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,657
What's up, Dear? Dear!

221
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,419
Hey, answer me! Dear!

222
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,453
No, this is...

223
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,908
not an accident.

224
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,033
He drank a lot of water so is unconscious and in serious condition,

225
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:16,430
Yes. So who fell in the river?

226
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,955
The owner of a Cafe in this neighborhood.

227
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:23,110
Mr. Ryota Renno, age 39.

228
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:26,326
According to eyewitness reports,

229
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,107
Mr. Renno was holding his kite like this and walking backwards.

230
00:16:29,227 --> 00:16:35,094
Unfortunately, from between those pikes where the rope was cut,

231
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:38,994
he slipped and fell into the river.

232
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:45,877
I see.

233
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:50,077
The ends of the rope are pretty old and worn out.

234
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:54,701
I'm sure it was cut some time ago, but left unattended.

235
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,781
This seems to be an accident,

236
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,773
I guess we can leave the rest up to the local police.

237
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,958
Yes, sir.

238
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,990
I don't think this is an accident.

239
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:05,871
Conan?

240
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,241
It's not an accident?

241
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:13,733
Officer Takagi, can you try connecting both ends of the rope?

242
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:16,288
What? Yeah.

243
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,604
What?

244
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,954
See? They don't reach, right?

245
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,629
Yeah.

246
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:30,390
But if it was exposed for some time to wind and rain,

247
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,535
the rope would shorten.

248
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,538
But...

249
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:40,281
this rope below... See, it's too long.

250
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,606
Even if this were to be connected it would be dangling

251
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,598
and of no use.

252
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:46,852
True.

253
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:49,598
Besides, this rope...

254
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:52,383
the color's changed on one side,

255
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,213
but the underside isn't.

256
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,307
But why?

257
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:02,006
Maybe the rope of the post at the far end was used.

258
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,142
The rope of the post at the far end?

259
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes.

260
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:12,826
The rope at the far end would've been exposed to rain and totally worn out.

261
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:17,612
That rope was untied, the length was matched and tied here.

262
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:22,928
To make it look like the rope was cut from some time ago.

263
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,760
The color on one side of the rope wasn't changed

264
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,360
because the rope that was originally tied onto the post was used.

265
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,053
I see.

266
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,934
Mitsuhiko and Genta are confirming it now,

267
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,529
so I think we'll find out soon.

268
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:44,982
It's just like you said, Conan!

269
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,196
The rope of the post before the one at the farthest end...

270
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,451
was newly cut

271
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:56,769
and wasn't connected to the post at the farthest end next to it.

272
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:01,013
Hey!

273
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:06,069
The post at the farthest end on the other side had no rope tied onto it!

274
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:08,556
See?

275
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:12,580
But who on earth would do such a thing?

276
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,684
And for what?

277
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:24,220
Beats me, I'm just a kid.

278
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:28,375
-I guess so. -He's right.

279
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,828
But maybe...

280
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:36,244
it was to make the man who drowned, fall into the river.

281
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,250
It can't be.

282
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,496
That man slipped on his own and...

283
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:48,716
But that man was backing down holding the kite like this, right?

284
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,438
At times like this we're not careful about how things are behind us, right?

285
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,336
No. Because we know that the rope is there.

286
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:01,202
We may be careful not to step on the tails of the kite, though.

287
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:05,112
Then, if you can skillfully lure the man

288
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,012
between the posts that have no rope,

289
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,758
maybe you can make him fall.

290
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,806
True.

291
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:15,051
If so, the perp is...

292
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:17,052
The suspicious ones...

293
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:23,382
are that plump man who was on the same team as the man who drowned.

294
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:28,148
If they were on the same team,

295
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,974
he could've told the man who drowned where to stand, right?

296
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:36,162
Not over there! Farther back, back!

297
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:43,097
And the man next to him of sturdy built.

298
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:50,250
That man was talking to the man who drowned before he fell into the river.

299
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:53,241
Come see me after this is over.

300
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,575
I could settle things right now if you want.

301
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,802
Okay. Get details from the two.

302
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,682
And,

303
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:08,120
the man who drowned was also talking on the phone with somebody

304
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,105
just before falling into the river.

305
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,978
If you move back any farther...

306
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:17,408
What?

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,297
-What? -Do you know who he was talking to?

308
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:23,520
From the cell phone that was on the ground...

309
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,806
Dear?

310
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,012
What's up, Dear? Dear!

311
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:30,853
Hey, answer me! Dear!

312
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,116
Is what I heard.

313
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:36,219
I think it was the man's wife.

314
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,847
Contact his residence right away.

315
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,847
But I answered the cell phone that was on the ground

316
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:46,056
and told her that her husband fell into the river,

317
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:50,586
she rushed over here and got on the ambulance with him.

318
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,671
Get her back right away

319
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:59,680
as a prime suspect to an alleged murder.

320
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,219
Yes, sir.

321
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:08,525
This is an ingeniously planned premeditated murder.

322
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:12,541
It's most likely that the perp is one of the three.

323
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,384
But...

324
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,714
how did the perp carry this out

325
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:23,153
at a crowded kite flying event?

326
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,714
And just who is the perp?

327
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:54,351
"Next Episode" -You're saying that I lured Renno to where the rope was cut

328
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,111
and made him fall into the river?

329
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,608
He was probably punished by heaven and fell into the river.

330
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,751
Why on earth do I have to be suspected?

331
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,693
There may be some other perp besides those three.

332
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:11,209
But there's got to be a way...

333
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:13,057
I don't think there is.

334
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,344
Next Conan,

335
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,899
"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 2)"

336
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:38,024
Next Conan's Hint:

337
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,069
"Kite string"

338
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:42,599
Why are kites called "Tako" (Octopus) in Japanese?

339
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:43,669
Would you have preferred to call them "Ika" (Squids)?

340
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,269
No, I'd prefer "Ebi" (Shrimps).
