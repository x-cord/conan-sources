1
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.040
Murderer!

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.340
My God!

3
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.340
This is bad, Mr. Glover!

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.340
I have one too.

5
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.740
The magistrate office will take this

6
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440
as an opportunity to capture you.

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.840
If this should happen,

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.040
business as well as the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance will go down the drain.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.740
No need to worry.

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.140
All charges against, I, myself, will clear.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
I, Ryoma Sakamoto!

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.040
The vivid colored memories of summer

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
solve mysteries all season round.

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.240
The stage is in Nagasaki, at the end of the Edo Era.

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240
Where did the scriptwriter disappear to?

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.240
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.539
"The Nagasaki Mystery (End of the Edo Era)".

20
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:58.339
We've time-slipped,

21
00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.539
or so I thought, but...

22
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:01.639
As always,

23
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.339
Ran won first prize at the shopping arcade raffle drawing.

24
00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.039
And, today,

25
00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.939
"Nagasaki Station" -we arrived in Nagasaki.

26
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.639
"Confucius Shrine"

27
00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.439
"Ooura Catholic Church"

28
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.039
"Glover Garden" -Glover Garden is a famous site in Nagasaki

29
00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.239
where the mansion of the English merchant, Thomas Blake Glover,

30
00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.939
who supported zealous men of noble ideals,

31
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.139
such as Ryoma Sakamoto stands.

32
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.339
What's she looking for?

33
00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.039
-A heart stone. -A heart stone?

34
00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.939
Among the stone pavement within the garden,

35
00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.139
it is said that there are two heart-shaped stones.

36
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.839
If a couple finds them, it is said that they will get married,

37
00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.939
or if they touch it, their love will be realized.

38
00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.339
There seems to be many myths about it.

39
00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.939
I found it!

40
00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.839
It's cute!

41
00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.839
I wonder where the other one is.

42
00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.539
Who cares about something like that?

43
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.739
I'm more concerned about eating the famous Nagasaki Chanpon and Saraudon.

44
00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.839
Murderer!

45
00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.939
What was that?

46
00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.839
I'm sure I heard murderer.

47
00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:09.939
This way?

48
00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.439
Move it!

49
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.439
Everybody, stay where you are and don't move!

50
00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.239
Leave the rest to this famed Detective Kogoro Mouri!

51
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.939
What's with this victim?

52
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.139
He... he's revived.

53
00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.639
Who on earth are all of you?

54
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.139
Cut!

55
00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.839
Too late.

56
00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.739
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:45.739
It's so misleading.

58
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.939
The filming of a two-hour TV mystery drama

59
00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:54.039
staged in Nagasaki at the end of the Edo era was in session.

60
00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.039
A murder occurs at the Glover Mansion,

61
00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.239
and Ryoma Sakamoto who was sheltered here,

62
00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:01.139
serves the role of a detective.

63
00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.139
He takes Ine, a young woman doctor who studied Western medicine

64
00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.739
by means of the Dutch language, as his assistant,

65
00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:10.439
and clears his name by solving the case.

66
00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.339
How about it, Ine?

67
00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.839
Was a gun used, after all?

68
00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.239
"Kyonosuke Sasahara (33) as Ryoma Sakamoto"

69
00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:21.639
To think that something like this would happen at this mansion...

70
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.639
"Benichiyo Yamashita (42) as Tsuru"

71
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.339
We've sure got trouble.

72
00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.439
"Andrew Hatta (50) as Glover"

73
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.739
No doubt about it.

74
00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:35.039
The cause of death is by gunshot.

75
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.539
"Futaba Nanao (23) as Ine Karasuma"

76
00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.939
Cut!

77
00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.739
Okay!

78
00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:44.639
Hey! Are you sure it's okay?

79
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.839
It may be just acting,

80
00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.239
but should a doctor say her lines with so much emotion?

81
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:49.839
"Keisuke Sakakibara (45), TV Drama Director" -It's okay!

82
00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.239
Ine's still a new doctor, so that'll do.

83
00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:56.439
"Akikazu Nakane (48), Cameraman" -Your acting was quite something, Ochiyo!

84
00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.039
"Ryuhei Kishimura (30), Assistant Director" -Right, Benichiyo!

85
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.339
You think so?

86
00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:02.839
I'm glad if you think so.

87
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.139
Next is the scene that Chubei Soneya,

88
00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.839
a colleague of the victim appears.

89
00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:12.939
Showtime, Mr. Sazanami!

90
00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.039
Okay!

91
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.839
I'm counting on you, Bara!

92
00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.139
"Chojiro Sazanami (45) as Chyubei Soneya"

93
00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.139
Yeah, same here, Cho.

94
00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.539
Where's Soneya's props?

95
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:25.839
Here they are!

96
00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.539
"Kazuomi Sakota (35), Props Master" -They're all here.

97
00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.939
Don't you think it's a bit too flashy?

98
00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.539
No.

99
00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.839
I wonder if you can do something about this comb too.

100
00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.339
No, but that's Madame Butterfly's...

101
00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.539
You really like opera, don't you?

102
00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.239
But is it really okay, Bara?

103
00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.439
To start filming when we still don't know how the story ends,

104
00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.139
or more than that, who the culprit is.

105
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:54.939
Well, even if it's a bit delayed,

106
00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.939
Tatsumi always comes up with a masterpiece.

107
00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.539
She's quite a beauty,

108
00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.239
that woman playing the role of the doctor.

109
00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:06.239
You mean Ms. Futaba Nanao, right?

110
00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:09.739
She's a new actress that's expected to become popular soon.

111
00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:11.639
You've got to be kidding!

112
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.539
We can't do that!

113
00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.239
That's why I told you that won't do.

114
00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:19.239
I told you to keep it hidden!

115
00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:22.239
Mr. Sasahara is a handsome bachelors

116
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:23.539
and is always ranking at the top when it comes to

117
00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.439
wanting him to be a boyfriend. That's what I heard from Sonoko.

118
00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:28.339
I wonder if something's wrong.

119
00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:32.039
Maybe it has to do with women?

120
00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:33.339
No way!

121
00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.839
We've got trouble!

122
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.739
"Taizo Ooki (52), Producer of a drama production company" -Tatsumi split!

123
00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:39.739
-What? -What?

124
00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.939
I knew he's been troubled recently, but...

125
00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:52.939
After all of us who used to work together gathered together again...

126
00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.339
Maybe we should wait a while more.

127
00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:57.739
No, we can't wait any longer.

128
00:07:57.739 --> 00:07:59.739
Is it?

129
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:01.339
If so...

130
00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:02.639
That's right!

131
00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.839
The thing is...

132
00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:06.639
What?

133
00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.839
Sleeping Kogoro?

134
00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.839
Yes?

135
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.239
Please!

136
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:15.539
Please find the culprit of this mystery drama

137
00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:19.239
with your deduction, Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:21.139
Huh?

139
00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.839
Hey, hey.

140
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.339
"Kosaku Tatsumi (45), Scriptwriter" -The scriptwriter of the mystery drama,

141
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.039
Mr. Kosaku Tatsumi,

142
00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.839
is a veteran who has a history of winning various awards.

143
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.439
On top of this drama being the work of Mr. Tatsumi

144
00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:34.939
with no other original work to go on,

145
00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:38.139
since it cranked in despite delay in the script being submitted,

146
00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:39.739
there was no one but Mr. Tatsumi,

147
00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:41.539
who knew what to expect was coming,

148
00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.839
or who the culprit in the script would be.

149
00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.239
If this drama goes down the drain,

150
00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:51.839
our company will go bankrupt!

151
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.839
So long as you figure out who the culprit is, Mr. Mouri,

152
00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:58.039
I'll take care of what comes up after that.

153
00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.739
-Please! -Please!

154
00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:07.739
It's impossible after all.

155
00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:10.739
With no written script,

156
00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:14.039
there's no way that I can figure out the culprit.

157
00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:17.039
But, you accepted the work, didn't you?

158
00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.139
You told them that there's no mystery

159
00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:20.539
that the Sleeping Kogoro can't solve.

160
00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:22.239
Well, you see...

161
00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:25.039
It's true that there're not enough clues.

162
00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.739
Huh?

163
00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:33.539
What's this?

164
00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.739
"Serial Art Theft Case"

165
00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:35.939
"Illegally Sold Among Fans"

166
00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:37.439
"A Large-scale Smuggling Organisation"

167
00:09:37.439 --> 00:09:39.239
What's this?

168
00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.039
Why is it in a place like this?

169
00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.439
A band of artwork thieves.

170
00:09:43.439 --> 00:09:44.439
That's it!

171
00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:47.239
These are stories based on real cases, aren't they?

172
00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:50.239
In other words, the culprit is a band of thieves?

173
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:52.139
But, nothing like that comes out

174
00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:54.639
in the script that they have now, you know?

175
00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:56.739
They're appearing from now.

176
00:09:56.739 --> 00:09:58.539
I wonder about that.

177
00:09:58.539 --> 00:09:59.839
If so,

178
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:02.739
it wouldn't have to be hidden in a place like this.

179
00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:06.839
Yes, right, I'm leaving now.

180
00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:07.939
So,

181
00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.939
I've got no choice but to do something about it, right?

182
00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:15.339
Why this?

183
00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.539
I'm exhausted.

184
00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:22.939
So, there weren't many clues after all, were there?

185
00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:24.439
That's why I've been telling you

186
00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:26.939
the band of thieves are the culprits.

187
00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:29.039
Hi, Mr. Mouri.

188
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:35.439
I'm Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover.

189
00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:36.839
-What? -What?

190
00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:41.839
I look more like the statue in Glover Garden

191
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.939
without my make-up, don't I?

192
00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:46.339
No...

193
00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:49.439
If I remember correctly, the Glover who helped Ryoma out

194
00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:51.639
was about 30 years old.

195
00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:54.439
Detective boy.

196
00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:55.839
You're thinking that the actor

197
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.339
is older than the actual Glover, aren't you?

198
00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:01.039
No...

199
00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:04.539
It seems that Mr. Ooki's production company

200
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.339
is having quite a tough time.

201
00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:10.239
So, most of the performers in this drama

202
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.539
are acting for guarantees cheaper than the usual,

203
00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:16.239
thanks to connections through Mr. Ooki and Mr. Sakakibara.

204
00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:19.039
Does that go for you too, Mr. Hatta?

205
00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:22.139
Yes, I've known everyone for a long time.

206
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.339
The director did mention

207
00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.539
that all the colleagues from the past got together.

208
00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.239
Yes.

209
00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:34.139
Mr. Sakakibara, Mr. Ooki, Ochiyo, Mr. Sazanami and I

210
00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:37.039
used to work together since the days we were still unknown actors.

211
00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:39.639
Of course, the same goes for Mr. Tatsumi.

212
00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.939
I see.

213
00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:45.739
Since I was the only one who could be used to act as Glover,

214
00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:48.239
the script was written so I was already married to Tsuru,

215
00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:52.239
as a middle-aged couple.

216
00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:55.439
Mr. Tatsumi may have not liked this,

217
00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:58.139
because he used to place importance on being genuine.

218
00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:02.339
Is that why he disappeared without finishing the script?

219
00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:04.439
I have no idea.

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:09.539

"Higashi Yamate No.13"

222
00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:17.839
Pops told me to ask you.

223
00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:19.939
I wonder.

224
00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:21.439
How about you, Bara?

225
00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:22.639
Me neither.

226
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:26.639
Tatsumi used to be secretive about what he was planning to write, so...

227
00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:32.139
Hey, what on earth are we going to do?

228
00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:34.139
It's just a matter of time, you know.

229
00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:49.739
Hey, Sonny.

230
00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:53.539
You're the one who came with Mr. Mouri, aren't you?

Dad, Futaba is from Nagasaki.

233
00:13:13.089 --> 00:13:15.389
Since they finished filming my part,

234
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:19.689
I was thinking that maybe I would be able to help you,

235
00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:22.089
or rather, take you around.

236
00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:24.189
That'd be a great help!

we visited the places that were noted.

Isn't this the gun that Kid stole some time ago?

243
00:13:40.489 --> 00:13:41.689
Yup.

00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:04.189
How interesting!

250
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:06.489
Ran, give it back to me!

251
00:14:06.489 --> 00:14:07.889
Just a while more!

252
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.189
Really.

253
00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:13.189
I'm starved.

That's...

255
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:17.089
Don't tell me...

You mean this?

262
00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:37.789
I bought it at a shop near the Glover Garden.

263
00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:44.889
Finally!

264
00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:46.589
It looks delicious!

265
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:49.989
It's good, fantastic!

266
00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.589
It's really good, isn't it, Conan?

267
00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:53.789
Yup.

Aren't you eating?

269
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:06.889
The thing is, a few days ago,

270

Mr. Tatsumi was almost hit by a car.

271
00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:12.989
What?

272
00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:16.089
He said that somebody seems to have pushed him from behind.

273
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:18.789
Are you sure?

274
00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:21.789
Why didn't you say anything till now?

275
00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:23.289
Well...

276
00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.889
Anyway,

277
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:29.089
maybe Mr. Tatsumi disappeared because he feared for his life.

Mr. Tatsumi!

Futaba?

283
00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:54.789
Is it Mr. Tatsumi?

284
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:01.589
A little more...

285
00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:13.789
We lost track of him.

286
00:16:15.689 --> 00:16:18.589
I wonder why she seems so desperate.

Hello?

288
00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.389
Mr. Ooki.

289
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:35.889
What? You got the continuation of the script by mail from Mr. Tatsumi?

290
00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:39.389
And, was the name of the culprit written?

291

00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:06.189
I guess.

297
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:07.989
Strange.

298
00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:09.689
I had it all fastened.

299
00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:11.989
Please be careful!

300
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.589
She sure is something.

301
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.289
Does she do karate or something?

302
00:17:17.289 --> 00:17:19.389
She may not look it, but she's won the Kanto Tournament,

303
00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:21.189
she's a champion!

"Capitan room" - The continuation of the script that was received by mail

305
00:17:33.189 --> 00:17:34.889
was also incomplete.

306
00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:39.389
But the second murder case was written there.

307
00:17:39.389 --> 00:17:41.689
The site of the crime was in the Capitan room of Dejima.

308
00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:45.289
The victim is a secret detective hired by the Nagasaki magistrate,

309
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:46.789
and he left a dying message behind; the Japanese kanji character

310
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:49.589
for the number 9 (kyu).

311
00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:53.889
And? What did he say?

312
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:59.389
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei, for the details.

313

314
00:18:03.389 --> 00:18:06.289
We managed to fill the schedule in time,

315
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:08.189
but the problem is, "What now?"

316
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:09.789
Which means?

317
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:13.789
A new character appeared without previous reference.

318
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:15.889
There are a lot of mysterious dialogs too.

319
00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:18.789
I'm sure it's a quite important role, though.

320
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:20.689
We don't have anyone to act the role.

321
00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:23.389
We don't have the time or money to call someone from Tokyo either.

322
00:18:23.389 --> 00:18:25.889
That's a problem, isn't it?

323
00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:27.689
Right, it sure is.

324
00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:30.689
How old are you?

325
00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:32.589
I'm 17.

326
00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:35.589
I see! We can do that too!

327
00:18:37.889 --> 00:18:39.389
It can't be.

328
00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:42.389
Please lend this to us!

329
00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:44.389
No! No way!

330
00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.389
I mean... Hey...

331
00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:48.489
No way! No darn way!

332
00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:51.789
Help, Dad! Conan!

333
00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:53.289
Give it your best shot!

334
00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:54.689
Hang in there!

335
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.889
No, the other way!

336
00:18:56.889 --> 00:18:58.989
That's why I don't like amateurs.

337
00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:00.289
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:02.089
No, it's my mistake!

339
00:19:02.089 --> 00:19:04.289
Hey, are you sure it's going to work?

340
00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:07.089
It's not a school play, you know.

341
00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:09.289
Don't worry, just relax.

342
00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:11.189
Just say your lines

343
00:19:11.189 --> 00:19:13.889
and we'll do the rest.

344
00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:15.289
Yes...

345
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:17.889
Okay then, shall we try out the dialogs?

346
00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:21.089
You can try first by looking at the scripts.

347
00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:22.989
Please wait!

348
00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:24.789
Let's start!

349
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:28.889
Mr. Sakamoto. I'm Otei, the daughter of Miuraya.

350
00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:31.389
What would you like with me?

351
00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:36.389
That's what the girls of the West wear,

352
00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:38.489
called a dress, is it not?

353
00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:40.789
The daughter of Miuraya is known to all in town

354
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:42.889
to be affected by European culture.

355
00:19:42.889 --> 00:19:43.989
By the way,

356
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:46.689
the man that was "you know what" in the Capitan's room

357
00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:48.989
was said to have left a writing "kyu" behind.

358
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.289
Do you know what it means?

359
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:53.789
Kyu?

360
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:55.689
Figures are important.

361
00:19:55.689 --> 00:19:58.089
Figures will solve everything.

362
00:19:58.089 --> 00:20:00.489
Right?

363
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:02.989
Yes, that's right.

364
00:20:02.989 --> 00:20:04.989
Why me too?

365
00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:07.389
Cut! Okay!

366
00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:12.089
Break time!

367
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:15.189
But, what a strange dialog.

368
00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:17.989
"Figures will solve everything." What a line.

369
00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:19.089
Come to think of it,

370
00:20:19.089 --> 00:20:20.889
there seems to be a lot of actors and actress

371
00:20:20.889 --> 00:20:23.689
with numbers in their names.

372
00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:27.389
"8" -Andrew Hatta, acting as Glover, right?

373
00:20:27.389 --> 00:20:28.689
Tsuru, his wife

374
00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:31.489
"1,000" -is acted by Ms. Benichiyo Yamashita.

375
00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:33.089
I guess so.

376
00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:36.189
"7" -The same with Futaba, her last name is Nanao.

377
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:37.889
There are some on our staff too.

378
00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:42.289
"3" -Mr. Ooki's name is Taizo.

379
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:44.589
"1" -Mr. Sakota's is Kazuomi.

380
00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:51.789
Mr. Sakamoto, do you know?

381
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:55.089
That in Nakashima River here, there lives a monster.

382
00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:56.489
What?

383
00:20:56.489 --> 00:20:58.989
But, there's no need to worry.

384
00:20:58.989 --> 00:21:00.389
The monster's weak point

385
00:21:00.389 --> 00:21:03.889
is its second tooth from the left on its lower jaw.

386
00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:06.389
Cut! Okay!

387
00:21:06.389 --> 00:21:08.589
The monster's weak point...

388
00:21:08.589 --> 00:21:10.889
This is another mysterious line.

389
00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:13.989
This is...

390
00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:15.989
Only this line is written in a different font.

391
00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:17.389
Maybe...

392
00:21:24.389 --> 00:21:28.889
Maybe this could be a message from Mr. Tatsumi?

393
00:21:28.889 --> 00:21:30.389
If Otei of Miuraya

394
00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:34.489
was a character that was created to relay that message...

395
00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:37.889
The thing thinkable is the truth of why he disappeared!

396
00:21:37.889 --> 00:21:39.289
And, that is...

397
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:40.289
"Serial Art Theft Case"

398
00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:41.289
"Illegally Sold Among Fans"

399
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:42.289
"A Large-scale Smuggling Organisation"

400
00:21:47.989 --> 00:21:51.889
This is all I know.

401
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:55.889
Next, I will take you to the restaurant that first started Western cuisine.

402
00:21:57.189 --> 00:21:59.489
I've had enough! Count me out!

403
00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:13.089
He was probably punched,

404
00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:14.289
moreover, with bare hands.

405
00:22:14.289 --> 00:22:16.189
Get a hold of yourself, Sakota!

406
00:22:16.189 --> 00:22:17.489
Where's the ambulance?

407
00:22:17.489 --> 00:22:19.989
I called them. They'll be here soon.

408
00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:21.989
Darn! Who did this to you?

409
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:32.589
Huh? Me?

410
00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:33.689
What?

411
00:22:33.689 --> 00:22:35.589
Ran?

412
00:22:35.589 --> 00:22:36.889
Can't be!

413
00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:39.589
The karate champion?

414
00:22:39.589 --> 00:22:42.189
No, I didn't...

415
00:22:43.689 --> 00:22:45.889
Hey, Sakota! Get a hold of yourself!

416
00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:47.289
Sakota!

417
00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:13.889
"Next Episode" -Why did Mr. Sakota point at Ran back then?

418
00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:16.189
Where are you now?

419
00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:18.689
I was just about to leave.

420
00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:21.989
I was suddenly attacked by someone at the observatory.

421
00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:23.789
I see! I got it!

422
00:24:24.689 --> 00:24:26.889
The meaning of the dying message!

423
00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:31.989
The culprit who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami is...

424
00:24:31.989 --> 00:24:33.889
you, Ran!

425
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.289
Next Conan,

426
00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:39.289
"The Nagasaki Mystery Theater (The Present)".

427
00:24:55.189 --> 00:24:57.589
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:57.589 --> 00:24:59.489
"Stroke order".

429
00:24:59.489 --> 00:25:01.189
Dad, what shall I do?

430
00:25:01.189 --> 00:25:02.289
Sleeping Ran?

431
00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:04.389
I promise I'll help you.
