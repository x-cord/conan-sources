1
00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:03.782
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:05.682
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.582
Today, Ayumi is put in a tight situation without a second to waste.

4
00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:09.682
Mystery and action.

5
00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.082
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.082
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:15.582
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:59.695
"SOS! Message from Ayumi"

9
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:03.095
Okay, I have it.

10
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.495
This is next... how about it?

11
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:07.395
Alright, I'm done.

12
00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.195
Darn it.

13
00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:12.895
Mitsuhiko and I are last again.

14
00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.095
Mitsuhiko, you're last!

15
00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.595
That's what you think.

16
00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.595
Alright.

17
00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:34.295
This one!

18
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:36.795
I did it.

19
00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:39.095
I'm done.

20
00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:40.595
Darn it.

21
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.095
Why do I lose all the time?

22
00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.095
Well, even a kindergartener can beat you

23
00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:49.195
just by looking at your face.

24
00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:50.995
Anyway, your expression is totally different

25
00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:54.595
when you're looking at the joker and when you're not.

26
00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:57.995
Conan, don't tell him the secret.

27
00:02:57.995 --> 00:02:59.495
Is that what it was?

28
00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:01.895
Alright, one more time.

29
00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:04.495
This time, I'll keep this face.

30
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.195
Haibara, would you like to participate too?

31
00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.795
I would rather read this book.

32
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.395
You don't want to play with us.

33
00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:17.095
You're cool as usual, aren't you?

34
00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:19.095
That's right, Conan.

35
00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:21.795
Do you know about the robbery murder

36
00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:24.095
that took place yesterday in Haido Town?

37
00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:28.695
Yeah, you mean the woman owner of the French restaurant, "Le Escargot",

38
00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.595
that was killed, don't you?

39
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.595
That's a funny name for a restaurant.

40
00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:35.495
It's not funny at all.

41
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:40.895
"Escargots" are edible snails used in French cuisine.

42
00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:44.395
What? You can eat snails?

43
00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:47.695
A snail-rice bowls?

44
00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:50.395
"Snail-rice bowls"

45
00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.695
What're you imagining?

46
00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:57.595
And, have you heard any details on it?

47
00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:03.095
Yes. Last night, I heard Pop Mouri talking with Inspector Megure.

48
00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:05.895
He said the victim was asleep until near noon

49
00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:09.695
and she met up with the robber who broke in.

50
00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:13.895
Does that mean the robber sneaked in thinking that no one was home?

51
00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:15.395
Looks like it.

52
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:17.995
The victim's hands and legs were tied

53
00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:20.295
and she was stabbed with a knife.

54
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:23.695
Probably, the perpetrator made her tell where the money was,

55
00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:25.495
took all of it,

56
00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:28.695
and killed her just before he left.

57
00:04:28.695 --> 00:04:33.295
He must've killed her because she saw his face.

58
00:04:33.295 --> 00:04:34.295
Probably.

59
00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:36.995
Frightening.

60
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:40.195
Looks like the Youth Detective Squad won't be making an appearance

61
00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:41.395
with a vicious perpetrator like that around.

62
00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:43.195
Of course not!

63
00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:45.195
In the first place, children aren't suppose

64
00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:47.295
to be talking about murder cases.

65
00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:50.395
You should be talking about more children-like things with dreams.

66
00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.195
Dr. Agasa, do you have some throat drops?

67
00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:55.695
Does your throat hurt?

68
00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.295
Come to think of it, Ayumi...

69
00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:59.295
Your voice is a bit funny.

70
00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:02.395
Let's have a look. Open your mouth.

71
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:07.695
Your tonsils are pretty swollen.

72
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:09.395
You seem to have a fever too.

73
00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:10.695
Is it a cold?

74
00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.195
If it's a cold, eat some broiled eel on rice

75
00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:13.895
and it'll be gone with a flash.

76
00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.195
Genta, she's not the same as you.

77
00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:19.195
Ayumi, you'd better go home for today.

78
00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:20.595
We'll go home too.

79
00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:23.595
That's right. Please take a good rest at home.

80
00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:24.895
That's good.

81
00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:27.895
Well, I'll get the car ready,

82
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.795
so wait a minute.

83
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.495
"Teitan Elementary School, the following Monday" -Attention!

84
00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:38.995
Good morning.

85
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.995
Yes, good morning.

86
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.195
Be seated.

87
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:45.495
Before I take attendance,

88
00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:48.895
I just received a phone call from Ayumi Yoshida's mother.

89
00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:52.695
Today, Ayumi will be out with a cold.

90
00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:55.795
-Is she okay? -I thought so...

91
00:05:55.795 --> 00:05:59.595
That Ayumi, didn't she eat any broiled eels on rice.

92
00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:03.195
She seemed pretty bad yesterday.

93
00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:04.995
Oh, worried?

94
00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:06.495
Of course.

95
00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:10.095
You're pretty kind, aren't you?

96
00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:11.095
Be quiet.

97
00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:12.495
"The condo where Ayumi's home is, Resident Tower"

98
00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:13.995
Then, Ayumi...

99
00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:16.595
I'll be gone for a little while.

100
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:18.195
I'll finish what I have to do as soon as possible

101
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:19.995
and I should be home by noon,

102
00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:21.695
sleep quietly.

103
00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:23.695
Goodbye...

104
00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:26.595
Don't worry.

105
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.795
When the swelling in your throat goes down,

106
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.195
you'll be able to talk again.

107
00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:31.595
Well, then...

108
00:06:57.895 --> 00:06:59.595
Hello, Yoshida residence.

109
00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:01.795
We are out at the moment.

110
00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:05.795
Please leave your name and message after the peep sound.

111
00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:33.095
Yes.

112
00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:35.495
Miss Yamamoto, a delivery for you.

113
00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:37.095
Yes, please come in.

114
00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:55.395
"Yoshida"

115
00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:04.195
It's Mother.

116
00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.695
No. It's not Mother.

117
00:08:21.695 --> 00:08:24.895
Mother wouldn't ring the doorbell.

118
00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:35.095
A thief?

119
00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.195
Police...

120
00:08:38.195 --> 00:08:40.295
I've got to call the police.

121
00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:36.695
A brat's room...

122
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:50.095
You're a good child. Don't hide, come out here.

123
00:09:51.095 --> 00:09:53.495
I won't do anything.

124
00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:10.195
What should I do?

125
00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:13.795
It's probably that robber that Conan and the others were talking about.

126
00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:14.995
If he catches me,

127
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:18.195
I'll definitely end up like the owner of "Escargot".

128
00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:24.195
Let's go to visit Ayumi after school today.

129
00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:27.195
I'm for it. She'll surely be happy.

130
00:10:27.195 --> 00:10:29.595
Will she really?

131
00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.695
Girls don't like

132
00:10:30.695 --> 00:10:34.995
to have people see them when they're not feeling well

133
00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:38.095
especially someone she likes.

134
00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.695
Hey, hey.

135
00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:43.995
But, I guess that has nothing to do with grade-school kids.

136
00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:49.895
What's her problem?

137
00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:53.495
She's a grade-school kid too.

138
00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:08.895
It's probably Ayumi playing the keyboard harmonica.

139
00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:10.795
Ayumi, is that you?

140
00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.895
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

141
00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:21.795
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

142
00:11:21.795 --> 00:11:23.695
It's the Yaiba clock.

143
00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:26.695
That's right. It's the Masked Yaiba clock.

144
00:11:26.695 --> 00:11:29.895
Dr. Agasa bought it for us before.

145
00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:31.595
You press the button on the head

146
00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:34.095
and it tells the date and time.

147
00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:38.595
But, why doesn't Ayumi answer herself?

148
00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:41.895
Maybe she doesn't have a voice.

149
00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:44.195
Hello, Ayumi.

150
00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:47.895
Ayumi, is it that you don't have a voice?

151
00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:49.295
Tap the badge once for "yes",

152
00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:51.495
and twice for "no".

153
00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:58.795
Once, that's a "yes".

154
00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:01.095
She can't speak after all.

155
00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:04.795
She probably bored and wanted to hear our voices.

156
00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:07.395
Okay. Let's cheer her up.

157
00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:08.395
Wait a minute.

158
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.695
Something bothers me.

159
00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:15.195
I can understand why she used the clock's voice to reply

160
00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:18.095
but, that clock was 5 minutes late.

161
00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:20.295
In the first place, today isn't the 5th.

162
00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:21.795
Well...

163
00:12:22.795 --> 00:12:28.195
Isn't Ayumi trying to tell us something?

164
00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:31.795
Ayumi, has some sort of trouble come up?

165
00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:40.895
Ayumi, tap the badge once for "yes" and twice for "no".

166
00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:42.095
That's "no".

167
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.095
She just contacted us because she's bored.

168
00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:46.495
The lesson is about to start,

169
00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:49.295
so we'll contact you again on our next break.

170
00:12:51.895 --> 00:12:54.595
Oh no! Next is the music room.

171
00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:55.595
We've got to hurry.

172
00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:58.095
Teacher Kobayashi is frightening when she gets angry.

173
00:12:58.095 --> 00:12:59.195
Got to make a dash for it.

174
00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:09.095
A brat with a fancy toy.

175
00:13:17.785 --> 00:13:18.785
"2nd Music Room"

176
00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:21.785
Well, I think you all know, but...

177
00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:24.785
next month, there will be a concert.

178
00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:29.185
B class will be playing the keyboard harmonica.

179
00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:33.285
Today, I'd like to decide on the piece we'll be playing.

180
00:13:33.285 --> 00:13:35.485
Everyone, are there any good pieces?

181
00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:37.785
-Yes. -Yes...

182
00:13:37.785 --> 00:13:40.085
-Worried about Ayumi, aren't you? -Then, yes, Sato.

183
00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:41.285
Yes.

184
00:13:41.285 --> 00:13:46.085
-Me too. That melody she first played... -Yes, any other?

185
00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:48.685
I've heard it somewhere.

186
00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:50.985
Doesn't something come to mind?

187
00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:53.685
I'm not good at music...

188
00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:58.185
I'm sure it was... mi mi re do re.

189
00:13:58.185 --> 00:13:59.885
Putting that aside,

190
00:13:59.885 --> 00:14:03.485
wonder why the date and time were wrong?

191
00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:07.385
Today is the 5th... 10:30 am.

192
00:14:07.385 --> 00:14:10.485
5th... 10:30 am.

193
00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:13.285
Well then, now that we've decided the tune.

194
00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.785
First, let's try singing it together.

195
00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:17.385
-Yes. -Yes...

196
00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:28.685
"Mi Mi Re Do Re" -"Snail..."

197
00:14:28.685 --> 00:14:30.085
"Snail"

198
00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:33.485
-She wanted to tell us "snail". -"Where is your head?"

199
00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:34.885
-That's it. -"Where is your head?"

200
00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:37.385
Teacher! Please call the police!

201
00:14:37.385 --> 00:14:39.785
Ayumi's life is in danger!

202
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:41.885
Wait, Edogawa!

203
00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:47.485
Darn it, why didn't I realize it earlier?

204
00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:49.285
From that melody, "snail"...

205
00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:51.785
in other words, "Le Escargot".

206
00:14:51.785 --> 00:14:56.285
She was trying to tell me there was a robber there.

207
00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:59.785
It's probably at that time that Ayumi was caught by the robber.

208
00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:04.585
Ayumi, has some sort of trouble come up?

209
00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:10.985
Ayumi, tap the badge once for "yes" and twice for "no".

210
00:15:14.885 --> 00:15:16.385
Please be safe,

211
00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:17.585
Ayumi.

212
00:15:22.085 --> 00:15:24.385
Haibara, I understand the situation.

213
00:15:24.385 --> 00:15:27.785
Everyone, I'm going to go and call the police,

214
00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:30.085
so please be quiet and review the lesson.

215
00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:35.885
-Is it true? -Genta.

216
00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:38.085
Mitsuhiko, let's go.

217
00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:53.785
Darn, when I don't have a time...

218
00:15:53.785 --> 00:15:55.285
Wait a minute.

219
00:15:55.285 --> 00:15:58.085
The robber killed the woman owner

220
00:15:58.085 --> 00:16:01.885
after he had taken all the money and was about to leave.

221
00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:12.785
A total of 75,000 yen.

222
00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:16.685
Living in a big condo like this and this is all there is.

223
00:16:18.685 --> 00:16:22.385
Well, guess it's time to be leaving.

224
00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:42.885
Hello, Yoshida residence.

225
00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:45.085
We are out at the moment.

226
00:16:45.085 --> 00:16:51.885
Please leave your name and message after the peep sound.

227
00:16:51.885 --> 00:16:54.185
It's me...

228
00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:55.785
Dr. Agasa.

229
00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:58.685
I'm in the neighborhood right now.

230
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.185
Do you remember the 5,000,000 yen I borrowed?

231
00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:02.785
Well, I thought I 'd like to return it

232
00:17:02.785 --> 00:17:05.085
and have just been to the bank to withdraw the money.

233
00:17:05.085 --> 00:17:06.785
5,000,000 yen?

234
00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:11.285
The patient money for that invention came in.

235
00:17:11.285 --> 00:17:15.385
You' re probably just at the nearby supermarket, aren't you?

236
00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:17.585
I'll be right there.

237
00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:23.485
That's right.

238
00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:27.085
Conan probably got in contact with Dr. Agasa for me.

239
00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:28.385
Hey!

240
00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:31.885
That guy who just called is he your grandfather?

241
00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:38.285
5,000,000 yen.

242
00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:40.785
I can't let it go by...

243
00:17:51.885 --> 00:17:54.085
It's me, open the door.

244
00:17:59.485 --> 00:18:00.585
Alright.

245
00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:11.785
Oh, no.

246
00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:14.285
Dr. Agasa will be caught too.

247
00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:15.885
What should I do?

248
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.085
Here it is, here it is.

249
00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:28.785
Who are you?

250
00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:30.285
Where's the old man?

251
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:32.785
There was only me from the very beginning.

252
00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:35.185
You're a robber, aren't you?

253
00:18:36.585 --> 00:18:38.485
Do you know that...

254
00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:42.285
if a soccer ball hits you it hurts pretty bad?

255
00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:46.585
Especially a ball

256
00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:50.785
that's kicked with these Hyper-Shoes!

257
00:19:00.285 --> 00:19:01.385
Ayumi!

258
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.185
Are you alright?

259
00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:10.785
Wait, I'll set you free right now.

260
00:19:22.685 --> 00:19:25.385
You brat... now you've done it.

261
00:19:25.385 --> 00:19:28.685
Darn it, it didn't do any good with that helmet.

262
00:19:28.685 --> 00:19:30.785
You won't get away for nothing.

263
00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:35.485
Die!

264
00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:36.885
-Stop it! -Stop it!

265
00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:43.985
Who are you guys?

266
00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:45.285
Genta Kojima.

267
00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.285
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya.

268
00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:49.285
-The Youth Detective Squad. -The Youth Detective Squad.

269
00:19:49.285 --> 00:19:50.985
What's that?

270
00:19:50.985 --> 00:19:52.085
Run!

271
00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:54.185
Don't make a fool of an adult!

272
00:20:06.785 --> 00:20:08.585
We did it.

273
00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:10.185
We sure did.

274
00:20:11.985 --> 00:20:16.185
Great victory for the Youth Detective Squad!

275
00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:17.685
You guys...

276
00:20:20.985 --> 00:20:24.085
-Awesome. -We did something great.

277
00:21:56.785 --> 00:21:59.285
"The Beika Park, few days later"

278
00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:03.385
Ayumi, I'm glad you've gotten rid of your cold.

279
00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:06.385
My voice is back to normal too.

280
00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:08.185
But, that perpetrator...

281
00:22:08.185 --> 00:22:11.185
I was surprised to find out that he was a different guy

282
00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:12.785
from that robbery and murder case.

283
00:22:12.785 --> 00:22:16.485
That murderer was caught in Yokohama, wasn't he?

284
00:22:16.485 --> 00:22:18.285
According to Inspector Megure,

285
00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:20.285
the perpetrator that entered Ayumi's home

286
00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:24.585
didn't have intentions of harming her.

287
00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:26.385
Even if she saw his face,

288
00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:30.285
he thought that a child wouldn't have the ability to testify.

289
00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:33.485
But, he did attack Conan.

290
00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.085
So, it's only proper that he get caught.

291
00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:36.885
Idiot!

292
00:22:36.885 --> 00:22:39.885
What do you mean by, "only proper that he get caught"!

293
00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:42.785
Things just went well this time.

294
00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:48.085
From the next time, wait for the police before doing anything.

295
00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:50.685
Yes. We'll do that the next time.

296
00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.385
It's alright if you understand.

297
00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:56.785
Hey, let's go ride the swings.

298
00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:58.885
-Let's go, let's go. -Let's do that.

299
00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:02.785
I wonder if they really understand.

300
00:23:02.785 --> 00:23:05.485
Shinichi, that goes for you too.

301
00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:06.685
I know.

302
00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:09.085
As much as possible, I try not to get them involved.

303
00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:10.085
Not that.

304
00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:12.585
Your brain may be an adult

305
00:23:12.585 --> 00:23:15.385
remember that your body's a grade school child.

306
00:23:15.385 --> 00:23:16.785
In the first place...

307
00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:18.485
Dr. Agasa!

308
00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:20.385
Thank you!

309
00:23:20.385 --> 00:23:22.085
If it weren't for your phone call,

310
00:23:22.085 --> 00:23:24.685
the perpetrator would've got away.

311
00:23:29.385 --> 00:23:31.285
I don't mind you using my voice

312
00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:33.785
but, why did you have to make me a grandfather?

313
00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:35.885
Sorry, sorry.

314
00:23:35.885 --> 00:23:40.985
Anyway, having grandchildren like them would be pretty nice.

315
00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:48.685
Okay, shall Grandfather give you a push?

316
00:23:48.685 --> 00:23:51.085
He's completely into the role.

317
00:23:51.085 --> 00:23:54.585
He should be looking for a bride before grandchildren.

318
00:24:03.385 --> 00:24:07.785
"Next Episode"

319
00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:09.785
Ran, keep an eye on that window.

320
00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:20.385
It's blood.

321
00:24:27.985 --> 00:24:29.285
Next Conan,

322
00:24:29.285 --> 00:24:32.585
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 1)"

323
00:24:33.987 --> 00:24:36.187
Next Conan's Hint:

324
00:24:36.187 --> 00:24:38.487
"Pendant"

325
00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:39.687
The movie is coming soon.

326
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:41.987
This week is the 40th anniversary of Shounen Sunday,

327
00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:43.387
congratulation.
