1
00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:03.515
On our way home from fishing

2
00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:08.715
when Mr. Subaru came to pick us up instead of Dr. Agasa,

3
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.715
we stopped over at the Ikkaku Rock,

4
00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:13.115
that is known for the legend of the one-horned dragon.

5
00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:16.215
There, we find the names of fish,

6
00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.915
mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish carved on the rock,

7
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.015
as well as the dead body of a woman wearing a wet suit.

8
00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.015
It looked as if she got messed up in a diving accident

9
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:28.415
and escaped to the rock,

10
00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:30.415
but help failed to come and she died of dehydration.

11
00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:32.315
But, I wasn't deceived.

12
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:35.015
Even though the woman was wearing lipstick,

13
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:39.215
there were no signs of any lipstick on the regulator near her.

14
00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:43.915
This is homicide set up to look like an accidental death.

15
00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.615
Moreover, we found a diver's watch

16
00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:52.015
that seems to have been used to carve words on the rock.

17
00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.315
I noticed that a part of the words in the back was scratched off.

18
00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.615
The name of the woman who died is Ms. Hikari Akamine.

19
00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:03.915
According to her three male friends that say they're her diving friends,

20
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:07.515
Hikari seems to have disappeared while diving three days ago.

21
00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:12.915
Who on earth could've left Hikari alone at Ikkaku Rock

22
00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:14.415
to dehydrate to death?

23
00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.115
And, what's hidden behind the names of fish

24
00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:23.515
mackerel, carp, sea bream, and flatfish?

25
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.215
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

26
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.615
Saturday nights are for mystery.

27
00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:34.815
Fish messages left behind on a Dragon legend rock.

28
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:36.415
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:38.115
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:40.215
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:27.542
"The Ikkau Rock Where Fish Disappear (Part 2)"

32
00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:33.142
That's what she gets for being reckless when she can't even swim.

33
00:03:33.142 --> 00:03:35.342
She couldn't swim and yet she went diving?

34
00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:38.742
Yes, there are a lot of divers who can't swim.

35
00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:42.442
Because we can use fins and breathe using a tank.

36
00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:47.342
By the way, what's your relationship with Hikari?

37
00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:49.942
We're just her diving friends.

38
00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:53.342
In the beginning, only we were diving together

39
00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:56.242
"Rokusuke Oto (23)" -but Hikari said she wanted to join us,

40
00:03:56.242 --> 00:03:58.842
so we started diving together.

41
00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:01.942
"Shuhei Aosato (25)" -Using her cruiser,

42
00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.042
we could dive at any diving point we wanted too.

43
00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.442
"Yasuji Kaida (24)" -With her around,

44
00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:08.842
we got to eat gorgeous gourmet dishes too.

45
00:04:08.842 --> 00:04:15.542
But, don't people usual scuba dive in pairs of two?

46
00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.642
How did you lose track of Hikari?

47
00:04:18.642 --> 00:04:22.042
Hikari swims of ahead of us on her own,

48
00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.642
saying things like she wants to be alone when in the water.

49
00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:26.742
A half a month ago,

50
00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.142
because of that she was taken in by the current

51
00:04:29.142 --> 00:04:31.242
and had the fright of her life.

52
00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:32.342
Yes.

53
00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:34.142
If that didn't happen,

54
00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:36.842
Yoshiro wouldn't be dead.

55
00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:40.842
Yoshiro?

56
00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:41.842
Oh, well...

57
00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:42.942
Don't talk about Yoshiro.

58
00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:45.442
It has nothing to do with what we're talking about now.

59
00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:49.742
By the way, Mr. Kaida.

60
00:04:49.742 --> 00:04:52.742
What happened to your eye?

61
00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:56.642
Last night, he punched me

62
00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:59.442
when I said that Hikari's probably in bed

63
00:04:59.442 --> 00:05:00.742
at some man's place,

64
00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:02.942
so to just leave her as she is.

65
00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:06.442
He got angry saying what if the worst happens.

66
00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:09.742
Then what about the mask you're wearing Mr. Oto?

67
00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.342
Hikari forced me to go diving

68
00:05:11.342 --> 00:05:13.642
when I wasn't feeling all that well...

69
00:05:16.242 --> 00:05:19.242
so I caught a cold and it's taking me forever to recover.

70
00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:23.342
Oh, but I'm diving without worrying about a thing now, though.

71
00:05:23.342 --> 00:05:24.542
Mr. Aosato.

72
00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:27.442
Under your lip... did you hurt yourself?

73
00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:29.042
Pimples.

74
00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:31.742
Last night when I was net surfing at an internet cafe

75
00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:33.342
and was holding my head in my hands,

76
00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:35.142
I burst a pimple.

77
00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:38.642
What were you net surfing for?

78
00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:41.942
What else but information on Hikari?

79
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.042
I was checking to see if there were any young guys who saw her at sea

80
00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:48.142
and picked her up or something even if the chances were really slight...

81
00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:50.242
I was checking blogs on the subject.

82
00:05:50.242 --> 00:05:52.742
Hey, you guys.

83
00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:55.042
What kind of fish do you like?

84
00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:58.242
Please answer one by one.

85
00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:02.042
Tell us! I like eels!

86
00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:04.942
What's with these kids?

87
00:06:04.942 --> 00:06:06.642
Well, you see...

88
00:06:06.642 --> 00:06:09.342
Hey! What's with you guys blurting out

89
00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:11.442
something weird like that out of the blue?

90
00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:13.242
It's not weird!

91
00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:17.242
That dying message of sea bream and flatfish.

92
00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:22.742
They could be the names of the fish that the culprit liked.

93
00:06:22.742 --> 00:06:23.842
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:27.842
No, they've got a point.

95
00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:32.942
It's not unusual that an innocent idea not bound by common sense

96
00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:36.942
will serve as a key to revealing the truth.

97
00:06:36.942 --> 00:06:40.242
Isn't that how you solved many cases,

98
00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:43.342
using the words of this boy as a clue?

99
00:06:43.342 --> 00:06:47.442
Well... I wouldn't say that many, but...

100
00:06:47.442 --> 00:06:51.442
Hey, do you guys have fish that you like a lot?

101
00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:54.942
All three of us love fish.

102
00:06:54.942 --> 00:06:57.342
We don't have any particular fish we don't like either.

103
00:06:57.342 --> 00:06:58.642
So they say.

104
00:07:00.642 --> 00:07:04.642
Hey, hey, just how long to plan to stay here?

105
00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:08.242
Right, the sun'll go down soon too.

106
00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:14.742
You all have the same diver's watch as Hikari's.

107
00:07:14.742 --> 00:07:16.442
Yes.

108
00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:19.442
Hikari made it for us.

109
00:07:19.442 --> 00:07:24.242
She wanted us to all have something in common as a diving team.

110
00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:28.242
She carved the name Akamine Angel Fish Club on the watch.

111
00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:31.742
Angel fish?

112
00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:37.042
I'll hear you out at the station.

113
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:39.842
I want to hear if you have anything will lead to the culprit too.

114
00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:41.142
Culprit...

115
00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:43.942
You mean this is not an accident?

116
00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:47.042
Right. There's a killer

117
00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:50.642
and most probably among the three here.

118
00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:52.442
But, what can it be?

119
00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:54.342
The dying message having to do with fish

120
00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:57.842
mackerel, carp, sea bream, flatfish.

121
00:07:57.842 --> 00:08:00.142
What on earth does it mean?

122
00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:03.942
Besides the word on the diver's watch that was scratched out...

123
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:05.942
Why only the word fish?

124
00:08:05.942 --> 00:08:07.142
I get it.

125
00:08:07.142 --> 00:08:10.342
The name of fish.

126
00:08:10.342 --> 00:08:12.842
If you add words to it and connect it,

127
00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:14.642
it'll form a phrase.

128
00:08:14.642 --> 00:08:15.742
Add?

129
00:08:15.742 --> 00:08:17.542
If you add "ku" to "saba" (mackerel),

130
00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:18.642
it makes the word "sabaku" meaning desert!

131
00:08:18.642 --> 00:08:20.142
Add "ai" to "tai" (sea bream),

132
00:08:20.142 --> 00:08:21.542
it makes the phrase, "I want to see you."

133
00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.742
In other words, the message is,

134
00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:27.942
"I want to see you so come to the desert!"

135
00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:30.342
Then what about flatfish?

136
00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:31.942
It means to be inspired,

137
00:08:31.942 --> 00:08:35.942
(hirameke-flatfish+ke) of this reading the message.

138
00:08:35.942 --> 00:08:40.842
But who's going to wait for who at the desert?

139
00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:43.642
That woman's dead.

140
00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:46.342
Right.

141
00:08:46.342 --> 00:08:49.442
Besides, so conveniently adding certain letters

142
00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:51.442
to words and connecting them forcibly to make phrases,

143
00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:53.642
I don't think leads to solving anything.

144
00:08:53.642 --> 00:08:56.342
Whether letters are added or removed,

145
00:08:56.342 --> 00:08:57.442
there's got to be a key word

146
00:08:57.442 --> 00:08:58.942
that serves as a hint as to what should be done.

147
00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:03.042
Great work, you guys!

148
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.342
What?

149
00:09:05.342 --> 00:09:08.342
So, you can't make light of innocent remarks after all.

150
00:09:09.542 --> 00:09:11.142
Don't tell me you...

151
00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:12.342
Figured out the culprit?

152
00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:15.742
Yes, thanks to all of you.

153
00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:17.642
What do you mean?

154
00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:20.542
The culprit was telling us who he was to begin with.

155
00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:26.642
That he was the one who left Hikari back at Ikkaku Rock

156
00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:28.942
and killed her.

157
00:09:28.942 --> 00:09:32.742
Hey, hey, the sun's really going to set if you don't hurry.

158
00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:37.842
Don't you think we should take Hikari's body to land as soon as possible?

159
00:09:37.842 --> 00:09:40.342
If you still have something you want to ask us,

160
00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:42.742
you can do so to your heart's content back at the station.

161
00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.742
Okay, carry her body onto the boat...

162
00:09:44.742 --> 00:09:45.942
-Wait a second! -Wait a second!

163
00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:50.042
What, both of you?

164
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:53.142
Well... this boy wants to talk to you.

165
00:09:54.142 --> 00:09:57.242
But if you have something you want to say, you can go ahead, Subaru.

166
00:09:57.242 --> 00:10:02.042
So, I'll hear everyone out to their heart's content back at the station.

167
00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:04.442
But, then...

168
00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:09.642
All proof that is here will be hidden.

169
00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.042
Isn't that right?

170
00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:12.142
Sort of.

171
00:10:12.142 --> 00:10:15.742
Proof? What proof are you talking about?

172
00:10:15.742 --> 00:10:19.942
Can't you tell?

173
00:10:19.942 --> 00:10:22.242
Of course, it's proof of the culprit

174
00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:26.642
who left that woman back here at Ikkaku Rock

175
00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:29.142
leaving her to dehydrate to dehydrate to death.

176
00:10:29.142 --> 00:10:30.442
Hey, hey.

177
00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:33.042
Hiding proof means... Don't tell me that...

178
00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.042
Yes, he's probably here.

179
00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:39.142
The culprit is among one of us.

180
00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:40.642
Wait up!

181
00:10:40.642 --> 00:10:43.042
How do you know something like that?

182
00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.142
It's true that Hikari disappeared

183
00:10:45.142 --> 00:10:49.442
while she was diving with us three days ago but...

184
00:10:49.442 --> 00:10:50.742
It could be that she was picked up

185
00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:55.542
by some bad guy and was left behind here!

186
00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:58.342
No, that's close to impossible.

187
00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.942
You said when Hikari disappeared

188
00:11:01.942 --> 00:11:03.242
that you received text mail from her saying,

189
00:11:03.242 --> 00:11:05.442
"I'll leave the rest to you guy", right?

190
00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:10.842
That's proof that the culprit is among you.

191
00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:12.342
I think that the culprit sent that mail

192
00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:16.242
so that you wouldn't go out to search for Hikari right away

193
00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:18.242
after he left her behind at the site.

194
00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:20.942
In order to do so, he had to come on board the boat

195
00:11:20.942 --> 00:11:22.742
from diving earlier than everyone else

196
00:11:22.742 --> 00:11:24.742
look for Hikari's cell phone,

197
00:11:24.742 --> 00:11:28.642
"I'll leave the rest to you guy" -and send the mail out.

198
00:11:28.642 --> 00:11:29.942
"Sent"

199
00:11:30.542 --> 00:11:32.242
Unlike the phone, the address remains

200
00:11:32.242 --> 00:11:33.942
when you mail something out.

201
00:11:33.942 --> 00:11:36.842
So, it had to be sent using Hikari's address

202
00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:38.542
to avoid being suspected.

203
00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:41.842
I see, so the only ones who could've sent the mail

204
00:11:41.842 --> 00:11:44.942
are the ones who knew

205
00:11:44.942 --> 00:11:47.442
that it wouldn't be strange for her to be sending you mail.

206
00:11:47.442 --> 00:11:48.842
But...

207
00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.442
where's Hikari's cell phone that you're talking about?

208
00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:56.042
Well, if it were me, after I send the mail

209
00:11:56.042 --> 00:11:59.942
I would dispose of it in this vast sea.

210
00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:02.742
Then, there is no proof.

211
00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:04.242
Not so.

212
00:12:04.242 --> 00:12:09.442
Not only proof, Hikari left us the name of the culprit.

213
00:12:09.442 --> 00:12:12.142
Isn't that right,

214
00:12:12.142 --> 00:12:15.042
Mr. Shuhei Aosato?

215
00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:35.606
Hey, cut out that weird talk.

216
00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:38.806
It's like you're saying that I'm the one who did it.

217
00:12:38.806 --> 00:12:43.706
Besides, how did you know that his name is Shuhei, kid?

218
00:12:43.706 --> 00:12:46.206
We only gave you our last names.

219
00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:53.206
Hikari carved the name of the culprit on the Ikkaku Rock,

220
00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:56.206
that's why I know. Your full name Shuhei Aosato.

221
00:12:57.506 --> 00:12:59.306
Where is something like that written?

222
00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:03.606
Carved? You mean the name of fish?

223
00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:06.206
But, the only names written were mackerel,

224
00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:07.906
carp, sea bream and flatfish?

225
00:13:07.906 --> 00:13:09.706
It's true if you look at only that

226
00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.306
it looks like the names of fish are carved but...

227
00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:14.406
If you take into consideration

228
00:13:14.406 --> 00:13:19.406
the word that was scratched out in back of Hikari's diver's watch,

229
00:13:19.406 --> 00:13:21.306
it comes to light, doesn't it?

230
00:13:21.306 --> 00:13:23.206
Was something scratched out?

231
00:13:23.206 --> 00:13:28.806
Yes. The word in between "Akamine Angel" and "club" were...

232
00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:31.706
Akamine Angel Fish Club.

233
00:13:31.706 --> 00:13:35.606
The word that was scratched out was fish.

234
00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:36.706
In other words,

235
00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:38.606
she wanted you to scratch out the word fish.

236
00:13:38.606 --> 00:13:42.006
-Yes. -Wait, please.

237
00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:44.406
The word fish?

238
00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:49.606
Mackerel, carp, sea bream and flatfish are all fish!

239
00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:54.906
If you scratch out fish, they'll all disappear.

240
00:13:54.906 --> 00:13:57.506
I get it, kanji characters.

241
00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.406
You change the names of the fish into kanji characters

242
00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:04.606
and cross out the fish part of it.

243
00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:05.706
Kanji?

244
00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:09.206
Is there a kanji character for mackerel?

245
00:14:09.206 --> 00:14:11.606
Yes, you write the word "fish" to the left of the kanji

246
00:14:11.606 --> 00:14:15.206
and "Ao" to the right making the word mackerel.

247
00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:18.806
"Fish" on the left and "Sato" to the right, carp.

248
00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:24.306
"Fish" to the left and "Shuu" to the right, sea bream.

249
00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:29.906
And to the left and "Hei" to the right makes flatfish.

250
00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:34.406
If you remove the "fish" part from all the kanji characters...

251
00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.106
Ao.

252
00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:38.206
Sato.

253
00:14:38.206 --> 00:14:40.406
Shu.

254
00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:41.506
Hei.

255
00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:44.406
"Aosato Shuhei"

256
00:14:44.406 --> 00:14:47.306
-Aosato Shuhei! -Aosato Shuhei!

257
00:14:47.306 --> 00:14:49.206
-Hey! -You...

258
00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:52.306
No way. Don't take them seriously.

259
00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:55.706
No one's going to make a culprit out of me

260
00:14:55.706 --> 00:14:57.806
using such a riddle like reason.

261
00:14:57.806 --> 00:14:59.506
But...

262
00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:02.906
It seems pretty logical to me.

263
00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:06.506
But, if I'm the culprit

264
00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.706
all she had to do was write my name as is, right?

265
00:15:08.706 --> 00:15:12.706
She probably thought that you'd erase it if she did.

266
00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:17.706
You know, when you come back here to confirm if she died.

267
00:15:17.706 --> 00:15:20.006
What're you talking about?

268
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:23.306
Did you see me come here or what?

269
00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:25.306
No, we didn't.

270
00:15:25.306 --> 00:15:30.406
But, we know the other reason why you came here today, Mr. Aosato.

271
00:15:30.406 --> 00:15:31.506
What?

272
00:15:31.506 --> 00:15:34.306
To switch the regulator.

273
00:15:34.306 --> 00:15:39.006
You probably slashed the pipe of Hikari's regulator with a knife

274
00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:43.306
and after faking an air leak brought her here to Ikkaku Rock

275
00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:45.506
lied to her saying that you'd be coming back to get her

276
00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:47.506
and left her behind like you did, right?

277
00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:51.506
People don't come to Ikkaku Rock

278
00:15:51.506 --> 00:15:55.706
and since Hikari can't swim you figured she couldn't escape.

279
00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:59.206
In other words, you came to switch

280
00:15:59.206 --> 00:16:03.406
that slashed regulator with your own.

281
00:16:03.406 --> 00:16:05.206
If the slash is found later,

282
00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:07.206
the case would not be handled as an accident.

283
00:16:07.206 --> 00:16:10.106
If you close off the slash with a vinyl tape or something,

284
00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:12.806
you can make it back with that regulator.

285
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:16.006
So, I'm asking if you guys saw me do that?

286
00:16:16.006 --> 00:16:17.906
The band-aid by your lip...

287
00:16:18.906 --> 00:16:22.306
You said that you busted a pimple

288
00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:24.206
while you were net surfing at an internet cafe

289
00:16:24.206 --> 00:16:27.206
with your head in your hands, right?

290
00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:30.406
Most of the mouse in internet cafes are for right-handed people.

291
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.906
Which means that you were holding your head with your left hand

292
00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:38.406
so the busted pimple should naturally be below your left chin.

293
00:16:38.406 --> 00:16:40.806
But, judging from the position of the bandage...

294
00:16:40.806 --> 00:16:42.806
The Band-Aid is not under your left side, is it?

295
00:16:43.806 --> 00:16:45.706
It got smeared on, didn't it?

296
00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:48.606
When you went back to the boat to switch regulators

297
00:16:48.606 --> 00:16:51.106
with Hikari's and put it in your mouth?

298
00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:52.306
Oh, no...

299
00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:56.106
Hikari's lipstick.

300
00:16:58.006 --> 00:17:01.606
I see. When you got on board and wiped your mouth

301
00:17:01.606 --> 00:17:04.806
you realized for the first time that lipstick was smeared on you.

302
00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:07.306
So, you hid the lipstick that smeared under your right lip

303
00:17:07.306 --> 00:17:11.206
by using Band-Aid, right?

304
00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:13.906
Lipstick doesn't come off that easily

305
00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:16.806
just by wiping it off with your hand.

306
00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:19.506
But, she sure is a strange diver.

307
00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:21.306
I mean if she was a beginner I can see,

308
00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.206
but, she's been diving for some time,

309
00:17:23.206 --> 00:17:26.006
and yet why did she dive without removing her lipstick?

310
00:17:26.006 --> 00:17:27.606
She did so deliberately.

311
00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:30.206
When she first started diving,

312
00:17:30.206 --> 00:17:33.606
I mistakenly used her regulator and got lipstick smeared on me.

313
00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:35.706
She thought that was funny,

314
00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:40.106
so she continued to keep her lipstick on when diving.

315
00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:44.106
Well... thanks to that,

316
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:48.306
we found out that Hikari left Yoshiro to die.

317
00:17:49.306 --> 00:17:50.906
Left him to die?

318
00:17:50.906 --> 00:17:55.006
Do you remember the accident 6 months ago?

319
00:17:55.006 --> 00:18:00.106
Yes, you mean when Hikari was taken by the current at the lake

320
00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:02.706
and Yoshiro went to save her.

321
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:05.106
We somehow managed to find Hikari

322
00:18:05.106 --> 00:18:07.206
and pull her up to the boat but...

323
00:18:07.206 --> 00:18:11.506
Yoshiro was dead a while later.

324
00:18:11.506 --> 00:18:15.506
Hey, don't tell me that Yoshiro was near Hikari back then too?

325
00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:18.006
Yes, it's likely.

326
00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:21.206
But, that isn't what she said back then.

327
00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:25.906
I'm alone. Sorry and let me on board.

328
00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:28.106
It's so cold I'll freeze to death.

329
00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:30.506
So, we all thought...

330
00:18:30.506 --> 00:18:33.706
She didn't see Yoshiro.

331
00:18:33.706 --> 00:18:36.306
Of course, she saw him,

332
00:18:36.306 --> 00:18:39.906
because on the Yoshiro's rescue regulator that was found later.

333
00:18:39.906 --> 00:18:44.806
Hikari's lipstick was smeared all over it.

334
00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:46.706
When I pushed her for an answer,

335
00:18:46.706 --> 00:18:48.206
she said that she thought that Yoshiro

336
00:18:48.206 --> 00:18:51.206
had already swum back to land but...

337
00:18:51.206 --> 00:18:53.406
Isn't it natural to ask right away?

338
00:18:53.406 --> 00:18:55.306
About Yoshiro who came to rescue her

339
00:18:55.306 --> 00:18:58.906
and got caught in the current again, wondering if he's okay.

340
00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:01.806
All she was concerned about was getting back on land

341
00:19:01.806 --> 00:19:04.806
and jumping into a warm bed!

342
00:19:04.806 --> 00:19:09.206
She could care less if Yoshiro lived or died!

343
00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:16.006
That's why I left that woman behind at Ikkaku Rock here.

344
00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:17.306
Well...

345
00:19:21.706 --> 00:19:24.706
You're all going to experience the same thing!

346
00:19:24.706 --> 00:19:27.306
Shuhei, don't be stupid!

347
00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:30.806
Don't worry.

348
00:19:30.806 --> 00:19:34.006
I'm just going to buy time until I get out of here.

349
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.606
You guys are staying here for a while.

350
00:19:36.606 --> 00:19:38.306
Hey, officer!

351
00:19:38.306 --> 00:19:40.906
Tell your men on board the boat,

352
00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:44.606
that you're returning on my cruiser while listening to my story,

353
00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:47.006
so to go on back without you.

354
00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:50.406
And when the police boat is out of sight...

355
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.106
Fisherman!

356
00:19:52.106 --> 00:19:57.906
Cut the rope that is tied to the rock and let it go.

357
00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:00.306
When the fishing boat is out of sight,

358
00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:02.506
I'm taking this child

359
00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:05.506
and getting out of here with the cruiser!

360
00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:09.606
Darn. My watch type tranquilizer gun's on the boat.

361
00:20:09.606 --> 00:20:11.206
Although it's a bit dangerous

362
00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:14.106
I'll use my super kick shoe.

363
00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:17.206
I'm wearing boots.

364
00:20:17.206 --> 00:20:21.106
Hey, Ai, don't you have anything that may serve as a weapon?

365
00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:23.806
What makes you think I'd have something so convenient on me.

366
00:20:30.306 --> 00:20:33.106
0.12 percent...

367
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.506
What?

368
00:20:34.506 --> 00:20:38.506
That's the rate that a culprit makes a safe escape.

369
00:20:38.506 --> 00:20:40.806
It's one in a thousand people.

370
00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:45.506
But, those few who have received the blessing of the devil

371
00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:48.606
and fled will eventually tire from hiding their true identities,

372
00:20:48.606 --> 00:20:51.406
living in fear and continue living on.

373
00:20:51.406 --> 00:20:53.106
Putting aside those who have confessed

374
00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:55.806
to their crime or committed suicide,

375
00:20:55.806 --> 00:20:58.806
the success rated is virtually...

376
00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:00.906
nil.

377
00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:03.806
Will you be able to endure being all alone

378
00:21:03.806 --> 00:21:08.306
as well as the pressure of all that is to come?

379
00:21:09.306 --> 00:21:10.606
Shut up!

380
00:21:23.606 --> 00:21:26.906
Okay, you're fine now.

381
00:21:26.906 --> 00:21:28.006
Thank you.

382
00:21:32.806 --> 00:21:37.106
Well, then, shall we have you flee all the way to the station?

383
00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:39.006
Yes, sir.

384
00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:44.506
You're sure strong!

385
00:21:44.506 --> 00:21:46.306
Really awesome!

386
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.606
Not really...

387
00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:50.206
Thank you, Subaru.

388
00:21:50.206 --> 00:21:55.806
Is what you said about 0.12 percent really true?

389
00:21:55.806 --> 00:21:58.406
Of course, it's a lie.

390
00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:01.906
I thought I had no choice

391
00:22:01.906 --> 00:22:04.806
but to provoke him if I wanted him to divert

392
00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:07.206
the knife away from her.

393
00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:09.106
You're really something after all.

394
00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:02.006
Just as I thought. He's...

395
00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:09.806
She has been choked to death.

396
00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:11.106
Manual strangulation.

397
00:24:11.106 --> 00:24:13.706
Excuse me. There are green stains

398
00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:16.806
on both shoulders of Ms. Yukiko.

399
00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:20.606
Yukiko took the stairs all the way down to B1.

400
00:24:20.606 --> 00:24:23.206
Why didn't she use the elevator?

401
00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:26.606
The one who killed Yukiko...

402
00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:28.106
is among them.

403
00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:30.306
Next Conan,

404
00:24:30.306 --> 00:24:34.139
"Hands that Play Chords of Discord"

405
00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:51.876
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:51.876 --> 00:24:54.176
"Crayon".

407
00:24:54.176 --> 00:24:56.776
Shin, your name is Shinichi, isn't it?

408
00:24:56.776 --> 00:24:59.276
You can't say it with that kind of timing.
