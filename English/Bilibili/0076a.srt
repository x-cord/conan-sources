Today's the Kaitou Kid special!
Detective and thief square off!

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.430
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.390
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:38.514
I'm high school student
Kudo Shinichi.

8
00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:40.724
I went with Mori Ran,
childhood friend and classmate,

9
00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:42.344
to an amusement park,

10
00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:45.644
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal involving a man in black.

11
00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:50.394
I was so engrossed with watching
that I didn't see his partner hiding!

12
00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:54.094
I was knocked down
and given a poison.

13
00:01:54.094 --> 00:01:57.234
When I woke up,
my body had shrunk!

14
00:01:57.764 --> 00:02:00.224
If they learned
Kudo Shinichi was alive,

15
00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.434
people around me would be in danger!

16
00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.534
After following Prof. Agasa's
advice to conceal my identity,

17
00:02:05.534 --> 00:02:08.084
Ran asked me my
name and I quickly said...

... "Edogawa Conan!"

19
00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:13.304
Then, to uncover
information about them,

20
00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:16.934
I moved in with Ran
and her detective father.

No one's really

69
00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:15.974
According to Sonoko, he steals art

70
00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:19.184
and his top secret FBI or CIA

71
00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:21.804
or Interpol number was 1412.

72
00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:24.944
"International Criminal Number"
or Interpol number was 1412.

73
00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:30.244
The leading theory is that people
learned the number and it just stuck!

74

75
00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:36.634
Apparently he has a different

00:11:39.334 --> 00:11:42.764
I want to know about
him before I meet him!

173
00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:45.764
Meet him?! You know where he is?!

174
00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:50.004
Yup! I've figured out his route inside!

175
00:11:50.004 --> 00:11:52.344
Then why didn't you tell the police?!

176
00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:55.084
I suddenly wanna see it, too...

177
00:11:55.084 --> 00:12:00.304
...the face of a retro thief who sends
warning notices in this day and age!

178
00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:08.044
The "two" in "when
the moon splits the two"

179
00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:09.724
refers to a satellite and the sun!

180
00:12:09.724 --> 00:12:16.444
And if the splitting refers to the moon
creating an eclipse between them...

181
00:12:16.844 --> 00:12:22.404
...then he'll show up between
12:30 and 4:00 am when BS TV is off!

182
00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:27.864
Yes! The Black Star's initials
are BS (Broadcast Satellite)!

183
00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:31.914
If the "waves" refer to
a satellite signal...

184
00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:35.874
...then he'll be coming from
the direction of the BS signal!

185
00:12:36.684 --> 00:12:39.974
The BS signal is sent from
south to west at a 45 degree angle

186
00:12:39.974 --> 00:12:44.804
and from 42.3 degrees above the horizon.

187
00:12:44.804 --> 00:12:51.304
The only place that fits the bill
is the roof of the Haido City Hotel!

188
00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:03.264
Inspector! A strange kid ran
into the hotel! What do we do?!

189
00:13:03.264 --> 00:13:06.324
Nothing. There's only
one person I'm after.

190
00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:11.534
And not even he
could dress up as a child.

191
00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:27.514
Employees Only

192
00:13:40.764 --> 00:13:44.954
Beika Museum is...
right around there.

193
00:13:47.184 --> 00:13:49.264
12:28.

194
00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:51.804
Now I just wait for him to show up...

195
00:13:54.974 --> 00:13:56.694
Hello? Professor?

196
00:13:56.694 --> 00:13:58.164
Hi, Shinichi.

197
00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:02.634
I checked your dad's files
with recent newspaper articles.

198
00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:07.594
Kaitou ♪1412 is enveloped
in quite a bit of mystery.

199
00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:12.054
His first appearance
was in Paris eighteen years ago.

200
00:14:12.054 --> 00:14:16.314
He suddenly disappeared ten
years later and was presumed dead,

201
00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:23.264
but he's back after eight years
and is primarily active in Japan.

202
00:14:23.264 --> 00:14:27.784
Eighteen years ago?
He must be pretty old then...

203
00:14:28.094 --> 00:14:30.764
He has all kinds of names...

204
00:14:30.764 --> 00:14:33.494
"The Modern Lupin,"
"The Moonlight Magician"...

205
00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:38.594
But there's one alias
that people like the most...

206
00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:39.704
Alias?

207
00:14:40.094 --> 00:14:48.594
A young novelist interested
in the crafty Kaitou ♪1412

208
00:14:48.594 --> 00:14:52.684
once jokingly read
the number like so...

209
00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.644
"K I D."

210
00:14:54.884 --> 00:14:57.064
"K I D"?

211
00:14:57.064 --> 00:15:01.774
That's right.
Kaitou ♪1412 is known as...

212
00:15:08.844 --> 00:15:10.934
...the Kaitou Kid!

213
00:15:17.094 --> 00:15:19.764
He landed silently before me,

214
00:15:19.764 --> 00:15:22.514
so as not to disturb
the stillness of the night.

215
00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:27.294
Together with a fearless smile,

216
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.404
as if he saw through everything.

217
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.059
What's going on, Shinichi? Shin--

218
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.189
A cape and a silk hat...

219
00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:50.569
An impenetrable stance...

220
00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:55.109
I can't make out his face,
but he's surprisingly young.

221
00:15:56.029 --> 00:16:00.279
His thirties. Twenties?
No, even younger!

222
00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.499
Hey, little boy.

223
00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:06.289
What are you doing up here?

224
00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:13.589
Fireworks!

225
00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:16.549
What?!

226
00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:19.259
A strange flash and sound?!

227
00:16:19.259 --> 00:16:24.229
Yes. Above the Haido City Hotel,
southwest of the museum.

228
00:16:24.229 --> 00:16:26.939
Shall I check it out,
Commissioner?

229
00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:28.599
Of course you shall!

230
00:16:28.969 --> 00:16:32.819
Look! A helicopter!
I think it noticed!

231
00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:37.489
Seems you're no ordinary kid.

232
00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:41.119
I'm Edogawa Conan. A detective.

233
00:16:42.789 --> 00:16:44.719
Shouldn't you be escaping,
Kaitou Kid-san?

234
00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:48.249
The helicopter will
be here any minute.

235
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.419
I only have one chance to
get him with my tranquilizer gun!

236
00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:56.379
The instant he
turns away to escape!

237
00:16:58.339 --> 00:16:59.179
A radio?!

238
00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:06.809
Chaki here! Kaitou Kid sighted
on top of the Haido City Hotel!

239
00:17:07.889 --> 00:17:11.809
Attention all patrol
cars in Beika and Haido

240
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:15.779
and all helicopters
in the air above Beika!

241
00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:20.009
Proceed to the scene at once
and capture the Kaitou Kid!

242
00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:22.629
He's using my voice!

243
00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:24.989
Wait! That's not me!

244
00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.919
It's his trap!
All units, return at once!

245
00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:31.929
This is Helicopter ♪1!
I'm above the hotel!

246
00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:33.879
Sighting confirmed!

247
00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:35.139
What?!

248
00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:37.969
I think he sent the orders!

249
00:17:39.179 --> 00:17:41.429
This is Nakamori!

250
00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:44.889
Attention all officers
inside the Haido City Hotel!

251
00:17:44.889 --> 00:17:49.849
The Kid's on the roof! Rush
to the scene at once! Seize him!

252
00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:51.879
This guy's incredible...

253
00:17:51.879 --> 00:17:54.819
He can imitate any
voice without a machine!

254
00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:56.279
Damn it!

255
00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.739
Your voice is on the radio!

256
00:17:58.739 --> 00:17:59.029
lt's the Kid! He's using my

257
00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:01.549
Nakamori Ginzo (41)
lt's the Kid! He's using my

258
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:03.819
voice to bring us to him!
Nakamori Ginzo (41)

259
00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:07.909
That's insane!
Why on earth would he do that?!

260
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:10.249
What's he doing?!

261
00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:18.469
Satisfied, Detective?

262
00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:22.679
Freeze, Kid!

263
00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:26.639
Oh, my. Inspector Nakamori.
You certainly arrived quickly.

264
00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:33.309
Ha! You knew I cracked your
code and had the place staked out!

265
00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:38.779
I figured you might hang-glide in,
so I checked everyone in the hotel

266
00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:41.259
and fortified the main entrance,

267
00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:45.989
but I never expected you to go
around Toto Tower and then land here.

268
00:18:46.469 --> 00:18:50.449
Forget about the pearl!
You have nowhere to run!

269
00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:55.919
I'm only here to observe you tonight.
I don't plan to steal anything.

270
00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:56.889
What?!

271
00:18:56.889 --> 00:19:01.259
Oh? I clearly wrote
so at the start of the letter!

272
00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:04.639
"April Fools." It was a lie!

273
00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:07.349
Don't let him escape! Get him!

274
00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:12.059
A flash grenade!

275
00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:14.519
Are you aware, little boy?

276
00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:19.359
A kaitou is a creative artist
who skillfully steals his prey,

277
00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:22.509
but a detective is
nothing more than a critic

278
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:24.949
who finds fault in
what is left behind!

279
00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:25.969
What?!

280
00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:31.579
He disappeared!

281
00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:34.129
He disappeared!

282
00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:35.509
He vanished!

283
00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:39.419
Helicopters! Track him using radar!

284
00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:44.629
It only shows our
three helicopters in the area!

285
00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:48.099
Has he gotten away again?!

286
00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:52.269
This is insane! No one
can just disappear like that!

287
00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:58.019
What's this?!

288
00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:02.549
"On March 19th, I will appear
on the Queen Selizabeth

289
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:07.679
leaving from Yokohama Port
to steal the real Black Star.

Please cancel it,
Commissioner Chaki!
March 19th
--Queen Selizabeth, Yokohama Port

293
00:20:16.209 --> 00:20:18.179
We're dealing with the Kaitou Kid!

294
00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:22.679
We can't let him get near the jewel
with such lousy security as that!

295
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:25.339
Don't be like that,
Nakamori-kun!

296
00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:28.679
Tonight's party is
full of important people!

297
00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:31.129
We can't do anything rough!

298
00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:37.689
Besides, we'll lose face if we
cancel the party out of fear of him!

299
00:20:37.689 --> 00:20:42.049
Don't worry. It'll take three hours
for the ship to get to Tokyo.

300
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:47.699
It's a floating prison! Even if he
does get on, he's like a rat in a trap!

301
00:20:50.619 --> 00:20:54.619
This year marks Suzuki
Industries' 60th anniversary.

302
00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:59.079
This is entirely because
of the support from you all.

303
00:20:59.339 --> 00:21:02.039
Please forget about
sneak thieves for tonight

304
00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:09.509
and enjoy this elegant and grand
party to which 500 have been invited!

305
00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.259
But, first!

306
00:21:13.379 --> 00:21:13.489
I have devised a

307
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:14.759
Suzuki Tomoko (43)
I have devised a

308
00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:16.719
special plan for tonight.
Suzuki Tomoko (43)

309
00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:18.999
Please open the small boxes
given to you before you boarded.
Suzuki Tomoko (43)

310
00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:22.189
Please open the small boxes
given to you before you boarded.

311
00:21:22.429 --> 00:21:26.899
They are my letter of challenge
to any foolish thieves.

312
00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:28.699
This is--

313
00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:32.009
Yes! These are our family's symbol,

314
00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:36.659
as well as the Kaitou Kid's
prey tonight! The Black Star!

315
00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:42.129
Only one is real, of course.
And only I know to whom it was given.

316
00:21:42.129 --> 00:21:46.339
The rest are imitation pearls!

317
00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:50.179
Now, then.
Please put them on your chests

318
00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:55.059
and tell the Kid, "Go ahead
and take it, if you dare"!

319
00:21:55.509 --> 00:21:59.969
Of course, that's assuming he
manages to determine which one is real

320
00:21:59.969 --> 00:22:02.879
during the three hours we're at sea!

321
00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:06.759
Your mom's pretty smart!

322
00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:08.449
What's wrong, Sonoko?

323
00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:11.179
I can't find my sister...

324
00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:13.289
Don't tell me she's still at home!

325
00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:14.949
Yeah, right!

326
00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:15.269
Eh?! The ship already left?!

327
00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:17.759
Suzuki Residence
Eh?! The ship already left?!

328
00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:18.909
How come?!
Suzuki Residence

329
00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:22.629
That's my line!
Do you know what time it is?!

330
00:22:22.629 --> 00:22:27.679
But the commissioner called to
say he was delaying it two hours...

331
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.219
Right, Dad?

332
00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:31.759
Daddy's there?!

333
00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.129
Bastard!

334
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:38.689
Where did the company president go?!

335
00:22:38.689 --> 00:22:40.299
He went to the restroom...

336
00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:50.509
Now I see! He got on
board disguised as the president!

337
00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.909
I thank you, Kaitou Kid!

338
00:22:55.009 --> 00:23:00.219
You've given me a chance to
tear off that bold mask of yours!
