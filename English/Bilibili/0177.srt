1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.240
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.040
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.840
Danger is closing in, Haibara and Conan.

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.840
There are many people appearing in this episode.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.590
On the way home from school,

10
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.290
Haibara and I ran into Gin's car.

11
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.190
One of the Black Organization members.

12
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.190
I set a transmitter and wiretap in his car

13
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.390
and pursue them!

14
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.590
However, Gin destroyed the wiretap when he found them.

15
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.090
They have realized the existence of Haibara!

16
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.690
We found out about their murder plans via wire tap.

17
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.490
So we headed to a farewell party of a movie director

18
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.890
which are held at the Haido City Hotel.

19
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.290
Hey, that politician's gone!

20
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.990
What?

21
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.090
What was that?

22
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.890
A handkerchief?

23
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.490
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Conan Part)"

24
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.690
The chandelier...

25
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.390
What happened?

26
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.890
This is...

27
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.890
What happened?

28
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.690
I don't know.

29
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.290
What is going on?

30
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.490
I wonder.

31
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.090
What on earth is it?

32
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.790
Hey! Will somebody explain what's going on?

33
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.590
Quiet please, everyone!

34
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.590
I am Inspector Megure of the police department!

35
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.090
You're here so early for a change.

36
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.090
I received a report from someone

37
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.990
saying that someone will commit a murder here tonight.

38
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.590
That someone was after the life of Mr. Nomiguchi!

39
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.490
How is he, Officer Takagi?

40
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.690
No good. He is not breathing.

41
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.890
I see. Contact the department right away.

42
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.290
Yes, sir!

43
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.590
He's the killer.

44
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.390
One of the Black Organization's mens who shrunk my body.

45
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.490
Codename, Pisco!

46
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.490
He's still somewhere in here!

47
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.790
Oh. I see.

48
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.990
Then you were the ones closest to Mr. Nomiguchi

49
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.990
when the chandelier came falling?

50
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.990
Yes.

51
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.390
Did you see anyone suspicious at that time?

52
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.890
"Yoshiharu Tawara (58)" -I didn't have time to look

53
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.090
because I was almost crushed by the chandelier too.

54
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.190
Take a look at this!

55
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.690
The chandelier skimmed my suit and it tore.

56
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.090
"Chris Vineyard (29) -I never saw any suspicious characters.

57
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.590
I see.

58
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.990
Inspector, she says she hasn't seen anyone suspicious.

59
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.590
It's an accident, a mere accident!

60
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.890
"Naoya Tarumi (35)" -The chain of the chandelier

61
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.490
old and broke off,

62
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.790
and the politician coincidentally got crushed to death under it.

63
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.290
But somebody reported that

64
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.490
there was going to be a murder, right?

65
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.690
What about that?

66
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.390
"Kenzo Masuyama (71)" -Before you suspect us,

67
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.990
I would sure like to know more

68
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.790
about the person who reported the murder.

69
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.590
After all, that person may be the murderer.

70
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.090
The person was using a voice changer

71
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.890
that we couldn't make out whether it was a man or woman.

72
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.990
"Naomichi Mugikura (43)" -It could've been a prank then.

73
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.990
Many people detested Nomiguchi

74
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.790
for being suspected of bribery.

75
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.290
That's right...

76
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.990
And the accident happened to

77
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.490
take place after the prank call.

78
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.190
"Yasuo Mihei (62)" -He was punished by the heavens!

79
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.690
You really can't get away with evil doings, right?

80
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.790
I don't see how you can eat in this situation.

81
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.290
I wish timid greenhorns would shut up!

82
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.590
Hey, somebody go get the chef!

83
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.790
What the matter?

84
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.090
Did you find a cockroach in there or something?

85
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.290
That's because you at a time like this.

86
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.490
You're being punished by the heavens too!

87
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.490
What?

88
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.390
-Come, now, let's all calm down. -This is...

89
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.690
A piece of broken chain from the chandelier?

90
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.190
Why is this in there?

91
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.290
"Mika Nanjo (38)" -Anyway, politician Nomiguchi died

92
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.790
because the chandelier falls on top of him, right?

93
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.890
If it were homicide,

94
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.190
then there would have had to be a rig of some kind,

95
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.790
and somebody would've had to lure him under the chandelier

96
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.290
after the place got dark.

97
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.790
But there seems to be

98
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.290
no such thing on the chandelier or the ceiling

99
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.790
that it was hanging from either.

100
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.290
Therefore, murder'd be impossible!

101
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.890
Now, that it's cleared.

102
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.790
May I please be excused?

103
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.990
That's true.

104
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.190
Dropping the chandelier on the target in the dark,

105
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.690
unless something were to be set up in advance, it's impossible.

106
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.090
But, the killer succeeded in doing so.

107
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.190
How?

108
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.490
Hey, where're we going?

109
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.790
We're getting out of here.

110
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.690
It's too dangerous to spend meaningless time here any longer!

111
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.890
Besides, if Inspector Megure and the others see us here,

112
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.090
how are we going to explain why we're here?

113
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.290
The only clue is the broken off piece of chain

114
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.890
that you picked up a while ago.

115
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.290
You couldn't possibly figure out

116
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.290
who the killer is with just that.

117
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.690
What if I have two clues?

118
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.090
After the chandelier fell and before the lights came back on,

119
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.690
something came falling.

120
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.390
This handkerchief.

121
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.690
So what?

122
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.590
The name of the killer is not written on it, is it?

123
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.390
See, look in the corner of this handkerchief the words,

124
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.390
"Farewell Party for Director Sakamaki" are sewn on.

125
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.190
The owner of this handkerchief

126
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.890
received it here at the reception desk!

127
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.590
Besides, look at everyone around you.

128
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.290
See, that man with the glass cup,

129
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.390
the plump lady next to him,

130
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.890
and the old man with the beard who is beyond,

131
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.590
they all have handkerchiefs.

132
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.890
The colors are different!

133
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.390
What does that mean?

134
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.690
Probably because they passed out handkerchieves of

135
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.790
seven different colors in memory of

136
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.290
Director Sakamaki's best movie, "Rainbow Colored Handkerchief"

137
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.690
In other words, if we check at the reception desk

138
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.290
on who received purple handkerchiefs,

139
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.190
we can more or less have a clue!

140
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.290
But, we won't be able to determine

141
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.490
whether the owner is involved with the killing.

142
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.390
Yeah. We still can't tell what it was used for

143
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.190
or whether it belongs to the killer or not.

144
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.590
But, the possibility that it has nothing to do with the killing

145
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.390
is not zero, right?

146
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.790
Excuse me, officer.

147
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.490
May I go to the restroom?

148
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.690
Okay.

149
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.290
Hey, hold it, what're you all doing here?

150
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.690
Is it true that politician Nomiguchi passed away?

151
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.490
I hear it was an accident?

152
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.890
How about it?

153
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.390
We'll explain everything later,

154
00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.790
so stand back everyone!

155
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.790
Hey, wait!

156
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.590
Please answer us!

157
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.490
"Enter keyword"

158
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.790
Who did I gave the purple handkerchief to?

159
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.790
Yep! I picked that handkerchief up,

160
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.990
so I want to give it back to the owner!

161
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.590
That handkerchief was supposed to be used for something later, right?

162
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.590
Yes, at the end of the gathering,

163
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.690
a certain color of handkerchief was supposed be chosen,

164
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.890
and the people with it were supposed to make comments.

165
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.890
Can you give me the names!

166
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.390
I'll go look for the person who lost it.

167
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.290
What shall we do, Inspector?

168
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.790
If we hold them back any longer,

169
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.790
we may cause a racket.

170
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.390
It looks like an accident no matter how you look at it too,

171
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.190
so maybe we should let them go for now.

172
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.290
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.890
I've found the person, sonny!

174
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.190
This is the name of the seven people

175
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.190
who are in the room now.

176
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.690
-There! -Thank you!

177
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.990
I see.

178
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.790
Those seven people.

179
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.590
I can't be absolutely sure

180
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.590
but maybe one of their members Pisco is among the seven.

181
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.190
Hey, they're coming out!

182
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.190
Excuse me, were you nearby when the accident occurred?

183
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.090
I don't know! Get out of my way!

184
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.290
Please tell us the details of the accident

185
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.790
Ask the police, not me!

186
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.990
Darn it, let's go back to Dr. Agasa's car for now.

187
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.090
Haibara!

188
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.290
Hey, Haibara?

189
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.890
Where are you? Answer me!

190
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.590
Wait!

191
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.090
Hey, where are you?

192
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.490
Answer me!

193
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.990
Haibara!

194
00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:01.079
Haibara.

195
00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:04.279
Wake up, Haibara.

196
00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:08.079
Haibara...

197
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.279
What's the matter?

198
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:14.079
We're having class now.

199
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:16.479
"The Giant Turnip. Grandfather. Grandmother."

200
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.079
Could it be because of your cold?

201
00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:24.279
Maybe you should go rest in the infirmary after all.

202
00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.479
A dream?

203
00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:29.679
Right...

204
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:34.679
It can't be a coincidence that I ran into him in town.

205
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:37.579
All my dreams have been the same recently.

206
00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:40.879
I wonder if I'm tired?

207
00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.779
Haibara.

208
00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.579
Answer me, Haibara.

209
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.879
-Who is it? -Hey, Haibara!

210
00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:47.879
Who is it?

211
00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.279
Haibara!

212
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.479
Who is it?

213
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:51.679
Haibara!

214
00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:57.879
Kudo?

215
00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:59.779
Haibara? Is that you, Haibara?

216
00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:00.779
Where are you?

217
00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.679
In Dr. Agasa's car in front of the hotel!

218
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:05.979
I'm using the built in microphone and speaker in my glasses

219
00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:07.379
and communicating with you.

220
00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:09.579
What happened to me?

221
00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.579
That's what I'd like to know!

222
00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:14.479
What happened in the corridor in front of the hall?

223
00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:16.179
In front of the hall?

224
00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:22.679
Oh, I was swallowed by the crowd of people

225
00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:24.879
and lost track of you.

226
00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:27.679
Then somebody came at me from behind.

227
00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.779
What did that person do from behind?

228
00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:35.379
Somebody made me sniff something

229
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.179
and it looks like I'm confined in a wine cellar or something.

230
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:41.179
Hey, don't tell me that...

231
00:12:41.179 --> 00:12:44.379
Yes. The one who committed the murder under police surveillance

232
00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.579
under the very eyes of the police is one of

233
00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:49.079
the members of the organization...

234
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:50.279
Pisco!

235
00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.779
What?

236
00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:54.979
Don't tell me that he is close to you?

237
00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:59.679
No, that person is not here right now.

238
00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.879
The door of this room is securely locked, though.

239
00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:04.979
The only that I see here are

240
00:13:04.979 --> 00:13:07.379
a cardboard box on a baggage cart,

241
00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.879
and a janitor's overalls.

242
00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:10.979
Overalls?

243
00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:14.379
Yes. After I was made to sniff something,

244
00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:15.879
he probably took me to the restroom

245
00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.579
and changed into overalls,

246
00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:20.179
then, he put me in this cardboard box

247
00:13:20.179 --> 00:13:21.979
and brought me here.

248
00:13:21.979 --> 00:13:25.879
I think that if he goofed killing that politician in the hall,

249
00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.679
he was going to carry out the killing the restroom

250
00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:30.179
and bring him here.

251
00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:34.579
Okay, we've got to find a way to get out of there

252
00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:36.879
and plan our next move.

253
00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:40.279
Listen, Kudo. Listen very carefully.

254
00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.479
The word "Apo" in the Apotoxin 4869

255
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:46.979
that shrunk our body, which stands for apoptosis.

256
00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.079
In other words, it means the death of a program.

257
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.679
Yes. The cells have a self-destruction structure

258
00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:57.879
and is existing because of a signal that keeps that in check.

259
00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.979
Hey, Haibara.

260
00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:04.879
But, this drug not only guides apoptosis,

261
00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:07.079
it also waits for the activation of trimorphism

262
00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.479
and increases cell multiplication efficiency.

263
00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:10.879
Cut it out, Haibara!

264
00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:12.979
I'll listen to all you have to say

265
00:14:12.979 --> 00:14:14.479
after you get out of there.

266
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.479
Never mind, and just listen, will you?

267
00:14:17.479 --> 00:14:19.279
Because I'm never going to be able to...

268
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:23.279
to talk to you again.

269
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.479
-What? -Can't you tell?

270
00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:29.379
They kidnapped me and locked me here

271
00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:32.079
despite me being a child.

272
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:34.479
Even if I were to able to get out of here,

273
00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:38.679
they would track me down in a day or two.

274
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:39.979
If that happens,

275
00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.879
they will annihilate Dr. Agasa, who had sheltered me,

276
00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.779
as well as everyone I am involved with

277
00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:49.179
in order to protect their secret.

278
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.579
Now, do you understand?

279
00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.679
Whether I am killed here

280
00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:54.979
or get out of here,

281
00:14:54.979 --> 00:15:00.679
I will never be able to see all of you again.

282
00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:02.579
Haibara.

283
00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:04.979
That's why I'm going to give you

284
00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:09.179
all the information on the drug while I can.

285
00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:13.479
"The Great Adventure of Dr. Agasa Part II"!

286
00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.579
Hey, what was that?

287
00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:22.279
The game that Dr. Agasa made that Mitsuhiko gave back to me at school.

288
00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:27.079
They probably checked the MO that was in my pocket.

289
00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:32.179
A cellular phone connected to the computer means...

290
00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:33.979
Just as I thought.

291
00:15:33.979 --> 00:15:36.479
They were searching my face.

292
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:39.479
Hey, you're not tied up?

293
00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:41.979
That's why I'm rushing!

294
00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:44.379
They wouldn't leave me for a long time

295
00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:46.379
without even tieing me up, would they?

296
00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:50.879
No. They won't be back for a while yet.

297
00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:54.979
After you disappeared, I called the Inspector immediately.

298
00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:58.279
And told him not to let the seven

299
00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:01.079
who received the purple handkerchief out of the Haido City Hotel.

300
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:03.579
Using Shinichi's voice!

301
00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:05.679
The fact that you're not tied up,

302
00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:09.579
and that the cellular is still connected to the computer

303
00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.879
show that the guy who confined you

304
00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:15.479
wanted to leave the hotel just for awhile for something

305
00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:17.179
but was stopped at the door by the officers,

306
00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:19.379
and is being questioned now!

307
00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.179
Moreover, it is very likely

308
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:24.679
that he makes contact with those outside.

309
00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:26.179
It's been an hour since you disappeared,

310
00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.479
and yet, it's unthinkable that nobody

311
00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:34.079
including the guy who kidnapped you, went back.

312
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:36.579
Just as I thought.

313
00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.479
The guy who committed the murder is among the seven.

314
00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:41.879
He assassinated his target and confined you there.

315
00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:44.179
The guy called Pisco!

316
00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:48.679
Then, you mean I'm still inside Haido City Hotel?

317
00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:50.379
Yeah, most probably!

318
00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:52.279
If we can find proof that he committed the murder

319
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.779
before he contacts the others,

320
00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.179
and hand him over to the police,

321
00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:59.279
you're still safe!

322
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:05.079
The longest the Inspector can keep them in the room is another hour.

323
00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.579
I'll go ask the employee of the hotel

324
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.379
if they have a wine cellar that's not in use,

325
00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:12.379
and get you out of there!

326
00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:14.779
If I say that a girl is locked in...

327
00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:16.079
You idiot.

328
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.279
Didn't I just tell you

329
00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:20.879
what will happen to people who get involved with me?

330
00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:22.179
It's not my fault

331
00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:23.979
if something happens

332
00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:26.979
to the employee who helps me out.

333
00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.679
Then, why don't you find a way

334
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:31.079
to get out of there yourself?

335
00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:32.079
In the meantime,

336
00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:34.879
I'll go and figure out which of the seven is Pisco.

337
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:38.379
You say it like it's so simple,

338
00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:40.879
but there is no escape route here.

339
00:17:40.879 --> 00:17:43.879
Only an old fireplace.

340
00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:45.979
Can't you climb up that fireplace?

341
00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:51.679
Impossible. It's too wide to climb.

342
00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.679
If I weren't this small,

343
00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:54.979
I could probably use my hands and legs

344
00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:56.679
and get out of here, but...

345
00:17:56.679 --> 00:17:58.579
Isn't there a rope or something?

346
00:17:58.579 --> 00:17:59.579
I wonder.

347
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.779
Would they have a rope in a wine cellar?

348
00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:05.879
Are there all kinds of liquor in there?

349
00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:08.779
Yes. It seems that they packed liquor from all over the world

350
00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:10.879
into this room that is not being used anymore,

351
00:18:10.879 --> 00:18:13.779
and turned it into a wine cellar.

352
00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:15.679
Do you see something called Paikal there?

353
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:16.779
Paikal?

354
00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:19.479
Yeah, it's a very strong Chinese liquor.

355
00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:21.079
I don't know.

356
00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:22.379
Look for it!

357
00:18:22.379 --> 00:18:25.379
I wonder if I can.

358
00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:27.179
Why do you want me to look for it, anyway?

359
00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:29.379
How's your cold?

360
00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:31.779
Didn't you say you were coming down with one this morning?

361
00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:34.579
What are you, a scatterbrain?

362
00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:36.579
Never mind that. How are you feeling?

363
00:18:36.579 --> 00:18:39.879
Thanks to being left lying on the floor for a while,

364
00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:41.279
I think my fever went up.

365
00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:43.379
-I see. -Oh, my.

366
00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:45.679
You sound a bit happy?

367
00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:46.879
Sort of.

368
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.979
I found the Paikal.

369
00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:53.979
But, what do I do with this liquor?

370
00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:57.279
I'm going to help you get out of there.

371
00:18:57.279 --> 00:19:00.279
I'm going to put a real fancy spell on you!

372
00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.979
That was the scene right after the accident!

373
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:08.979
In a room located near the scene of the accident,

374
00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:10.879
it seems that several people

375
00:19:10.879 --> 00:19:12.579
have been called in for questioning.

376
00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:15.979
The names of these people have not been announced.

377
00:19:15.979 --> 00:19:18.879
This was brought to you live from the scene.

378
00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:19.879
From the televised broadcast just now,

379
00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:21.479
I've figured out the approximate positions of the seven people

380
00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:24.379
right after the murder.

381
00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:26.079
But, this isn't enough.

382
00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:29.379
What's the spelling for Hercule Poirot?

383
00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:30.579
What?

384
00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:31.979
Hey, what're you doing?

385
00:19:31.979 --> 00:19:33.979
Did you drink the Paikal like I told you to?

386
00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:36.479
Yes, I did.

387
00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:38.679
I don't know what you're trying to do,

388
00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:41.479
but I'm feeling as bad as ever.

389
00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:44.879
Give me the spelling for Poirot.

390
00:19:44.879 --> 00:19:49.879
It's H. E. R. C. U. L. E. P. O. I. R. O. T.

391
00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:51.979
Why do you want to know?

392
00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:53.679
I'm trying to download the data of that drug

393
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:57.879
from this computer to Dr. Agasa's MO,

394
00:19:57.879 --> 00:19:59.979
but it requires a password.

395
00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:01.579
R.O.T.

396
00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:02.879
"Wrong password"

397
00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:05.479
No good. I can't open it with Poirot either.

398
00:20:05.479 --> 00:20:08.379
What do you mean the password is Poirot?

399
00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:10.779
The people of the organization

400
00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:14.679
were calling the drug by this name

401
00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:19.279
Changing serial number 4869 was coded Sherlock.

402
00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:22.379
For an inefficient detective,

403
00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:24.479
That's why I'm entering all the detective names

404
00:20:24.479 --> 00:20:27.479
that I can think of one after the other.

405
00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:29.879
I guess it's not all that easy.

406
00:20:29.879 --> 00:20:31.779
Shelling Ford.

407
00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:37.579
It's spelled, S. H. E. L. L. I. N. G. F. O. R. D.

408
00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:39.279
Was there a detective by that name?

409
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.579
Never mind that, just enter it!

410
00:20:40.579 --> 00:20:45.079
S. H. E. L. L. I. N. G. F. O. R. D.

411
00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:51.679
It opened. Why?

412
00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:53.879
The name Shelling Ford

413
00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:56.779
is the temporary name that Conan Doyle

414
00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:58.579
named the detective of his novel

415
00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.579
before the detective was renamed Sherlock.

416
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:03.979
In other words, this detective was in his trial stage!

417
00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:07.679
Oh. It's a pretty fancy thing for the organization to do.

418
00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:10.279
We don't have much time left.

419
00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.379
How're you doing?

420
00:21:12.379 --> 00:21:14.379
Of course I'm doing terrible

421
00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:16.479
after drinking that liquor.

422
00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:20.179
I'm going to download the data of the drug into the MO,

423
00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:22.379
and hide it here,

424
00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:25.179
so come get it later, okay?

425
00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:28.279
After they come to get me.

426
00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.079
Hey.

427
00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:32.079
Shinichi, in front there.

428
00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:38.679
It's them.

429
00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:40.579
Don't tell me they've come for Pisco.

430
00:21:40.579 --> 00:21:42.479
No, no way!

431
00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:44.479
Before the seven people are released,

432
00:21:44.479 --> 00:21:47.979
the Inspector is supposed to call me.

433
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:51.379
Don't tell me that a transmitter was built in

434
00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:53.379
to the computer that Haibara is using right now.

435
00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:57.079
I see, since they couldn't get through by phone,

436
00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:59.079
they followed the transmitter.

437
00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:00.579
Haibara, big trouble!

438
00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:01.779
They're coming!

439
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:05.479
Hide in the fireplace or something for now.

440
00:22:05.479 --> 00:22:07.579
Hey, what's up?

441
00:22:07.579 --> 00:22:08.679
Hey!

442
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:12.679
Inspector! It's Kudo!

443
00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:18.879
What? Black organization?

444
00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:01.779
"Next Episode" -Pisco isn't here.

445
00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:03.779
Burn marks?

446
00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:05.579
Which means that this chain was...

447
00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:10.879
I see. So, that's what it was.

448
00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.179
I really missed you.

449
00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:18.479
Sherry.

450
00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:22.279
Haibara!

451
00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:24.179
Next Conan,

452
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:28.300
"Re-Encounter with the Black Organization (Solution Part)"

453
00:24:29.697 --> 00:24:31.397
Next Conan's Hint:

454
00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:33.197
"Fluorescent paint"

455
00:24:33.197 --> 00:24:34.297
There is going to be a great turn of events in the next episode!

456
00:24:34.297 --> 00:24:35.897
We should never drink too much

457
00:24:35.897 --> 00:24:37.597
when we're not feeling good.
