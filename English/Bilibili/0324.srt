1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.440
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.640
There is a clockwork of complex codes in numbers.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.740
But he finds the solution and reveals the culprit.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.567
We were supposed to meet up with Heiji and Kazuha,

9
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.167
but they did not come.

10
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.167
So, we decided to go look for them.

11
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.467
We called on Mr. Kusukawa, the detective,

12
00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.067
and found out they went

13
00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:54.467
to a certain Itou residence on Kenbashi street.

14
00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:01.467
You must be hungry.

15
00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.467
But could you wait for a little while, dear?

16
00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.267
Your mom is busy right now.

17
00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.967
After I finish my work,

18
00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:10.267
I'll feed you. Okay, dear?

19
00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.267
Good kitty.

20
00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.667
Mommy has to go up to them

21
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.667
and let them know where they stand.

22
00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:22.067
I've got to see to it that they feel it to the bones.

23
00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:34.967
"Heiji Hattori No Way Out (Part 2)"

24
00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:39.667
Darn it! Where are those Osaka kids?

25
00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.167
I'm completely tired out.

26
00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:43.667
Cheer up, Dad.

27
00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.667
Let's have lunch and then start searching for the Itou's again.

28
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.467
We could have passed them on the way.

29
00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:56.767
And why must I have lunch this late in this shabby restaurant?

30
00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:58.567
It's no use complaining now, Dad.

31
00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:01.367
We were supposed to have lunch with them.

32
00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:03.967
Besides, it's kind of old fashioned.

33
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.967
And I kind of like this house.

34
00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:08.667
Old fashioned it is.

35
00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:12.867
You don't see a horoscope dispenser so often anymore these days.

36
00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:16.867
Hey. Make another phone call, Ran.

37
00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.767
They may have gone to my detective agency.

38
00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.067
Yes, Dad.

39
00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.167
I've tried calling from time to time.

40
00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:24.867
But I the phone won't connect.

41
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.367
-Hello? -It's me.

42
00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.167
Hattori?

43
00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.667
What?

44
00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:33.167
Give me the phone!

45
00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.767
Hey, you guys! Where on earth are you?

46
00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:36.967
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.667
I'm with Mr. Kusukawa in a coffee shop.

48
00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.367
We've been talking about detective business

49
00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:44.367
and forgot to get in touch with you.

50
00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.467
Then, is Kazuha there with you, too?

51
00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:48.667
Don't worry about her.

52
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.567
She is alright.

53
00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.267
By the way, Pops,

54
00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.867
we have a cipher that we want you to solve it.

55
00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:56.367
A cipher?

56
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.767
Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

57
00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:02.167
and I promised him that I won't go back until I solve it.

58
00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.367
I tried everything, but I couldn't solve it.

59
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:08.067
So, I thought of getting your help while Mr. Kusukawa is out.

60
00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:11.067
Huh? Aren't Mr. Kusukawa there with you?

61
00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.367
No. One of his mahjong pals called him on the phone.

62
00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:17.667
They need one more player.

63
00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.367
He went outside to tell them he can't make it.

64
00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:24.267
Well, I will mail the cipher through the phone right now.

65
00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:27.267
You send me the solution by sundown.

66
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.367
Let me know the seven numerals hidden in that cipher.

67
00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.167
Seven numerals?

68
00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:37.067
If you can't solve it, I can't come to you.

69
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:38.467
So, hang in there.

70
00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:40.367
Hey, wait!

71
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.167
Darn it.

72
00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:50.067
What a smart kid you are to let Kogoro Mouri think it over for you.

73
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:51.667
Thanks.

74
00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:56.767
Now, we need to mail the cipher.

75
00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.967
He soiled the paper with his blood,

76
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.767
so we can't read the lower half of it.

77
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.367
What?

78
00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:04.667
Didn't you make a copy of it?

79
00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:06.667
No. After we got that cipher,

80
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:09.167
we were busy interrogating Kusukawa.

81
00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:12.467
I have memorized all of it.

82
00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:16.067
49 numerals and the order of the alphabets.

83
00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:21.067
Really? Then, tell me

84
00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:23.867
all the 49 letters without looking at the paper.

85
00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:29.867
But if you give me even one wrong number,

86
00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:34.067
you will get stained with the blood of that girlfriend of yours.

87
00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:38.267
What's this?

88
00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:40.367
I can't make any sense out of this.

89
00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:41.767
True.

90
00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:44.467
Numerals and four alphabets.

91
00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:47.067
Q, A, K, J.

92
00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.067
Could it be...

93
00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.767
I have no idea what they are supposed to mean.

94
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:56.667
But Heiji said he won't budge an inch until he solves this.

95
00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:57.867
I'm busy!

96
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:00.567
Huh? Conan, did you find out something?

97
00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:02.667
Yes. A little.

98
00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:03.667
What's that?

99
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.667
Look at these letters.

100
00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.867
The A, J, Q, and K remind me of the letters on playing cards.

101
00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:11.267
So, I've changed them into numbers.

102
00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:12.567
And then?

103
00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:16.067
Then, the numbers turned out to be 64 in all.

104
00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:20.267
But I noticed that there is one lone number.

105
00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:23.067
That's the nine in the center.

106
00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:24.967
There's only one nine.

107
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:27.267
Yes. Take that 9 out,

108
00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:31.767
and the remaining 63 numerals will make 7 groups of 9 numerals.

109
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:35.267
If there are seven numerals in this cipher,

110
00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:41.167
each of the seven groups should be a certain number.

111
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:44.267
But you can't solve it like math.

112
00:06:44.267 --> 00:06:45.767
I see.

113
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:50.467
It's just a bunch of nonsense.

114
00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:52.667
Here's your diced steaks, sir.

115
00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:56.167
This is just the thing I've been waiting for.

116
00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.967
Hi. This is the Kid's Lunch Plate.

117
00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:07.567
Hey, Pops. Can it be Mr. Kusukawa who coded this cipher?

118
00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:09.167
Yes.

119
00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:13.567
I see. That's why the center is a nine.

120
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.367
Here is your omelette, Miss.

121
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:17.867
It looks delicious.

122
00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:19.367
Conan?

123
00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:22.867
It's rather simple once you figure out how to solve it.

124
00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:24.867
Huh? This looks strange.

125
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:28.667
The first four are numerals, but the last three are not.

126
00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:33.067
Wait. I saw these somewhere before.

127
00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:43.167
Now, the time is up.

128
00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:46.467
We have to go now, otherwise we won't make it in time

129
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:47.967
to use the safe deposit box.

130
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.067
If you want to blame someone,

131
00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:53.067
blame it on that incompetent detective of yours.

132
00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:57.467
Wait! I may be able to solve it overnight.

133
00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:59.767
You can go to the bank tomorrow

134
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.567
before the letter is delivered to the detective agency.

135
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:03.667
We are not worried about it.

136
00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:06.267
Because the letter will not be delivered.

137
00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:07.967
What? You are not going to...

138
00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:08.967
Yes, we are.

139
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:12.467
We'll ambush the deliveryman in front of the office

140
00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:15.867
and rob him of the letter.

141
00:08:15.867 --> 00:08:20.367
We will keep paying the fee for using the safe,

142
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:22.667
and the tape will not come out into this world.

143
00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:28.067
We will take time to solve the cipher.

144
00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:33.367
Unlike you guys, I have unlimited time on my side.

145
00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.667
Now, if you have anything left to say,

146
00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.567
I'll listen to you.

147
00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.567
To listen to a person with genuine concern

148
00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:42.967
is a duty for an attorney.

149
00:08:42.967 --> 00:08:45.367
Darn it. Kudo, you fool.

150
00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:47.067
What are you doing?

151
00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:51.567
You don't seem to have any concern for this world.

152
00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:54.067
Well then, as you wish...

153
00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.467
I do... I have a lot.

154
00:08:56.467 --> 00:09:00.667
I have so many things to say that I was at a loss.

155
00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:02.067
More than anything else,

156
00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:05.167
I want to say a word to the girl behind me.

157
00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.467
What do you want to say to her?

158
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.067
You know she will be dead soon, don't you?

159
00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:17.367
I wanted to tell her some important things since a long time ago.

160
00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:20.867
So, would you mind putting your gun on the floor

161
00:09:20.867 --> 00:09:23.467
while I talk to her?

162
00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:26.867
Well, well. After all, you guys are high school kids.

163
00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:29.067
Excuse me for being dense.

164
00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:31.667
This will do, I hope.

165
00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:36.067
Now, you can start telling her.

166
00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:38.867
Gosh. Don't rush me.

167
00:09:38.867 --> 00:09:41.567
I am choosing the best words for her.

168
00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:48.167
So that she'll be impressed and can go to heaven with those words.

169
00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:51.167
They must be fascinating and wonderful words.

170
00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.867
He's still alive.

171
00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.167
Darn it!

172
00:09:58.967 --> 00:10:00.967
It's a pity, Heiji.

173
00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:04.267
It was such a good strategy for taking the gun from me.

174
00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.267
Strategy, was it?

175
00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:07.567
Now, get up.

176
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:13.667
But we are lucky to find him alive.

177
00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:18.167
Now, let's have it. Give me the answer to the cipher.

178
00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:22.767
Or do you want to see the head of your kid friend here blown apart?

179
00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:26.467
Don't tell her, Mr. Kusukawa.

180
00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:27.567
If you do,

181
00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:30.967
it'll only buy you a little more time to go to heaven.

182
00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:34.267
So, let's make them regret what they're doing.

183
00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.167
You talk too much!

184
00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:38.367
Heiji!

185
00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:42.067
Now, hurry up!

186
00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:44.667
Give me the answer before I count up to five.

187
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:46.467
We are running out of time,

188
00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:48.267
so I won't hesitate to fire at the first person.

189
00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:49.367
Stop it, please!

190
00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:51.167
One.

191
00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:54.067
I really mean it, Kazuha.

192
00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:57.167
-Two. -I really wanted to tell you something...

193
00:10:57.167 --> 00:10:58.667
before I die.

194
00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:00.967
Three.

195
00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:04.067
I've tried to tell so you many times.

196
00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.867
Four.

197
00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:08.267
When we were back to back and I felt you trembling.

198
00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.067
I wanted to say...

199
00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:11.967
Five.

200
00:11:29.947 --> 00:11:31.547
Oh, my. A mail.

201
00:11:32.947 --> 00:11:35.547
From Kogoro Mouri?

202
00:11:35.547 --> 00:11:37.947
They couldn't possibly have solved the cipher so soon!

203
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.647
It doesn't look like an answer to me.

204
00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:45.747
Didn't they just send back what we sent them?

205
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:46.847
No.

206
00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:50.447
Some of the numerals and alphabets are in different order.

207
00:11:50.447 --> 00:11:53.647
What? Hey, give me the phone.

208
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.247
No... Could I take a look at it, please?

209
00:11:59.347 --> 00:12:01.447
There, take a look.

210
00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:04.447
It looks exactly like the cipher I gave you to solve.

211
00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:09.547
Yes, this one looks very much like it.

212
00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:11.447
But this is an answer to the mail we sent.

213
00:12:13.247 --> 00:12:18.147
This says they found the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

214
00:12:18.147 --> 00:12:20.347
You are not making it up, are you?

215
00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:22.247
Then, tell us.

216
00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:24.447
I can't tell you here.

217
00:12:24.447 --> 00:12:28.247
Little one. You don't know what a sorry pickle you're in, do you?

218
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.147
You're the one who don't know what pickle you're in.

219
00:12:30.147 --> 00:12:31.747
Huh?

220
00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:36.147
Kogoro Mouri knows the answer to the cipher.

221
00:12:36.147 --> 00:12:39.347
Furthermore, he knows that Mr. Kusukawa made the cipher,

222
00:12:39.347 --> 00:12:43.247
and also that we are with Mr. Kusukawa.

223
00:12:43.247 --> 00:12:45.947
If the three of us disappeared at the same time,

224
00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.947
that will make the detective think hard,

225
00:12:48.947 --> 00:12:50.147
and he'll find out

226
00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:52.447
the meaning of the seven numerals hidden in the cipher.

227
00:12:52.447 --> 00:12:57.447
And that the seven digit number is an ID.

228
00:12:57.447 --> 00:13:00.447
Well, he will take less than a week to find them all.

229
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.947
Don't tell me that you sent your cipher to Kogoro Mouri

230
00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:04.847
knowing what he will do all the while?

231
00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:06.847
We'll be in big trouble, Miss.

232
00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:08.747
We can kill them and run, can't we?

233
00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.747
You talk too much.

234
00:13:10.747 --> 00:13:13.547
You have only two choices.

235
00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:15.147
You kill us,

236
00:13:15.147 --> 00:13:19.447
let Kogoro Mouri get the tape and listen to it

237
00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:23.247
or let me go get the tape,

238
00:13:23.247 --> 00:13:26.947
and exchange us for the tape.

239
00:13:26.947 --> 00:13:30.047
Actually, Mr. Kusukawa can go instead of me.

240
00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:33.047
But he can't possibly play the role with that swollen face of his.

241
00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:37.747
So, I'm telling you I will go instead of him for you.

242
00:13:37.747 --> 00:13:40.347
And as Mr. Kusukawa told you,

243
00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:45.447
if you stop doing bad things and promise not to kill us,

244
00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:48.047
I won't turn you in to the police, so don't worry.

245
00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:50.647
You can't fool me.

246
00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:54.247
You're going to get the tape and rush it to the police.

247
00:13:54.247 --> 00:13:58.247
Then, one of you can come with me

248
00:13:58.247 --> 00:14:01.247
and watch over me to keep me from doing anything funny.

249
00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:04.047
You don't have much time to think.

250
00:14:04.047 --> 00:14:05.247
If we don't get going now,

251
00:14:05.247 --> 00:14:08.847
we won't make it in time to use the safe deposit.

252
00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:13.047
I see.

253
00:14:13.047 --> 00:14:16.247
Okay, I will accept your terms.

254
00:14:16.247 --> 00:14:19.247
But if the answer to the cipher proves wrong,

255
00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:21.947
you know what will become of you.

256
00:14:29.147 --> 00:14:32.847
Now, Heiji can go with me,

257
00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:37.447
and the young lady can stay here with him.

258
00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:39.447
Heiji.

259
00:14:39.447 --> 00:14:41.347
What is it, Kazuha?

260
00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.947
If we make it through...

261
00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:47.447
If we make it through,

262
00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:50.447
will you tell me what you were going to tell me?

263
00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:55.847
Sure.

264
00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:57.847
I'll keep on telling you until you get tired of hearing it.

265
00:15:08.147 --> 00:15:09.847
Heiji.

266
00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:18.247
It's gasoline.

267
00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:20.847
As soon as we get a phone call from her saying that she's got the tape,

268
00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:22.347
we'll set fire.

269
00:15:22.347 --> 00:15:24.447
That kid will be surprised to learn

270
00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:28.347
that you are not in front of the house waiting for him,

271
00:15:28.347 --> 00:15:33.547
but are inside the house and that it's on fire.

272
00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:35.747
"Tohto Bank"

273
00:15:36.147 --> 00:15:38.247
All right, Heiji.

274
00:15:38.247 --> 00:15:41.647
Be quick about it.

275
00:15:41.647 --> 00:15:45.947
Enter the seven numbers hidden in the cipher.

276
00:15:45.947 --> 00:15:50.347
Well, don't you want to know how to solve the cipher?

277
00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:52.747
No, that can wait.

278
00:15:52.747 --> 00:15:56.647
Since that cipher was made by Mr. Kusukawa, the gambling man,

279
00:15:56.647 --> 00:16:01.147
you can easily see that those A, J, Q, and K are of playing cards.

280
00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:04.347
Change them into numbers,

281
00:16:04.347 --> 00:16:06.547
and we have 64 numerals in all.

282
00:16:06.547 --> 00:16:08.647
But there's something bothers me

283
00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:11.347
which is number nine in the center.

284
00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:15.847
There are lots of 1 to 6 numbers, but there's only one 9.

285
00:16:17.147 --> 00:16:20.147
That's when it hit me that if I take out the 9,

286
00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:22.147
I can divide the remaining 63 numerals by 9

287
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.847
and get 7 groups of numbers.

288
00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:30.347
Those 7 groups of numbers can stand for a 7-digit number.

289
00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:34.247
And all numbers are in 1 to 6.

290
00:16:34.247 --> 00:16:36.347
For a gambling man,

291
00:16:36.347 --> 00:16:39.247
1 to 6 means only one thing, doesn't it?

292
00:16:39.247 --> 00:16:41.047
A dice.

293
00:16:41.047 --> 00:16:43.747
The code is telling you to put the 9 numerals of 7 groups

294
00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:48.647
into the form of dice of 3 by 3 squares.

295
00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:54.947
But what and where are the seven numerals?

296
00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.947
Okay. Let's change the numbers into the dots of dice,

297
00:16:56.947 --> 00:16:59.447
and imagine we are looking at the dice.

298
00:16:59.447 --> 00:17:01.847
The red dots of dice are bigger and striking,

299
00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:04.547
now you can read the seven numbers.

300
00:17:04.547 --> 00:17:08.847
The number comes up to 3156204.

301
00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:14.347
So, it's 3156204.

302
00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:17.547
Probably, the cipher was made into squares

303
00:17:17.547 --> 00:17:19.747
with the center to be nine

304
00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:23.747
because of the image of dice and dots on them.

305
00:17:23.747 --> 00:17:25.947
Look! It's opened.

306
00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:30.647
So, this is it. The tape you wanted to get.

307
00:17:31.347 --> 00:17:34.447
Looks like it. Now, give it to me quickly.

308
00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:38.247
Before doing so, you will learn another interesting tale.

309
00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:39.347
What?

310
00:17:39.347 --> 00:17:43.347
The lower half of the cipher I sent to Kogoro is slightly changed.

311
00:17:43.347 --> 00:17:48.147
The lower three numerals were changed to stand for alphabets.

312
00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.447
Alphabets?

313
00:17:50.447 --> 00:17:51.847
Right.

314
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:54.947
One capital and two small case letters.

315
00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:57.747
L, I, B.

316
00:17:57.747 --> 00:18:00.147
Libra, the Balance.

317
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:03.247
A Latin for the balance scale shortened to L-I-B.

318
00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:04.747
Libra?

319
00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:06.647
You don't know?

320
00:18:06.647 --> 00:18:08.747
You wear it on your lapel, don't you?

321
00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:13.447
The attorney's pin in the form of the balance.

322
00:18:15.547 --> 00:18:19.547
Then, Kogoro Mouri might go to my house to...

323
00:18:19.547 --> 00:18:21.447
He probably went and did it

324
00:18:21.447 --> 00:18:23.747
because he sent me back that mail of his.

325
00:18:23.747 --> 00:18:25.147
A mail?

326
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:28.047
Get them out.

327
00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:29.447
Take them outside the house

328
00:18:29.447 --> 00:18:32.447
to reduce the number of bad guys.

329
00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:35.247
I can't believe it.

330
00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.747
You'd better believe it.

331
00:18:37.747 --> 00:18:41.347
Because you have no hands in this game.

332
00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:44.547
Hey, are you there?

333
00:18:44.547 --> 00:18:46.747
You're up there, aren't you?

334
00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:50.447
Don't be so slow. Come on down, guys!

335
00:18:50.447 --> 00:18:51.447
Miss, is that you?

336
00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:53.547
So quick, isn't it?

337
00:18:53.547 --> 00:18:56.247
Did you forget something?

338
00:19:00.447 --> 00:19:02.247
Hey!

339
00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:03.447
What's wrong?

340
00:19:03.447 --> 00:19:04.647
Hey!

341
00:19:12.347 --> 00:19:14.247
Isn't that a soccer ball?

342
00:19:15.847 --> 00:19:17.447
Who is it?

343
00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:25.047
I don't really get it,

344
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:27.147
but I called the police already.

345
00:19:27.147 --> 00:19:29.947
And I just hope I did something right for them.

346
00:19:32.947 --> 00:19:35.147
The police arrived in time

347
00:19:35.147 --> 00:19:38.347
to securely protect Kazuha and Mr. Kusukawa.

348
00:19:38.347 --> 00:19:42.747
The dishonest attorney and her two men were arrested.

349
00:19:42.747 --> 00:19:46.447
And the case of the cipher, illegal tax evasion, and confinement

350
00:19:46.447 --> 00:19:48.847
was solved and closed in an instant.

351
00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:25.047
So, you used that voice changer to mimic her voice

352
00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:26.747
and lured them to come out.

353
00:21:26.747 --> 00:21:30.447
Then, you used anesthetic gun and a soccer ball to knock them down.

354
00:21:30.447 --> 00:21:31.947
That was great, Kudo.

355
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:33.947
You better thank me for it.

356
00:21:33.947 --> 00:21:37.647
I had to come out of the toilet of a restaurant to go up to you.

357
00:21:37.647 --> 00:21:41.147
If you didn't leave like you did back then,

358
00:21:41.147 --> 00:21:44.247
things wouldn't have gotten as complicated as this.

359
00:21:44.247 --> 00:21:48.847
I have no idea that'd you'd be held up by a middle-aged lady like her.

360
00:21:50.447 --> 00:21:53.347
Conan, are you alright?

361
00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:56.347
Your kid's lunch has gotten cold.

362
00:21:56.347 --> 00:21:58.447
I'll be with you in a minute.

363
00:22:00.147 --> 00:22:01.847
A kid's lunch for you?

364
00:22:01.847 --> 00:22:06.047
Ran sometimes orders it for a nice kid like me.

365
00:22:06.047 --> 00:22:09.747
Well, it served as a hint for solving the cipher.

366
00:22:09.747 --> 00:22:14.547
Yes. The red circle on the flag and the one on the die is the same.

367
00:22:14.547 --> 00:22:17.347
By the way, why did Mr. Kusukawa

368
00:22:17.347 --> 00:22:18.947
go to her and talk her out of her wrongdoings

369
00:22:18.947 --> 00:22:21.247
despite knowing that he'd be great bait for the mass media?

370
00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:26.247
Long time ago, Mr. Kusukawa's mom got help from that attorney.

371
00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:28.647
His mother suffered great losses in a fraud

372
00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.847
and that attorney helped her at that time.

373
00:22:30.847 --> 00:22:34.147
So, his mother is very grateful.

374
00:22:34.747 --> 00:22:36.647
Because of this memory,

375
00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:39.947
he went to her to talk her out of doing illegal business.

376
00:22:40.747 --> 00:22:44.047
I'm really grateful to you.

377
00:22:44.047 --> 00:22:46.347
I was really in deep water when you came to me.

378
00:22:46.347 --> 00:22:48.447
What deep water are you talking about?

379
00:22:48.447 --> 00:22:52.647
You mean the time when you really wanted to tell me something?

380
00:22:52.647 --> 00:22:53.747
Kazuha.

381
00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.247
What was it?

382
00:22:55.247 --> 00:22:56.847
What did you want to tell me

383
00:22:56.847 --> 00:23:00.247
when you felt me trembling against your back?

384
00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:02.147
You better not hear it.

385
00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:05.047
You told me you'd tell until I get tired of hearing it.

386
00:23:05.047 --> 00:23:07.947
What on earth was it?

387
00:23:07.947 --> 00:23:10.347
Well...

388
00:23:11.047 --> 00:23:12.947
Well?

389
00:23:12.947 --> 00:23:14.147
Well?

390
00:23:15.147 --> 00:23:17.547
It's about...

391
00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:20.547
Every time you trembled behind me...

392
00:23:20.547 --> 00:23:23.147
your hair...

393
00:23:23.147 --> 00:23:27.347
Your hair like a horse tail pricked me on my neck

394
00:23:27.347 --> 00:23:30.347
and made me so ticklish.

395
00:23:33.047 --> 00:23:34.847
I'm really sorry for you.

396
00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:38.447
Drop dead for once!

397
00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:45.747
"Next Episode" -An arsonist?

398
00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:47.047
From the start of this year,

399
00:23:47.047 --> 00:23:49.847
there have been a series of arson cases.

400
00:23:49.847 --> 00:23:53.447
But there's always this one thing left at the site of the fire.

401
00:23:53.447 --> 00:23:55.747
A red horse doll.

402
00:23:56.947 --> 00:23:59.747
But I know of a house that may be a target.

403
00:23:59.747 --> 00:24:00.747
What?

404
00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:03.447
Well, I don't really have anywhere to go this holiday,

405
00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:06.347
so I will go visit that house.

406
00:24:07.447 --> 00:24:13.447
Next Conan, "Red Horse In The Fire (Case)"

407
00:24:14.215 --> 00:24:16.415
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:16.415 --> 00:24:18.515
"1, 2, 3"

409
00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:19.915
Complex mysteries in three episodes.

410
00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:21.015
Hey, Kazuha. You're not leaving Tokyo so soon, are you?

411
00:24:21.015 --> 00:24:23.461
Why not, Heiji? Did you get yourself another first love in Tokyo?
