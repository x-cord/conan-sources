1
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.540
Today's stage is at an ordinary apartment complex.

2
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.740
Is it an accident or a homicide?

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
There is a blind spot that cannot be seen in ordinary life.

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:05.525
Move it!

8
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.125
You, get out of here!

9
00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.925
You crows sure a nuisance, I tell you.

10
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.525
Shoots. There's not much of anything here.

11
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:16.025
"City Crows"

12
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.225
I think something happened.

13
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.525
I wonder what kind of case it is?

14
00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:33.225
Hey, no, stand back.

15
00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:34.825
What's with you, kids?

16
00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:37.925
Please give us the details, Officer Chiba.

17
00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.825
No.

18
00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:46.925
-That's... -A homicide?

19
00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.325
Homicide?

20
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:49.325
-Just as I thought! -How frightening!

21
00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.225
No! It's not a murder case, it's an accident!

22
00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:54.325
An accident?

23
00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:56.325
You guys are really something.

24
00:03:56.325 --> 00:03:59.225
To be honest, someone died.

25
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.225
It was a grandma who used to live here alone.

26
00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.125
Her name is Tatsue Egami.

27
00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:07.325
When she was coming back home,

28
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:10.925
a flower pot happened to fall and hit her on the head.

29
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:14.525
That fell on her head?

30
00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.225
But where did it fall from?

31
00:04:21.025 --> 00:04:22.825
Hanging them like that is dangerous.

32
00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:25.325
It's not strange if it fell anytime.

33
00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:26.725
That's unacceptable.

34
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:30.225
What kind of person is living there?

35
00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.325
Room 404.

36
00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:35.625
It's the apartment that the late Tatsue Egami lived in.

37
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:41.525
So, that grandma got hit in the head by the plant she was growing?

38
00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:44.125
That is what we believe happened.

39
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:47.325
That's too bad for that Grandma.

40
00:04:47.325 --> 00:04:50.125
It's true that it's bad for her, but...

41
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.225
Officer Chiba!

42
00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.525
How was it?

43
00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:55.725
The neighbors tried to warn her about the danger.

44
00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:59.325
They asked her to put the pots inside,

45
00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:01.925
but she didn't listen to them.

46
00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:05.025
I see. So if she had listened,

47
00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:07.925
this wouldn't have happened because of crows.

48
00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.725
Crows?

49
00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.125
Don't you see them?

50
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.925
They're everywhere.

51
00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:19.625
Since it's on the 4th floor,

52
00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.925
it's not likely that a stray cat did it.

53
00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:23.825
One of those probably dropped the planter

54
00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.925
with either their beak or feet.

55
00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:38.925
Crows sure are strong, aren't they?

56
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:42.025
I wonder if the crow is really the one who did this?

57
00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.925
There are no witnesses.

58
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:45.225
Since it was early in the morning,

59
00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:47.125
there seems to have been no one around, too.

60
00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.925
Maybe someone who lives opposite here saw something.

61
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.125
Right. As you can see, it's impossible.

62
00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.825
To be killed by a crow,

63
00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:03.425
I'm starting to feel more and more sorry for granny.

64
00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.725
There are people making sarcastic remarks

65
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.525
like a crow was killed by a crow.

66
00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:10.725
A crow killed by a crow?

67
00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:16.425
It seems that Tatsue Egami was called "grandmother crow" behind her back.

68
00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:18.425
Grandmother crow?

69
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:21.425
She used to go out early in the morning to make her rounds

70
00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:24.725
going through the trash that other people threw out.

71
00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:27.625
Moreover, she seems to have always worn only black clothes.

72
00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:32.225
That's why she was called grandmother crow, huh?

73
00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.925
She had a pretty bad reputation, too.

74
00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:37.125
They couldn't stand her going through their trash

75
00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.525
and invading their privacy.

76
00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:41.625
There even seems to have been people who moved out.

77
00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:45.225
She was disliked by everyone in the apartment complex.

78
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:49.225
But why did she do such a thing as go through other people's trash?

79
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:51.825
Yeah. Well, what triggered it was...

80
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.625
Gosh! How messy!

81
00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:11.125
The lottery ticket she found

82
00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:13.925
happened to be one for 3rd place or something.

83
00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:18.525
So, she seems to have thought she could find something valuable again.

84
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:20.625
That seems to have been the beginning of her reason

85
00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.925
for going through trash.

86
00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:25.225
"Dream come to me once more..." She hoped, I guess.

87
00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:27.525
They took on revenge on her

88
00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:29.425
because she went around looking into other people's trash.

89
00:07:29.425 --> 00:07:31.825
Revenge?

90
00:07:31.825 --> 00:07:33.825
The crow got mad

91
00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:35.725
thinking that she was going to take away their food.

92
00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:38.225
That's why the crow dropped the planter.

93
00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:41.625
I see. The crow took revenge because it involved food.

94
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:45.925
It's possible because crows are smart.

95
00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:47.825
The old lady seems to have made her rounds

96
00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:49.625
of the trash dumps this morning, too.

97
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:51.625
And when she came back to the 1st floor doorway

98
00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:53.925
in order to return to her room,

99
00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:55.825
the planter seems to have fell from above.

100
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:06.325
But isn't it strange?

101
00:08:06.325 --> 00:08:09.925
The old lady came home from outside, didn't she?

102
00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:12.825
From that side then this way, right?

103
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.425
Then she was going to enter that entrance.

104
00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:16.825
Yeah.

105
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:20.625
I wonder how she came from in front of the entrance to this side?

106
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.125
Come to think of it, you're right.

107
00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:25.225
True. If she did go this way,

108
00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:28.925
even if the planter came falling, it wouldn't have hit her.

109
00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.425
The fact is, we thought that was strange too,

110
00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:34.725
the minute we got here.

111
00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:39.025
The refrigerator which was put outside as trash...

112
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:41.425
I mean, because one of her hands was inserted under it,

113
00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:43.125
and she was lying dead in a strange position.

114
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:48.025
But we figured the reason out

115
00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:49.925
after we looked under the refrigerator.

116
00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.925
In other words, when she came back...

117
00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:03.225
Oh, no!

118
00:09:10.025 --> 00:09:12.325
And tried to retrieve her coin,

119
00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:15.225
the mischievous crow dropped the planter.

120
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.525
Judging from the circumstances, this is probably what happened.

121
00:09:20.525 --> 00:09:22.025
Convincing.

122
00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:24.625
I really feel sorry for the old lady.

123
00:09:26.425 --> 00:09:29.225
I wonder if such a coincidence exists.

124
00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:31.025
She happens to drop her coin and it just happens

125
00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:33.425
to roll under the refrigerator that is put out as trash.

126
00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.225
Right above her is a row of planters are lined up.

127
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.525
And just as she tries to retrieve her coin,

128
00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.525
the crow just so happens to drop the planter.

129
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.425
Hey!

130
00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:04.725
"Closed for Safety"

131
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:10.325
You can't make it out to the roof.

132
00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:11.725
If so...

133
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.625
What's up, Conan?

134
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:25.325
The only way it can be done is from that room on the 5th floor.

135
00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:28.025
"504: Imai, 404: Egami"

136
00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:30.225
You're...

137
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.325
Ms. Imai.

138
00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:34.225
Thank you just a while ago.

139
00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:36.525
Thank you for doing your rounds.

140
00:10:36.525 --> 00:10:38.025
Have a nice day.

141
00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:39.525
Huh?

142
00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:42.725
Good morning.

143
00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.725
Good morning.

144
00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:52.325
Ayumi, do you know her?

145
00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:55.725
Well, she looks very familiar, but...

146
00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:59.825
She lives right above that old lady's room, right?

147
00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.225
Yeah. We asked her if she saw anything

148
00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:05.825
during our investigation.

149
00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:08.825
Does she live with her family?

150
00:11:08.825 --> 00:11:12.325
No. I heard she was living alone.

151
00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:14.325
But, is something about her bothering you?

152
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:17.225
I'll bet you fell in love at first sight with her.

153
00:11:17.225 --> 00:11:20.725
Do you like older women like her?

154
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.425
I wonder who she is.

155
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:27.425
I know I met her somewhere before.

156
00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:36.825
What? This is not an accident?

157
00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:38.725
But a homicide?

158
00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:46.125
Yes. If the crow hooked its feet onto the planter,

159
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:49.725
it would have fell upside down or diagonally.

160
00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:52.825
Naturally, if the planter fell on her head, it would crack to pieces.

161
00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:56.225
But that planter was cracked

162
00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:58.925
as if it had fallen bottom first.

163
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:02.425
Which means

164
00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:05.125
it came falling straight down.

165
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:08.325
In other words, the planter was not hooked by the crow,

166
00:12:08.325 --> 00:12:10.625
but rather, removed from the fence and dropped.

167
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:19.325
Only humans can do something like this.

168
00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:32.947
But, then who killed granny?

169
00:12:32.947 --> 00:12:35.847
The person living on the top floor.

170
00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:38.447
What?

171
00:12:39.547 --> 00:12:42.047
She's the only one who could've done it.

172
00:12:42.047 --> 00:12:45.447
I checked and found that nobody can go out to the roof.

173
00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:48.947
The one who can hang a planter from granny's window

174
00:12:48.947 --> 00:12:50.947
is the one who lives on the floor right above her.

175
00:12:50.947 --> 00:12:52.547
No one other than her could.

176
00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:57.447
It's true that you can't do it from a lower floor.

177
00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:00.147
Please wait, Conan!

178
00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:03.647
It's true that she can hang a planter, but...

179
00:13:03.647 --> 00:13:07.347
You're going to ask why granny was under the window, right?

180
00:13:07.347 --> 00:13:12.747
Yes, because granny went there only because she dropped her coin

181
00:13:12.747 --> 00:13:15.747
and it rolled under the refrigerator.

182
00:13:15.747 --> 00:13:17.747
In other words, it was a coincidence.

183
00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:18.747
Right!

184
00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:20.347
It's true that, that part was a coincidence.

185
00:13:20.347 --> 00:13:24.247
If so, your deduction won't work out, Conan.

186
00:13:24.247 --> 00:13:26.747
Because you can't possibly bring your target

187
00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:29.747
to the place of your choice.

188
00:13:29.747 --> 00:13:30.847
Yes, you can.

189
00:13:30.847 --> 00:13:32.547
How?

190
00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:36.747
Well, I've been thinking from morning, but I still don't know.

191
00:13:36.747 --> 00:13:40.347
-But I'm certain. -Wrong, Conan!

192
00:13:40.347 --> 00:13:42.547
She's not the kind of person

193
00:13:42.547 --> 00:13:44.347
who would do a frightening thing like that.

194
00:13:44.347 --> 00:13:45.947
She's kind.

195
00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:49.347
So, do you know her after all, Ayumi?

196
00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:52.047
She wasn't wearing the usual uniform so I didn't recognize her,

197
00:13:52.047 --> 00:13:53.647
but now I remember.

198
00:13:53.647 --> 00:13:57.047
If I'm not mistaken, she works at the bakery in front of the station.

199
00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:03.647
So, you're still in 1st grade.

200
00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:06.747
Yes, I go to Teitan Elementary.

201
00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:10.247
You're really fantastic being able to run errands.

202
00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:13.147
No, not really. Anybody can do this.

203
00:14:13.147 --> 00:14:15.747
Here you go. Thank you for waiting.

204
00:14:15.747 --> 00:14:20.447
When I was in 1st grade, I was kind of dense.

205
00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:23.447
Same here. That's how most of us are in 1st grade.

206
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:25.847
Right, that's how most of us are.

207
00:14:27.247 --> 00:14:31.247
I was so embarrassed, so I haven't been to that shop since then.

208
00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:34.547
She was nice enough to remember me.

209
00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:37.047
I don't see how you can suspect someone as nice as her.

210
00:14:37.047 --> 00:14:38.647
It's not a very good

211
00:14:38.647 --> 00:14:40.747
to suspect people right off the bat like that, Conan!

212
00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:44.347
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

213
00:14:44.347 --> 00:14:46.347
-Conan! -Conan!

214
00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:59.247
No matter how much you think, there is no way to lure the old lady

215
00:14:59.247 --> 00:15:01.747
to come right below the window.

216
00:15:01.747 --> 00:15:05.247
The poor granny was accidentally killed

217
00:15:05.247 --> 00:15:07.447
by a mischievous crow, after all.

218
00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:12.247
No, there's got to be a way.

219
00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:20.347
Hey, sonny, it's dangerous!

220
00:15:20.347 --> 00:15:22.147
Could you wait a while?

221
00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:27.647
So, that's the story.

222
00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:35.247
What's the matter, Conan?

223
00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:36.647
I've figured out

224
00:15:36.647 --> 00:15:41.347
how she lured granny to go below the window.

225
00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.347
It's this.

226
00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:45.347
What's that?

227
00:15:45.347 --> 00:15:47.347
Don't tell me that this is...

228
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.447
Yeah. It's the thing

229
00:15:49.447 --> 00:15:52.047
that Grandmother Crow wouldn't miss for the world.

230
00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:57.647
Conan and the others really get me mad.

231
00:15:57.647 --> 00:16:01.247
How dare they suspect such a nice and kind lady.

232
00:16:03.847 --> 00:16:06.947
Gosh! They're still investigating something on her!

233
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:12.247
Excuse me. About that lady that works at the bakery over there...

234
00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:15.147
Ayumi.

235
00:16:15.147 --> 00:16:18.347
You know, Conan, how sad do you think a person would feel

236
00:16:18.347 --> 00:16:21.347
if she's suspected when there's no proof?

237
00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.547
Cut it out already!

238
00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:24.347
Well, you see, Ayumi...

239
00:16:24.347 --> 00:16:27.447
We've found the evidence.

240
00:16:27.447 --> 00:16:29.047
What?

241
00:16:29.047 --> 00:16:30.247
No way...

242
00:16:41.447 --> 00:16:42.747
Did you want anything with me?

243
00:16:42.747 --> 00:16:46.647
About yesterday...

244
00:16:46.647 --> 00:16:50.847
Can you show me your lottery ticket?

245
00:16:50.847 --> 00:16:53.547
You bought a lottery ticket yesterday, didn't you?

246
00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:56.247
Just one ticket at the lottery ticket sales booth near the bakery.

247
00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:58.047
Please show me that.

248
00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:01.947
You have it, don't you?

249
00:17:03.847 --> 00:17:05.447
Please show it to us.

250
00:17:05.447 --> 00:17:08.247
You have it with you, don't you?

251
00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:14.347
-It's okay already, Ayumi. -Yes.

252
00:17:14.347 --> 00:17:15.747
But...

253
00:17:15.747 --> 00:17:20.547
It wasn't an accident that the planter came falling and hit granny.

254
00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:23.647
Ayumi, although you insist that it can't be,

255
00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:25.247
the only thing thinkable is that

256
00:17:25.247 --> 00:17:27.647
the lady living in that room above did it.

257
00:17:41.547 --> 00:17:45.247
She hooked up granny's planter and got hold of it.

258
00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:48.247
Next, you dropped a long string down to the floor.

259
00:17:48.247 --> 00:17:50.447
Then you stuck the lottery ticket that you bought

260
00:17:50.447 --> 00:17:53.147
on the tip of the string

261
00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:56.847
and put it by the entrance

262
00:17:56.847 --> 00:18:00.347
and waited for granny to return.

263
00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:14.847
When granny tried to pick the lottery ticket up,

264
00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:16.647
you pulled the string.

265
00:18:21.247 --> 00:18:23.947
That way, you can position the granny at exactly where you needed.

266
00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:27.247
I don't think you could see granny's head

267
00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:30.447
because of the over-sized refrigerator.

268
00:18:54.647 --> 00:18:58.247
All you had left to do was retrieve the lottery ticket, right?

269
00:19:04.747 --> 00:19:08.947
The 500 yen was something that you had put there to begin with,

270
00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:12.047
to camouflage an unnatural situation, right?

271
00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:13.947
I couldn't figure it out at first,

272
00:19:13.947 --> 00:19:17.847
but when the trash collectors came a while ago,

273
00:19:17.847 --> 00:19:21.347
I noticed the traces of a string underneath the refrigerator.

274
00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:28.547
Moreover, the ripped part of the lottery ticket was found there, too.

275
00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:32.647
With the torn piece of lottery ticket,

276
00:19:32.647 --> 00:19:36.347
I'm sure we'll find your fingerprints on it.

277
00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:39.647
It's okay.

278
00:19:39.647 --> 00:19:42.147
You don't have to go out of your way to look for the fingerprints.

279
00:19:45.547 --> 00:19:49.547
But, why? Why did you kill granny?

280
00:19:51.847 --> 00:19:55.547
She made me look like a fool, at the bakery I work for.

281
00:19:59.847 --> 00:20:01.447
See, see.

282
00:20:01.447 --> 00:20:05.647
I read your letter. What a laugh this letter is.

283
00:20:05.647 --> 00:20:07.547
Look at it.

284
00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:10.047
Why do you have that?

285
00:20:10.047 --> 00:20:11.847
I ripped it and threw it away.

286
00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:15.947
Oh, my trash.

287
00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:17.647
That's right, you're grandmother crow.

288
00:20:17.647 --> 00:20:19.847
You got it from the trash.

289
00:20:19.847 --> 00:20:21.147
Give it back to me!

290
00:20:29.147 --> 00:20:32.847
What are you so worked up about?

291
00:20:32.847 --> 00:20:36.047
I'm going to enjoy myself with this letter for a while.

292
00:20:41.247 --> 00:20:45.347
It was a letter of goodbye from my boyfriend.

293
00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.547
How cruel.

294
00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:52.747
I was trying to forget him.

295
00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:54.547
But she had the nerve to go out of her way to pick it up

296
00:20:54.547 --> 00:20:57.247
and laugh about it on top of showing it to others!

297
00:20:57.247 --> 00:20:58.547
But...

298
00:21:02.447 --> 00:21:06.447
You're still little, so you may not understand.

299
00:21:06.447 --> 00:21:09.747
But you'll eventually find out

300
00:21:09.747 --> 00:21:13.047
that there are things that people cannot forgive

301
00:21:13.047 --> 00:21:17.047
even if it seems to be very trivial.

302
00:21:17.047 --> 00:21:20.447
But no matter how unforgivable,

303
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:23.847
you're not supposed to take other people's lives, Noriko!

304
00:21:28.447 --> 00:21:30.247
You're right.

305
00:21:49.547 --> 00:21:50.947
Will you please accept this?

306
00:21:50.947 --> 00:21:53.547
I can't possibly take it with me, so...

307
00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:58.747
What is it?

308
00:22:03.247 --> 00:22:06.347
I understand

309
00:22:06.347 --> 00:22:10.247
how sad you must've been at that time even if I'm a child.

310
00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.447
But...

311
00:22:13.447 --> 00:22:16.547
what's bad is bad!

312
00:22:19.247 --> 00:22:21.847
Exactly, Ayumi.

313
00:22:25.347 --> 00:22:28.947
City crows sure are sinners.

314
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:03.047
"Next Episode"

315
00:24:03.047 --> 00:24:05.147
It was the man we saw just a while ago!

316
00:24:05.147 --> 00:24:06.347
Which means that...

317
00:24:06.347 --> 00:24:09.647
The two cases are not related to each other in any way.

318
00:24:09.647 --> 00:24:12.047
It can only be explained as a case of "synchronicity".

319
00:24:14.247 --> 00:24:17.047
If Takehiko was really killed,

320
00:24:17.047 --> 00:24:20.247
it would have nothing to do with the case in Beika-cho.

321
00:24:20.247 --> 00:24:23.047
Right, everything fits in too well.

322
00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "A Case of Synchronicity (Part 1)"

323
00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:32.774
Next Conan's Hint:

324
00:24:32.774 --> 00:24:34.974
"Twins"

325
00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:36.174
The next episode has to do with synchronicity.

326
00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.174
It means something that occurs at the same time,

327
00:24:37.174 --> 00:24:39.474
that is, to attune to something.
