1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,040
The three members of The Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,640
spent their time absorbed in a new TV game during summer vacation.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,540
At the convenience store, we coincidentally happened to run into

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,140
a boy who goes to the same Teitan Elementary as us,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,940
and while talking to him we end up going to his relative's house

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,140
to play the TV game.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,540
I sensed something suspicious about that home that we went to

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,940
and just then, Toshinari finds a ruthlessly killed body

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,140
in the room next door!

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,740
In the meantime,

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,340
between the two police detectives Sato and Takagi...

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,040
I don't have it...

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,240
You know, that.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,940
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,940
Oh boy.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,440
Don't tell anybody because it's embarrassing.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,640
Miwako's having a baby?

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
She's pregnant, right?

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,940
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,640
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,440
Officer Takagi's going to be a Daddy?

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,240
The two are shocked, a shocking trick.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,840
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:00,419
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Truth)"

27
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,819
I'm back.

28
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,519
What's up? This sinister atmosphere...

29
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,419
The fact is, Officer Chiba...

30
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,219
I, I found it!

31
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,419
Bento that was made on August 13th

32
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,219
and the newspaper dated August 13th.

33
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,219
Well, I buy newspapers every day.

34
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,119
But, no matter if you're just taking care of him for a week,

35
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,119
feeding a child only snacks,

36
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,819
bentos from convenience stores and cup noodles.

37
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,719
I think you should think more about what you feed him, no?

38
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,019
After all, Noriya's still growing.

39
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,219
Motherly instinct is growing in Officer Sato?

40
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,519
And, and...

41
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,719
I'm the Daddy.

42
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,519
Hey, Officer Takagi?

43
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,919
Did you go confirm at the convenience store?

44
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,119
Yes.

45
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:34,719
He was in view on the surveillance camera of the convenience store!

46
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,519
Mr. Yasutomi, at around 06:00 pm yesterday,

47
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,519
August 13th, shopping!

48
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,619
Of course, Toshinari and Noriya were in view shopping too.

49
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,619
Really?

50
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,919
And about six months ago,

51
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,319
there seems to have been a traffic accident

52
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,519
on the road in front of the florist near the convenience store.

53
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,819
-Traffic accident? -Yes.

54
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,519
Something about a woman suddenly running out in front of a car,

55
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,019
and though the driver steered away to avoid her,

56
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,119
couldn't make it in time,

57
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,719
and ended up crashing into the guardrail on the opposite side.

58
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,119
The driver was unconscious.

59
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,519
Thanks to someone nearby calling the police,

60
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,519
the driver lived.

61
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,319
But, as to the woman who was run over,

62
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,319
no one noticed that she was stuck under the car because of her clothes.

63
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,719
And due to delayed treatment,

64
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,319
she passed away.

65
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,319
According to the driver,

66
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,819
it seemed that the woman came dashing out into the street

67
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:34,919
as if she was being chased.

68
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,419
And, what does that accident have to do with this murder case?

69
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,719
It seems that the convenience store salesclerk saw

70
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,919
Mr. Yasutomi fleeing from the site of the accident.

71
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,119
Moreover, the woman who was run over...

72
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,919
Yes.

73
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,219
The one who died in that accident was my older sister, Mika.

74
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:59,319
I'm making it a point to bring flowers every day

75
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,719
to the accident site since then.

76
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:03,619
Is... is that so?

77
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:08,519
But aren't those flowers are bit flashy to be decorated as offerings?

78
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,419
My sister used to like pink.

79
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,819
I thought that maybe once in a while, such colors would be nice.

80
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,219
I see.

81
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,619
Sir.

82
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:22,319
Was your sister troubled about something?

83
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,719
For example...

84
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,119
stalkers?

85
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,819
Was she?

86
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,919
No.

87
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,819
I haven't heard of anything like that in particular from her.

88
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,419
Just as I thought...

89
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,619
The one who killed Mr. Yasutomi is this man,

90
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:42,519
Mr. Toshinari Shiga.

91
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,019
But, he has an alibi that on August 13th,

92
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,719
for two hours between 7:00 to 9:00 in the evening

93
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,419
he was with Noriya right through.

94
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,319
I'm going to air the room out a bit.

95
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,819
Oh no, it's already sundown!

96
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,119
I've got to go home.

97
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,719
No joke? I opened the bag of snacks.

98
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,119
Genta, you're spilling it.

99
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,819
Aren't there plates or something?

100
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,119
I think there were some paper plates.

101
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,819
What happened to your leg?

102
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,219
It looks like pinch marks.

103
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,919
I think I over scratched the mosquito bite.

104
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:31,019
Hey, the Yaiba movie you saw last night was it by chance...

105
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,819
Yes, that's right!

106
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,019
I watched it and holding back wanting to go pee!

107
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:40,919
If so, that newspaper...

108
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,019
Don't tell me.

109
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,619
Conan?

110
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,919
Just as I thought...

111
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,419
Only the newspaper for August 12th is gone.

112
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,719
No doubt about it!

113
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,119
He's the killer.

114
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,719
He distorted the time

115
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:03,519
and completed his alibi trick.

116
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,219
He even twisted Noriya's thoughts.

117
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,019
At any rate...

118
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:14,719
If between the hours o f 7:00 to 9:00 last night,

119
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,119
when the crime was committed,

120
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:20,219
Toshinari and Noriya who were in the room next to the crime site,

121
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,619
didn't hear any suspicious sounds

122
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,519
because of the TV program they were watching,

123
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,519
we'll just have to ask the other people who live in this apartment.

124
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,619
But since this apartment is scheduled to be destroyed next year

125
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,919
the only other residents here

126
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,019
are the elderly couple who live upstairs.

127
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,919
It seems that they spent the night

128
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,419
over at their grandchildren's home last night.

129
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,819
Is that right?

130
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,319
Ai, I'll leave everyone to you.

131
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,819
Okay.

132
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,219
Come on, all of you!

133
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,219
Let's spend the night at Dr. Agasa's house

134
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,219
and have a ball playing TV games!

135
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,719
Okay, let's play Titan Hunter, then!

136
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,819
Let's, let's!

137
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,919
Okay, I'll bring the software from my house then!

138
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,919
Will you come too, Noriya?

139
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,019
I'd like to ask you all kinds of things about the game.

140
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,219
Besides, you don't want to sleep in a room

141
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:10,219
next to where a murder was committed, do you?

142
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,219
No.

143
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,919
Aren't you going?

144
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,919
No!

145
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,219
By the way, why did you move to an apartment like this

146
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,019
that's scheduled to be destroyed next year?

147
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:26,919
I wanted a change of pace.

148
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,519
Because I used to live with my sister before

149
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,519
but since she died from the accident.

150
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,919
But, you moved here just a month ago, right?

151
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,319
I'd think that you'd buy pots and pans and the like,

152
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,619
but there's nothing in this room!

153
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,919
Well, cooking's not my piece of cake,

154
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,219
so I have no kitchen appliances.

155
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:51,519
But since you have no detergent or sponges under the sink,

156
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,019
it means that you don't have plates or cups either, right?

157
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,919
Right, I was going to go get some soon.

158
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,619
Oh, is that so?

159
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,119
I thought it was because you were planning

160
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:07,919
to move out right away after killing Mr. Yasutomi who lived next door.

161
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:27,127
Conan, what do you mean?

162
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,327
Toshinari was watching TV during the time the crime was committed

163
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,327
from 7:00 to 9:00 last night, wasn't he?

164
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,027
Together with Noriya.

165
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:39,127
But, Noriya said he was holding back going to the bathroom all

166
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,727
during the time the movie was playing.

167
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:45,227
That means that there were no commercials

168
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,027
for 2 hours straight, right?

169
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,027
I see! It's was a rental DVD.

170
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,627
Rental DVD?

171
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:56,727
Yes. If the movie is aired on TV,

172
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,527
at the same time it would be released as DVDs

173
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,727
and rented out or sold already.

174
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,127
I see.

175
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,827
He placed the DVD that he prepared beforehand

176
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,327
and placed it in the player,

177
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,927
then play it at the appropriate time,

178
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:14,527
it would look as if the movie is playing on TV to a child.

179
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,227
But, Toshinari...

180
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:19,227
The night of the crime, on August 13th,

181
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,327
didn't you say that aside from the game,

182
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,327
you were watching the movie right through with Noriya?

183
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:27,527
Yes. Before and after the movie too.

184
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,727
Then, it'd been impossible for you to...

185
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:35,127
Are you sure it was August 13th?

186
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,727
Yes.

187
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,527
It seems that he had Noriya confirm

188
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,627
the date of the newspaper that day.

189
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:44,527
Right?

190
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:45,527
Yes.

191
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:46,527
See!

192
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:50,027
That day was unmistakably August 13th.

193
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:53,627
I see. I guess I made a mistake.

194
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,227
They wouldn't be selling newspapers of the future,

195
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,927
that is the following day, would they?

196
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,027
Tabloids.

197
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:03,127
If it's the so-called evening newspaper

198
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:05,827
the date of the following day is printed.

199
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:09,427
If he bought that and made Noriya confirm.

200
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:12,327
He could've tricked Noriya into thinking that it was the wrong date.

201
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,027
Come to think of it,

202
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:17,627
only the newspaper dated August 12th was gone.

203
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:18,727
I see.

204
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:22,527
You got rid of the evening paper that was dated August 13th

205
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,427
that you bought on the 12th, didn't you?

206
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:28,627
In other words, you were watching the movie on TV with Noriya

207
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,727
on the night of August 12th.

208
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,927
So, it would've been completely possible for you to commit the crime

209
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,627
on the night of August 13th, no?

210
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,627
Please wait!

211
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,427
Didn't Noriya tell you?

212
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,327
That we watched the movie on TV yesterday!

213
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,727
I'm pretty sure that children can tell the difference

214
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,827
between yesterday and the day before, can't they?

215
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:52,327
If you think I'm lying, please call Noriya back here and ask him!

216
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:55,227
He'll tell you that today is the day after we watched movie.

217
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:57,727
Come to think of it, Noriya was saying...

218
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,327
At sundown on August 13th,

219
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:02,027
after returning from the convenience store,

220
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:04,627
he played the game till the movie started,

221
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:08,627
then after the movie he played the game again until quite late.

222
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:11,627
He woke up early in the morning played again,

223
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:16,027
then went to the convenience store to buy breakfast

224
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:19,927
and played until around noon but, got sleepy so took a nap

225
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,027
and resumed playing the game again after getting up.

226
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:23,627
Then, since they got hungry,

227
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,127
they went to the convenience store again

228
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:26,927
where he met us.

229
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:32,727
Noriya said that he was with me playing the TV right through, didn't he?

230
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:36,627
Yes. But he also said that after he went to buy breakfast with you

231
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:40,627
at the convenience store and finished eating, you went out.

232
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:44,927
He said you told him to use the headset and keep playing the game.

233
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:47,027
Where did go out to?

234
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,827
I just went out to take a puff.

235
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,527
Besides that was this morning.

236
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,627
Time wise it has nothing to do the crime, does it?

237
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,327
Talking of time,

238
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,027
there's no watch in this room, is there?

239
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,727
The only one who can tell what time it is,

240
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:06,527
is you, Toshinari because you're wearing a watch.

241
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,027
Moreover,

242
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:11,027
there're thick curtains by the window

243
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:14,127
and if all you're doing is playing the game eating snacks,

244
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:16,227
you won't get hungry

245
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:19,127
so it'd be easy to lose track of what time it is, right?

246
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:23,527
I think you should at least by a watch or something!

247
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:24,727
Yes.

248
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:28,427
I see, so in other words...

249
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,327
The day before the crime was committed,

250
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,627
on August 12th, you buy the evening paper at the convenience store,

251
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:36,327
and make Noriya think that it's the 13th.

252
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,527
Then that night,

253
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,427
let's say till about a little past 10:00 pm,

254
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:40,927
you make him play the game

255
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,827
and then tell him it's time for the movie.

256
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:45,727
Then, after showing him the DVD till about 12:00 am,

257
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:48,627
if you made him play the game until early the next morning...

258
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:51,127
When you woke him to tell him that it was morning,

259
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,727
it would've been a little after noon on August 13th.

260
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,927
If you made him play the game till sundown that day

261
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,327
and then told him, "Let's go buy breakfast,"

262
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,827
it would really have been at 06:00 pm

263
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,827
on the 13th that you went to the convenience store.

264
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,227
I... I see! In this season,

265
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:10,227
it's bright no matter if it's 6:00 am or 6:00 pm.

266
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:13,127
Then, after eating breakfast,

267
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,927
if you told him that you'd be going out for a while and left,

268
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,927
you would've had more than enough time to murder Mr. Yasutomi.

269
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:22,227
Besides, it seems that Noriya was wearing a headset

270
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:25,227
and probably couldn't hear anything.

271
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,027
Then, afterwards you returned to your room again

272
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,027
and made Noriya play the game until early morning.

273
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:32,827
After this if you urge him to take a nap

274
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:37,327
and make him sleep well till the afternoon of August 14th,

275
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:41,527
to Noriya, the two days, the 13th and the 14th

276
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:45,227
would've seemed to be only one day.

277
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,727
How about it? Is there anything not right here?

278
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,227
What do you mean, how about it?

279
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:54,027
Besides, why would I want to kill the next door neighbor?

280
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,527
Your older sister is really a beauty, isn't she, Toshinari?

281
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:58,827
Hey, sonny!

282
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,327
But, it's strange.

283
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,827
All the pictures towards the end is not looking this way.

284
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:06,527
And there's what looks to be a hole on the top part.

285
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:12,227
You really like your older sister, don't you, Toshinari?

286
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:14,727
You lined all the pictures of your older sister

287
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,427
that you took in secret up and posted them somewhere, right?

288
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:18,927
That's...

289
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,127
Stalking!

290
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,927
Come to think of it, the forensic officer was saying

291
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,527
that there was also a board with pictures posted on them

292
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,327
in Mr. Yasutomi's room too,

293
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:32,027
but that most of them didn't match the discolored part of the board.

294
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:34,327
Which means that the pictures that were posted on that board

295
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,027
were actually these pictures,

296
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,427
and after the crime was committed,

297
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:38,927
in order to erase all connection with yourself

298
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,427
you peeled all of it off,

299
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:44,627
and posted Mr. Yasutomi's pictures over that area!

300
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:46,427
If so, the data of the pictures

301
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:48,427
may still be in Mr. Yasutomi's laptop

302
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:50,927
that was on his desk.

303
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,727
Go check it right away!

304
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,727
Although it may already have been erased...

305
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:55,827
Okay.

306
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,627
I'm sure they're still there.

307
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:03,927
I didn't even think of it.

308
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,527
Besides, I peeled the pictures off

309
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,227
because I didn't want to keep the pictures of my sister

310
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,927
posted in the room of that darn stalker any longer.

311
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:19,527
Which means that Mr. Yasutomi was stalking your sister after all?

312
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:24,127
Yes. I just realized it 2 months ago.

313
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:28,927
I went to offer flowers at the site of the accident

314
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,327
as always when he came to talk to me asking,

315
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:34,527
"Were you her fan too?"

316
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,127
It bothered me so I tailed him

317
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:44,127
and saw from through the window.

318
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,127
Him posting the pictures of my sister

319
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:48,727
on the board while mumbling,

320
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:52,727
"It's your fault for running from me".

321
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:55,727
Don't tell me that your sister came running out to the street

322
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,027
as if she was being chased because...

323
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:01,927
Yes. My sister came running out into the street

324
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:06,127
and got run over because that guy came after her.

325
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,927
Before killing that guy,

326
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:12,227
I asked and confirmed,

327
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:14,727
why he fled back then

328
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:19,427
and why he didn't tell the paramedics that my sister was under the car!

329
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:26,427
If he did, maybe my sister would've still been alive.

330
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:31,227
The man said that he was just plain scared.

331
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:35,427
And so you moved to the room next to Mr. Yasutomi

332
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,527
and schemed this?

333
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:42,027
Yes. I was told to take care of Noriya for a week from,

334
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:44,027
some time ago so...

335
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:49,427
Well, I didn't think that Noriya would fall so nicely for this trick.

336
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,627
Just what're you talking about?

337
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:54,527
Noriya pinched his own feet trying to keep himself awake,

338
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:57,927
and played the game for long hours,

339
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,327
that's why everything went well.

340
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:03,327
He did it because his mother told him to stay with you

341
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:05,227
and cheer you up.

342
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,327
Otherwise, this plan would never have worked out.

343
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,427
I see.

344
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:18,427
So, I was the one who was being taken care of.

345
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:43,327
And? What's Noriya going to do after this?

346
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,027
They're going to let him stay at Dr. Agasa's home

347
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,627
until he's mother returns.

348
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,327
His mother for the time being,

349
00:20:50,327 --> 00:20:52,127
called Noriya to tell him that Toshinari

350
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,627
would be going on a trip for a while.

351
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:59,127
And? Isn't it about time you told me?

352
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:02,027
Who on earth were you planning to give those flowers to?

353
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,527
Of course you, Officer Sato.

354
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:07,027
I actually wanted to give you

355
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:11,127
that Fake Dragonhead along with a ring!

356
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:13,527
Give me a ring and flowers?

357
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,227
Before giving me something like that

358
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:18,227
give me your red badge, Officer Takagi!

359
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,927
Red badge?

360
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,327
It's this one that's being passed out

361
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,727
by the 1st Investigation Division of MPD, right?

362
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,927
But, why?

363
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:29,427
You said that you'd take responsibility, didn't you?

364
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,227
That's why...

365
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:35,227
Remember last time when you let the suspect you handcuffed go

366
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,527
and I nabbed him back?

367
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,727
It seems that I dropped my badge

368
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:42,227
while doing so back then.

369
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,227
After that I realized that I had lost it

370
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:46,827
and went back to the site to look

371
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,727
for it but couldn't find it.

372
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:52,927
I picked it up and have it in my left slacks pocket.

373
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,527
I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.

374
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,527
No joke! Are you serious?

375
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:57,627
Hey, Officer Sato...

376
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:00,127
This is it! My red badge!

377
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,827
I'm glad!

378
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:03,927
Well, although we always wear it,

379
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,527
we don't really have to,

380
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:10,527
we can always get new ones if we ask the execs for it.

381
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,327
Is that right?

382
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:14,927
I thought that I would be asked to submit a written letter of explanation

383
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:16,327
and was embarrassed.

384
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:19,527
That's why I was depressed for a while.

385
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:24,727
You mean the thing that you said you didn't have was...

386
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,227
Right! This red badge!

387
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,727
What?

388
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,427
Watch out!

389
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:35,627
Hey! What's that bummed out look for?

390
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,527
We were able to arrest the perp on the spot,

391
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,627
so shape up, will you? Shape up!

392
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:45,227
Yes.

393
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:50,227
I have this feeling from a while ago that we're being...

394
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:52,227
Watched, right?

395
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:53,527
Miwako.

396
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:56,827
Yumi. Officer Chiba too.

397
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:00,527
Yumi, everybody's looking at us.

398
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:03,827
Why don't you ask yourself why?

399
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:06,427
Miwako, you don't have it?

400
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,727
Right, I found it though!

401
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,327
You found it?

402
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:14,827
See, see? Officer Takagi picked it up for me!

403
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,727
If he told me about it earlier,

404
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:20,227
I didn't have to be so bummed out.

405
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,227
Don't tell me...

406
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,527
What is it?

407
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:28,827
09:36 pm, Wataru Takagi taken into custody!

408
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:31,427
We'll escort him to the interrogation room now!

409
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:32,427
Copy!

410
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:36,027
What? What?

411
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:37,527
Wait!

412
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:42,327
Oh boy. So, Officer Takagi goofed again?

413
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:44,627
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

414
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:49,127
There's been a slight misunderstanding.

415
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,727
Officer Sato!

416
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:53,127
Fantastic!

417
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:02,327
Yes. We're really good friends.

418
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:05,427
Okay!

419
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,827
Oh no! He's drowning!

420
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:14,027
Is there anything important shown here?

421
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:16,927
Next Conan,

422
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:20,927
"The Man Betrayed by the Sea".

423
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,027
