1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:05,682
Ran, Sera, Pops and I were invited

2
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,682
by Sonoko to participate in a TV show.

3
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:12,482
But, after shooting of the program starts

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:15,182
and the locked box with the fruit

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,982
that will be determining the victory

6
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:18,582
or defeat of the patissiers is opened.

7
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:21,082
The corpse of Mr. Takegi,

8
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:24,082
-"Shoutoku Takegi, age 69" -the chief judge found inside.

9
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,882
Moreover, what bothers me more

10
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:28,982
is Mr. Takegi's actions.

11
00:00:28,982 --> 00:00:32,782
Why was he going that far to check the box?

12
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:36,482
Maybe he just thought it was being leaked

13
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,482
to Mr. Kurimura, the champion,

14
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:40,582
who won for six consecutive weeks?

15
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,682
Huh?

16
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:45,282
It seems that he always brought ingredients

17
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:47,782
that went along well with the theme fruit.

18
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,382
So, maybe he suspected

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,182
that Kurimura knew the contents of the box.

20
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,382
Inspector Megure!

21
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,082
Huh?

22
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:56,182
It seems that last night Mr. Takegi

23
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,082
secretly came to the TV station

24
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:00,482
and mingled among the extras of a samurai show.

25
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:01,882
I see.

26
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:02,982
He wanted to make it look

27
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:04,682
as if he wasn't at the TV station

28
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:08,082
and wanted to try catching the perp in the act.

29
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,382
It's very likely that Mr. Takegi was hiding

30
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:12,282
in the storeroom where the box was stored,

31
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:15,182
ambushing the perp.

32
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:22,682
There were traces of blood being wiped off

33
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,682
by the area where the lid and box match.

34
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,882
That means that the box

35
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,382
was at the scene of the crime, no?

36
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:36,282
That's where Mr. Takegi was killed.

37
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,082
By the perp...

38
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:48,182
Who secretly opened the box.

39
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,382
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

40
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,182
are slashed by the light of deduction.

41
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,782
The hidden trick about the box.

42
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,882
What is the key evidence that points to the perp?

43
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:10,382
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:15,382
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:52,811
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 2)"

47
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,611
Oh, here they come!

48
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:01,211
Isn't this Mr. Takegi?

49
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,111
See, he's looking around

50
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,711
and going into the storage room.

51
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,411
The problem is, who's coming after him?

52
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:12,611
Like I told you before, it's me.

53
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:16,311
No. The one who came is...

54
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,611
Producer Taruoka?

55
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,911
Why you?

56
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:24,111
I... I am the producer, you know.

57
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,411
I went to confirm whether the box arrived safely.

58
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,411
-"Toshide Taruoka, age 48" -Mr. Takegi had warned me that

59
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,511
if the contents of the box were to be leaked outside,

60
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:34,711
I would be responsible too, so...

61
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,411
Either way, you're sure taking a while.

62
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,311
You've been inside for about 30 minutes.

63
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:42,511
I forgot where the box was,

64
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:45,411
and I was looking around for it.

65
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,811
The storage room is spacious and really cluttered, you see.

66
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,211
The next one to come is...

67
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,311
Assistant director, Mr. Furuya.

68
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:56,111
He has two young ADs with him.

69
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:02,711
You seem to be taking your time too.

70
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,311
The thing is, I finished checking the box right away,

71
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,311
but I was taking a puff.

72
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:09,411
-"Wataru Furuya, age 31" -It's practically no smoking

73
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,711
inside the TV station,

74
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,411
and ADs are so busy that we have no time to take a puff.

75
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,811
I smoked three to four cigarettes

76
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:17,411
while checking my mail.

77
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,211
Well, the storage room is no smoking too, though.

78
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,011
There you are.

79
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:27,211
You've been inside for about 30 minutes too.

80
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,411
If no one else went in after this,

81
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,911
you two would be the suspects.

82
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,011
What...

83
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:38,211
Oh, I went into the storage room too.

84
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:39,311
Huh...

85
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,911
You did too, Mr. Kasuga?

86
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,011
-"Terafumi Kasuga, age 45" -Yes, sir.

87
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,711
I was concerned about what Mr. Takegi told me.

88
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,511
Although I was confident about the key that I locked,

89
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,111
but as for the key that the TV station locked,

90
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,311
I wasn't too sure because I didn't really check it.

91
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,611
Oh, true!

92
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,911
Mr. Kasuga has come.

93
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:58,211
I think I was inside for about 30 minutes

94
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:01,111
just like the two before me.

95
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,311
Because I checked it many times repeatedly

96
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,411
and took a lot of picture

97
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,111
on top of that to show to Mr. Takegi.

98
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,211
And what did you come up with?

99
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,211
Since the keys were all completely locked,

100
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:16,011
I left for home that day.

101
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,411
After Mr. Kasuga left,

102
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,911
it seems that no one has come into the storage room

103
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:22,611
until some of the staff members

104
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,911
came to pick up the box the following day.

105
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,611
In other words...

106
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:32,011
Producer Taruoka, assistant director Mr. Furuya,

107
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:36,411
and food coordinator Mr. Kasuga...

108
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,211
The perp who killed Mr. Takegi is among you three.

109
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:48,011
-"Nichiuri TV" -So, well...

110
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:51,211
The suspects have been narrowed down to three.

111
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,111
But, who on earth is the perp?

112
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,611
I mean, in the first place,

113
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,211
it's a mystery as to how the key was opened.

114
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,711
Unless we figure that out.

115
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,211
I wonder why it's packed so tightly?

116
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,711
Even if the champion and the challenger were to use it,

117
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,711
they would probably use no more than ten during the program.

118
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,411
You mean, you don't know something so basic?

119
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:20,111
The more packed the box is the better it looks.

120
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,511
The fruit that left over

121
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:25,511
is always given out to the audience by drawing lots.

122
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,911
Well, it seems that the box has a raised bottom,

123
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,611
so that it doesn't get too heavy.

124
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,611
Because it's always packed with rare fruit

125
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:35,211
that you can hardly get a hold of.

126
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:38,611
There seems to be a lot of people

127
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,511
who send in entries to be in the audience.

128
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,311
And, how is it?

129
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,811
Have you figured out the perp?

130
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,411
Not at all. Nowhere close.

131
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,411
We don't even know how the box was unlocked either.

132
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,911
Well, compared to that mystery,

133
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,811
that's trivial.

134
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,011
That mystery?

135
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,311
What?

136
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,011
What's that about?

137
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,411
Hey...

138
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,611
don't tell me you really don't know?

139
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:03,611
Yes.

140
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,911
You don't know something so important like this?

141
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,911
You really haven't realize it?

142
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:11,811
Listen well!

143
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,211
The rear view of Yoko's hair!

144
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,811
In the live program the other day,

145
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:18,111
her hair was quite short.

146
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,211
But, today her hair is long.

147
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,411
The rate at which her hair grew is not normal.

148
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,911
Oh, she's probably wearing an extension.

149
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,611
Exten...

150
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,711
Short for hair extension,

151
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,111
in other words a mini wig!

152
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,611
Mini wig?

153
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,511
In Yoko's case,

154
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:37,911
I think she made it look natural

155
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:40,311
by using a decorative hairpin.

156
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,811
Is that so?

157
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:44,911
I see.

158
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,711
So, that's the story.

159
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:50,011
If so, that person is unmistakably the perp.

160
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,911
You came up with the same idea as me just now, didn't you?

161
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:55,911
Huh?

162
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,711
When she laughs,

163
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,811
those double teeth that show...

164
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:11,511
But, the problem is the proof.

165
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,711
I think that I...

166
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,211
I've met her somewhere before.

167
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:18,711
Huh?

168
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:20,311
What... what is it?

169
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:23,211
Is there something on my face?

170
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,511
Oh, no.

171
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,811
It's nothing.

172
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:30,611
We've taken pictures, so all we've got left to do now

173
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,511
is take the box back and check it thoroughly.

174
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,411
Right.

175
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:38,711
Are those apples all that were in the box?

176
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,511
Yeah.

177
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,611
Weren't there any that were spilled out of the box

178
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:47,011
or stuck to the lid of the box?

179
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,111
We put everything in the box.

180
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,311
If any spilled out,

181
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:53,311
it probably did when we opened the box.

182
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,511
Hey... you mentioned that

183
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,511
there were a lot of theme fruit packed

184
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,711
in that box all the time, didn't you?

185
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,011
Yep. It's always so packed

186
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,611
that two or three would spill out when opened.

187
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,111
Besides the MC Mr. Kenzaki used to always say,

188
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,211
take a look

189
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:10,911
at these fruit that are virtually spilling over!

190
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,811
If so...

191
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,811
That would serve as proof.

192
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:20,711
Oh, hey!

193
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,411
That brat.

194
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,911
He's moving around like he's with Heiji Hattori.

195
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,511
Huh? What's the matter, Ran?

196
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,211
Waves...

197
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:35,011
When I watch the rear view of Sera running off,

198
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,411
I always hear this deep sound inside my ear.

199
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,311
The sound of rippled waves.

200
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,511
As if I magic spell is cast over me.

201
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,811
Ran?

202
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:00,311
What...

203
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,811
Don't tell me you fell in love with her?

204
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:05,011
No, it's nothing like that.

205
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,211
I think you only think that way

206
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,911
because that tomboy is a returnee.

207
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,011
Huh...

208
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,911
Just what do you mean?

209
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,211
See, because she came back from overseas.

210
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:19,211
Way over the sea, right?

211
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,311
What a stupid...

212
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,511
-"Storage Room Number Three" -Why aren't you letting me in?

213
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,911
Come on! Letting me in just a bit!

214
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,211
No!

215
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:31,111
This storage is where the box was kept,

216
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,611
as well as the scene of a crime, you see.

217
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:37,011
Then, didn't you find anything in the storage room?

218
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:41,411
Nothing that has anything to do with the crime for now.

219
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,111
What about something strange inside?

220
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:46,011
Come to think of it,

221
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,711
when I went inside to check the storage room,

222
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,511
a young AD was being scolded,

223
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,411
because the little prop that was to be used

224
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,811
in the kitchen setting of a drama was not washed clean.

225
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,611
The kitchen?

226
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,911
A little prop?

227
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,711
Well, it seemed to have nothing to do

228
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,611
with the case though.

229
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:03,611
Hey...

230
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:07,611
Those three suspects are still there, aren't they?

231
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:11,311
Yeah. They're still waiting in the room.

232
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,511
All three are pleading

233
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,811
that they want to leave as soon as possible.

234
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,211
If I remember correctly,

235
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:19,211
producer Mr. Taruoka says he needs to do

236
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,411
a press conference on the case.

237
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:25,811
Mr. Furuya says he hasn't eaten anything since morning,

238
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,311
so that he'd like to go get a bite to eat.

239
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,711
The food coordinator, Mr. Kasuga,

240
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:33,311
says he wants to go home to feed his pet dog.

241
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,511
I think it was.

242
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:38,411
Then you'd better hurry and start.

243
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,911
Huh? Start what?

244
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,911
Well just a little...

245
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,811
Magic show.

246
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:58,562
What? A magic show?

247
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,562
You mean you called us and the suspects over here

248
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,962
to show us something like that?

249
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:05,462
Moreover, that tomboy's going to do it?

250
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,962
Well, come now...

251
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:10,262
I'm sure that you'll be surprised when you see it.

252
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:14,562
Conan's not here.

253
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:17,362
I'm sure he's with Sera.

254
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,462
-"Waiting Room C" -Over here!

255
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:27,062
Welcome to Masumi Sera's Hall of Magic.

256
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:30,262
I mean, don't tell me that...

257
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:31,762
you're sitting on the box

258
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:34,262
that the victim was put inside?

259
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,362
Well, yes.

260
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,162
I also have the padlock for this box

261
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:41,662
and the key to open it too.

262
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,062
Hey...

263
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,862
I had the large prop staff

264
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,362
prepare a similar box.

265
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,762
The key is for real though.

266
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,762
And, what's going to start?

267
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:56,662
First of all...

268
00:13:56,662 --> 00:14:00,162
Please confirm that there is nothing in the box!

269
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,062
There seems to be nothing inside.

270
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,862
Yeah.

271
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:11,962
Okay!

272
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:13,462
And...

273
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,162
I close the lid of the box.

274
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:21,362
I pull the iron lever of the padlock

275
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:24,262
through the lock hole of the box.

276
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,762
See, it's locked.

277
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,462
So now, without the key for the padlock,

278
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,762
the box won't open, will it?

279
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,162
No.

280
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,862
Then take this key

281
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,762
and leave this room for a while please.

282
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,962
What? We have to go out?

283
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,462
You can come in

284
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,962
after Officer Takagi finishes what he has to say.

285
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,162
Officer Takagi?

286
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:52,462
Oh, hey, where's Conan...

287
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,362
Oh, that's right.

288
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:01,762
Please allow me to explain.

289
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:04,662
The key to this case

290
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,862
is indeed the box locked with a key.

291
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,262
Mr. Kasuga, the food coordinator locked

292
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:12,662
the box filled with fruit with the padlock

293
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,762
and sent it to the TV station.

294
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:19,462
Next, the producer Mr. Taruoka instructs Mr. Furuya, the AD

295
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:22,062
to lock the box with yet another padlock

296
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:25,862
and send it back to Mr. Kasuga.

297
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:30,262
Then Mr. Kasuga removes the padlock that he locked

298
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,662
and sends it back to the TV station again

299
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:36,862
and was stored in the storage room.

300
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:38,162
But then, why the corpse of Mr. Takegi

301
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:41,062
was found inside the box

302
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:43,362
until the program began?

303
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:47,662
Of course after Mr. Kasuga first locked the box,

304
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:51,562
Mr. Furuya, the AD who had come

305
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,862
to pick up the box from the TV station,

306
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:58,262
had confirmed that Mr. Takegi wasn't inside.

307
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,062
Moreover, that key,

308
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:02,762
was a special key with no spare

309
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,962
that it's not easy to pry open.

310
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:08,362
Of course it has no hidden door

311
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:09,762
and is in this condition.

312
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,362
How on earth did the perp...

313
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,962
Never mind the introductory remarks,

314
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,862
hurry up and out with the answer!

315
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:18,862
Please tell us, Officer Takagi!

316
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,862
More than me telling you,

317
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,162
it's faster if I show you.

318
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:29,762
This is indeed the answer!

319
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:35,262
Conan?

320
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,462
Where were you?

321
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,862
I was hiding behind the box.

322
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,562
I mean, where's Sera?

323
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:46,962
Where do you think she is?

324
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,662
Hey, don't tell me that...

325
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,062
In the box?

326
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:56,262
That's ridiculous! The box is locked and yet!

327
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,962
Then, why don't you open it?

328
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,362
No joke!

329
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,762
Why?

330
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,462
I used this.

331
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:25,462
A rubber tube?

332
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,862
It seems to be colored gold

333
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,662
just like the padlock though.

334
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:33,062
I had the large prop staff make it for me a while ago.

335
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:35,462
But, how on earth?

336
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:37,062
Yeah...

337
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:40,362
I'll use this and show you.

338
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,062
Lend me that padlock too, please.

339
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,062
Yeah.

340
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:47,162
When using the padlock,

341
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:50,762
fit the tube onto the tip of the bar.

342
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:54,762
Then, I forced this through the hole of the padlock.

343
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,662
See, like this,

344
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:00,362
it looks like the box is locked.

345
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:02,762
True!

346
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,362
True...

347
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,662
With this all you have to do is twist the lock

348
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:11,362
and the padlock will unlock easily.

349
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:14,562
Moreover, the border at which the tube attached is hidden

350
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,462
by the seam of the parts of the box

351
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,262
where the bar of the padlock is pushed through

352
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:20,962
and can't be seen.

353
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,462
In other words, I pretended to lock the key

354
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,862
using that tube,

355
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:27,862
unlocked the padlock and went inside the box.

356
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:31,762
Conan who was hiding behind the box pulled the tube out

357
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,762
and then really locked the padlock.

358
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,362
That's how it was done.

359
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:41,462
Right. The point of this trick is the padlock.

360
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,762
That is, you don't need the key to lock the box.

361
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:48,262
Mr. Kasuga who knew the contents to begin with

362
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:52,762
didn't need to open the box using such a trick.

363
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:57,662
Producer Taruoka who instructs the padlock to be locked

364
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:01,562
also didn't have the chance to use this trick.

365
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,762
If so, the only person left is,

366
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,362
the one who was instructed

367
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:08,962
by Mr. Taruoka to lock the box and send it back...

368
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:11,062
Mr. Wataru Furuya, the AD.

369
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:16,862
I think you're the only one who could've done it?

370
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:23,762
You probably just did it to get your reward

371
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,762
for telling the champion

372
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,862
what the theme fruit in the box was.

373
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,462
You must've been opening the box each time

374
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:30,462
in the storage room.

375
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:38,962
Last night Mr. Takegi was hiding.

376
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,462
Since he saw you and got at you for what you were doing,

377
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:44,262
you got into a struggle...

378
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,662
You killed him inadvertently,

379
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,262
and then hid him into the box

380
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:56,862
at the spur of the moment, no?

381
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,462
Where do you have such evidence?

382
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:01,562
The evidence is...

383
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:03,862
In your stomach, Mr. AD.

384
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:04,962
Huh?

385
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,762
Mr. AD, after you put that man into the box,

386
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:10,062
you drank up about ten juiced apples

387
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:12,262
because there wasn't enough space to put him inside, right?

388
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,262
You did this by using the little prop juice mixer

389
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,262
that was in the storage room, no?

390
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:19,162
After all, the footage of the surveillance camera

391
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:20,662
shows that you weren't holding anything

392
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,262
when you came out of storage room.

393
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,962
Even if it were so,

394
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:28,062
it's already digested in my stomach.

395
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,762
Don't you know?

396
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,562
There is a substance in the seed of apples

397
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:35,462
called amygdalin,

398
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,362
and over eating it can cause problems, you know?

399
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:41,762
Mr. AD, when you put the apples in the juice mixer,

400
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:44,462
you didn't take away the seeds, did you?

401
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,462
Well, don't worry.

402
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,062
If it were seeds from about ten apples,

403
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:53,062
it can't give you cyanide poisoning.

404
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:57,362
But, if you haven't eaten anything from morning,

405
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,462
I'm sure you haven't moved your bowels yet.

406
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:01,962
So, I think it'll come out in time,

407
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,762
the seeds of the rare apple

408
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,262
that weren't crushed by the juice mixer.

409
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,762
When they come out,

410
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,562
the case is closed.

411
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:18,062
I guess it's a case of your bowel tells it all.

412
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:42,962
Oh! It's on the internet news!

413
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,562
Just as Sera had said,

414
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,362
the seeds came out of the AD

415
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,862
and matched those of the theme apples.

416
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:52,562
It seems that the champion Mr. Kurimura confessed too.

417
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:56,362
That he knew the theme fruit beforehand.

418
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:59,462
But, Conan was really amazing this time too.

419
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,062
I didn't know that...

420
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:03,762
the seeds of apples were poisonous.

421
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,062
I... I just happened to remember

422
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:08,362
what Shinichi told me.

423
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:12,362
You and Shinichi are really close, aren't you?

424
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:14,362
By the way...

425
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,962
I have something I'd like to ask you, Sera.

426
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:22,862
Oh yeah, you were said something like that a while ago.

427
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:25,762
Sera, by any chance...

428
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:30,262
Have you ever met me somewhere before?

429
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,362
Huh?

430
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:39,862
Well, I wonder...

431
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:41,362
What?

432
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:44,662
Sorry, but I can't tell you that.

433
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:48,762
Not until the time comes.

434
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,162
-"Next Episode" -These are the things

435
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,562
my belated husband had collected.

436
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,562
I see.

437
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:00,462
Watch out, Dad.

438
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:01,962
Be careful!

439
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,462
Yeah, I know.

440
00:24:03,462 --> 00:24:04,962
Just what is the meaning of this?

441
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,662
What is all this commotion about?

442
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,662
Why did you cancel the passing the audition?

443
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:14,362
Madam's room is...

444
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,062
Mama!

445
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:17,762
Next Conan,

446
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:21,462
"A Diamond, A Portrait and A Great Actress"

447
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,362
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,362
"Sunlight"

449
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:42,662
Talking of shiny light, it's time for star Kogoro

450
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:43,662
to make an appearance!

451
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:44,662
You're really energetic, aren't you?

452
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:46,562
It's because he didn't make any deductions today.
