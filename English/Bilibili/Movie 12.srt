1
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,910
(Domoto Music Academy)

2
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,160
(At around a quarter past three this afternoon,
an explosion occurred at the Domoto Music Academy in Beika.)

3
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,160
(Pianist Renjo Takehiko and the cellist Mizumi Yosuke were killed instantly.
Violinist Soko Kabe was badly injured and sent to the nearest hospital.)

4
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,260
(Soko Kabe. After graduating from the Tokyo University of Arts, she studied
abroad in Vienna Art University, winning multiple musical awards.)

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,450
(After returning to Japan, she participated in multiple performances
and is presently one of the most promising violinists.)

6
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,250
Soko Kabe.

7
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,420
If you want to hate something, hate your own talent.

8
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,100
Everything is for that silent night.

9
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
I am Kudo Shinichi, a high school detective.

10
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,540
When I was at an amusement park with Ran, my childhood friend,

11
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,920
I witnessed men in black in the process of a suspicious transaction.

12
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,930
While caught up in watching the deal,

13
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,180
I failed to notice that his partner had come up from behind me.

14
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,390
I was forced by that man to take in the poison.

15
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,890
When I woke up,

16
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,730
I found that my body had shrunk.

17
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,860
If they know that Kudo Shinichi is still alive,

18
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,360
they'll try to kill me and even my family and friends.

19
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,780
So I listened to Professor Agasa's advice and hid my true identity.

20
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,200
When Ran asked about my name,

21
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,080
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly hit me.

22
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,000
In order to get more information about the Black Organization,

23
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,920
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm gonna kick it, Mitsuhiko!

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,380
Leave it to me!

26
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,550
Got it.

27
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,550
Mitsuhiko!

28
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
Conan!

29
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,470
It's heading toward you, Ayumi!

30
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,390
Me?

31
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,520
I got this!

32
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,490
Nice!

33
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,160
They are my classmates, Genta, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.

34
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,670
They founded the Detective Boys and forced me to join them.

35
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,010
We have another member,

36
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,420
Ai Haibara.

37
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,550
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

38
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,390
Her parents, who died when she was a little girl,
were both scientists in the Black Organization.

39
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,810
She used to work for that organization too, with a code name Sherry.

40
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,150
The poison APTX 4869 was created by her.

41
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,160
However, because her only sister, Akemi Miyano,

42
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,200
was killed by the people of the Black Organization.
So she started to disobey the organization.

43
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,960
She took the pill intending to end her life.

44
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,790
However, her body shrunk.

45
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,550
That's how we met and went to the same class of grade one.

46
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,220
In the meantime, I am still investigating
the true identity of the members of the Black Organization.

47
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,140
However, this little detective

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
always forgets his own situation.

49
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,900
With his natural ability of deduction and Professor Agasa's inventions,

50
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,320
he has solved a lot of tricky cases.

51
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,070
Thanks to him, I am always worried.

52
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,820
However, when we are in the music class,

53
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,740
he got me worried for another reason.

54
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,880
It's your turn to speak your classic lines.

55
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,380
Though my body had shrunk, my mind is still clever.

56
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm the famous detective who can solve all the cases.

57
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,970
Only one truth will prevail!

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,190
Kazuki Domoto?

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,770
You know him, right?

60
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,730
Yeah, isn't he the founder of the music academy
where a bombing occurred last week?

61
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,700
Actually, I am at that place right now.

62
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,120
Mr. Domoto used to be a famous pianist,

63
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,740
but he turned to play the organ all of a sudden.

64
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,040
Plus, in order to build a new concert hall,

65
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,880
he even brought in the organ from an old church in Germany.

66
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,050
The one which was said to be played by Bach himself, right?

67
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,760
I got the chance to attend the opening concert
of Domoto hall after it's completion.

68
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,810
I even get to watch the rehearsal.

69
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,430
It's all arranged by Sonoko.

70
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,440
Come to think of it, Domoto Concert Hall
was built by Suzuki Construction Company.

71
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,240
A piano key?

72
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,570
It flew over here?

73
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,490
Why don't you come with, Shinichi?

74
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,620
You'll get to hear a Stradivarius played live.

75
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,960
Didn't you always say that you want to hear one yourself someday?

76
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,260
What's that guy doing?

77
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,770
Hey, are you listening, Shinichi?

78
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,480
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,320
Unfortunately! I'm in the middle of an investigation now.

80
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,360
Can't you take some time off?

81
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,360
The rehearsal is on the day after tomorrow.

82
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,070
Sorry, I can't go.

83
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,160
The concert is next Tuesday.

84
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,290
I really can't make it.

85
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,210
I said I was working on a case...

86
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,460
But you might be done with the case by then.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,880
I'll ask Sonoko to reserve a seat for you.

88
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,000
I told you I couldn't go. Stop being so meddlesome.

89
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,800
Meddlesome?

90
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,340
No...

91
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,930
You are right!

92
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,810
I'm just a meddlesome karate fool.

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
That's not what I said.

94
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,310
It doesn't matter. Even if you listened to a real Stradivari,

95
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,270
you still can't become the real Holmes.

96
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,440
What?

97
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,740
Because you are tone-deaf, Shinichi.

98
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,030
Ran, you little!

99
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,040
Well, keep up the good work, famous tone-deaf detective.

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,830
Puff, I'll never invite that deduction geek again!

101
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,920
Seriously.

102
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,430
Hello.

103
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,760
Conan, what do you want to eat tonight?

104
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,220
Well...

105
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,730
How about curry? Or do you want to eat something else?

106
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,140
Curry sounds fine.

107
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,440
Great, you've done me a great favor by being so honest.

108
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,150
Stay safe and come back home before it gets dark, okay?

109
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,360
Okay.

110
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,160
See you.

111
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,330
When I am Conan, I'm being "honest", huh?

112
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,590
(Kazuki Domoto
Organist and Composer)

113
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,170
Bravo! Very well played!!

114
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,170
That was excellent, Mr. Domoto.

115
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,930
The Organ has a different kind of charm from the piano.

116
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,390
No wonder Kazuki Domoto is a well-known performer.
That was a marvelous performance.

117
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,770
I've seen that man on television.

118
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,520
There, the man with glasses.

119
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,610
That's Mr. Takumi Fuwa.

120
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,000
(Takumi Fuwa  Domoto Hall director)
He's been the sole tuner for Mr. Domoto for 35 years.

121
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,160
He's now the director of Domoto Hall.

122
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,240
That guy...

123
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,620
The man who just turned his head is a German, Mr. Hans Muller.

124
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,000
He's a tuner of pipe organs.

125
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,630
(Hans Muller  Organ Tuner)
Though he looks pretty happy now

126
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,880
I heard he had frequent disputes with Mr. Domoto in the past.

127
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,390
The one interpreting next to him is Mr. Domoto's son,

128
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,930
(Genya Domoto  Pianist, Kazuki Domoto's son)
Mr. Genya Domoto, a pianist.

129
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,260
He's also in charge of the upcoming performance.

130
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,270
Also, the two women over there.

131
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,480
They are both Mr. Domoto's students.

132
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,110
The one on the right is Miss Rara Chigusa, a soprano,

133
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,720
(Rara Chigusa  Soprano Singer)
from the class of 9 in Domoto Music Academy.

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,950
The woman who seems a bit psychotic is

135
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,740
a student from class of 8 in the same academy.

136
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,200
(Shion Yamane  Violinist)
A violinist, Ms. Shion Yamane.

137
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,120
She's substituting for Soko Kabe,
the person who got injured in the explosion then?

138
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:10,830
Yes, that's right.

139
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,920
When the accident happened,

140
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,590
the Miss Kabe's Stradivarius just so happened
to be sent for adjustments,

141
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,460
so it wasn't destroyed.

142
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
So Miss Shion borrowed it for the performance.

143
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,100
And the person who's sitting in the front is...

144
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,520
She's Miss Reiko Akiba, isn't it? The soprano singer.

145
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,890
I knew you would know her.

146
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,650
She is very famous.

147
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,150
(Reiko Akiba  Soprano Singer)

148
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,780
Now, Miss Shion, get ready.

149
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,940
Okay.

150
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,200
Let's begin with the first piece, Ave Maria.

151
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,950
Yes.

152
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,870
Looking at it, it seems you are not ready to rehearse with me, right?

153
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry. You'll have to wait for a little longer.

154
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm, I'm sorry.

155
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,140
We could finally hear a Stradivari in person, Officer Sato.

156
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,510
Personally, I prefer an Amati.

157
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,600
Be quiet!

158
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,930
That won't do, that won't do!

159
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,060
You are not in the moment!

160
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,480
What have you been doing for the past week?

161
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,400
Was there something wrong?

163
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,240
It sounded perfect.

164
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,660
No, that's not the sound which a Stradivari should make.

165
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,580
Let's start from the top.

166
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,530
Yes.

167
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,520
What? What happened?

168
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,810
The string seems to have snapped.

169
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,610
Sorry, I'll go change it.

170
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,900
What do you think of the balance of the sound?

171
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, I think it's good.

172
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,490
My, my,

173
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,240
do I even have a chance to sing today?

174
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,040
Miss Akiba, do you have a moment?

175
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,670
Would you at least let me go to the restroom?

176
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,260
Mouri.

177
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,970
Do you have any leads on the culprit behind the bombing?

178
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,640
Not yet.

179
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,140
The bomber used plastic explosive, right?

180
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,690
The timer was also found.

181
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,150
The bomb was set to explode
at the time when the two victims were performing.

182
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,150
If that's the case, then...

183
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm sorry, Mouri,

184
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,030
I can't tell you the details of the investigation here and now.

185
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,410
Especially in front of the kids.

186
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,080
Kids?

187
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,750
Go play with the others!

188
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,790
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,420
It's so big.

190
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,470
Not only is it big, it's also beautiful.

191
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,590
It's splendid, isn't it?

192
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,310
How does an organ make sound?

193
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,640
The principle behind it is the same as
the recorders you play at school.

194
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,110
See, there are lots of pipes lined up, right?

195
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,900
Just like blowing into a recorder, when we push air into the pipes,

196
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,070
the organ will make a sound.

197
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,110
Air?

198
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,990
I see.

199
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,830
But the pipes don't have any holes like a recorder.

200
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
That's right. When we play the recorder,
we use our fingers to cover the holes,

201
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,040
in order to make sounds of different pitches.

202
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,420
As for the organ,

203
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,340
we only need to press on the key
to let the corresponding pipe make sound.

204
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,590
Each pipe can only make one sound.

205
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,680
What are those switch-like things?

206
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,140
These? These are known as "Stops".

207
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,520
When you pull these out, the organ will make different sounds.

208
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,110
For example, if I pull this out.

209
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,490
It's a trumpet!

210
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,290
A flute!

211
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,830
An organ player should be able to combine all those sounds

212
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,920
to add variety to their performance.

213
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,460
I see. I've learned a lot today.

214
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,630
Now, time for the long-awaited quiz!

215
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,340
No one is waiting for that.

216
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,220
An opera singer who injured his throat was waiting for an operation.

217
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,190
However, he decided against the operation
and got better after taking a pill from an old man.

218
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,110
Which of the following singer am I talking about?

219
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,900
1. Soprano

220
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,730
2. Alto

221
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,820
3. Tenor

222
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,400
4. Bass

223
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,870
This one's difficult...

224
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,080
Professor, how about a hint?

225
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,880
How do you say "operation" in English?

226
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,250
Operation.

227
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,840
Normally, we pronounce it as Ope.

228
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,050
Also, the pills came from an old man, right?

229
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,470
Conan, have you figured it out?

230
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,550
It's simple.

231
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,720
First...

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,600
It's the first one.

233
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,020
The answer is the first one: Soprano.

234
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,900
An opera singer gave up the operation,

235
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,320
so we should remove "ope" from "opera".

236
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,320
A pill is usually small and round.

237
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,820
An old man's pills indicates grandpa's small circle.

238
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,830
If  we combine it with the "ra" from before,

239
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,250
Ra...

240
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,910
(Note: そふ's katakana is ソフ. The small circle is the half-voiced symbol.)
The little circle...

241
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,290
(Note: そふ's katakana is ソフ. The small circle is the half-voiced symbol.)
of grandpa...

242
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,960
It's soprano!

243
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,170
That's so boring.

244
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,930
You got it right, but it's still rude
of you to call it a boring riddle.

245
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,930
Excuse me, Miss Akiba, can we have a talk now?

246
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,810
Geez. It won't take long, will it?

247
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,230
We just need to know the details about

248
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,530
the email which Miss Soko Kabe sent to you before the explosion.

249
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,530
"I can't work with a bunch of amateurs
who can't tell the differences in sound."

250
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,870
What does that mean?

251
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,910
The meaning? It's just like what it says.

252
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,750
I've told you, me and Miss Kabe...

253
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,290
The first time you two met was on the press conference
for this public concert, right?

254
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,090
She said she was going to listen to
the performance of the two who passed away

255
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,680
and that she would email me her thoughts.

256
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,430
Which means, the music which those two people
played wouldn't match Mr. Kabe's style.

257
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,480
The two called themselves musicians
but they couldn't tell the difference between sound.

258
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,940
So, Miss Kabe thought that
they were not qualified to perform with her, right?

259
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,980
I think so.

260
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,020
Why didn't you ask her directly?

261
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,730
Hasn't she already regained consciousness?

262
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,610
She is conscious, but perhaps due to the blast from the explosion

263
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,990
she had lost her memory of the incident.

264
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,080
Is that so?

265
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,420
Also, we found this at the scene.

266
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,040
The body of the flute?

267
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,040
Yes.

268
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,470
(A flute consists of three parts: the mouthpiece, the body,
and the foot. Only the body was left there.)

269
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,890
Perhaps some student dropped it there.

270
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,930
But isn't it suspicious that only the body was left there?

271
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,770
Does anything come to mind?

272
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,900
Miss Akiba?

273
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,650
No, nothing.

274
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,030
I've had enough!

275
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,950
Wait, Miss Akiba!

276
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,420
What is that?

277
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,540
What are you drinking?

278
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,710
Tea.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,670
Can I have some?

280
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,590
No.

281
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,510
So stingy.

282
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,340
Does it contain ingredients which are beneficial for the throat?

283
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,640
It's none of your business.

284
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,890
If you are right,

285
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,390
maybe we can win the first prize
in the singing competition after drinking this.

286
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,770
Singing competition?

287
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,860
There will be a singing contest between the classes next week.

288
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,530
I know! Why don't you coach us for the competition?

289
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,450
We'll practice in the music room at school
from 2 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

290
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,660
Though Miss. Ran will play the piano for us...

291
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,220
The person who will teach us singing is the problem.

292
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,500
Hey, you brats!

293
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,960
Who did you say was the problem?

294
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,140
- Seriously! What problem?
- Sorry, please don't mind them.

295
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,800
The song you picked isn't "The Ninth", is it?

296
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,100
I hate that song.

297
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
No, it's not the carpenter's song.

298
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,230
It's the school anthem of Teitan Primary School.

299
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,030
"The ninth" refers to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

300
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,320
Is that so?

301
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,160
Fine, I'll coach you guys.

302
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,080
Think of this as a favor from a Teitan Primary School alumnus.

303
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,240
You graduated from Teitan Primary School too?

304
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,710
So, please leave now. You are interfering with the rehearsal.

305
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,500
Okay.

306
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,880
I'm glad that she could coach us singing,

307
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,170
but that lady is kind of rude.

308
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,590
Yeah, I feel the same.

309
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,260
She give off the stereotypical queen aura.

310
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,310
She's a little like you, Haibara.

311
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,360
No, I mean she's a pretty woman.

312
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,480
I can't tell if Miss Akiba was trying to be difficult or kind.

313
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,570
Maybe she drove everyone out to

314
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,870
take pressure off Miss Shion who seemed very nervous.

315
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,160
Aren't you reading too much into it?

316
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,120
Maybe.

317
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,280
0:30

318
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,360
You are taking it so serious against an amateur.

319
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,740
A lion will go all out even if it's chasing after a rabbit.

320
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,170
All right, all right, I am the rabbit.

321
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,290
By the way, we should play mixed doubles next time.

322
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,170
We can ask Makoto and Shinichi out.

323
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Shinichi...

324
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,050
That deduction geek!

325
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,110
No way.

326
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,790
So, you and Shinichi got into a fight.

327
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,500
Marital quarrels and southern winds subside at night.

328
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,080
That's not what happened.

329
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,500
You two are always like this.

330
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,210
You get into a fight, and then always make up right away afterwards.

331
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,800
But I remember the time when you two got into a big fight.

332
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,930
You two didn't talk to each other for a week, right?

333
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,550
When was that?

334
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,060
Remember, during the start of the second year of middle school.

335
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,930
I remember!

336
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,100
At that time...

337
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,980
Wait, what were we fighting about?

338
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,230
Then, how did you two work it out?

339
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,110
You forgot everything?

340
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,110
I think it was...

341
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,870
Stop, stop, wait!

342
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,620
Why did you two go back home together when you were having a fight?

343
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,920
Because our homes were in the same direction.

344
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,550
Fine, just continue.

345
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,060
At that time, it was someone singing.

346
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,890
We heard someone singing from the river.

347
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,190
While we were listening, we just...

348
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,440
made up with each other.

349
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,280
Then, what song was it?

350
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,610
What was it?

351
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,280
Well, it's a very famous song.

352
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,750
But, how do I describe it?

353
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,710
It was a song that reached into our hearts.

354
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,090
♪ On the green mountain ♪

355
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,140

♪ Teitan, Teitan, Teitan Primary School ♪

362
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,050
What do you think of their singing?

363
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,970
Fine.

364
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,600
First, you,

365
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,440
your voice is too loud.

366
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,650
You have to fit in with everybody else voices.

367
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,570
The boy with freckles.

368
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,610
Your pitch is right, but sometimes your mind would drift.

369
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,530
Could it be because you keep staring at
the face of the girl in front of you?

370
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,450
The girl in front of you...

371
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,160
That's Haibara!

372
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,420
Next, this girl.

373
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,500
You sing very well,

374
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,880
but you should sing more like a child.

375
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,840
That's because I'm not a child.

376
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,970
Your pitch was accurate and your voice was lively. Well done.

377
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,640
Don't be influenced by the voice beside you.

378
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,810
- You have to be confident.
- No wonder she's a famous singer.

379
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,770
Even without listening properly,

380
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,230
she could tell the everyone's voices apart.

381
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,900
She has the ears of a musician.

382
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,240
The problem is

383
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,530
you!

384
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,570
Yes.

385
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,870
You were completely off key the whole time!

386
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,660
Did you do it on purpose?

387
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,330
No...

388
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,750
He didn't do it on purpose!

389
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,750
He's just tone deaf!

390
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,250
Are you really trying to help me?

391
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,710
Worst of all, the piano also sounded weird.

392
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,880
The sound was flat the whole time.

393
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,430
Was the piano even tuned?

394
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,510
Really?

395
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,510
I didn't notice.

396
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,930
I think so too.

397
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,390
This person...

398
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,060
Miss Akiba,

399
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,020
do you have perfect pitch?

400
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,020
Yeah, I do.

401
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,650
What's perfect pitch?

402
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,740
The ability to name the pitch

403
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,030
upon hearing it. In other words, the ability to hear the pitch.

404
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,240
For example.

405
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,330
E5 mi.

406
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,710
B3 and F5, si and fa.

407
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,760
Correct.

408
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,760
Awesome!

409
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,090
That's why you are a great singer.

410
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,840
How do I put it,

411
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,430
I don't know if it's essential for a musician to have perfect pitch.

412
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,390
I was born with it,

413
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,150
but there are people that could get it after training.

414
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,320
I heard that was the case for the former piano tuner Mr. Takumi.

415
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,150
All right, that's all my advice.

416
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,160
You have to practice on your own next.

417
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,620
When you can sing better,

418
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,830
I'll come back to coach you.

419
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,120
Are you going already?

420
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,170
I'd like to hear a demonstration before you leave.

421
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,290
I agree!

422
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,670
How much can you pay me?

423
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,340
Professionals don't sing without being paid.

424
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,050
Goodbye.

425
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
That's it.

426
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,350
Hey, that's my tea.

427
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,020
Thanks for the tea.

428
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,310
What's wrong, Genta?

429
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,780
What's wrong?

430
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,990
Genta, Genta!

431
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,990
Are you all right, Genta?

432
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,830
Someone added something in it.

433
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,200
That's what you're thinking, right?

434
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,500
How could that happen?

435
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,910
How's that possible?

436
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,040
Anyway, let's take him to the hospital first.

437
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,170
Is Genta going to be all right?

438
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,510
He seemed to be in a lot of pain just now.

439
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
His eyes even turned red.

440
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,470
When was the last time you had the tea?

441
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,180
I think it was before noon.

442
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,180
Where did you drink it?

443
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,020
At the Domoto Music Academy.

444
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,060
I borrowed a classroom to practice singing.

445
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,150
Before I left, I went to the restroom.

446
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,110
During that time, I left this bottle in the classroom

447
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,360
along with my other things.

448
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,370
If someone put something in it,

449
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,530
it had to be at that time.

450
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,580
But, who could it be?

451
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,120
Thank you very much.

452
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,000
Genta!

453
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,210
Are you all right?

454
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,300
Not at all.

455
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,130
What did the doctor say?

456
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,930
The doctor said his throat is quite inflamed,

457
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,890
but he'll recover in four or five days.

458
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,100
So you will recover?

459
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,050
That's great!

460
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,100
However, that means he can't speak properly for the next four days.

461
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,900
There are only three days until the concert at Domoto Hall.

462
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,820
If Miss Reiko had drank from it,

463
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,780
she might have been unable to perform.

464
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,490
Let's call Inspector Megure

465
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,200
and ask him to analyze the contents of that bottle.

466
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll send the bottle to him then.

467
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,240
But before that...

468
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,910
We'll send Genta back home.

469
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,710
I'll go too.

470
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,790
Me too.

471
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,540
I need to see this child's parents

472
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,960
and ask them why their kid drinks things
from others bottle without permission.

473
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,470
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,930
Genta.

475
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,350
Cheer up, Genta.

476
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,400
Four days

477
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,610
will pass in the blink of an eye.

478
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,530
I want... to eat... the grandpa's pills.

479
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,240
The professor's riddle came true.

480
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,790
Everyone, move to the side.

481
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,380
No,

482
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,170
run!

483
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,050
Hurry up!

484
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,470
Damn it, I can't see his face!

485
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,520
Turn right! Turn right!

486
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,250
What the?

487
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,310
Are you OK?

488
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,610
Shoot!

489
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Are you Okay?

490
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,530
What's wrong with that truck?

491
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,530
Going the opposite direction on a one-way street!

492
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,490
Miss Reiko,

493
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,030
your leg is bleeding.

494
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,830
That's just a minor injury.

495
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,750
Did the truck stop because the taxi showed up?

496
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,710
Or was it...

497
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,960
Sorry, please take care of these kids.

498
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,180
I'm going home in this taxi.

499
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,760
Please tell the police what just happened.

500
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,390
You are leaving?

501
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,810
Nothing good happens when I am with you guys.

502
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
How could she say that?

503
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:21,810
That's mean.

504
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,450
Inspector!

505
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,710
What's the cause of the explosion?

506
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,580
Yes, sir.

507
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,380
We've determined that the room was filled with propane that leaked.

508
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,300
And was ultimately detonated by the lighting of a match.

509
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,680
However, the gas detection device was damaged before.

510
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,300
That means it wasn't an accident, but a murder.

511
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,140
The victim is Osamu Shida, the owner of this shop. He's 36 years old.

512
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,390
Mr. Shida is a violinist,

513
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,690
a student from the class of 1 in Domoto Music Academy.

514
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,310
The class of 1?

515
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,900
The same as the two victims who died in the explosion.

516
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,360
I don't think it's a coincidence.

517
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,070
It's not.

518
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
Officer Sato.

519
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,540
I found this in the shop.

520
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,160
That's...

521
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,460
the footpiece of a flute.

522
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,250
I'm sure of it.

523
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,790
This is a serial homicide committed by the same culprit.

524
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,630
Also, the criminal left us a message.

525
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,840
The body and the footpiece of the flute.

526
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,550
Only the mouthpiece hasn't shown up yet.

527
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,680
The criminal will surely commit another murder.

528
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,850
About the victim who plunged to his death
in the open sea yesterday, Hisao Sone...

529
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,390
He seems to have been a viola player...

530
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,440
Actually, we found out that he was a student
from the class of 1 in Domoto Music Academy.

531
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,440
So, is it possible that...

532
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,570
Mr. Renjo and Mr. Mizumi who died last week

533
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,570
and Mr. Shida who died in the explosion, were classmates.

534
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,750
Also, two years ago, the four of them formed a piano quartet.

535
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,250
As I thought, our suspect is a serial killer.

536
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,630
It should be.

537
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,050
According to the prefectural police, there are

538
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,550
minute cuts by a knife on the glider wing.

539
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,810
What's more important is the thing we found under Mr. Sone's car seat.

540
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,100
You found the rest part of the flute, the mouthpiece, right?

541
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,730
Now that all the parts of the flute appeared,

542
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
does it mean the murder will stop?

543
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,700
I hope so.

544
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,030
By the way, Ran,

545
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,740
Yes.

546
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,000
Inside the bottle which you brought here...

547
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,080
It was determined

548
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,250
there were traces of a highly irritated drug.

549
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,500
It's too serious to be passed off as a prank.

550
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,920
What about the trunk which chased after us?

551
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,180
It was stolen at a place nearby the crime scene.

552
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,470
Which means,

553
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,350
the criminal wanted to hurt Miss Akiba

554
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,140
with the drug in the bottle, but failed.

555
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,890
Then, he went to his next plan,
which was stealing a truck and running her over.

556
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,650
All to achieve his original purpose.

557
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,400
And the purpose is stop Miss Akiba from

558
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,400
performing at the Domoto Hall's opening.

559
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,240
So, if Miss Reiko couldn't perform,

560
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,040
who will replace her?

561
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,460
Most likely, Miss Rara Chigusa.

562
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,880
She was the top candidate for the soprano

563
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,420
because she's the student from the class of 9 in
Domoto Music Academy and was taught by Mr. Domoto.

564
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,130
However, at that time,

565
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,680
Miss Soko Kabe who was chosen to give the performance

566
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,140
highly recommended Miss Akiba whom she had never met
and said she wanted to perform with the latter.

567
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,270
That's how Miss Akiba was chosen for the performance.

568
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,110
So, the next question should be

569
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,400
the connection between those four people had with that incident.

570
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,240
Until now, we haven't found the connection between
Mr. Akiba and the four others.

571
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,780
The only thing we know is

572
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,660
the relationship between Miss Kabe
and the two men who died in the explosion.

573
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,460
But there's still the issue of the performance...

574
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,960
The bomb was placed under the floor near the two men.

575
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,250
If that's the case,

576
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,010
then Miss Kabe might just be collateral damage?

577
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,050
It's too early to say that.

578
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,560
There are others with motives to hurt Miss Kabe.

579
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,190
You mean Rara Chigusa, the candidate before Miss Akiba.

580
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
We have another suspect.

581
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,780
That's Yamane Miss Shion who replaced Miss Kabe.

582
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,740
That person?

583
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,490
If she borrowed Miss Kabe's Stradivari

584
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,660
and gives an excellent performance

585
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,830
at this concert where
all the famous international musicians will gather,

586
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,880
she'll become world famous overnight.

587
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,260
But, there's one more possibility.

588
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,220
Though Mr. Domoto appreciates her talents,

589
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,050
he still asked Miss Kabe to give the performance.

590
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,720
It was not because of Miss Kabe herself,

591
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,980
but the Stradivari she owned.

592
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,900
Mr. Domoto wanted to pick Miss Shion.

593
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,610
That's why he chose Miss Shion to be the stand-in.

594
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,360
Then in order to get his hands on the Stradivarius,

595
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,700
he ensured that Miss Kabe would be seriously injured.

596
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,280
This possibility cannot be ruled out either.

597
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,290
Their relationships are so complicated.

598
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,250
I really got confused.

599
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,460
Anyway,

600
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,330
Rara Chigusa has a motive to kill Miss Kabi and Miss Akiba.

601
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,170
Mr. Domoto and Miss Shion have the motive to kill Miss Kabe.

602
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,010
But we still haven't found the motive
the three suspects have to kill the four victims.

603
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,220
Am I right?

604
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,770
Yeah.

605
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,270
By the say, is there anything special about

606
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,940
the piano in the practice room where the explosion occurred?

607
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,900
No, I didn't hear anything special about it.

608
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,070
Why did you ask that?

609
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,820
When I went to that place,

610
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,950
I saw Mr. Fuwa

611
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,410
taking the piano pieces away carefully as if they were very important.

612
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,500
I thought maybe there might be something special about it.

613
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,960
Hey, didn't I tell you to stop wandering around on your own!

614
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,420
Sorry.

615
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:49,300
Mr. Domoto has played that piano at his home for 30 years.

616
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,220
When he retired from playing the piano,

617
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,220
he moved the piano to the academy for the young students to play.

618
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,100
The piano was tuned by Mr. Fuwa

619
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,940
when it was in Mr. Domoto's house

620
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,730
as well as in the academy.

621
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,240
Perhaps to him the piano is like his child.

622
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,070
Now do you understand, kiddo?

623
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,410
Speaking of which,

624
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,080
Mr. Fuwa seems to have a big problem with the four victims.

625
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,620
He criticized about their attitudes toward life.

626
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,090
But it's impossible that he would kill them for that reason.

627
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,840
True.

628
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,010
Even if their attitude toward life irritated Mr. Fuwa

629
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,390
so that he wanted to kill them,

630
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,270
we still can't connect him to the incident that happened to Miss Akiba.

631
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,230
Inspector,

632
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,440
maybe we should separate Miss Akiba's case

633
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,110
from the other four.

634
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,860
However, those cases all connects to Mr. Domoto.

635
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,240
Don't you find it too coincident?

636
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,070
You've got a point.

637
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,490
Anyway,

638
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,950
we should protect Miss Akiba

639
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,370
until the end of the concert.

640
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,330
I remembered sending Takagi to do it.

641
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,000
Well...

642
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:09,590
She said I was too annoying and drove me out.

643
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,470
Seriously.

644
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,300
What were you thinking, Takagi?

645
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,510
If Miss Akiba is attacked again,

646
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,600
not even a written apology would do you any good.

647
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,520
But she said she would stay at home for the next two days.

648
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,890
You fool!

649
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,310
Is there anyone who would just say "Oh, I see" and leave?

650
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm sorry.

651
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,650
I'm leaving.

652
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,110
Conan!

653
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,200
Morning, Conan!

654
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,240
Good morning!

655
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,660
What's with you guys?

656
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,160
Coming over so early this morning?

657
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,500
We are going to see Kamen Rider.

658
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,080
Kamen Rider?

659
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,460
I got word that

660
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,050
they'll be filming in Ryokuchi Park today.

661
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,760
We think that Genta might recover right away after seeing that.

662
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,140
He seems pretty okay to me.

663
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,180
So we wanted you to come with us.

664
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,600
Where are you going?

665
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,440
I got something to do.

666
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,600
What is it?

667
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,810
Nothing serious.

668
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,690
Is it more important than your friendship with Genta?

669
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,570
I guess I have no choice.

670
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,450
I'm going to meet Miss Reiko.

671
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:16,860
Reiko sensei?

672
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,620
I don't think you should go.

673
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,200
You'll be scolded again.

674
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,250
Maybe, but if I can't protect her from the bad buy...

675
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,880
You mean the bad guy from last time?

676
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,170
Why do you have to protect her?

677
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,960
Why is that?

678
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,590
I don't know.

679
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,680
I just feel obliged to do it.

680
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,320
He said it must be because of love.

681
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,780
Conan prefers older women.

682
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,440
How's that possible?

683
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,780
Anyway, please take care of Genta.

684
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,870
I'm relying on you guys!

685
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,990
Conan!

686
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,250
Is it because he trusts us?

687
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,790
Maybe.

688
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:41,660
Hello.

689
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,870
Morning, Miss Reiko.

690
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,080
Excuse me.

691
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,000
Hey, you.

692
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,540
Nice apartment.

693
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,880
It's a quiet place.

694
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,630
Wait a minute.

695
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,470
What's wrong with you? How could you barge into people's homes?

696
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,510
What do you want?

697
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,220
I want to learn to sing.

698
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,260
I was thinking of some intensive training.

699
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,060
Wait a moment, you are that tone-deaf boy, aren't you?

700
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,810
Not today.

701
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,110
Are you going out today?

702
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,650
I heard that you would go soak in the forest air
one day before important concerts

703
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,820
in order to relax your mind.

704
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,030
Since you know that, why did you come?

705
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,700
I want to go with you.

706
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,160
Gosh, didn't I tell you that

707
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,500
nothing good happens when I am with you guys.

708
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
So I don't want you to stay around me.

709
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,960
You only said those harsh words to protect us, right?

710
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,130
That's because you are sure that you are the target of the culprit.

711
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,560
When you said you wanted to go to Genta's house,

712
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,180
it wasn't because you wanted to tell his parents on him,

713
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,190
but because you wanted to get Genta safely home.

714
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,810
What nonsense are you talking about?

715
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,780
By the way, can I have some juice before we leave?

716
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,070
I'm so thirsty.

717
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,700
Fine.

718
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,660
I only have 100% orange juice.

719
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,580
Don't expect too much.

720
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,120
That'll do.

721
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,000
Flute.

722
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,080
And the man.

723
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,710
Hey,

724
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,880
it's ten years too soon for you to be interested in a lady's bedroom!

725
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,890
Miss Reiko, do you play the flute too?

726
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,470
It's none of your business.

727
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,470
Go back home after you're done drinking that.

728
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,310
I won't teach you how to sing

729
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,520
or take you to the forest.

730
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,400
Okay.

731
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,290
I'll just follow you there. Don't mind me.

732
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,370
Geez. See if I care when you get lost.

733
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,840
It's fine. It's fine.

734
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,550
Inspector Megure, we found the connection
between the four men and Miss Akiba.

735
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,430
What?

736
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,770
Three years ago in January,
in the dormitory of Domoto Music Academy in Izu,

737
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,940
the flute player who lived with them got drunk

738
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,360
and fell off the cliff near their dormitory.

739
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,940
His name is Soma Hikaru and he died at the age of 28.

740
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,570
He's a student from the class of 6 of Domoto Music Academy.

741
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,030
Did they...

742
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,000
Yes, the four men got him drunk knowing that he was bad at drinking,

743
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,830
However, what they had done didn't cause him
to fall off the cliff directly,

744
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,590
so that incident was designated as an accident.

745
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,840
That accounts for it.

746
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,460
So why is it related to Miss Akiba?

747
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,970
In fact, Mr. Soma is Miss Akiba's fiance.

748
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,010
What?

749
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,050
Inspector.

750
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,810
Actually, it's very possible that

751
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,600
she still hates those four men until now.

752
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,560
Then why was she attacked too?

753
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:24,090
♪ Kamen Rider, if you call his name ♪

754
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:31,050
♪ Kamen Rider, he'll show up at any time ♪

755
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,550
Hello.

756
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,890
Hi.

757
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,980
Hi.

758
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,730
Are they mother and son?

759
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,570
They don't look alike at all.

760
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,190
Why are they keeping a distance from each other?

761
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,740
Maybe he got his mother mad?

762
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,830
Seriously.

763
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,410
Hey, do you know why I would take a walk in the forest

764
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,370
one day before the concert?

765
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,290
Because I want to absorb nature into my body.

766
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,720
That's because European music was born out of nature.

767
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,190
Can you understand that?

768
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,360
I think I do.

769
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,450
Are you all right, Miss Reiko?

770
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:45,840
Run!

771
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,600
You go first!

772
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,270
The attack came like I expected...

773
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,690
Oh no!

774
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,780
She'll be shot.

775
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,090
Miss Reiko, this way!

776
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,800
Why... why didn't the person pull the trigger?

777
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,630
What does he want...

778
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,520
Hey, I think we should inform the police.

779
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,400
No, I just told you, if we call the police...

780
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,650
You said there would be delays
and you would miss the concert tomorrow, right?

781
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,200
I know that too.

782
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,280
Then stop talking.

783
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,790
After the concert, I'll tell the police what happened.

784
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,200
Do you understand?

785
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,410
Okay.

786
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,250
Officer Takagi,

787
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,170
Miss Akiba and Conan.

788
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,140
Miss Akiba, where did you go?

789
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,930
Didn't you say that you wouldn't go anywhere today?

790
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,430
I went out on a date with this boy.

791
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,430
D...date?

792
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,060
Miss Akiba, there's something we need to ask you.

793
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,770
Not now.

794
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,320
It's about Mr. Soma.

795
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:35,820
Mr. Soma was your fiance, right?

796
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,330
Officer, I'll tell you everything I know.

797
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,410
But please wait until the end of the concert tomorrow.

798
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:56,590
Inspector, did Mr. Soma have a mole here?

799
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,220
Yes, how did you know that?

800
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,020
Because I saw his photo in Miss Reiko's apartment.

801
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,100
You've been to Miss Akiba's room?

802
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,860
Yeah. Please send me home. I'll tell you everything I know.

803
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,280
So, that's why we sent Conan back.

804
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,360
But in the end, the only thing he knows is that

805
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,620
there's Mr. Soma's photo and a flute in her room.

806
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,410
Geez.

807
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,960
But inspector,

808
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,790
even if she has the motive to kill the four men,

809
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,960
we still can't say that she's the murderer, right?

810
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,800
She was nearly hit by the truck after all.

811
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:43,140
I mean, maybe it's Mr. Soma's family who wants to avenge him?

812
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,310
No, I don't think that's possible.

813
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,480
Please have some tea.

814
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,560
Thanks.

815
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,100
Sorry to trouble you, Ran.

816
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:51,940
Help yourself.

817
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,200
His mother was a single mom and passed away five years ago.

818
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,120
He didn't have any siblings.

819
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,240
What about his father?

820
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,910
I have no idea.

821
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,370
I don't even know if he's still alive.

822
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,460
What is that...

823
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:19,340
There's one other issue with those four that died.

824
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,470
They once performed a concert while drunk.

825
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,520
After that, they were given a good scolding by Mr. Domoto.

826
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,230
What? When did that happen?

827
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,190
Well, actually, it's, I got it.

828
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,020
It was on the concert a year ago.

829
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,570
The piece they played was Beethoven's Piano Quartet.

830
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,160
I know it now, Officer.

831
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,240
I know the one who killed the four men, injured Miss Kabe,

832
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,540
and attacked Miss Akiba. Also his motive.

833
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,830
Really, Mouri?

834
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,630
The culprit is

835
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,010
Genya Domoto. It's you!

836
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,350
The reason is that you worship Beethoven a lot,

837
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,520
and,

838
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,100
you are obsessed with him.

839
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,400
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

840
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,910
You killed the four men

841
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,910
because they played Beethoven's piece when they were drunk.

842
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,290
They violated the sanctity of that great composer.

843
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,920
You hurt Miss Kabe because

844
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,670
when you performed with her,

845
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,340
you two had strong disagreements on the interpretation of the piece.

846
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,390
There's a detailed account of that in Miss Kabe's essays.

847
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,930
Next, you attacked Miss Akiba because she said that,

848
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,690
"You are not going to sing the Ninth, are you?

849
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,940
I hate that song."

850
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,150
That was an insult to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

851
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,900
Wait a minute!

852
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,240
I do love and respect Beethoven a lot.

853
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,530
But I'm not that crazy.

854
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,330
No, I'm sure of it.

855
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,630
The fact that you have the same haircut as him is the proof.

856
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,500
M-Mouri.

857
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,010
Are you kidding me?

858
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,930
This is my natural hairstyle!

859
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,260
I inherited from my deceased mother.

860
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,930
If you don't believe me,

861
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:34,980
please look at this!

862
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,860
Oh, really.

863
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,230
They look very alike.

864
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,030
Now what? My motive to hurt those four men and Miss Akiba

865
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,120
can only be my adoration to Beethoven.

866
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,660
Miss Kabe and I are both musicians.

867
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:56,000
We always argue because of out differing interpretations of music,

868
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,630
but that's limited to the performance!

869
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,250
It's ridiculous of you to think that

870
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,630
I would hate her for that reason.

871
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,380
No, but...

872
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,300
Inspector,

873
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,840
did you pay a visit to us in the middle of the night

874
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,260
to let us hear this absurd deduction?

875
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,430
We have a very important concert tomorrow.

876
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,150
We understand.

877
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,980
Anyway, please go back tonight.

878
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,400
When the concert is over, you can ask us anything you want

879
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,150
and we will definitely cooperate with you.

880
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,280
I thought I was totally correct.

881
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,080
Where did you get that confidence from?

882
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,540
Officer Takagi,

883
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,370
hasn't Miss Kabe regained her memory?

884
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:44,050
Well, we could finally talk to her,

885
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,010
but she kept saying how the pitch of
the sound the air conditioner makes and can't sleep.

886
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:51,600
She's saying all sorts of incomprehensible things.

887
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,020
The pitch of the sound the air conditioner make? Could it be...

888
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,060
You don't need to take it now, right?

889
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,820
Sorry.

890
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,690
Please use this.

891
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,650
Yes.

892
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,740
The piece they'll play are the same as
the ones they will perform on the concert.

893
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,780
Plus, we can sit anywhere we want.

894
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,870
Dress rehearsals are the best.

895
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,840
We'll be seated upstairs during the public performance.

896
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,130
I asked my dad to book the seats for us.

897
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,220
Those are the VIP seats.

898
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,010
There are ten seats, which could hold all of us.

899
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,100
Ten of us?

900
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,640
I also invited Professor Agasa and the kids.

901
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,850
I invited Shinichi too.

902
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:45,940
You should inform him.

903
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,650
Tell him I left the ticket at the reception desk.

904
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,450
I don't think it's necessary.

905
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,870
It's fine. Hurry up. Or the ticket will be wasted.

906
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,370
All right.

907
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,450
But I don't think he'll come.

908
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,910
Sorry, Ran.

909
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,800
It seems you didn't tell the police what happened yesterday.

910
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,010
Thank you.

911
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,680
Never mind that.

912
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,680
How's your leg?

913
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,220
It won't affect my singing.

914
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,190
Miss Soko Kabe has perfect pitch too, doesn't she?

915
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,980
Yes, I figured that out when we first met.

916
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,940
We got along pretty well.

917
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,440
Does that mean something?

918
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,610
Nothing.

919
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,160
Is that so? Well, I'll go now.

920
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,700
I hope the concert goes well.

921
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,960
Miss Reiko and Miss Kabe both have perfect pitch.

922
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,300
If so...

923
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,340
I'll get angry again if I talk to him on the phone, so I emailed him.

924
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,340
Oh, I hope Shinichi could come.

925
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,470
Whatever.

926
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,430
I just don't want the ticket to be wasted.

927
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,810
That's what I said before.

928
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,060
Really?

929
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,230
It can't be helped, let's begin without him.

930
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,860
What happened?

931
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,030
Mr. Mouri, Mr. Muller hasn't shown up yet.

932
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,910
The organ tuner?

933
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,540
He said he would come to the dress rehearsal to do the fine tuning.

934
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,330
This is really troublesome.

935
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,130
He didn't answer his calls either.

936
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,420
The people from the hotel said that
he didn't come back since last night.

937
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,210
Since last night?

938
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:38,510
Anyway, we only need him to do the fine tuning.
It won't be a big problem if he can't come.

939
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,100
But doesn't it mean that he went missing?

940
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,180
Did you tell the police?

941
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,150
Not yet. The questioning will take too much time.

942
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,030
We have to focus on the concert now.

943
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,670
Miss Shion looks like a different person.

944
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:13,310
♪ Ave maria ♪

945
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:23,030
♪ Gratia plena ♪

946
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:28,870
♪ Dominus tecum ♪

947
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,910
The sound...

948
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:49,730
♪ Benedicta tu in mulieribus ♪

949
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,520
Miss Shion played the violin so well!

950
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,820
That's right! It was completely different from the last rehearsal!

951
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,990
It's like the Stradivari actually belongs to her.

952
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:03,700
What do you know?

953
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,830
Miss Reiko's singing was wonderful as well.

954
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,040
Conan!

955
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,170
You guys are too early.

956
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,130
That's because you aren't allowed in
even if you're only one minute late.

957
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,970
So we asked the professor to bring us here early.

958
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,350
What's in your hand?

959
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,890
Isn't that a recorder?

960
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:34,350
You idiot, no one would bring that to a classical music concert.

961
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,480
Don't tell at him. He can't speak now,

962
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,780
so he wants to make sound with that.

963
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,360
Even so.

964
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,570
Of course, he won't make a sound during the concert.

965
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,320
Right,  Genta?

966
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,370
It means, yes.

967
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,540
Remember to hide it when you get into the hall.

968
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,920
You can't use your cellphones either.

969
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:00,920
They know. They didn't even bring their detective boys badge.

970
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,720
I'm hungry.

971
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,260
Then let's go get something to eat.

972
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,850
That's right. The concert will be at 5 o'clock.

973
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,980
We can't let our stomach grumble in the middle of the concert.

974
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,730
He's saying grilled eel over rice.

975
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,400
If only we could all communicate with recorders.

976
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:24,070
Well, that's not impossible.

977
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,700
We just need to turn the notes into letters.

978
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,160
The notes?

979
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,910
To letters?

980
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,040
However, using English letters might still be difficult for Kojima.

981
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,170
There really is something wrong with that sound.

982
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,710
Miss Ran, I just remembered something I have to do.

983
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,420
I'll go to my seat before the performance.

984
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,380
Wait, Conan!

985
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
What a selfish brat.

986
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,910
That note! Isn't that note a little weird?

987
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,870
I think so too.

988
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,330
I noticed that when I was singing.

989
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,130
However, though I know which key it is,

990
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,050
I don't know which stop it was.

991
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,590
That's because there are several of them making sound.

992
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,430
It does sound slightly flat.

993
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,520
I'm sure of it.

994
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,770
The sound came from there.

995
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,980
I think it should be one of the short pipes on the inside.

996
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,270
One of them definitely needs tuning.

997
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,740
We have to fix it before the performance.

998
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:49,700
But we still don't know where Mr. Muller is.

999
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:50,870
Indeed.

1000
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,370
Anyway, let's inform Mr. Domoto first.

1001
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,210
It seems that he's not here.

1002
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:03,500
Yes.

1003
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,920
Maybe he went to have some tea.

1004
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,300
Or maybe he's there...

1005
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,970
By the way, I'm surprised that you noticed.

1006
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,470
My ears are sharp.

1007
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,480
This is great.

1008
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,730
Maybe you have perfect pitch too.

1009
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,020
That'll be the best.

1010
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,910
Mr. Domoto is not here.

1011
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,740
Could he be somewhere else?

1012
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,040
Well.

1013
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,420
Maybe it's like what you said, he went to have tea.

1014
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,110
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

1015
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,400
smoking is permitted only in the designated areas.

1016
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,150
Akiba is still not here?

1017
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,320
Yes, she didn't answer the phone either.

1018
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,240
The staffs are also looking for her now.

1019
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,950
Did she go missing too?

1020
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,200
I don't know.

1021
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:21,870
First it was Mr. Muller, now even she is...

1022
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,040
What is happening here?

1023
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,420
The concert will start in 15 minutes.

1024
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,460
If she still hasn't shown up...

1025
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,920
Please give me the chance.

1026
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,760
After what happened to Miss Kabe,

1027
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,560
I thought that this might happen.

1028
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,390
So I have been practicing.

1029
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:43,690
But...

1030
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,940
Please, sir!

1031
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,860
I'll do a better job than Akiba.

1032
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,570
You don't need to be better.

1033
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,160
Music is the plea from humans to God.

1034
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:59,950
You have to sing as if you are praying.

1035
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,960
Shinichi didn't turn up after all...

1036
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,380
Speaking of, what happened to Conan?

1037
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,930
The concert is about to start.

1038
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,470
Really, where did Conan go?

1039
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,930
But if it's Conan, I'm sure he'll be fine.

1040
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,850
I trust him.

1041
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,310
Me too.

1042
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,360
Just like Conan trusts us,

1043
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:30,690
we should trust him too.

1044
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,450
Conan is going to be all right.

1045
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,950
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

1046
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,960
Miss Akiba won't be performing today

1047
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,290
due to some unforeseen reasons.

1048
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,590
Taking her place for this performance is

1049
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,800
Rara Chigusa, the student from the class of 9 of Domoto Music Academy.

1050
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:00,430
We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

1051
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,220
What's happened?

1052
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,230
She did a wonderful job during the dress rehearsal.

1053
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,190
Could it be that she and Shinichi are in trouble?

1054
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,780
Plastic sheet?

1055
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:20,740
What has happened?

1056
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,300
Miss Reiko, Miss Reiko!

1057
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:40,800
What?

1058
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,720
Where is this place?

1059
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,390
Probably the downstream of the canal.

1060
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,310
The guy who attacked us

1061
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,860
must have set us adrift from the lake behind
Domoto Hall and let the canal carry us here.

1062
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,980
But, who would...

1063
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,280
I have no idea.

1064
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:59,410
Also, why did that person put us on a boat

1065
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:00,530
after knocking us out.

1066
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,830
Anyway, if we can't get back in time,

1067
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:03,870
the concert will be...

1068
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,370
But, even if we can swim that distance,

1069
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,790
the wall is still too high for us to climb.

1070
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,470
There doesn't seem to be anyone around.

1071
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,600
But, look,

1072
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,730
there's a phone on the wall.

1073
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,230
If we can't reach it, we can call for help.

1074
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,450
Wait, even if we can't reach it,

1075
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,950
we can still phone for help if we take down the receiver

1076
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,950
But how could we do it?

1077
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,830
When we dial the numbers to make a call,

1078
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,870
there'll be "pi, po, pa" sounds, right?

1079
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,170
That's DTMF signal.

1080
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,170
Through a combination of low and high signals

1081
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,420
to transmit the telephone number.

1082
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,840
So, if we can successfully produce those sounds...

1083
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,930
We'll be able to dial the number, right?

1084
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,350
The number 1 should be 697Hz and 1209Hz,

1085
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:15,520
the number 0 should be the combination of 941Hz and 1336Hz.

1086
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:16,770
No problem.

1087
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,690
I can remember the dial sounds.

1088
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,740
But we have to take the receiver down first.

1089
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,200
I've got that covered.

1090
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,740
The problem is that, after we take it down,

1091
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,120
we won't be able to make a call again.

1092
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,080
Which means, we only have one chance.

1093
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:38,630
If we fail, we could only wait for someone to find us.

1094
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,800
We don't have any time to waste.

1095
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,380
Let's do it.

1096
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,430
Since we've decided to do it,

1097
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,180
let's do the rehearsal now.

1098
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,930
What was that?

1099
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,730
The sound of an explosion. Something exploded!

1100
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,730
It was in the direction of the Domoto Concert Hall.

1101
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,530
Could it be...

1102
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,910
We are at the music forest in Nishitamashi.

1103
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,630
Just moments ago, two explosions occurred here
at the Domoto Concert Hall.

1104
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,340
The blast took place in the innermost left of the concert hall

1105
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:21,840
and the entrance of the greenroom which is on the middle right.

1106
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,880
The concert started five minutes ago.

1107
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,050
We still don't know the situation inside...

1108
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,470
Another explosion.

1109
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,310
Hurry! The sound of the number "0".

1110
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,780
It should work.

1111
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,070
Let's row the boat over.

1112
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,330
We can do it here. Stop.

1113
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,710
Now what? How are you going to take the receiver down?

1114
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:01,000
Just wait and see.

1115
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,940
Amazing.

1116
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,140
Now, let's start!

1117
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,610
Hello, this is 110 communication room.

1118
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,000
Miss Akiba and Conan?

1119
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,710
They seemed to have been washed downstream on a boat

1120
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:40,960
after they were knocked out.

1121
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,090
The location is Nishitama Reservoir Water Temperature Management Office.

1122
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:51,100
They are here!

1123
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,180
I see them! Over there!

1124
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,400
So it was from Domoto Concert Hall.

1125
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,450
There have been more than 10 explosions

1126
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:12,030
which took place at the pillars outside the building.

1127
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,410
We haven't found the cause of the explosion.

1128
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,790
Someone planted the bombs there.

1129
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,910
Though we still don't know if the bombs
were set off by a timer or a remote control,

1130
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,500
I think the culprit might be the same person who killed the four men.

1131
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,130
That's right. The first incident was also an explosion.

1132
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:32,680
But, why did that person leave us in a place
far away from the concert hall instead of killing us?

1133
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:36,890
Could it be that she's...

1134
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:43,610
Another one.

1135
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:46,900
Hey, can we get in touch with the people in there?

1136
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,070
Miss Ran and Mr. Mouri are still inside the building.

1137
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,410
We can't get through.

1138
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,740
The culprit may have cut the telephone lines.

1139
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,240
What about their cellphones?

1140
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:55,950
It's pointless.

1141
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,830
It's a basic etiquette to turn off cellphones during a performance.

1142
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,630
Except for certain areas, there's no cell service in the concert hall.

1143
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,300
Besides, people inside the hall should be safe.

1144
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:11,550
That's because the hall is completely soundproof and fireproof.

1145
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,300
Maybe the people there didn't even notice the explosion.

1146
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,140
Which means the concert might still be going on now.

1147
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,140
I think so.

1148
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:24,730
But, maybe the explosion will not
only happen at the places outside the hall.

1149
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,770
It will extend to the inside.

1150
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:30,320
No, maybe it already did.

1151
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:33,070
Ran.

1152
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:45,420
♪ Und sich mir zu eigen gibet ♪

1153
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:59,810
♪ Ach drum laß ich Jesum nicht ♪

1154
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:12,400
♪ Wenn mir gleich mein Herze bricht ♪

1155
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,000
Good evening, everyone.

1156
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,540
Welcome to the concert.

1157
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,880
I am Genya Domoto.

1158
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:14,880
As you know, tonight, we finally...

1159
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,090
Come over here! This way!

1160
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,220
What are you doing? Hurry and get that hose over here!

1161
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:32,610
This is serious.

1162
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:35,610
But the hall in the middle seems fine.

1163
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,200
The people inside should be fine.

1164
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,030
It's too soon to be relieved.

1165
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,990
The entrance to the hall have been all blocked.

1166
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,750
A rescue operation would be impossible!

1167
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:46,710
How could it be like this?

1168
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,380
What's more, we don't know which pillar will explode next.

1169
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,550
There are 23 pillars surrounding the building.

1170
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,260
Does the bomber want to blow all the pillars off?

1171
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,380
Damn it, what should we do?

1172
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,100
We can only get in from the roof.

1173
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:02,970
Is it possible?

1174
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,720
We can manage to do that now.

1175
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,190
But, there isn't a proper parking apron.

1176
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,060
I don't know if the roof can bear the weight of the helicopter.

1177
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,270
I see.

1178
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,940
Please get as low as you could.

1179
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,570
Then we'll jump out.

1180
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,240
I'll lead the way.

1181
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,120
The access from the roof to the fourth floor is very complicated.

1182
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,450
Therefore...

1183
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,200
But...

1184
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,750
We don't have time to think, do we?

1185
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:30,710
Now that the explosions have stopped, we should hurry!

1186
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,630
Lower,

1187
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:39,840
lower,

1188
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:41,800
lower,

1189
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,140
a bit lower.

1190
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,810
I can't go any lower.

1191
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,770
The air flow is less steady than I thought.

1192
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,150
I can't keep the helicopter balanced.

1193
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,270
You need to get off now.

1194
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,280
Come on, Miss Akiba.

1195
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,870
Conan, you should stay in the helicopter.

1196
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:10,830
Conan.

1197
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,710
I'll stay here

1198
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,540
until Miss Ran and everybody else are saved.

1199
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,550
Conan.

1200
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,090
Also, I've seen the culprit's face.

1201
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,590
Though I don't know who the bomber is,

1202
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,890
I've seen the person who attacked us.

1203
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,970
Maybe he's somewhere in the concert hall, so...

1204
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,230
Hurry up, I can't hold it anymore.

1205
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:35,770
Fine, we have to take him.

1206
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,650
Takagi, hurry!

1207
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,480
Yes!

1208
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,670
This is the interior corridor on the fourth floor.

1209
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,420
Didn't we simple descend directly from the top?

1210
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,300
If I didn't say that, you wouldn't have let me come, would you?

1211
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,760
I did the same thing as this boy.

1212
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,970
Did you really see the face of the culprit?

1213
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,160
What a surprise.

1214
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:35,420
Though we expected that, I'm still shocked
that the people here really haven't noticed the explosions.

1215
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,170
Anyway, let's find the bombs first.

1216
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,710
It's impossible to evacuate so many people at once.

1217
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,180
Besides, if the target is the concert hall,

1218
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,510
there have to be bombs set up inside the hall.

1219
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:50,810
I understand.

1220
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:54,850
Conan, you should stay here with Miss Akiba.

1221
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:55,730
I know.

1222
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:56,730
Let's go.

1223
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,350
Yes.

1224
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,280
Ran,

1225
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,620
wait for me.

1226
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,960
The inside, what's the situation inside?

1227
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:43,280
♪ Come unto Him all ye that labour ♪

1228
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:54,330
♪ Come unto Him that are heavy laden ♪

1229
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:01,540
♪ And He will give you rest ♪

1230
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,130
The culprit knows the structure of the hall very well

1231
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,380
and planted bombs here.

1232
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:11,930
It has to be one of the staff members.

1233
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,270
The sound is very weird.

1234
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,900
Even Mr. Domoto didn't notice.

1235
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:22,060
If it's a piano, he would have noticed it.

1236
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:26,190
He's only been playing the organ for two years,
so he probably couldn't tell the difference between the sound.

1237
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,990
The difference between the sound?

1238
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,530
With a bunch of amateurs who can't tell the difference in sound...

1239
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,700
So that's what it was about...

1240
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,080
Miss Kabe noticed the difference,

1241
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,080
because she has perfect pitch.

1242
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:42,170
Wait, if that's the case, then why did that person...

1243
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,960
Could it be, that person...

1244
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,260
If so,

1245
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,380
why did he attack her...

1246
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:57,600
His mother is a single mom.

1247
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,020
I see. I know everything.

1248
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,980
But what does the difference in sounds have to do with the explosion?

1249
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,400
By the way, I just noticed this.

1250
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,910
But the explosions stopped during

1251
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,330
Mr. Domoto's speech, right?

1252
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:20,330
Is it really because the culprit didn't want
others to hear the sound of the explosion?

1253
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,670
No, it can't be.

1254
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,420
The bomb will only be set off when the performance starts.

1255
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,960
I get it. That why the sound is different.

1256
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,630
It's that sound again.

1257
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,680
How many times did you hear that sound?

1258
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:37,180
From the beginning of the concert,

1259
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,520
do you remember how many times that key appears?

1260
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,230
It should be

1261
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:43,560
twice in Ave Maria.

1262
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:51,820
Ten times in the chorus,

1263
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,040
eight times in the piece which is being performed now.

1264
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,840
So it's 20 times in total.

1265
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,380
So, there are still four times left.

1266
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,550
That sound is linked to the explosion.

1267
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:19,850
That's why there was no explosion when Mr. Domoto gave the speech.

1268
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,900
There are 23 pillars surrounding the hall,

1269
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:35,160
which means

1270
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,950
the bomber needs to create 24 explosions

1271
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,830
in order to destroy all the pillars

1272
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,370
and the concert hall.

1273
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,790
You mean...

1274
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,590
Yes.

1275
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,420
If we can't stop the performance

1276
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,590
before that sound shows up for 4 times,

1277
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,680
this concert hall will be blown up.

1278
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:07,900
It's that sound again.

1279
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:11,230
Shoot, I was right about it.

1280
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,570
The culprit should be watching somewhere.

1281
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:24,790
There it is again.

1282
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:26,410
I found him.

1283
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,500
So it was that person after all.

1284
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,510
I have an idea. I'll stop the performance on the stage.

1285
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,220
Wait.

1286
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:36,800
If we stop it abruptly,

1287
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:38,680
the culprit will use a remote to set off the bomb.

1288
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:41,720
I saw the criminal holding a remote.

1289
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,220
But...

1290
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:44,930
Damn it, what should I do?

1291
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,600
Isn't there a clever way to stop the performance?

1292
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,900
Or a way to change the culprit's mind?

1293
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,150
Three minutes.

1294
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,360
Will three minutes be enough?

1295
01:25:59,160 --> 01:25:59,780
But...

1296
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,250

The song

1304
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,430
is "Amazing Grace".

was Miss Reiko.

1319
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:03,530
I won't let you do that.

1320
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:08,530
It's this singing which could warm our hearts

1321
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:12,030
that made you hesitant, right?

1322
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,910
Moreover, this song was

1323
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:19,670
your son, Mr. Soma's favorite song before he died.

1324
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:24,960
And the one who's giving the performance was the person he loved.

1325
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,260
The difference in sounds

1326
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,630
is the key of my deduction.

1327
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:34,180
At first, we thought there was something wrong with the tuning.

1328
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,270
But that wasn't the case.

1329
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:39,600
Hidden in one of the pipes,

1330
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:43,860
must be a micro-sensor which could sense minute changes in air flow.

1331
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,280
Because of that,

1332
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,990
the sound made by that pipe is slightly off.

1333
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:52,700
Once the sensor in the pipe senses the air flow,

1334
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:59,080
the bombs which you have set up will be set off one after another.

1335
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:06,590
When the last bomb explodes,

1336
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,300
this concert hall will be destroyed.

1337
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,720
The bombs did not explode during the dress rehearsal

1338
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,810
because the sensor wasn't activated.

1339
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:17,310
Am I right?

1340
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,190
Director of Domoto Hall,

1341
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,730
the former piano tuner, Mr. Takumi Fuwa.

1342
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:31,820
Not here.

1343
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,570
This is bad.

1344
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,870
If this continues,

1345
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,950
the bomb will explode before we find it.

1346
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,330
Quiet.

1347
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:43,120
What is that sound?

1348
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,610
Don't move!

1349
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,690
Police!

1350
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:11,990
Mr. Muller.

1351
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:20,540
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

1352
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,580
How did you know it was me?

1353
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,750
Perfect pitch.

1354
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,210
Mr. Fuwa, you have perfect pitch,

1355
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,800
but you didn't point out the irregular sound
during the dress rehearsal.

1356
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:36,260
That made me suspicious.

1357
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,810
I see.

1358
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:44,520
Then, how did you find out that I was Hikaru's father?

1359
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,610
The plate number of your car is 52-83.

1360
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,940
You got that from your son's birthday, right?

1361
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:56,860
You could not proclaim your love for your son to the world,

1362
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,370
so you used the number plate
as a testimony of your connection to your son.

1363
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,790
Also, I saw a photo of you when you were young

1364
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:04,660
in Mr. Domoto's house.

1365
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,790
You look exactly the same as your son.

1366
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,090
You killed the four musicians

1367
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:16,930
to avenge for your son who died in the accident.

1368
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:19,930
You left the flute parts at the crime scene

1369
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,270
to make the police think that there would only be three murders.

1370
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:29,560
You got Miss Kabe involved and injured her,

1371
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,610
because she has perfect pitch and could tell the differences in sound.

1372
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:38,030
Only someone who has perfect pitch

1373
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,280
will be afraid of another who also has that ability.

1374
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:44,250
Judging from that, I think the culprit can only be you, Mr. Fuwa.

1375
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:48,170
There's another person

1376
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,710
who has perfect pitch. That's Reiko Akiba.

1377
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:03,970
However, she's the fiancee of your deceased son,

1378
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,430
so you can't hurt her with a bomb

1379
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:10,020
like you did to Miss Kabe.

1380
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:16,150
Therefore, you put an irritant drug in her drink

1381
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,780
and attacked her with a truck and an air gun.

1382
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,030
To make her unable to perform on the stage,

1383
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,080
you only need to hurt her throat

1384
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,000
or break her ankle.

1385
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:44,180

He improvised.

1387
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,210
He pressed on the key.

1388
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,850
How? Why didn't...

1389
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,640
There won't be any more explosions.

1390
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,440
Before I got here,

1391
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,030
I already removed the sensor in the pipe.

1392
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,190
In three,

1393
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,400
no, two minutes.

1394
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:47,290
Well done, kid.

1395
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,330
What's your name?

1396
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,410
Conan Edogawa.

1397
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,790
I'm a detective.

1398
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,130
Bravo, bravo.

1399
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,760
Bravo, bravo.

1400
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,470
Found him.

1401
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,760
He has a remote in his hand.

1402
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,970
It's him after all.

1403
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:10,640
What do we do?

1404
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:13,230
Should we rush in before he sets off the bombs?

1405
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:13,900
No.

1406
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,230
The moment we get in, he'll press on the button.

1407
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:19,440
So what should we do?

1408
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:22,610
Let's go to that room.

1409
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,570
Maybe we can figure out something in that room.

1410
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,950
What will you do?

1411
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,910
We'll shoot him

1412
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:31,250
before he presses on the button.

1413
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:38,880
Unfortunately, young detective,

1414
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,260
I can set off the bombs with this remote too.

1415
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,090
You lost.

1416
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:45,220
Really?

1417
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,010
It's hard to say.

1418
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:50,850
Why is it hard to say?

1419
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:54,850
Though I don't know how you got into the concert hall,

1420
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:58,310
seeing as how the police haven't raided the place yet,

1421
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:01,780
the hall is probably engulfed in flame

1422
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,320
so they are not able to come in, right?

1423
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,700
Though I didn't expect that the sensor would be removed.

1424
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:10,160
Anyway,

1425
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:14,160
now I can set off the bomb at any time I want.

1426
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:17,880
As a farewell gift,

1427
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,920
I'll send you to heaven when you are performing.

1428
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,010
Shoot, at that time...

1429
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:34,270
Right at the moment when you play your favorite organ,

1430
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:36,730
Kazuki Domoto.

1431
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:47,320
Conan!

1432
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,990
No, I can't shoot him right now.

1433
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,300
Great, now please start playing,

1434
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:04,380
Domoto.

1435
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,260
What can I do?

1436
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,680
I can't use my stun-gun wrist-watch.

1437
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:09,550
What else can I do?

1438
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:13,680
Move aside, Conan.

1439
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,430
Please.

1440
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:24,650
Give it to me.

1441
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,110
My recorder.

1442
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:27,700
My voice is back.

1443
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,870
Yes, that's it.

1444
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:33,700
Damn it.

1445
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,420
Farewell, young detective.

1446
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:45,460
Like I'd let you!

1447
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:55,140
mi la la la fa

1448
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:57,770
Shoot

1449
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,640
Someone's going to shoot!

1450
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:00,480
What is that sound?

1451
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,860
It's the sound that signals the end of the game.

1452
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,190
What?

1453
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:18,330
Freeze, police!

1454
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:21,790
I lost.

1455
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:15,260
Mr. Fuwa,

1456
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,760
where are the rest of the bombs?

1457
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,600
Inside the ceiling above the stage.

1458
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,560
Takagi, contact Inspector Megure.

1459
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:23,310
Yes.

1460
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,730
Excuse me,

1461
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,940
can I listen to the rest of the performance?

1462
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:33,240
I'll confess everything after that.

1463
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,460
I see.

1464
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,290
They finally had the fire contained.

1465
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:50,350
- We'll go over there...
- Inspector!

1466
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,510
There's an opening on the east side.

1467
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,800
Okay, let's go.

1468
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,470
I'll talk to you later.

1469
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:06,100
Why did you set up the bombs in the concert hall.

1470
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:14,280
I have worked as Kazuki Domoto's piano tuner for 35 years.

1471
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,530
I have spent half of my life with him.

1472
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:21,120
But two years ago,

1473
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,410
he suddenly retired from playing the piano

1474
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,590
and told me that

1475
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:34,630
he wanted me to be the director of Domoto Concert Hall
which would be fully constructed in 2 years.

1476
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,720
Of course, I could turn him down

1477
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:41,850
and become a freelance tuner.

1478
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,930
But,

1479
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:50,270
I have been the sole tuner of Kazuki Domoto,
the international pianist, for 35 years.

1480
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:54,400
I can't accept tuning for another pianist.

1481
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,240
My pride wouldn't allow me to.

1482
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:01,030
Nevertheless, I am just a craftsman

1483
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:03,950
who can't fulfill the job as a director.

1484
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,370
I was devastated by despair.

1485
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:48,330
Two years ago, my wife died of illness.

1486
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,630
One year after that, my son died from an accident.

1487
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:58,260
Then I lost my job as a tuner,
which I considered the only thing which gives my life a meaning.

1488
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:01,680
I had nothing to lose.

1489
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,140
The music I love the most

1490
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:09,640
now sounds like noise to me.

1491
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:16,650
Yes, finally, at the night when I was woken up by

1492
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,240
that sound which appears in my dream repeatedly,

1493
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:24,700
I decided to wipe out everything

1494
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:28,540
in exchange for the quiet night which I used to have.

1495
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,790
I'll wipe out the four men who took away the life of my son,

1496
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,380
the selfish Domoto,

1497
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:37,800
the organ and Domoto concert hall
which took away his interests in piano,

1498
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:41,720
and even the musicians all over the world and the audience

1499
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:45,550
who came to hear the organ performance.

1500
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:51,640
I agreed to be the director of Domoto concert hall

1501
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:53,520
to gain access to the organ

1502
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:56,230
to place the bombs in the concert hall,

1503
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:59,530
I needed to become the director of the hall first.

1504
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:04,570
On the other hand, the piano which was abandoned by Domoto like I was

1505
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,410
was also very pitiful.

1506
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:07,910
That means...

1507
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:11,210
Blowing off the piano with the practice room

1508
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,830
was your way of showing your love for the piano, huh?

1509
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:17,590
That's all I have to say.

1510
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,050
Next,

1511
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,640
please call Domoto over.

1512
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,850
Mr. Fuwa, calm down!

1513
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,220
Don't worry,

1514
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,060
I'll only use this to kill myself.

1515
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,560
I have no intention of hurting anyone else.

1516
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,730
Conan, leave this room.

1517
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:38,230
No, you committed a serious crime

1518
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:40,480
and now you want to end your life without atoning for your sin.

1519
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,280
I won't allow such cunning action.

1520
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,400
Conan!

1521
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,780
Mr. Fuwa, please don't do anything stupid.

1522
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:48,240
Shut up, I want Domoto here!

1523
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:49,370
Fuwa,

1524
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,120
I am right here.

1525
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,960
Mr. Domoto!

1526
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:02,970
Fuwa, I'm sorry.

1527
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:06,430
I never thought that you would brood over it.

1528
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:08,100
You've finally realized?

1529
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:10,720
Because of your selfishness, I was so...

1530
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,310
It's not like what you think, Fuwa.

1531
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,440
I retired from playing the piano

1532
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:20,270
because I noticed that there was something wrong with your tuning.

1533
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,650
I knew about your pride,

1534
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,610
so I didn't point it out in front of you.

1535
01:45:26,410 --> 01:45:30,700
Even so, to this day,
I still have no intention to work with other tuner.

1536
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:34,250
That's why I stopped playing the piano.

1537
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:37,040
No way, I have perfect pitch!

1538
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:40,380
Yes, you do.

1539
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:44,470
But your hearing has declined with age.

1540
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:49,800
There were times when you mistuned the piano without noticing it.

1541
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:55,730
Liar, you lie. A lie, a lie.

1542
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:01,400
If I know things would become like this,
I should have told you the truth.

1543
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,650
I am so sorry.

1544
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,280
It's already late to apologize.

1545
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,900
It's all your fault.

1546
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:07,780
No,

1547
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:12,990
if my best friend does the same thing to me,

1548
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:17,040
I would think that maybe she does have a reason

1549
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:24,960
or she cares more about me than herself.

1550
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,170
Why?

1551
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:32,470
Because I trust my friend.

1552
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,430
Me too.

1553
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:07,130
I can't believe the explosion outside was so serious.

1554
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:09,380
I really had no idea.

1555
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,970
Conan made a great contribution in this case.

1556
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:16,680
I knew it! It's just like what I said.

1557
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:22,060
By the way, I'm surprised Shinichi
could understand the code from the recorder sound.

1558
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:24,820
After all, the trick of turning notes into English letter

1559
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,360
is always seen in detective fictions.

1560
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:30,700
Si refers to H in Germany note names.

1561
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:35,410
Since he knew that my mom was British.

1562
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,830
So si refers to B.

1563
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,790
Then he knew that I used English note names.

1564
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,920
I figured he would deduce that instantly.

1565
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,340
After that, I was counting on his absolute pitch.

1566
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:47,920
I see.

1567
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,430
Plus, I trust him,

1568
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:53,590
as a partner.

1569
01:47:56,390 --> 01:48:00,310
I thought that Beethoven's fan was the killer.

1570
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,390
Dad is still babbling.

1571
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:05,730
However, he still didn't show up.

1572
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:07,320
That deduction geek.

1573
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:08,900
Shinichi?

1574
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,900
Whatever, I don't care about him.

1575
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:12,740
Let's go, Conan.

1576
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:15,950
He was here the whole time.

1577
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,840
Listen, the sound.

1578
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,090
It's a violin.

1579
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,220
It's "Amazing Grace".

1580
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:35,760
No, I mean the way it's performed.

1581
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:36,760
The way it was performed?

1582
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,140
Shinichi?

1583
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:42,480
Wait, Ran!

1584
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:02,540
Shinichi, Shinichi!

1585
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:06,250
Brother Shinichi already left.

1586
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:08,540
Conan.

1587
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,920
He said he had another case.

1588
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,420
Shinichi really came here?

1589
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,050
After hearing Miss Reiko singing,

1590
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,180
he said he remembered the thing which happened three years ago.

1591
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:23,480
Then he played that song with this violin in the academy.

1592
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:28,230
He said it was for Sister Ran and himself.

1593
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:34,190
Brother Shinichi said that "I have upset Ran".

1594
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,570
Did you two have a fight?

1595
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,490
It's nothing.

1596
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:43,830
Even if you have come, I still won't forgive you.

1597
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:49,630
You idiot.

1598
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,850
He and I always came here in the past.

1599
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:21,650
This is where we walked on our dates.

1600
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,030
Really?

1601
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,400
On that spring after his accident,

1602
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,950
I sang his favorite song

1603
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,320
at the place full of our memories.

1604
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:34,200
It's "Amazing Grace", right?

1605
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:35,700
Yes.

1606
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:41,250
I hate the four men so much at the beginning

1607
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:44,750
and even wanted to kill them.

1608
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:47,590
But I forgave them at last.

1609
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:52,470
Because "Amazing Grace" is a song about forgiveness.

1610
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:56,890
Well, it's time for me to go.

1611
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,640
Conan, let's sing together next time.

1612
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:03,770
Bye.

1613
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:05,530
See you.

1614
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:07,360
See you.

1615
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:12,370
By the way, Miss Ran,

1616
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:16,330
how did you know that it was Mr. Shinichi who played the violin?

1617
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,870
Because he has a weird habit when he plays the violin.

1618
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:22,210
It's easy to tell.

1619
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:24,880
Is that so?

1620
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:34,470
What's this weird habit?
