1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,340
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,740
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,740
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,240
High school girl Sonoko's deduction puts Kogoro to shame!

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
Solve the mystery of the missing weapon!

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,840
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:01,009
Eisuke Hondo who had been in the custody of the FBI

10
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,109
involving the case of Rena Mizunashi returns.

11
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,409
A suspicious man tails all of us who go to a karaoke shop

12
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,309
to celebrate Eisuke coming back to school.

13
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:16,409
Could he be a FBI agent who is watching and protecting Eisuke?

14
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,009
But that man is killed in a room of the karaoke shop.

15
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,709
The killer is among the customers who have come to the karaoke shop.

16
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,609
Don't tell me that Eisuke...

17
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,609
"Blind Spot of the Karaoke Shop ( Part 2 )"

18
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,509
Then, let's start

19
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,409
-with Mr. Kunio Tamai who was in room number 1. -Yes.

20
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,409
"Kunio Tamai (63)" -I came here today

21
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,409
on my way home from fishing.

22
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,309
Oh, you came to this karaoke shop alone after fishing?

23
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,209
Is anything wrong with that?

24
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,709
You've fished quite a lot of fish.

25
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,409
To be honest, I bought most of the fish at the supermarket.

26
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:18,209
I was careless and my fishing rod drifted away.

27
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,409
But I promised my family that I would fish a lot of fish.

28
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,709
So having no other choice I went to buy the fish.

29
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:32,709
It's true there's no fishing rod in the case.

30
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,709
If I get home too early, my family would get suspicious,

31
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,509
so I decided to kill some time here.

32
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,409
Next, Mr. Kyota Honma who was using room number 2.

33
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,609
Yes.

34
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:48,209
"Kyoto Honma (32)" -I have a company karaoke contest

35
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,309
coming up soon, so I was practicing here.

36
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,509
Is your company near here?

37
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,609
No,

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,409
I'd be embarrassed if any of my colleagues found out.

39
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,409
So, I came all this way to a shop that's some distance away.

40
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,709
Do you buy cigarettes by the carton?

41
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,509
Yes, because I'm a heavy smoker.

42
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,609
Excuse me, I will need to check it.

43
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,309
Well, cigarettes cannot be used as a blunt weapon.

44
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:27,409
Oh, stopping by at a karaoke shop after school.

45
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,409
"Eisuke Hondo (17)" -Yes.

46
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,209
I tell you, young people nowadays.

47
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,609
Oh, a maracas!

48
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,509
I like this instrument!

49
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,109
The maracas can't be used either.

50
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:50,809
"Konji Arimoto (34)" -Next, Mr. Konji Arimoto of room 4.

51
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:54,509
I came here to sing karaoke with her after going to the gym.

52
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,309
No problem, is there?

53
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,609
Huh?

54
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:00,809
This is the new sparkling drink

55
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:02,709
that was introduced the other day, isn't it?

56
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,909
Yeah, I bought it because she wanted to try.

57
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:10,209
It was so junk that she only took a sip though.

58
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,309
A PET bottle can't kill either.

59
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,509
"Keep Out, Police Line"

60
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,809
We tried going around everyone's room

61
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:25,009
but there's no sign of the murder weapon.

62
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:29,009
True, I also checked the restrooms.

63
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,109
That's impossible.

64
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:34,809
I'm sure it's somewhere in this karaoke shop,

65
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,909
the blunt object that was used as the murder weapon.

66
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,009
Besides, I also want to confirm

67
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,709
if that man who was killed is a FBI agent.

68
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,309
The number you have called

69
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,009
cannot be reached because it is outside the service area

70
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,209
or switched off...

71
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,409
Why can't I get through to Ms. Jody?

72
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,909
Inspector!

73
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,309
The film that the victim had on him has been developed just now,

74
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,409
and we found out something unexpected.

75
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,409
Something unexpected?

76
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:06,809
Hey, what's this?

77
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,409
It's the picture of us! Gross.

78
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,209
Don't tell me he was a stalker?

79
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,809
I'm sure that's what he was. Yuck!

80
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:17,309
I guess this incident has nothing to do with us, then.

81
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,509
I guess not.

82
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:21,809
I've never seen the face of the victim either.

83
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:26,009
Are you saying that you all never even passed by him in the corridor?

84
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,509
No, we don't.

85
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:28,509
If we were to see the victim,

86
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,509
it would either be in the corridor or the men's room.

87
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,009
But I didn't see the face of anybody besides all those here.

88
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,309
As for me, I haven't seen any other customers

89
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:39,909
until this incident occurred.

90
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,609
Well, normal thinking would lead us to think

91
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:46,209
that the boy with the round glasses is the killer, no?

92
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,509
Right.

93
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:51,409
He probably killed the man because he was being stalked everywhere.

94
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,009
No.

95
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,809
Hey, take a good look.

96
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,709
I'm in the center of all of them.

97
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,309
I'm the one he was after.

98
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,209
It's not this glasses boy klutz he was after!

99
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,709
Oh, boy.

100
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,309
Officer, I think it's about time you let us go!

101
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,909
Right, officer!

102
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,909
It's true that Sonoko's in the middle of this picture too.

103
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,209
Then maybe the man who was killed wasn't a FBI agent, but...

104
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,109
Oh, wait a sec.

105
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,009
If I remember correctly...

106
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,709
It's already 7:30p.m.!

107
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,109
No, I can't let you go yet.

108
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:42,009
I don't mind staying here until all your doubts about me are cleared.

109
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,809
Please do so.

110
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,309
I just happen to have playing cards on me,

111
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:50,809
I'll be playing Poker or Black Jack with her and kill time.

112
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,009
Black Jack!

113
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,309
So, that trick could be used.

114
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,109
At any rate,

115
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:05,009
taking into consideration Mr. Moniwa's estimated time of death

116
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,009
who was killed in room number 5 of this karaoke shop,

117
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,409
the murder was committed between 18:00 to 18:20,

118
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,809
during a span of 30 minutes.

119
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:18,809
According to the surveillance camera,

120
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:23,609
the people who went in the direction of the victim's room are...

121
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:30,309
Mr. Kyota Honma, who left room number 2 at 17:50.

122
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,409
Mr. Eisuke Hondo, who left room number 3 at 18:03.

123
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,509
Mr. Konji Arimoto, who left room number 4 at 18:05.

124
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,809
And, Mr. Kunio Tamai, who left room number 1 at 18:07.

125
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,209
I'm certain that the killer is among you four.

126
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,709
I can't let you go yet.

127
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,509
But, the murder weapon is nowhere, right?

128
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,709
If I remember correctly, you mentioned it was some blunt object, right?

129
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,609
He did, I don't think he has the right to keep us here

130
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,609
because the murder weapon isn't found.

131
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:12,309
The murder weapon is here.

132
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:15,609
It's something that's unthinkable of being a murder weapon, though.

133
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,709
Sonoko! Your usual "thing" has come!

134
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,109
Oh, no. That wasn't me just now...

135
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,109
Just now?

136
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,609
Yes, I thought that

137
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:41,009
it doesn't have to be me to solve this simple case,

138
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,709
but I'll tell you why it's hard to find the murder weapon.

139
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,409
The trick involves the murder weapon changing shape

140
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,009
after the murder was committed

141
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,509
and disappearing, together with the killer who used it.

142
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:11,661
Yeah, if it's okay with you, please tell us how it was done, miss.

143
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,061
Hold it!

144
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:15,961
You're saying that it was a blunt object when the murder was committed,

145
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,461
but is gone now, right?

146
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:19,561
Yes.

147
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,061
I got it, then.

148
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:26,061
The murder weapon was probably a huge clump of ice!

149
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:28,161
And the murder had a cooler box

150
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,761
that he could keep the ice in for a long period of time.

151
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:34,061
Mr. Kunio Tamai. It's you!

152
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,661
What?

153
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,761
Too bad. Wrong.

154
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,761
It's true that if ice were used to strike the victim's head,

155
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,461
after the murder is committed, it would melt and disappear.

156
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,061
But if it were used,

157
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,561
shattered pieces of ice and drops of water would splatter,

158
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,061
and smears made by water should've been found.

159
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,961
No such smears were found anywhere.

160
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:57,061
And, judging from the splattered blood of the victim,

161
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,161
left as is, there is no trace of the killer having wiped the floor

162
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,061
after committing the murder.

163
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:05,461
The murderer put that hard something inside something and struck the victim,

164
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,461
after making sure that it wouldn't scatter.

165
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,661
I see, a PET bottle!

166
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,461
If the content is frozen stiff,

167
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,461
water wouldn't splatter as much!

168
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:16,561
In other words,

169
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:18,061
the culprit would be the one who had the PET bottle

170
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,861
with a sparkling drink in it,

171
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,961
in other words, you, Mr. Arimoto,

172
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,561
No, wrong!

173
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,961
Mr. Akimoto left the room at a little after 18:00.

174
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:33,261
Inspector, you checked the PET bottle at 19:30.

175
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:34,961
In an air conditioned room like this,

176
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,861
ice inside a 500 ml bottle

177
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:41,061
will not melt completely in an hour and a half.

178
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,861
Then, what is the hard thing that you're talking about?

179
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:49,561
Oh, I think you have some too, Inspector.

180
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,761
What?

181
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,361
Yes, it's an essential item that everyone has.

182
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,161
Coins, loose change!

183
00:11:57,161 --> 00:12:00,461
And most probably ten yen coins!

184
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,661
-Ten... -Ten yen coin?

185
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:08,061
Miss, just how can somebody strike a person with a ten yen coin?

186
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,461
You are right, with just one ten yen coin,

187
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,161
the most a person can do is wound someone.

188
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:16,061
But with 300 coins,

189
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:19,861
it'll turn into a blunt object weighing 1.5 kilograms.

190
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,761
Although that's true, but...

191
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:25,161
Nobody had that many coins on them.

192
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,961
The person got rid of it after committing the murder.

193
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:29,761
Got rid of it?

194
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:33,061
By putting it into the machine behind you, Inspector.

195
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:38,761
-I see! -The cigarette vending machine!

196
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,961
In other words, 300 ten yen coins were put inside the PET bottle

197
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,961
and used as a murder weapon to beat the victim to death!

198
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,761
Then, later the coins were inserted into the vending machine and used.

199
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,461
No, no, no!

200
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,961
The mouth of the bottle of the sparkling drink is too small

201
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:55,261
to insert a ten yen coin.

202
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,361
Besides, if something like that were put inside the PET bottle,

203
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,461
it would be damaged from the inside and outside.

204
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,261
One look and it would be obvious.

205
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:05,061
But, what on earth were the coins put inside then?

206
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,961
Yes, just like the ten yen coin,

207
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,961
it's an essential item that everyone uses,

208
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:13,561
Moreover, if a lot of ten yen coins are stuffed inside it,

209
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:17,061
it turns into a weapon commonly called Black Jack.

210
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,561
A sock!

211
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:19,761
A sock?

212
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,861
Isn't that right,

213
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,661
Mr. Kyota Honma?

214
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,961
Why is it him?

215
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,561
Both Mr. Tamai and Eisuke are wearing socks, too.

216
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,361
Mr. Honma's shoes are tightly fitted, see?

217
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,261
Excuse me.

218
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,361
True.

219
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:50,661
When he came into our room once by mistake,

220
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,061
he bumped into Mr. Arimoto and fell,

221
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,961
but back then his shoe was not tight, so it came off.

222
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,061
Now, he's wearing the sock that he used

223
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,361
for the murder weapon over another sock.

224
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:04,561
He probably wanted to hide the victim's blood

225
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,961
that splattered on his sock when committing the murder.

226
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:11,961
Come to think of it, Mr. Honma had a carton of cigarettes.

227
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:14,661
If he has the wrapping paper of the carton beforehand,

228
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,261
after getting rid of the ten yen coins

229
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:19,561
that were used to commit the murder with the vending machine,

230
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,961
even if a lot of cigarettes come out,

231
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,161
he could put in the wrapping paper and get away with it.

232
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:26,961
If you check the vending machine for a large amount of ten yen coins,

233
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,861
that's conclusive evidence.

234
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,861
If blood is on his sock,

235
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:34,361
blood should also be found on the 10 yen coins inside.

236
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,761
I'm sure his fingerprints are on them, too.

237
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,661
I don't think the culprit who wanted to use up

238
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,861
all the ten yen coins as soon as possible and leave the scene,

239
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,461
would bother to use gloves.

240
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:49,261
Then, you lied when you said that you've never seen the victim?

241
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:51,161
Never seen him, my foot.

242
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:53,461
I'll bet you know him very well, isn't it?

243
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:54,561
What?

244
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,861
The victim's name is Tatsumi.

245
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,361
Just by the sound of the name

246
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,461
it's hard to tell whether the victim is a he or a she.

247
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:02,861
However, Mr. Honma mentioned that

248
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,461
if he were to see the victim,

249
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,961
it would be in the corridor or the men's room.

250
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:11,661
Didn't he say this because he knew the man already?

251
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,961
He would never run into a woman in the restroom

252
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:17,361
because the men's room and the ladies' room are separated.

253
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:27,561
Yeah, I knew him.

254
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,161
I'd never forget

255
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,561
that man's face!

256
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,261
I'll never forget that kidnapper's face!

257
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,861
Kidnapper?

258
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:40,161
Yeah.

259
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,961
That guy kidnapped my son,

260
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:47,061
and after learning that I reported it to the police...

261
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:54,861
he killed my son, who was only 4 years old,

262
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,861
just to get back at me.

263
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,061
Daddy!

264
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,761
Oh, no...

265
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,361
Officer,

266
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:07,961
do you remember the kidnapping case

267
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:10,361
that occurred in Okubocho, a year ago?

268
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:14,261
Yeah, I heard that the suspect was caught

269
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:17,061
but that he was acquitted due to insufficient evidence.

270
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,761
Right, the murder weapon wasn't found.

271
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:25,261
It seems that guy used the same trick I used too, though.

272
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,361
That's why you've been following him waiting for a chance

273
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,961
to find a place that would meet the condition for carrying out the trick.

274
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:34,561
In other words, you decided to carry out your revenge at this karaoke shop

275
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,661
that has individual rooms and a cigarette vending machine.

276
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,061
Yeah.

277
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,661
Well, I hope you're grateful.

278
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:47,261
Judging from the picture he had on him,

279
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:50,461
the next targets might've been you people.

280
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:53,361
Well, if my son were as cautious as you,

281
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,561
he wouldn't have been kidnapped in the first place.

282
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,961
By the same token, a parent who would do something so stupid like this

283
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:01,561
may not have existed either.

284
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,961
Some welcome back celebration it turned out to be.

285
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,161
But, I was really overwhelmed with emotion.

286
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:16,861
Your deduction show, Sonoko.

287
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,161
You were just like the Sleeping Kogoro!

288
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,161
Yeah...

289
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,761
Your deduction was just as good as if not better than Shinichi's.

290
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:23,861
Really?

291
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,361
I don't remember a thing.

292
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:31,061
Shinichi? You mean that high school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

293
00:17:31,061 --> 00:17:34,361
Right. He also Ran's "working away from home" husband.

294
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,961
Sonoko!

295
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:38,061
You're high school students and married?

296
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,661
Of course we're not married.

297
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:40,861
Why would I marry a guy like that?

298
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,561
He says he's busy with a case

299
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,461
and is out on a long business trip, you see!

300
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:48,261
They're like a long separated couple.

301
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,761
No. In fact, I'm living with her.

302
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,561
Oh, I've got some other books I want to buy,

303
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:56,861
-so you can go ahead home. -What? Now?

304
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:59,061
Don't worry, I'll stay with him

305
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,761
and make sure to bring him back to the detective agency.

306
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,461
Okay.

307
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,561
So? What is it?

308
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,861
You went out of your way to stay with me.

309
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,561
So, you must want to talk to me, right?

310
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:20,361
Yeah, I was thinking about it,

311
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:23,561
but I've decided to go to the States.

312
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,661
Did you decide to accept the witness protection program?

313
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,561
No, I refused.

314
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,761
Like I told you before, I don't like being tied down.

315
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:35,361
I seem to be lucky so far that the guys of the bad organization

316
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:38,961
haven't found me yet, either.

317
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:40,961
Then, why are you leaving for the States?

318
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:44,261
In order to join the CIA like my father and older sister did!

319
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:48,161
I'm going to reveal their evil doings from corner to corner

320
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,061
and eventually bust the entire Organization together with big sis.

321
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:57,161
First, you've got to do something about your clumsiness,

322
00:18:57,161 --> 00:19:00,161
or you're not going to make it as a CIA agent.

323
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,761
Yeah.

324
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,661
Besides, the CIA is an organization

325
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:06,561
that works for the national benefit of the US.

326
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,761
I wonder if he knows that?

327
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:12,661
But, if you decided on leaving,

328
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,861
why did you come back to school?

329
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,461
Although it was just for a short while,

330
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:19,861
I wanted to meet the friends I made here once more before going.

331
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,861
I wanted to confess to Ran that.

332
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,661
I fell in love at first sight with her.

333
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:33,461
I've never seen anyone so pretty and kind like her, you see.

334
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:36,961
But, she seems to like Shinichi,

335
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:41,061
although I don't know how he feels about her.

336
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,161
Oh, right. Do you know how to get in touch with Shinichi?

337
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,461
Yeah.

338
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,661
Then, will you ask him for me

339
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:52,461
whether it's okay to tell Ran how I feel about her?

340
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,561
I won't be like Shinichi

341
00:19:57,561 --> 00:20:00,161
and leave Ran to fend for herself.

342
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:02,161
And also that I'm planning to take her to the States with me in the future

343
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:04,761
and live happily ever after.

344
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,861
You can't.

345
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:13,061
No, I'm not asking for your opinion, ask Shinichi for me.

346
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,561
That's why I'm telling you it won't work!

347
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:26,961
Then... Then, don't tell me that you're...

348
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,361
Yeah, I'm exactly who you think I am.

349
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,261
So, the mystery's been solved!

350
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:47,561
I went to the Mouri Detective Agency to begin with

351
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,961
because I heard that he had seen Rena Mizunashi

352
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,761
just before she disappeared.

353
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,961
Back then, I didn't know that she was my older sister

354
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,661
as well as a member of the CIA.

355
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:59,861
Therefore, I thought that Detective Mouri conspired with bad people

356
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,061
sheltering her somewhere.

357
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,761
That's why I was checking up on Detective Mouri on my own.

358
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:10,061
Then, I found something out.

359
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,661
Detective Mouri's deduction before he becomes the Sleeping Kogoro

360
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:17,061
and after he becomes it, is totally different.

361
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:21,361
Moreover, you're always somewhere near the Sleeping Kogoro.

362
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:24,661
I tried not to think of why you've shrunk,

363
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:28,161
but just as I thought you're Shinichi Kudo, aren't you?

364
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,761
What do you mean "just as I thought"?

365
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:31,861
You sound like you already know about everything.

366
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:34,261
Yes, I assumed things to be this way.

367
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,361
From the time the Sleeping Kogoro appeared,

368
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,261
you were absent from school.

369
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,461
And, there was just one time that I fell deliberately

370
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:43,761
and not because I was a klutz.

371
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:47,561
Do you remember what I said when I saw you for the first time?

372
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:50,961
Nice to meet you, Detective Mouri.

373
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,861
I'm honoured to see you.

374
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,661
Then, you did all this just so that you could get the truth out of me?

375
00:21:56,661 --> 00:22:00,961
Oh, but it's true that I fell in love at first sight with Ran.

376
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,361
Make sure you make her happy.

377
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:34,161
Oh, right. Do you know?

378
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:37,461
Something seems to have happened at the FBI.

379
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:40,661
What do you mean?

380
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:44,461
It looked like someone passed away.

381
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:48,861
But, if you haven't heard anything,

382
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,361
I guess everything's okay.

383
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:02,461
Yeah, everything's okay.

384
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:09,261
"Next Episode"

385
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:12,461
We have no clients today either?

386
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:14,761
Who could be calling at this time of night?

387
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:16,761
Code name.

388
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,261
Bourbon.

389
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:23,861
Maybe one of the three set fire to the building.

390
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,261
Those guys...

391
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:29,261
must be around here.

392
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,261
The members from that organization.

393
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,961
Next Conan,

394
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:36,761
"The Youth Detective Squad And Red, White, Yellow"

395
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,961
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,861
"Diary"

397
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,261
Next expisode is red, white and yellow.

398
00:24:58,261 --> 00:24:59,561
You mean tulips?

399
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,561
-The sports festival! -A bean-paste bun?
