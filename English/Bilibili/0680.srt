1
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,607
Is this the rumored cactus?

2
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,607
It's a cactus called "Golden Barrel"

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,207
that takes 50 years to bear flowers.

4
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:13,207
-What? 50 years? -Yeah.

5
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:14,707
"Zenzo Sunada (66), a wealthy man" -I took care of it

6
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:16,807
since it was this small, right?

7
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,407
After so many years, it grew to be this big

8
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,107
and even blossomed with flowers.

9
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:26,607
Which means that you were raising it

10
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,507
from the time you were about Ran's age?

11
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:30,507
Exactly, sonny.

12
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:35,207
Sonoko, you came to see it in the past with your father, you know.

13
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,407
Really? I don't remember.

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,407
It's not surprising that you don't remember,

15
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:45,107
since you were still a toddler then.

16
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:47,907
That's why.

17
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:51,007
By the way, where's the flower that you're referring to?

18
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,007
-It's right there. -Huh?

19
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:58,007
It's enveloped by fluffy bird feather-like thorns at the top.

20
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,007
The yellow flower.

21
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,607
Really! How cute.

22
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:06,007
I guess...

23
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,707
True.

24
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:12,307
The vivid colored memories of summer

25
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:14,407
solve mysteries all season round.

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,107
In a greenhouse under tight security,

27
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,207
there're rare cactuses with stingy thorns.

28
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,907
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:21,907
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:24,307
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:16,965
"Cactus Rhapsody"

32
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,865
But what a large number of cactus you have here.

33
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,565
I guess you've got some valuable ones here, too.

34
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,765
Aren't you plagued by thieves at times?

35
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:30,365
Well, there's a specially ordered alarm set up here.

36
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:34,565
At night, I'm the only one who can cancel the alarm,

37
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,765
since I have this card.

38
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:39,765
It's sort of like the automatic wicket at the station.

39
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,965
But, why do you keep it in your pocket?

40
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:46,165
I keep whatever's important in here,

41
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:48,565
that way I feel safe.

42
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,765
Dad!

43
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:56,165
What do you guys want?

44
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:57,865
We heard from the lawyer!

45
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:00,465
That you changed the will?

46
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,265
Quiet! I've got guests!

47
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:05,865
Shut up! Tell us what's going on!

48
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,165
I'm not wasting my breath for something like that!

49
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,665
Get out of here.

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,365
My cactus are going to wither!

51
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,965
No good, Yasuyuki. Let's take care of this later.

52
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,165
Yeah.

53
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,765
You're going to explain this to us later, understand?

54
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,065
Gosh!

55
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,565
Really, I tell you...

56
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,765
The Golden Barrel finally blossomed, and yet...

57
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,865
Yashiro!

58
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,165
Where are you, Yashiro?

59
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:34,665
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:37,365
What seems to be the matter, sir?

61
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,765
What the heck is that?

62
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:46,065
I told you I don't use unglazed pottery planters!

63
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,265
Put it away right this minute!

64
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,465
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:53,265
What a temper.

66
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,465
Excuse me.

67
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,665
We came at a bad time, didn't we?

68
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,565
He seems to have been known in his younger days as "Zenzo the Ogre"

69
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:05,465
an aggressive wheeler-dealer.

70
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:07,565
How embarrassing.

71
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,365
I did shout at her, but she's a good worker, that Yashiro.

72
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,965
She's a super good cook, too.

73
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,165
Is that right?

74
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,265
She's so different from my two sons.

75
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,965
Okay, I'm going back to the house now,

76
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:24,165
but why don't you all take your time looking around?

77
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,865
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

78
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:36,665
What're you doing?

79
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:37,965
Dad.

80
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:40,365
I'm asking you what you're doing?

81
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,765
What else?

82
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,765
Unluckily, what you're looking for is here.

83
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,165
"Will"

84
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:52,365
Is it true that you're not dividing the inheritance to us?

85
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:53,565
I've decided to donate everything

86
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,965
to the Botanical Garden along with the cactuses.

87
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,965
What?

88
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,265
Not what you expected, eh?

89
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,465
You're going to give your money up

90
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,565
to your cactuses rather than your sons?

91
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,965
Most naturally.

92
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:08,865
A professional golfer, my foot.

93
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:11,565
All you do is live off me despite being a grown man.

94
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,265
I'm not giving you any money!

95
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:14,865
What?

96
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,465
Well, the flower was so small

97
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:21,665
despite him asking us to come over and look at it, wasn't it?

98
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,165
Not really.

99
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,765
He gave us an opportunity to see something really rare,

100
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,465
so we should be grateful.

101
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:30,965
That... I wonder what it is?

102
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:33,665
Isn't it a radiator for the water heater?

103
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:37,065
I'm sure it's regulating the temperature in the greenhouse.

104
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,465
I know, I know!

105
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,465
If I remember correctly, the temperature's being controlled here.

106
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,865
Hot!

107
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:45,165
Hey, Sonoko. Are you all right?

108
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:49,365
If so, what do I have to do to get you to go through

109
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,565
with the original will?

110
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,065
I have no intention of reversing the will

111
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,565
unless you succeed my business!

112
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,065
Are you telling me to quit golf?

113
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,365
You're just a third tier player

114
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,765
who's always defeated in the Monday qualifying anyway.

115
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:03,465
How dare you, saying what you will...

116
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,565
You took the words right out of my mouth!

117
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:09,065
Okay then, I'll do as I please!

118
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,765
You! What're you doing?

119
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,265
Well, you see...

120
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:18,565
I'll bet you came to ask for money as usual.

121
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:19,965
Same to you!

122
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,665
You won't get away trying to outdo me.

123
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:24,365
-What? -Please stop!

124
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,265
You're standing in front of your father's room, you know!

125
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:27,265
Who cares.

126
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,465
Shut up!

127
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,665
You come back after a long while,

128
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,465
and all you both do is talk about money!

129
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:37,665
Wrong. I came because I was worried about you.

130
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,065
Don't lie!

131
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,865
I already heard that the import car dealer

132
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:43,965
that you just started is suffering financially!

133
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,765
Worry, my foot.

134
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,465
It's no use fawning upon the great to win his favor.

135
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,665
All he has in mind are his cactuses.

136
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:57,465
No use picking a fight now.

137
00:07:57,465 --> 00:07:58,865
Let's cool it for now,

138
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:01,265
and try convincing him later tonight.

139
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,965
We're back.

140
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:09,265
After looking through all the plants, I'm kind of hungry.

141
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:10,265
Really.

142
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:13,465
"It's cake before flowers" is a phrase made just for you.

143
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,265
Conan!

144
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,565
Are you all right?

145
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,565
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

146
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:24,065
-I'm sorry. -Gosh.

147
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,165
I'm really sorry.

148
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,065
This...

149
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,965
Thanks.

150
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,565
Ms. Yashiro.

151
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,365
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:39,565
Please bring my dinner to my room.

153
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:42,065
Yes, sir.

154
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,165
Yasuyuki really changed.

155
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,365
I don't like him.

156
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,765
I'm filled.

157
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,065
I really ate.

158
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,865
Sonoko, you ate too much.

159
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,565
You took one helping after the other.

160
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:58,865
I couldn't help it.

161
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,565
When you got the craving, is when to go for it.

162
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,265
Ms. Yashiro.

163
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:04,265
Yes, sir?

164
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:07,865
I'll go out to practice golf for a while.

165
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:11,365
I'm going to go check on the car that I left back in the garage.

166
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:14,165
Bye.

167
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:17,365
Ms. Yashiro, thank you for the dinner.

168
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,265
It was really delicious.

169
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:22,865
Will you please teach me the recipe for that gravy sauce?

170
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:26,565
Oh? Just who are you going to make it for?

171
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,765
Don't tell me you're making it for your hubby.

172
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,965
No. Come off it, Sonoko.

173
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,765
I'm glad that you liked it.

174
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,965
Would you like some coffee now?

175
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,965
But we were just thinking of leaving.

176
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,565
Is Mr. Sunada still in the greenhouse?

177
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,065
Yes. Every day from about 20:00 to 21:00,

178
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:48,165
he spends his time taking care of the cactuses.

179
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:49,865
Let's go tell him goodbye, then.

180
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:54,665
But I've told not to let anyone in until 20:30.

181
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,165
So, could you wait a little while more?

182
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,265
Okay then, I guess we'll take a eating break here for a while longer!

183
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,965
I wonder if I'll get fat?

184
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,665
Come on, Sonoko.

185
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,665
That's nothing new.

186
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,465
Yasuyuki?

187
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,465
Wrong! I didn't do it!

188
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,865
What's the matter?

189
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,265
What's that?

190
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:25,265
Isn't that the will?

191
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,365
This is...

192
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,165
Don't tell me that...

193
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,365
Mr. Sunada!

194
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,765
Mr. Sunada!

195
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,173
The cause of death seems to be from a fractured skull

196
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,273
from being beaten in the head with a shovel.

197
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:54,173
The estimated time of death

198
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:58,573
seems to be between 20:00 to 20:30.

199
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:01,473
And who was the first to find the body...

200
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:06,873
Gosh. I sure run into you kids a lot at the scenes of crimes.

201
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:10,573
Hey, tell me about the circumstances when you found the body.

202
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:12,173
Uh...

203
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,273
After dinner, we were chatting in the living room,

204
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,273
when at about 20:00,

205
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,673
the sound of the alarm in the greenhouse went off.

206
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:22,973
Then, we went to look together with the housekeeper, Ms. Yashiro.

207
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,373
And saw Yasuyuki there.

208
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:27,973
You saw Yasuyuki?

209
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:32,873
Yasuyuki was holding Mr. Sunada's will!

210
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,373
Will?

211
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:39,273
It seems that Mr. Sunada recently rewrote the will!

212
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:43,873
Then, right after that, Misa ran into the greenhouse

213
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,773
and when we all followed her inside...

214
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,773
Mr. Sunada was...

215
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:52,973
Hey, let's go interrogate the people involved!

216
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,073
Yes, sir.

217
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,173
Like I already told you,

218
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,073
I rushed inside because I heard the alarm

219
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:00,173
and found Dad lying on the floor!

220
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:02,573
Why were you in the greenhouse

221
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,573
when you said you were going out to practice golf?

222
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:08,373
That's because Dad texted me to come over.

223
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:11,373
See!

224
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:12,773
I see.

225
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,673
You received it at 20:20.

226
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:17,373
How about the victim's cell phone?

227
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:21,973
Likewise, at 20:20 he texted to Yasuyuki.

228
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:26,773
Which means that the old man was alive till then.

229
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,473
And, what about the will?

230
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:33,873
Weren't you standing in front of the greenhouse holding the will?

231
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,773
Well...

232
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:38,173
I took it from the pocket of Dad who was lying on the ground.

233
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:40,173
Which means that you...

234
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,773
Wrong! I didn't do it! Please believe me!

235
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:46,773
This was found near the corpse.

236
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:48,173
A golf tee!

237
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,773
That's Yasuyuki's...

238
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:51,773
Yasuyuki!

239
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,373
Beats me.

240
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,373
Why would something like that be in a place like this?

241
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:59,073
Please believe me! I didn't do it!

242
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:01,273
I didn't kill Dad!

243
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:02,773
Please believe me!

244
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,773
After being texted to come here by the victim,

245
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:08,473
you pretended to go practice golfing

246
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:10,673
and headed for the greenhouse.

247
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,173
The victim let you in,

248
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:15,373
but you got into an argument with him concerning the will.

249
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,773
You lost your temper and picked up the shovel that was by you

250
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,873
and beat Mr. Sunada to death!

251
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:25,673
You took the will to gain inheritance, then fled.

252
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:31,073
Back then, the alarm sensed you and it went off!

253
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,573
-Isn't that what happened? -No way.

254
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:36,673
Inspector Yokomizo.

255
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,673
Mr. Sunada should've had a card

256
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:42,273
to cancel the alarm in his pocket, you know.

257
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:45,573
I wonder why that wasn't taken?

258
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:49,073
If he used it, the alarm wouldn't have gone off, don't you think?

259
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:53,673
It's true that the card to cancel the alarm

260
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,173
was in the victim's pocket.

261
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,773
You probably just panicked after beating your Dad up.

262
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,873
-Isn't that right? -There's more.

263
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,473
What is it now?

264
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,973
There's the planter of the Hairbrush Cactus

265
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:07,973
on the ground near Mr. Sunada, isn't there?

266
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,473
When we first came in here to look around,

267
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,473
it wasn't on the ground, you know.

268
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:15,473
It was probably knocked over

269
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:17,173
when the culprit was struggling with the victim!

270
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,973
If so, isn't it strange?

271
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,873
What is?

272
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:24,873
Because the soil that spilled out from the planter is super dry.

273
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:28,073
I wonder if the soil will dry up like that in just an hour or so?

274
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:33,573
Besides, a cactus thorn was poked in by Mr. Sunada's chest.

275
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:34,573
Never mind already!

276
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,973
Just stop keep butting your nose into the investigation, kid!

277
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:38,473
Off you go!

278
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,173
Okay!

279
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:49,573
It's withered.

280
00:14:49,573 --> 00:14:50,673
Maybe...

281
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:54,973
This is...

282
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:01,273
I see. So, that's the story.

283
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:03,973
If so, the culprit is...

284
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,173
definitely her!

285
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:13,973
Why? Why do I have to be arrested?

286
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:17,273
I'll hear you out at the station.

287
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:20,373
Cut out your talking and get inside!

288
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,473
Like I've been saying, I didn't do it!

289
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,373
Please believe me!

290
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,173
What's up? Did something happen?

291
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:32,573
No, the thing is... nothing really.

292
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:35,473
But the alarm's ringing!

293
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,973
Sonoko.

294
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,573
What's going on?

295
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:47,173
Hey.

296
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:50,273
I figured everything out with that alarm just now!

297
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,573
What?

298
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:54,073
This was an alibi trick

299
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,473
carried out by using the alarm device!

300
00:15:56,473 --> 00:16:01,273
The crime took place before Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

301
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:03,373
First, at around 20:00

302
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,873
when Mr. Sunada went into the greenhouse,

303
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,673
the culprit snuck in together

304
00:16:08,673 --> 00:16:10,573
and committed the crime.

305
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:15,773
Then, in order to frame Yasuyuki for the crime,

306
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,673
something that only he could've possessed,

307
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,573
was left behind at the scene of the crime.

308
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:24,473
After that, you used the dead Mr. Sanada's finger

309
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:27,473
to text Yasuyuki to come over

310
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,973
and set it so that the mail would be sent out at 20:20,

311
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,773
the time that would validate your alibi.

312
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:35,073
You preset the mail to go out at the fixed time.

313
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:39,073
That can be checked on by calling the cell phone company.

314
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:42,773
Moreover, the culprit used the alarm cancelling card

315
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:46,373
from Mr. Sunada's pocket and fled from the greenhouse.

316
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,473
Then, the culprit snuck away from us

317
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,173
taking a route that would be a blind spot from the living room

318
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,773
and went in through the backdoor to the house.

319
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,873
Then soon...

320
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:58,073
after you got back to the scene of the crime,

321
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:01,073
you returned the card to his pocket.

322
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:04,673
That's why when Yasuyuki took the will,

323
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,873
he didn't realize that the card was there.

324
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:12,973
Of course not, because the culprit had the card then.

325
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,573
Which means...

326
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:18,573
When the alarm rang, nobody was at the greenhouse.

327
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:21,673
If so, why did the alarm go off?

328
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,373
That's the key to this trick.

329
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:26,873
The trap that the culprit used taking advantage

330
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,973
of how the alarm system works.

331
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:32,373
Look on top of that radiator.

332
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:35,873
There is an unglazed pottery planter on it, isn't there?

333
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,873
The alarm system of this greenhouse

334
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:41,173
senses the slightest far-infrared ray

335
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,373
that is emitted by the human body and goes off.

336
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:47,773
Unglazed potteries as well as ceramics characteristically

337
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:50,273
have a tendency to emit far-infrared rays

338
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:53,473
like does the human body when heated.

339
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,073
The culprit took advantage of this.

340
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,773
Will something like that really make the alarm go off?

341
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,273
I tried out a small experiment.

342
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:05,073
I put that planter over there

343
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:07,673
because Sonoko told me to.

344
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,973
I see. That's why the alarm went off a while ago.

345
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:12,573
This circumstance is exactly the same

346
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:16,173
as when Yasuyuki entered the greenhouse.

347
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:20,173
In other words, it splendidly rang.

348
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,273
And there's only one person

349
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:25,673
that can carry out this crime!

350
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,673
Ms. Misa Yashiro.

351
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:32,773
You!

352
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,173
Misa.

353
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:37,473
It's truly and interesting story.

354
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:41,073
But that's just a deduction, isn't it?

355
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,173
Do you have any proof?

356
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:46,073
Proof that would indicate that I'm the culprit?

357
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:49,073
When you beat Mr. Sunada to death,

358
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,873
you happened to knock over a cactus.

359
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:58,173
But you needed to move the cactus

360
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,573
that was on the dead man's chest away, no matter what.

361
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,573
In order to take the alarm cancelling card away!

362
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:05,773
Back then,

363
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:09,773
I'm sure that the thorns of the cactus poked into your hand.

364
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:14,173
Which means, that the one who has traces of wounds from this

365
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:15,873
is the culprit.

366
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:19,273
Misa. If you insist on not being the culprit,

367
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,873
please show us your hand.

368
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:27,473
You win.

369
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:31,473
Just as you said, I'm the killer.

370
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:33,573
This is...

371
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,173
But, how did you figure it out?

372
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:38,373
The cactus told me.

373
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,173
What?

374
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:42,973
When I came to the site,

375
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,873
the soil that spilled out of the planter that was knocked over,

376
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:49,173
was already starting to dry up.

377
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,973
Moreover, the flower that was bloomed in the day time,

378
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,073
was for some reason withered.

379
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,473
And that's when it hit upon me.

380
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:58,773
That it had something to do

381
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,473
with the temperature here in this greenhouse.

382
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:07,673
And the other key to solving this trick is the planter.

383
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,873
The planter that was once put away after you were scolded,

384
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:13,173
was for some reason left behind at the scene of the crime

385
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:14,773
after the crime was committed.

386
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:18,073
That's when I was totally convinced.

387
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:21,573
That you, Misa, are the only one capable of being the culprit.

388
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,673
Because you're the only one

389
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:27,673
who knew where the planter you put away was.

390
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:34,973
I hated Zenzo Sunada.

391
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:37,173
In his prime years,

392
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:40,073
he ran one company after the other into bankruptcy

393
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,873
by his merciless ways

394
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,973
and ran many business owners into committing suicide.

395
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:53,573
One of them was my Father, who raised me by himself.

396
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:57,373
After Sunada retired

397
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,873
and put out a want ad for a housekeeper,

398
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:03,873
I made up my mind to avenge my Father's death with my own hands.

399
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:07,673
At seeing his sons going after their Father's money

400
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:10,173
and indulging themselves to the max,

401
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:14,573
I decided to put the blame on one of the two sons!

402
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,473
Ms. Yashiro.

403
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:19,973
At learning suddenly that all of you were coming,

404
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:21,173
it's true that I hesitated

405
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:23,073
on whether I should go through with my plan or not.

406
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,973
But I only had today.

407
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:28,373
A day when the whole family would gather together was rare,

408
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:30,173
so I only had today.

409
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:33,373
I'll hear you out at the station.

410
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:34,773
Yes, sir.

411
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:37,773
Misa.

412
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:43,273
Your feelings of wanted to hate Mr. Sanada...

413
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:45,173
I sort of understand it.

414
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:49,273
You lost your precious Father, after all.

415
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:52,973
But that doesn't mean

416
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:57,673
you can take a person's life for revenge.

417
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:40,473
I don't know why, but I'm really sleepy.

418
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,973
But you're really something, Sonoko,

419
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:45,973
to solve such a difficult case like that!

420
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,873
Really?

421
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:51,973
Well, if this Super Detective Queen of Deductions handles a case,

422
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,673
all of them are a piece of cake to solve!

423
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:00,773
Gosh. All you did was sleep.

424
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,073
You not only caught a wink, you know.

425
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:09,173
Cactus, cactus...

426
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,673
"Next Episode" -Train 3's door will now close.

427
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:16,673
Watch out because Kaitou KID will be on it!

428
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:18,073
Just kidding.

429
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:20,273
Next week, we will ride a luxury train.

430
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:22,273
And I'll compete with the queen.

431
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:23,973
2 hours until the next station.

432
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:25,873
A big showdown is going to occur,

433
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:28,273
but the organization is interfering again!

434
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:31,073
Hey. If you do it inelegantly,

435
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:33,973
the queen of heart won't appear.

436
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,173
Next episode, "The Tearful Crystal Mother"

437
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:39,173
It's arrived. Let's meet up.

438
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,273
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:59,473
"Ice"

440
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:00,973
The next two weeks will be with Sir Thief Kid.

441
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:02,273
Though it's a bit early, let's the three of us, celebrate...

442
00:25:02,273 --> 00:25:04,373
A Merry Christmas!
