00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,650
(Illustrated Diary)
Ayumi's Illustrated Diary.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Ms. Kobayashi praised my work
so much

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,400
for the illustrated diary I drew
last time.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,500
(Hagino Fruits & Vegetables)

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,400
She said The Youth Detective Squad
looked really cool

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
when solving the jewellery theft case!

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,900
So this time,

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,200
(Fujioka)
I want to draw a lot more

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,500
(Illustrated Diary)
so that I can be praised even more!

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,300
The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary
Part 2 is starting!

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,100
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,300
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,100
Ayumi's illustrated diary
depicts a case!

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,900
What is the truth
behind the bomb report?

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,400
He sees through the one
and only truth.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,200
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,900
(The Case of Ayumi's Illustrated Diary 2)

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
It all started

21
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,500
when we were on the way home
from a drive.

22
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Conan...

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,500
What's that?

24
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
(What's going on?")

25
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,500
(It keeps flickering... What is it?)

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,600
(It's some kind of signal...
What is it called?)

27
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
(Isn't it a Morse code signal?)

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
(That's it! A Morse code signal!)

29
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,300
That's a Morse code signal, right?

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,800
Yeah, and it keeps repeating SOS.

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,900
Good eye, Ayumi.

32
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,300
Has someone been captured?

33
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm not sure...

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
I'll take a look at what's going on,

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
so you guys wait right here!

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Stay alert.

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,000
He kind of looks like
a mythical tiger-carp.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Are you all right?

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,700
A bomb!

40
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,600
They've planted a bomb!

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,900
What?

42
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,600
We should run right away!

43
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,500
Hey, do you know
who planted the bomb?

44
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
How should I know?

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
I was only here
to deliver some items!

46
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,300
They were talking about the bomb

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,600
when they tied me up
and left me there.

48
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,700
I heard them!

49
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Dr. Agasa! We need to report
to the police right away!

50
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
You're right...

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,700
Where's Conan?

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,600
He can't still be in the building...

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
Hey, kid, it's dangerous here.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
You have to get away!

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,200
I'll be okay, just leave me alone!

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,700
I won't let you.

57
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,900
Hey!

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,600
- There's no way a kid like you
- Let me down.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,100
- can defuse a bomb.
- Let me down...

60
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,800
Officer Takagi!
And Officer Chiba, too!

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
You got here quickly.

62
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
We received an anonymous report
saying that

63
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
the light in the office over there

64
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,700
was giving out an SOS signal.

65
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,300
Anonymous?

66
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Officer Takagi.

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
That's the guy who was captured!

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Excuse me, but could you
tell us what happened?

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,300
First, please tell us your name.

70
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,700
Yes... My name is Masaru Danno.

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
(Masaru Danno (26))
Yes... My name is Masaru Danno.

72
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,200
(Masaru Danno (26))
It's written with the characters for

73
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,650
(Masaru Danno (26))
"group", "field" and "large".

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm a rider for
a motorcycle delivery company.

75
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
I was delivering a package

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,100
to an office
on the third floor of the building

77
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,200
and was just about to
get a signature

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
when a handgun
suddenly dropped out of

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,100
a rude-looking man's pocket.

80
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,200
Why did the handgun
drop out of the pocket?

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,700
It looked like
he was about to take out

82
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,200
a seal from his inner pocket.

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,500
I see.

84
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
And you were captured

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
because you happened to
see the handgun.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
Well, yes...

87
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,000
As a result, I was hit
on the head from behind and fainted.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,200
When I woke up, I was tied up
and unable to move.

89
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,900
That's when they said
they would blow up the building.

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,500
They wouldn't need to kill me

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,700
because the bomb would explode.

92
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,100
But why would the culprits say that

93
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,000
in front of you, mister?

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,900
Well, I was unconscious until
just before that moment.

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,300
I see! So you pretended to be asleep.

96
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And when the two of them
left the room,

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
the rest was history.

99
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,200
You kept sending an SOS signal
in Morse code

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,000
by making the light flicker.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
While looking like
a mythical tiger-carp.

102
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
Hey, mister,

103
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,600
how did you think of signalling for help
using Morse code?

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
How?

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,900
I was in the Boy Scouts as a kid,

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,300
so the signal I learnt came to mind
at that moment.

107
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,900
I see.

108
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,800
By the way,
is that your motorcycle?

109
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
Yeah, that's my treasured bike.

110
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,400
We just received word from
the bomb squad inside the building.

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,300
They said they found
something resembling a bomb

112
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,100
in the third-floor office.

113
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,800
They heard ticking noises

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,200
from within a cardboard box.

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
(The SOS was real...)
(Did they find the bomb?)

116
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,700
(Is the building empty?
Did everyone evacuate?)

117
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,000
(There's a bomb squad on the way!)

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
(Children? Why are they there?)

119
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
(Where is it? Inside the building?)

120
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
Boom!

121
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Or that's what you would think.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,800
In the box was just
a regular alarm clock.

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
(Ring...)

124
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,700
We searched every nook and cranny,

125
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,600
but we couldn't find any explosives.

126
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,800
What do we do, Takagi?

127
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Let's remove the barricade
around the building and retreat.

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,200
Some of the forensics guys can stay.

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
- Yes, sir!
- In the end, the bomb wasn't found.

130
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,100
But I was sure I heard them say that

131
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,200
they planted a bomb.

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Then, if they did plant a bomb,

133
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,000
why didn't they kill you?

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,300
You just say
the most unlucky things, kid.

135
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Well, in the end
there were no bombs going off.

136
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,200
Where were you, Conan?

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
I had something to do.

138
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
Hello?

139
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
What did you say?

141
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,800
Takagi,

142
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,000
the Kaneko Jewellery store in Beika-cho
had just been robbed!

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,100
What?

144
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,800
- What?
- Isn't Kaneko Jewellery...

145
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,700
It's the store that's...

146
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,780
(Hagino Fruits & Vegetables, Kaneko Jewellery)
on our way to school!

147
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,300
To everyone's surprise,
another robbery has taken place!

148
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,150
(SOS Light And Confinement Case)

149
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,700
(SOS Light And Confinement Case)
And so,

150
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,600
(SOS Light And Confinement Case)
the SOS Light And Confinement Case

151
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,900
developed in a way
we didn't expect!

152
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,700
I can't believe
the store was robbed again.

153
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,600
That's unfortunate.

154
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,800
I see. So that's it.

155
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
Dr. Agasa, could you
bring the car here?

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,200
Conan, what did you figure out?

157
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
You said, "so that's it" earlier.

158
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,900
What I mean to say is that

159
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,600
we were made accomplices

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,900
in the robbery without us knowing.

161
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,500
- Accomplices in the robbery?
- That's right.

162
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,500
(Masaru Danno, written with the words
for 'group', 'field' and 'large')

163
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,600
(Masaru Danno, written with the words
for 'group', 'field' and 'large')
That Danno guy is probably

164
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
(One of the robbers)
one of them.

165
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,100
What?

166
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,800
It's suspicious that he asked for help
using Morse code

167
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
instead of running away
without knowing

168
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,300
when the bomb would go off
or if anyone would notice.

169
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,200
But don't you think it's strange that

170
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
a robbery occurred right when people
were worked up over a bomb

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,600
that wasn't even there?

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,700
You're right.

173
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,500
As a result, many police officers
were at that building.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,300
Even the bomb squad was involved.

175
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,100
It was a perfect diversion.

176
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,400
But couldn't it have been
just a coincidence?

177
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,500
There needs to be some evidence

178
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
if we were to doubt his words.

179
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,600
That's what I thought,

180
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,000
but I didn't find it
when I was observing him.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
What were you trying to find?

182
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,700
A bump.

183
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
A bump?

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
He said he was knocked out cold,

185
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,400
but I didn't find any bumps or wounds
on the back of his head.

186
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,700
If he wasn't hit...

187
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,500
Then everything he said was a lie?

188
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,300
In other words, all of us,
including the police,

189
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,200
were completely tricked by him?

190
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
That's not necessarily the case.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
What do you mean by that?

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,900
I thought he was acting suspicious,

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,200
so I planted a tracker
on his motorcycle.

194
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
What?

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,000
So, we must be heading towards...

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,700
Yes, we're heading
where Danno's motorcycle is parked.

197
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,300
Look!

198
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,600
Isn't that Mr. Danno?

199
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,000
He can't be sleeping, right?

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Now he has a huge bump on his head!

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
He's unconscious, but it's okay.

202
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,200
He's still alive.

203
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,500
But why...

204
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
They must have had a big falling out.

205
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,600
Mitsuhiko, call an ambulance
and the police.

206
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
Right.

207
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,700
Let's try not to touch anything at all.

208
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,600
There it is.

209
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
What's that?

210
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
A driving recorder.

211
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
I couldn't find a key in his pocket

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
and thought the motorcycle
was parked weirdly,

213
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,800
so I thought

214
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,100
he might have parked his motorcycle

215
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,500
where the driving recorder
could record the warehouse.

216
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
Does that mean
he doesn't trust his accomplices?

217
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, that could have happened.

218
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,500
It shows what happened perfectly!

219
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,600
That must have hurt.

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm fast-forwarding a little.

221
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
All right!

222
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,800
It's clear as day in the footage.

223
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,000
Hello, Officer Chiba?

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,300
We've discovered the robbers' car.

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,400
It's blue,
and the licence plate number is...

226
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,800
It was heading west
from an abandoned factory

227
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,900
at 7 Haido-cho 15 minutes ago.

228
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Got it.

229
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,500
We'll dispatch
some people there immediately.

230
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,800
Report from
the traffic surveillance system.

231
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
The wanted vehicle has been found.

232
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,500
I'm stepping on it.

233
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
The wanted vehicle
is heading west on Haido-cho.

234
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,800
Nearby vehicles are moving fast.

235
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,500
Secure the target.

236
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Escaping vehicle found.

237
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
It's heading north
from Dashinomoto Stadium

238
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
towards Koume Expressway.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Dr. Agasa, exit at the next interchange!

240
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
- We should hurry, too!
- Okay.

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,600
Could this be...

242
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,700
A car chase!

243
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
A back-and-forth chase

244
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,500
between the culprits
and the police car,

245
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
going past the speed limit
and burning rubber!

246
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,000
It's beyond even
the description of Hollywood films!

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,300
And then, a large explosion!

248
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,500
Not only did that didn't happen...

249
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Report from PC 21.

250
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,700
The escaping vehicle has been
lost north of Hamare Park.

251
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,900
I repeat...

252
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Where did the culprits' car go?

253
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,100
We're past the stadium.

254
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,900
Where do we go from here?

255
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,600
The culprits were heading west
before they were spotted.

256
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
And then they headed north...

257
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,100
Turn left at the traffic light!

258
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,200
-What? -How do you know to turn left?

259
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Since the culprit headed north

260
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
the moment
they were discovered by the police,

261
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,600
it's unlikely that
their destination is that way.

262
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,700
Besides, a pursuer would
usually think that

263
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,500
the culprits would shake them off
by continuing to head north.

264
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,600
That's why the culprits went
in the opposite direction and headed south.

265
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,100
That's what I would do.

266
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
I see.

267
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,500
The culprits would also be able to
avoid expressways and main roads

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,600
that have surveillance cameras
installed throughout.

269
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,300
If that's the case,

270
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
the culprits will surely
pass through this road!

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,200
It would be nice
if we found the blue car.

272
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,300
Yes, but...

273
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,100
Where are they?
Where are the culprits?

274
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,900
There they are!

275
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,300
It's the blue car!

276
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,700
There's no mistaking it!

277
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
That's the car
in the driving recorder footage!

278
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,500
Well done, Ayumi!

279
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Yeah!

280
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,400
Dr. Agasa, we must not lose the car.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Got it.

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
This has to be it!

283
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,300
A car chase...

284
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
And then, now that
it has come to this...

285
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,950
(Transformation Button)

286
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,900
(Transformation Button)
Transform!

287
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,800
Clank! Clank!

288
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Shine!

289
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,700
What's that?

290
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,400
Boss...

291
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,500
Finishing move!

292
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,200
Beetle Straight Punch!

293
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,000
Bang!

294
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Boom!

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,100
That didn't happen,

296
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,600
but we quietly followed the car

297
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
and arrived at a parking lot next to
an apartment complex.

298
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,600
What are they doing?

299
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
They're about to steal a car.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,100
This is bad!

301
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
We have to stop them!

302
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,000
I know.

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Will there be a gun fight?

304
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
(Gun Fight)

305
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,200
That's not gonna happen.

306
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,500
But we can't just let them be.

307
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Dr. Agasa, call the police.

308
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,500
Okay. On it.

309
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,500
And Conan headed
towards the robbers.

310
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,300
But still, why were we chased
by the police?

311
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,800
We pretty much
followed the speed limit.

312
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,100
Maybe they found out
it was a stolen car.

313
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,600
I guess that's right.

314
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,900
We did steal that car
this morning, too.

315
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,400
Don't whine about it.

316
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,100
We did get all this jewellery,
after all.

317
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,700
I know, right?

318
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,400
Your plans are always flawless!

319
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,300
But then, why did you
betray Mr. Danno?

320
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,700
Why?

321
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,300
Of course, it's because we'd
get bigger cuts to ourselves!

322
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,600
Who are you?

323
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,900
I see.

324
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
So you were planning to
use him as much as you could

325
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,700
before throwing him
under the bus from the start.

326
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,100
What?

327
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,800
Why is this kid here?

328
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,700
You're the one
who planned this, right?

329
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,300
You asked Mr. Danno to cause some trouble
in a neighbouring town

330
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
so that you could
attack the jewellery store.

331
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,500
Kid, I don't know why you're trying to
look smart and meddle with us,

332
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,300
but it's time for you
to go home and sleep!

333
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,600
The plan of attack on the jewellery store
was simple.

334
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,700
All you needed to do was to
crash a dump truck you stole

335
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,900
at a construction site into the store.

336
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,800
How did you know?

337
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,100
You were watching us, weren't you?

338
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,200
If you were found out by a kid like me,

339
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,600
doesn't that mean your plan failed?

340
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,000
How about I tell you
why your plan failed?

341
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Let us hear it.

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,500
It's because Mr. Danno
saw through your betrayal of him.

343
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I won't say anything bad of you,

344
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,600
so just give up and surrender.

345
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
What do we do, boss?

346
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey kid, you'd better
turn around and go home,

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,900
or you're going to regret it.

348
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,000
I knew you'd do that.

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Dastardly adults like
you deserve to be punished.

350
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Take this!

351
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,700
My finishing shoot!

352
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,400
Bump! Bump!

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Fall...

354
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah...

355
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,900
And thus,
the robbers were rounded up,

356
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,100
and the jewellery was returned
without any problems.

357
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,700
We did it...

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,200
The other guy who was left
at the abandoned factory was also captured.

359
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Just as Conan deducted,

360
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,700
the other culprits hit him
in the head from behind

361
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,100
right after the diversion

362
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,800
so that they could
get bigger cuts to themselves.

363
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,900
(Kaneko Jewellery)

364
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,200
When we returned
the jewellery to the store,

365
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
the owner was really happy.

366
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,000
Officer Takagi promised to
treat us all to a meal again

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,400
as a reward for solving the case.

368
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,600
Yeah...

369
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
It's not my payday yet, though...

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,500
Officer Takagi said it's not
his payday yet, didn't he?

371
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,000
I guess we shouldn't expect
to be treated to a lot of food.

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
That didn't happen,

373
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,100
but we were treated to
a really fancy meal!

374
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,700
All right then, thank you
for the eat-all-you-can meal!

375
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,200
Thank you for the meal...

376
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,500
Seconds, please!

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
It's not eat-all-you-can!
You guys!

378
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
(Next Episode)
Did you see the culprit?

379
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
No...

380
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,000
I didn't see anything.

381
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,500
I don't understand
what he's trying to do at all.

382
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,000
Officer Takagi,

383
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,700
why did he become a police officer
in the first place?

384
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,100
Why can't you say it?

385
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,900
I can't remember what happened.

386
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
If my deduction is correct...

387
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,800
(An Unspeakable Alibi)
Next Conan,

388
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,900
(An Unspeakable Alibi)
An Unspeakable Alibi!

389
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,000
(An Unspeakable Alibi)

390
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,000
"Ballpoint pen"

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
I drew in my illustrated diary again!

393
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Please have mercy on me!

394
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,300
Thank you for the meal again.
