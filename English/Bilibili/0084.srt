1
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.100
A racing second hand,
a broken communication!

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.760
Conan's logic works great on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.550
It's already ski season!
Be wary of chilly crimes!

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.600
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.480
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.179
The Ski Lodge Murder Case (Part 1).

8
00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.209
Winter! And snow-covered
mountains mean skiing!

9
00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.289
And my long-awaited boy-hunt!

10
00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.039
Though, there's only
five or six guys on the slopes

11
00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.209
and they're all with their girlfriends...

12
00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.019
Yeah, the place really is empty...

13
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:01.479
The only untaken guy here is Conan-kun...

14
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.309
Yeah, yeah...

15
00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.789
That's okay,
let's just have fun skiing!

16
00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.279
It's okay for you
since you have Shinichi-kun!

17
00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.239
I've tried my hardest
these past seventeen years,

18
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.159
but nothing good
has ever happened to me...

19
00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.119
Sonoko...

20
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.869
So, you can pay for lunch!

21
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:23.829
Eh?!

22
00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.629
Hey, kittens!

23
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.129
Would you like to ski with us?

24
00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.839
But of course!

25
00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.719
Kittens?!

26
00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.409
We're ski instructors. Right?

27
00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.659
Yep!

28
00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.679
Really?!

29
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.649
Oh? Is that Mori-san and Suzuki-san?

30
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.819
It is you! Good to see you again!

31
00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.539
Yonehara-sensei!

32
00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.989
Oh? You know these girls?!

33
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.449
Yes! They were students of mine
when I taught at Teitan Elementary!

34
00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.369
Oh yeah, I remember
a teacher like her...

35
00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.459
But, you two sure have grown womanly!

36
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.829
And, you're as stunning as
ever with that long hair!

37
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:06.339
Oh, just my hair?

38
00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.959
Yonehara Akiko - (Ran and Sonoko's former teacher)
Oh, just my hair?

39
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.039
Says the thirty year old woman
who could never get married!
Yonehara Akiko - (Ran and Sonoko's former teacher)

40
00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.139
Very funny!
Yonehara Akiko - (Ran and Sonoko's former teacher)

41
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.549
Very funny!

42
00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:19.009
But, what about these
nice instructor friends of yours?

43
00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.969
Instructors?

44
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.889
Instructors, indeed...

45
00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.349
Eh? Grade school teachers?!

46
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:32.459
So, you both work with
Yonehara-sensei at Haido Elementary?

47
00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.199
That's right! They're my coworkers!

48
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.209
The teacher for Class 5-1,
Shimoda-sensei...

49
00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.499
...and boys P.E. instructor,
Sakai-sensei.

50
00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.159
Nice to meet you!

51
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.129
But, grade school teachers trying
to pick up high school girls...

52
00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.839
You two are still so young at heart!

53
00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.159
But nobody uses "kittens" nowadays!

54
00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.289
Where could he be?
Sugiyama-sensei sure is late...

55
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:01.509
Sugiyama-sensei?

56
00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:04.869
A music teacher
who wound up coming, too.

57
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.729
We agreed to meet
here at 2:00, but he's late...

58
00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.289
Do you suppose he went on
ahead to the lodge we're staying at

59
00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.029
so he can scare us?

60
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.739
It's very possible.
He loves that sort of thing.

61
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.039
Would you like to
come to the lodge, too?

62
00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.329
Can we?!

63
00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.959
Hey, now! No seducing my students!

64
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:31.909
Don't worry! We'll drive 'em back
in time for their ski bus home!

65
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:36.089
Hey, are you sure this is the road?!

66
00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:38.469
Oh, a car!

67
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.549
They live here?

68
00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.809
Pardon me! Are there
any lodges around here?

69
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:49.459
Yeah, there's one
halfway up that mountain,

70
00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:51.959
but don't tell me
you're goin' up there?

71
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:52.649
Yeah...

72
00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.209
I wouldn't if I were you.

73
00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:57.609
This area gets pounded
by blizzards every evening!

74
00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:01.069
Turn back while you still can.

75
00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.159
Should we go back?

76
00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.209
But Sugiyama-sensei
might be waiting for us...

77
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:09.039
Ugh! Who booked us
out here, anyway?

78
00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:12.869
Huh? I thought you did.

79
00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:15.539
Not me. Wasn't it you?

80
00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.749
No...

81
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.259
So, was it Yonehara-sensei?

82
00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:18.579
Annual Secret Ski Tour

83
00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:19.959
No.
Annual Secret Ski Tour

84
00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:25.749
I just did what that card I found in
my desk two weeks ago said to do,
Annual Secret Ski Tour

85
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.519
and circled that I would attend.
Annual Secret Ski Tour

86
00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.459
You usually organize our trips,
so I thought you did this one, too...

87
00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:38.239
No. Plus, there was another
note in my desk yesterday...

88
00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:39.159
Yeah!

89
00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.289
A list of the attendees and a map
to the meeting place and lodge!

90
00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.909
I got one, too!
Who could've put them there?

91
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.619
Maybe the person
with the key to the place?

92
00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:54.499
Someone here must have gotten
it from the lodge's owner.

93
00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.039
I have the key. I found it
in my desk yesterday...

94
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.469
So, who rented the car?

95
00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.959
Me. Sugiyama-sensei
called me last night

96
00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.929
and told me to get a rental car.

97
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.849
Then, wasn't he the
one who planned all this?!

98
00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.369
Conan-kun, what're you doing?
Let's go inside!

99
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.859
Right...

100
00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.329
It's so big!

101
00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.619
It was cold out there!

102
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:31.909
Hey! A fireplace!

103
00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.709
Aren't you glad we came, Ran?!

104
00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:37.619
But I don't think we
can leave in this blizzard...

105
00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:44.289
Sorry. I'll phone your parents,
so stay here tonight.

106
00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:44.889
Okay!

107
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.829
But, is it really OK
to rent such a fancy lodge?

108
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:54.899
Let's have Sugiyama-sensei pay,
since he planned this tour!

109
00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.229
Speak of the devil!

110
00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.109
There's our sponsor, Sugiyama-sensei!

111
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.689
Coming, coming!

112
00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:05.159
I got it!

113
00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.329
Sorry for taking so long,
Sugiyama-sensei--

114
00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.159
I see you're all here.

115
00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:15.749
Who's he?

116
00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:18.459
Mori Atsushi (37) - Newspaper Reporter
Just a newshound who these folks

117
00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.089
really helped out three years ago.
Mori Atsushi (37) - Newspaper Reporter

118
00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:22.459
Three years ago?

119
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:24.419
Why are you here?!

120
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:29.389
I got a tip-off that something's
gonna happen here tonight...

121
00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:30.349
Something's...

122
00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.309
...gonna happen...

123
00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:32.769
...here?!

124
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:38.439
I parked in the forest and waited
for you when a blizzard suddenly hit.

125
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.119
I'm coming in for a bit.

126
00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.279
Not so fast...

127
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:45.709
Is that wise? I'll just write,

128
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:52.289
"Haido Elementary Teacher
Throws Reporter Out Into Blizzard."

129
00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:56.079
Let's just be friends.

130
00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:58.539
Huh? Where are
Yonehara-sensei and the others?

131
00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:01.999
Dunno. Everyone
suddenly stopped talking...

132
00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:05.969
And we were having so much fun.
That guy ruined it all!

133
00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:07.289
Suzuki-san.

134
00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:11.299
Forget about him and
help me make everyone's beds.

135
00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:12.999
Okay!

136
00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:18.769
And you two can help
Nakamura-sensei with dinner.

137
00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:20.119
OK!

138
00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:24.229
Say, has Sugiyama-sensei
called or anything yet?

139
00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:30.779
No. I got his machine at home,
so I think he's on his way...

140
00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:35.449
You do that room.

141
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:36.329
Right!

142
00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:43.269
Huh? Nakamura-sensei isn't here...

143
00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:56.999
Is anything wrong, Yonehara-sensei?

144
00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:01.439
Sonoko?!

145
00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:04.289
Teacher! Say something, Teacher!

146
00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:06.359
What's that?

147
00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:07.559
"Mi"...

148
00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:24.419
Sonoko! What's going on?! Open up!

149
00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:26.269
You're in there, right?!

150
00:09:30.749 --> 00:09:33.049
What's wrong?! Sonoko!

151
00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.499
Please! Open your eyes!

152
00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:41.959
You're asleep?

153
00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:42.619
Ow...

154
00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.019
Yonehara-sensei!

155
00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.369
What's all the commotion here?!

156
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:47.889
What happened?!

157
00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:52.359
Eh? Someone attacked you?! Honestly?!

158
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:53.619
Yes.

159
00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:58.289
Someone covered my mouth from
behind while I was making the bed,

160
00:09:58.289 --> 00:10:00.329
and then I felt faint...

161
00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:05.369
Was it this handkerchief?
People on TV do it a lot,

162
00:10:05.369 --> 00:10:09.419
knocking someone out with a
handkerchief soaked in chloroform.

163
00:10:09.869 --> 00:10:11.369
Then, what's the rope for?

164
00:10:11.369 --> 00:10:14.139
She was strangled with
it after she was knocked out.

165
00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:18.619
See? There are
rope marks on her neck.

166
00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:19.679
There's no question about it.

167
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.619
Were you strangled, too?!

168
00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:23.749
I'm not sure.

169
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:28.369
I put up a fight, but I don't know
what happened after I passed out...

170
00:10:28.369 --> 00:10:29.109
A fight?!

171
00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:33.579
Yeah. I even had my
head bashed into the wall!

172
00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:34.319
Just look at this!

173
00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:36.579
What?

174
00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:38.409
What happened to your hand?

175
00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:39.789
My hand?

176
00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.709
What is this?!

177
00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:42.119
"Mi"...

178
00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:44.409
This is lipstick.

179
00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:45.869
Don't tell me my...

180
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:50.339
My lipstick is gone! I had it in here!

181
00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:54.299
Look! There's some
on Sonoko's hand, too!

182
00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:56.259
This one says, "Na..."

183
00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:57.719
"Mi" and "na"?

184
00:10:57.719 --> 00:10:58.969
What do they mean?

185
00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:01.979
"Mi-na-go-ro-shi." (massacre)

186
00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:04.409
A massacre?!

187
00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:07.939
Maybe the culprit
is trying to tell you that?

188
00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:11.749
Good thing nobody died, though.

189
00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:16.409
Now, you won't have to bend
the truth like you did three years ago.

190
00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.369
Eh?

191
00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:20.829
Enough already!
Are you still stuck on that?!

192
00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.159
Besides, I bet you attacked them!

193
00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.999
Get real.

194
00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:30.839
I was in front of the fireplace
when that girl screamed.

195
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:35.379
Anyways, is it really a good idea
to have a brat chase the culprit alone?

196
00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:36.469
Conan-kun!

197
00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:39.119
Perfect! There are still tracks here!

198
00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:40.559
Wait, Conan-kun!

199
00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:41.849
If I follow these...

200
00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:45.139
The front door?!

201
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:49.479
Wait! That means the attacker...

202
00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:51.719
...is still inside!

203
00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:54.119
Sonoko...

204
00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:56.749
She must have inhaled
too much chloroform.

205
00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.289
She'll wake up soon enough.

206
00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:00.789
Ow!

207
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:03.499
Anyways, was the stuff
about the footprints true?

208
00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:06.919
Yes. They went from
the window to the front door.

209
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:10.709
But who says
the attacker made them?

210
00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:12.249
You sure are dumb.

211
00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:15.869
Ran-neechan kicked the door
down 'cause it was locked.

212
00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:16.879
Conan-kun!

213
00:12:17.289 --> 00:12:20.659
That door only locks from the inside,

214
00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:23.459
so the window was the only way out.

215
00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:24.849
That's true...

216
00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:29.189
So, the attacker might've
taken refuge inside the lodge?!

217
00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:33.619
It's probably just
Sugiyama-sensei's doing!

218
00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:38.109
I thought so!
That jerk did all this to scare us!

219
00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:43.369
Get serious! Myself aside,
Suzuki-san has been strangled!

220
00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:45.329
That's too much to be a prank!

221
00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.159
Oh, sorry!

222
00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:52.499
Still, what could
Sugiyama-sensei be thinking?!

223
00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.209
If only he'd show up...

224
00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:58.969
I bet he can't come
out now that it's not funny!

225
00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.539
And what about you two?!

226
00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:04.429
Where were you when there
were two women being attacked?!

227
00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:07.869
Don't blame me. I was takin' a bath.

228
00:13:07.869 --> 00:13:11.649
I was in my room listening
to music on my headphones!

229
00:13:12.289 --> 00:13:14.619
Could you watch Suzuki-san?

230
00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:17.069
If she gets attacked again,
bust out your karate!

231
00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:18.529
Right!

232
00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:26.539
Nakamura-sensei's shoes are wet...

233
00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:29.869
Say, Nakamura-sensei.
Where were you earlier?

234
00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:31.619
You weren't in the kitchen...

235
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:35.079
Oh, the gas wasn't coming out,

236
00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:37.589
so I went out the back
to check the gas tanks.

237
00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.499
Anyways, where's dinner?

238
00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:44.159
Just wait a little more.
It's cooking right now.

239
00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:45.969
Smells like curry!

240
00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:49.599
I'll finish making the beds until then.

241
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.409
I'll be in the bath!

242
00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:54.789
I guess I'll go check on dinner!

243
00:13:54.789 --> 00:13:57.029
Planning to filch some food, are we?

244
00:13:57.579 --> 00:14:01.449
Thanks for making me some, too.

245
00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:04.709
No problem. There was
an extra helping, anyways...

246
00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:08.159
But, I'll never forget what
happened three years ago.

247
00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.119
Is that so?

248
00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.749
Say, what's this "three years ago" stuff?

249
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:16.589
You needn't worry about it, little boy!

250
00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:19.789
Oh? Those two didn't eat?

251
00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:22.709
She said they'll eat when
Sonoko-chan wakes up.

252
00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:25.799
Oh. We sure have
inconvenienced her...

253
00:14:28.249 --> 00:14:29.519
Who could that be?

254
00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.369
Maybe it's Sugiyama-sensei?!

255
00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:33.139
That jerk...

256
00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:36.619
Alright, Sugiyama!
We know you're in here!

257
00:14:36.619 --> 00:14:39.109
Quit sneaking around
and get out-- Eh?

258
00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:44.459
Yes. We're all right.
The heater's working.

259
00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:46.749
That was the lodge's owner.

260
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:50.829
It was snowing, so he was worried
if the heater was working or not.

261
00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:55.249
How odd. There's definitely
something going on in this lodge...

262
00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:57.709
Looks like I'll need to investigate!

263
00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:00.879
First, is the incident three years
ago everybody's tight-lipped about!

264
00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:04.119
Where are you going, little boy?!

265
00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:06.049
Just the bathroom!

266
00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:10.289
Huh? I'm sure I brought it...

267
00:15:10.289 --> 00:15:11.019
Found it!

268
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.229
The professor's Earring Cell Phone!

269
00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:17.189
Let's see, the professor's number is...

270
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:21.649
Eh? An incident at Haido
Elementary three years ago?

271
00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:23.709
Just look into it!

272
00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:25.659
But how?

273
00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:28.319
There should be case files
in my dad's study!

274
00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:31.789
Just hurry! I got a
bad feeling about this!

275
00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:33.669
If we don't hurry,
someone else might--

276
00:15:39.209 --> 00:15:40.589
Coming!

277
00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:45.629
I knew it was you, Sugiyama-sensei!

278
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:48.119
The music teacher has arrived!

279
00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:49.849
Don't scare us like that!

280
00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:52.809
What're ya doin'?
Come inside already!

281
00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:10.444
Hey! What's wrong?!
Sugiyama-sensei! Say something!

282
00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:12.774
Sugiyama-sensei!

283
00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:16.864
It's no use. He's passed away...

284
00:16:17.114 --> 00:16:19.534
But how...

285
00:16:19.534 --> 00:16:21.694
Don't tell me he froze to death?!

286
00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:23.034
No.

287
00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:25.864
This man was murdered.

288
00:16:25.864 --> 00:16:26.474
Eh?!

289
00:16:26.474 --> 00:16:27.834
Strangled.

290
00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:31.074
See this rope mark?

291
00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.924
Plus, the body's stiff.

292
00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:36.154
Isn't that called rigor mortis?

293
00:16:36.154 --> 00:16:37.284
Yes...

294
00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:41.764
Though that means he was
killed over nine hours ago...

295
00:16:42.154 --> 00:16:48.484
The fact that his body rang the
bell means someone set him there...

296
00:16:49.154 --> 00:16:54.404
But, we were all eating
by the fireplace when it rang...

297
00:16:54.404 --> 00:16:57.694
That means the killer isn't one of us!

298
00:16:58.154 --> 00:16:59.944
Who, then?!

299
00:16:59.944 --> 00:17:04.864
Probably the one who attacked
Yonehara-sensei and Sonoko-neechan.

300
00:17:04.864 --> 00:17:05.414
What?!

301
00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.824
Look at the "ko" on his hand!

302
00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:12.334
He has a letter written
in lipstick just like they did!

303
00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:18.554
Yonehara-sensei had "mi" and
Sonoko-neechan had "na", which makes:

304
00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:20.514
"Mi-na-ko."

305
00:17:23.824 --> 00:17:25.224
What is it, Shimoda-sensei?!

306
00:17:25.224 --> 00:17:26.154
Don't touch me!

307
00:17:26.154 --> 00:17:29.144
I got nothing to do with it! Nothing!

308
00:17:35.244 --> 00:17:38.114
Shimoda-sensei!
It's Yonehara! Open the door!

309
00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:40.074
Shut up! Leave me alone!

310
00:17:40.364 --> 00:17:41.874
Nothing we can do.

311
00:17:41.874 --> 00:17:44.364
Let's wait until he cools down.

312
00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.274
For now, let's call the police!

313
00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.244
Right!

314
00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:49.704
Someone was murdered?!

315
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:54.654
Yes, we found Sugiyama-sensei's
body leaning by the front door...

316
00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:56.324
What about the killer?!

317
00:17:56.324 --> 00:18:01.424
They could've snuck inside while
we were all gathered at the door...

318
00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:06.784
Don't worry. Sakai-sensei is
calling the police as we speak...

319
00:18:06.784 --> 00:18:08.114
It's no good!

320
00:18:08.114 --> 00:18:10.654
They said it's too dangerous
to send cars in the blizzard,

321
00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:14.654
so we gotta wait until it
dies down in the morning!

322
00:18:15.074 --> 00:18:16.244
Oh, no!

323
00:18:16.244 --> 00:18:19.324
So, they want us to sit
here until morning?!

324
00:18:19.324 --> 00:18:21.864
When the killer could still be inside...

325
00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:27.334
Why did all this have to happen?
It was such a fun ski tour...

326
00:18:27.824 --> 00:18:30.164
If only he were here now...

327
00:18:30.164 --> 00:18:30.784
Eh?

328
00:18:30.784 --> 00:18:33.794
I mean Shinichi! Don't you remember?

329
00:18:34.324 --> 00:18:38.494
He's the one who found
everyone's lunch money

330
00:18:38.494 --> 00:18:40.654
when I lost it in 4th grade!

331
00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:47.404
Oh, that cheeky runt from the class
next door who acted like a detective?

332
00:18:47.404 --> 00:18:49.564
Excuse me for being cheeky...

333
00:18:50.034 --> 00:18:53.154
He's a high school detective now!

334
00:18:53.154 --> 00:18:56.774
Come to think of it, I did see him
in the papers. I think his name was--

335
00:18:56.774 --> 00:18:58.694
Kudo Shinichi.

336
00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:03.954
A brilliant sixteen year old detective
who handled unsolvable cases...

337
00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:09.994
He was pretty good for a kid,
so I was gonna do a feature on him,

338
00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:12.744
but there's been no word on him lately.

339
00:19:12.744 --> 00:19:16.374
Rumor has it he croaked after
poking his nose into some case.

340
00:19:16.374 --> 00:19:19.534
How rude! Shinichi is ali--

341
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.444
What do you want, anyway?!

342
00:19:24.444 --> 00:19:27.074
I just came to warn you

343
00:19:27.074 --> 00:19:31.684
to not take your eyes off that
guy holed up in his room upstairs...

344
00:19:31.684 --> 00:19:36.654
If my reporter's instinct
is right, he'll be next to go.

345
00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:42.944
But, the more casualties, the better
the article and the better for me.

346
00:19:43.694 --> 00:19:46.694
Yeah, right. The upstairs
windows don't open,

347
00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:50.454
and he won't get
attacked if he's holed up.

348
00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:56.614
But, he is a bit agitated.
It's dangerous to leave him alone!

349
00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.674
Let's give him some coffee to calm down.

350
00:19:59.404 --> 00:20:05.574
Nakamura-sensei and I will
make some, so you go be with him.

351
00:20:05.574 --> 00:20:06.344
Right.

352
00:20:06.744 --> 00:20:10.974
Be extra careful!
The killer could be hiding inside!

353
00:20:10.974 --> 00:20:13.934
I'm dead! I'm dead!

354
00:20:14.324 --> 00:20:16.694
Someone's gonna kill me!

355
00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:22.274
Here you are, Mori-san!
Coffee and cocoa!

356
00:20:22.994 --> 00:20:24.284
Thank you...

357
00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:25.994
Oh? Where's that boy?

358
00:20:25.994 --> 00:20:28.614
Huh? Wasn't he with you?

359
00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:31.704
An outside job... Or was it?

360
00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:36.534
When the doorbell rang, everyone was
together but Ran and Sonoko,

361
00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:40.714
so it was definitely someone
else who placed the body here...

362
00:20:42.444 --> 00:20:46.744
Huh? Only that part of
the railing is missing snow...

363
00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:48.434
Did someone get on it?

364
00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:52.074
What's with that groove?

365
00:20:52.074 --> 00:20:53.644
There's one on the other side!

366
00:20:55.074 --> 00:20:57.394
Could this have been--

367
00:20:57.694 --> 00:20:59.104
Found you!

368
00:20:59.104 --> 00:21:01.994
You know, you shouldn't wander around!

369
00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:04.494
Go back to your room and get in bed!

370
00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:07.944
Shut up! Leave me alone!

371
00:21:07.944 --> 00:21:09.004
What's going on?

372
00:21:09.004 --> 00:21:12.154
Shimoda-sensei won't let me in.

373
00:21:12.154 --> 00:21:16.454
Then let's leave him alone,
lock our rooms,

374
00:21:16.454 --> 00:21:18.034
and get some rest until morning.

375
00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:22.924
It's the professor!

376
00:21:24.244 --> 00:21:26.574
Hey, Professor. Figure anything out?

377
00:21:26.574 --> 00:21:28.634
Yes, I finally found the file.

378
00:21:29.404 --> 00:21:32.824
Three years ago, a girl hanged
herself in the volleyball room

379
00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.614
at Haido Elementary.

380
00:21:34.614 --> 00:21:35.654
A suicide?

381
00:21:35.654 --> 00:21:38.104
Seems the cause was "exam neurosis."

382
00:21:38.404 --> 00:21:42.154
As a result, the blame
was focused on her teacher.

383
00:21:42.154 --> 00:21:43.744
What was the teacher's name?!

384
00:21:43.744 --> 00:21:47.694
It's not listed here,
but the girl's name is...

385
00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:51.114
Haido Elementary,
Class 6-2, Mochizuki Minako.

386
00:21:51.114 --> 00:21:52.074
Minako?!

387
00:21:52.074 --> 00:21:54.154
Does it mention anything else?!

388
00:21:54.154 --> 00:21:56.894
What're you doing there,
Conan-kun?

389
00:21:58.034 --> 00:21:59.364
What is that?

390
00:21:59.364 --> 00:22:00.534
Hello?

391
00:22:00.534 --> 00:22:03.424
Huh? That's the professor.
Is this a phone?

392
00:22:03.904 --> 00:22:05.404
Hey, Shinichi!

393
00:22:05.404 --> 00:22:07.154
Shinichi?

394
00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:08.884
Is Shinichi there, Professor?!

395
00:22:08.884 --> 00:22:10.844
Eh?! Ran-kun!

396
00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:17.034
Upstairs... Oh, crap!

397
00:23:43.735 --> 00:23:44.474
What is it?!

398
00:23:44.474 --> 00:23:45.528
What happened?!

399
00:23:45.528 --> 00:23:47.489
It's Shimoda-sensei!

400
00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:50.742
Wait!

401
00:23:50.742 --> 00:23:53.444
Not here! Not here! Not here!

402
00:23:53.784 --> 00:23:59.624
If it's not hidden anywhere,
that means the killer still has the rope!

403
00:23:59.624 --> 00:24:02.034
One of them...

404
00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:07.228
The killer... is you!

405
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.174
On the next Conan:
"The Ski Lodge Murder Case (Part 2)."
