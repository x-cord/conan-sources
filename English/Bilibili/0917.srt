00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,070
"National High School Spring Kendo Tournament"

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,870
Ran and I came to the Toto Gymnasium to cheer on Hattori,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,470
who traveled to Tokyo for a kendo tournament.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,370
But while there, we came across a murder.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,670
Furthermore, at the crime scene...

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,670
Who are you?

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,570
Who? Me?

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,370
I'm Kyoto Senshin High School student,

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,370
Soshi Okita.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,470
Hattori.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,070
Maybe I misheard you,

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,470
but did you just say something about winning the tournament?

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,870
You think you'll beat me?

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,870
Of course, idiot!

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,770
Then we don't need to wait until the match.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,970
Why don't we settle this here?

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,070
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,070
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,870
Heiji and Okita, Kazuha and Ran.

20
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,070
How will the case and their contest end?

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,870
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:54,211 --> 00:03:00,011
"Kendo Tournament of Love and Mystery (Part 2)"

25
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,711
Now that I've caught you...

26
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,711
you're not getting away.

27
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,811
"Soshi Okita, Kyoto Senshin High School Second-Year" -No.

28
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:14,611
It is me who have come to find you.

29
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,711
Come and get me.

30
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,111
My throat's wide open.

31
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:21,511
You're exposing your left shoulder.

32
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:24,111
The tip of your sword is low and to the back.

33
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:28,811
That's the Yagyu Shinkage-ryu cleaving stance.

34
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,711
In that case...

35
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,911
That's the Tennen Rishin-ryu hiraseigan stance.

36
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:42,711
Your blade is sharply inclined as you aim for your opponent's left eye.

37
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:45,011
Shut up already.

38
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:48,011
If you want me to hit you, I will!

39
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:50,911
Hold it!

40
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:56,411
I wish I could keep watching,

41
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,711
but I can't let you mess up the crime scene anymore than you have.

42
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:05,411
But if you can solve this case by the time the matches resume,

43
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,911
then we won't have to cancel the tournament.

44
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,311
Really?

45
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,211
Wait, Officer Sato.

46
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,411
Why not?

47
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,511
Those three are

48
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,411
"Tsuneyuki Yokote, Akane Sadamori, Nenji Norimura" -our only suspects.

49
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,711
Besides,

50
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,311
it seems like there's something romantic about this tournament.

51
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,711
Hey...

52
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,111
Excuse me.

53
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,811
Could I go to the bathroom?

54
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:30,611
It doesn't look like I can use that one.

55
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,211
Sure.

56
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,211
We've already asked you all our questions.

57
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,211
In that case, excuse me.

58
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,811
I want to know

59
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,011
who is Hattori's opponent?

60
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,911
Will he make it to the finals?

61
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,311
And will Hattori be able to win

62
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:49,711
and confess his feelings to Kazuha?

63
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:55,711
So, did you find a box cutter in the bathroom?

64
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,611
No, not yet.

65
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,411
Then we'll be checking your belongings.

66
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,911
We'll start with your sword bag.

67
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:04,211
Okay.

68
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,911
"Toto Gymnasium" -Why did you bring your sword bag to the bathroom?

69
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,311
The same reason as these boys.

70
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,711
I have a match tomorrow,

71
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,311
so I was going to do some practice swings

72
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,211
after using the bathroom.

73
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,711
I see.

74
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,211
Well?

75
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:22,711
We took apart the two swords that were in the bag.

76
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,311
We didn't find a box cutter.

77
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:29,311
We were curious about this thing

78
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,511
"Black Ink" -that was in the bag though.

79
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:32,911
Black ink?

80
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:34,611
Why do you have this?

81
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:39,011
Since I'm a referee, I keep a spare bottle on hand.

82
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,511
At this tournament, we paint over the name of the losers.

83
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,111
Let's see.

84
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,711
Hattori's opponent in the finals is...

85
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,011
"Kurahiko Namakoshi" -There.

86
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,211
It's Kurahiko Namakoshi.

87
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,911
Hey, Namakoshi.

88
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,211
You should forfeit if your leg is cramping.

89
00:05:57,211 --> 00:06:01,411
I'm okay. I'll win in two more games.

90
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,611
But you're up against Kaiho Academy's Hattori next.

91
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,711
Yeah.

92
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:09,511
You've never beaten Hattori before.

93
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:12,211
Sounds like he'll make it to the finals.

94
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:16,711
So who's Okita's opponent?

95
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,411
There it is. They're representing Tokyo, huh?

96
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,811
Wait, what's with this guy?

97
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:24,711
His name sounds really strong.

98
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:30,011
There isn't a box cutter in my backpack.

99
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:31,911
Huh?

100
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,011
This chocolate is melted.

101
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,111
You're right.

102
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:38,111
Just the ones on the edge are really melted.

103
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:41,811
It's because I had it in my jacket's inside pocket.

104
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,811
My body heat must've melted it.

105
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,911
Let's see.

106
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:49,411
Okita's opponent is from Tokyo, so...

107
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,111
Excuse me.

108
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,811
"Onimaru"

109
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,411
This name...

110
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:00,411
He's Okita's opponent.

111
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:02,111
Are you all right?

112
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:03,911
Yes.

113
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,211
Onimaru!

114
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:10,111
Is it true that you're forfeiting your final match?

115
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,811
What? Forfeiting?

116
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:17,111
Yes. Something came up and I must go home.

117
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,211
What came up?

118
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:23,411
The governor of Tokyo wants to make me an honorary citizen.

119
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,311
He's at my home right now.

120
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,111
That's incredible.

121
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,011
I thought only the elderly were given that title,

122
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,111
but it's not inconceivable

123
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,311
since you've won two consecutive national tournaments at your age.

124
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:38,511
I don't believe I'm worthy of that title yet.

125
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,311
I'm going home to reject his offer.

126
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,511
What a waste.

127
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:44,911
Don't worry. I'll participate in my semi-final match.

128
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,811
It's someone I've been wanting to fight.

129
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,411
I see...

130
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:51,711
Two consecutive national tournament wins?

131
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:55,711
That means he's the strongest kendo swordsman in Japan, right?

132
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,711
And since he won't fight in the finals

133
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,411
even if he wins his semi-final match,

134
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:05,111
"Winner" -if Hattori fights, he'll win automatically!

135
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,011
What's Heiji doing?

136
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,511
His match is starting in 20 minutes.

137
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,611
It's from Ran.

138
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,311
Congratulations?

139
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,011
Heiji hasn't won yet.

140
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,011
Iori, how did it go?

141
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,611
As we expected.

142
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:31,111
Then let's watch as my future husband

143
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,311
takes first place.

144
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,611
"Toto Gymnasium"

145
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:39,011
You seem to like taking pictures.

146
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,011
Yeah, I guess.

147
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:45,111
But the month's almost over, and you've hardly taken any.

148
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,111
-What? -Last month and the month before that,

149
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,111
you took close to 200 pictures.

150
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,511
I can do what I want!

151
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:54,811
Someone's calling.

152
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,811
I'm answering it.

153
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,811
Hello?

154
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,411
Huh? This isn't Tsuneyuki's phone?

155
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:06,911
Are you the girl who likes cutters that Tsuneyuki said he met?

156
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,311
Cutters?

157
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,411
As in those big sailboats.

158
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:15,411
I've been into sailboats recently.

159
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,211
It's got nothing to do with the murder weapon!

160
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,611
Didn't this old man hear the culprit mention box cutters?

161
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:25,711
Now that I think about it, I think they said "cutter."

162
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,511
-Give me a break. -Cutter?

163
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:32,711
None of them had a box cutter though.

164
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,711
And we didn't find one in the victim's bag.

165
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,611
No. Inside the bag,

166
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,911
we found a wallet, a towel, a phone, a magazine,

167
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:46,211
an empty bag of stomach medicine and the box it came in.

168
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,811
There are still traces of that medicine around his mouth.

169
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:53,511
His throat must have been cut right after he took it.

170
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:58,711
But we have to find that box cutter.

171
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,211
You're right.

172
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:04,011
Did you hear any strange noises inside the bathroom?

173
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:07,111
Like the blade of a box cutter being broken.

174
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:11,411
Speaking of noises, I heard rustling outside the bathroom.

175
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,211
That was probably the sound of them

176
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,911
throwing the armor out the bathroom window.

177
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,011
I heard that, too.

178
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:24,011
I heard a scratching sound after that.

179
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,711
I heard it, too.

180
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:27,711
So did I.

181
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,511
In any case,

182
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:34,611
they cut the throat of a ranked swordsman with a single blow.

183
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,811
As another ranked swordsman,

184
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:38,711
that makes you the most suspicious.

185
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:40,411
But...

186
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,511
Don't be so sure.

187
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,611
If they were wearing this outfit,

188
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,911
maybe he thought they were a student in the tournament

189
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:50,411
and let his guard down?

190
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,611
Okita!

191
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:53,411
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,511
That's evidence!

193
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:58,011
Yeah, but I was curious.

194
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:01,111
See? There's blood on the thigh armor,

195
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,111
but none on the gauntlets.

196
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,511
And there's some on the butt of the skirt.

197
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:08,511
Don't you think that's weird?

198
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:10,311
You're right.

199
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:14,611
Oh, right. I knew I recognized this old man.

200
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:18,511
He was the referee for my quarter-final match.

201
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,811
Really?

202
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:23,211
Yeah. He crashed into the guy I knocked back with my sword

203
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:24,811
and was bleeding from his nose.

204
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,911
A nosebleed?

205
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,811
I remembered something.

206
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,511
It was the way he spoke.

207
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,011
The hoarse-voiced man, who told their friend

208
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,411
to bring them another box cutter,

209
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:38,511
spoke with a Kansai accent like you boys.

210
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,411
What?

211
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,711
Hey, you.

212
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,711
You said the victim's wife was on her way.

213
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,911
Is she bringing him a change of clothes?

214
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:50,111
Yeah, she said she was.

215
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,711
What about a change of clothes?

216
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,011
Sorry, Kudo.

217
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:57,011
This case is mine.

218
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:08,678
Ten minutes until the semi-finals start.

219
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:09,878
We don't have a choice.

220
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:12,078
Could you have them cancel the tournament

221
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,678
and bring the tournament organizer here?

222
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:15,678
Got it.

223
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:17,678
Hold on.

224
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,278
In ten more minutes, we'll get more than our money's worth.

225
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:22,078
More than our money's worth?

226
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:24,378
Does that mean you know who did it?

227
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,578
Yeah.

228
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,778
In that case, I've figured it out, too.

229
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:32,278
Since we can't find the murder weapon,

230
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,278
the killer is...

231
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,578
that old man!

232
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,878
Huh?

233
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:42,778
What? How'd he kill someone when he's blind?

234
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,678
Isn't it obvious?

235
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:47,378
That's a sword cane.

236
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:50,778
He senses his opponent like Zatoichi

237
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:54,578
and slashed his throat with a backhanded slice.

238
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,878
Well, sir? Am I right?

239
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,778
Say, "What an awful way to live."

240
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,978
Say it and I'll forgive you.

241
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:05,678
Hattori, is this guy an idiot?

242
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,478
Sorry, it's just how he is.

243
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,678
So, do you know who did it?

244
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,978
No. What I do know is

245
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:18,378
the victim, Mr. Nukitani, had some kind of beverage in his bag,

246
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:21,878
but after he was killed, someone took it out.

247
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,678
And that person who took it

248
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:28,278
was probably former Self-Defense Force official, Ms. Akane Sadamori.

249
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:32,178
What makes you think that?

250
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,078
Because Mr. Nukitani took a powdered medicine

251
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,178
just before he was killed,

252
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,578
but he doesn't have a beverage on him.

253
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:43,278
Since the chocolate in Ms. Sadamori's bag was melted,

254
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,178
she probably had a plastic bottle containing a warm beverage inside it.

255
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:50,678
I told you, I was keeping the chocolate in my inside pocket.

256
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:53,778
Then wouldn't all of it be melted?

257
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:55,578
Wasn't only the edge melted

258
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:59,178
because you poisoned a warm beverage

259
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,178
and were keeping it in your bag

260
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,678
until you could give it to Mr. Nukitani?

261
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:05,978
That's why you were hiding in the bathroom.

262
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,578
So you could erase the evidence of your attempt to poison him.

263
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,278
It wasn't poison, it was laxatives!

264
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,978
I just wanted to inconvenience Mr. Nukitani

265
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,878
since he rejected my love!

266
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:18,778
I thought he'd be in the bathroom so I came to check on him,

267
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,378
but he'd already been killed.

268
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,378
I retrieved the plastic bottle

269
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,478
so I wouldn't be suspected of murder.

270
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,478
It's true. You have to believe me.

271
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,678
I don't think she did it.

272
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:31,378
If she was in a kendo club,

273
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:34,478
she'd know how to put on a skirt.

274
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:38,678
It seems like the killer wore the skirt backwards.

275
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,078
Then we're all innocent.

276
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,078
I used to practice kendo, too.

277
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:46,378
Did you really, Mr. Yokote?

278
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:49,478
You didn't even know you're not supposed to strike victory poses

279
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,278
during a kendo match.

280
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:56,278
Isn't that right, Mr. Referee?

281
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,678
Huh? Yeah.

282
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:01,178
It says to in the referee's rules.

283
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,578
I see.

284
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,378
Mr. Nukitani pointed out your lie

285
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:07,178
when you bragged to your girlfriend

286
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,278
about striking a victory pose after winning a match.

287
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,778
You resented him for the embarrassment he caused you.

288
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,678
Yeah. I thought I'd embarrass him, too,

289
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:21,078
so I followed and secretly photographed him.

290
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,978
Since that woman headed to the same bathroom as him,

291
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:27,178
I thought they might be having a tryst and came to check it out,

292
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,378
but this is how I found him.

293
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,478
I wanted to get out of here,

294
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:33,578
but those kids showed up,

295
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:37,978
so I was deleting my photos of him inside the bathroom.

296
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,178
That's why you had hardly any photos this month?

297
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,878
Yeah.

298
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:47,378
But Mr. Yokote doesn't have a box cutter.

299
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,678
But, Conan...

300
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:52,978
That's right. I don't have a box cutter

301
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,278
and I practiced kendo for a little while,

302
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,878
so I know how to wear a skirt.

303
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:00,278
Then why don't you put on that thigh armor?

304
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,378
Yeah, sure.

305
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:07,778
I think you cross these long straps in the back,

306
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:11,678
tie it in the front, and... it's done.

307
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:12,778
Wrong.

308
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,678
You're supposed to tie it under the front to hide the knot.

309
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:18,378
-What? -See?

310
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,478
When you tie it correctly,

311
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,578
you can see the blood on the front of the armor.

312
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:24,978
In other words, someone who knew how to wear the armor

313
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:27,478
deliberately put on the skirt backwards

314
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:31,178
to make it look like the work of someone with no kendo experience.

315
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,078
Among the three of you, the only one who'd need to do that is

316
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,878
the man dressed as a referee who's obviously a ranked swordsman,

317
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,978
Mr. Nenji Norimura.

318
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:44,678
You're the only one.

319
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:50,278
No way! You still haven't found Heiji?

320
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,078
But his match starts in less than five minutes.

321
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,878
Ran and Conan are missing, too.

322
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:59,778
Maybe they know where Heiji is.

323
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:03,878
"Incoming Call. Kazuha."

324
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:06,278
Kazuha's calling.

325
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:07,978
If I tell her where Hattori is,

326
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:10,578
she's sure to come here.

327
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,578
But until the crime is solved,

328
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,378
we can't afford to lose even a second.

329
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:20,778
But didn't the killer use a box cutter?

330
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,078
I don't have one either.

331
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,978
We had it all wrong.

332
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:26,978
What?

333
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:30,978
Isn't this what the victim, Mr. Nukitani, actually said

334
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,578
while talking to someone on the phone?

335
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:36,578
"This cutter is bloody and useless."

336
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,578
"Bring me another one."

337
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:41,878
That's exactly right.

338
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,378
There's nothing strange about that.

339
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:49,878
In Kansai, a cutter refers to what you call a dress shirt.

340
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:52,678
In other words, he said, "My nose bled on my dress shirt

341
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,978
and I can't wear it anymore."

342
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:58,578
"Bring me a new dress shirt."

343
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,778
That's it. That's why Mr. Nukitani's wife is

344
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:05,078
on his way here to bring him a fresh dress shirt.

345
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:06,278
Yeah.

346
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,578
"Black Ink" -Though even if his nose hadn't bled on it,

347
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,978
you probably meant to spill ink on Mr. Nukitani's shirt

348
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:14,178
so he'd come here.

349
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,078
But what about the weapon?

350
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,178
I don't have a blade.

351
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:22,278
You're carrying it.

352
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:25,178
You're saying I cut a man's throat with a bamboo sword?

353
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,978
Not an assembled sword.

354
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:33,378
If you sharpen a single piece of bamboo and swing it horizontally,

355
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,078
the centrifugal force can cut a person's throat.

356
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:38,878
I know someone who cut his neck on a sword he parried.

357
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:42,578
It wouldn't stop bleeding.

358
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:46,778
Yeah. The neck is the weakest part of the body.

359
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:49,478
The scratching sound heard in the bathroom

360
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:55,178
was you dulling the pointed tip against the wall.

361
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:59,078
Which means...

362
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:05,378
Mr. Nukitani's blood must be stuck to the inside of your sword bag.

363
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,478
We're going to check your bag.

364
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,978
Okay.

365
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,478
I'm sure you'll find some,

366
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:15,078
even though I tried to wash it in the bathroom.

367
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,978
Sorry, Kudo.

368
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,578
I'm the star this time.

369
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,778
How frustrating.

370
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:25,878
But why a bamboo sword?

371
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,278
Wouldn't a blade have been better?

372
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:31,278
That bamboo sword was my son's.

373
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:32,378
What?

374
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:36,978
Two years ago, Mr. Nukitani drove him to suicide.

375
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:38,778
He drove him to suicide?

376
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,978
Two years ago during this tournament's team match finals,

377
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,778
my son won a decisive bout,

378
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:45,978
but he accidentally struck a victory pose,

379
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,678
and his victory was invalidated.

380
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:51,878
Their opponents made a comeback and my son's team was eliminated.

381
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:54,778
My son had a strong sense of responsibility.

382
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,578
Unable to withstand the humiliation,

383
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,978
he took his own life.

384
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:03,378
That match was refereed by Mr. Nukitani!

385
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:06,778
But according to the rules, it couldn't be helped.

386
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:12,378
Yes. I thought Mr. Nukitani made the right call, too.

387
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,578
Until I saw him ignore the victory pose

388
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:19,578
struck by Kyoto Senshin High School's second man

389
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,478
during yesterday's team match finals!

390
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,778
I see.

391
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,878
Yeah. Not only did he not invalidate his victory,

392
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:29,178
but he gave the student a pep talk!

393
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:32,978
He showed favoritism since they're both from Kansai!

394
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:37,278
So I killed that biased man

395
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,678
with my son's bamboo sword!

396
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:45,578
He was probably holding this good luck charm.

397
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,778
A good luck charm?

398
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,078
That first-year second man said he really wanted to win,

399
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:53,078
so I let him borrow my good luck charm.

400
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:57,078
This Hachidai Shrine charm's been in my family for generations.

401
00:20:57,078 --> 00:21:00,078
I've never lost while wearing it.

402
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:01,578
After winning his match,

403
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:04,578
he noticed it sticking out of his uniform.

404
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:06,878
While putting it back, he said he thanked god

405
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,178
while holding it with tears in his eyes.

406
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:12,478
Maybe you mistook that for a fist pump.

407
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:13,878
You're lying.

408
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,278
It's true.

409
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:19,278
Apparently the referee told him not to cry during a match.

410
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,678
You're lying...

411
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,778
You're lying!

412
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,878
She's so strong.

413
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,678
What are you doing? Hurry!

414
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,478
Hey, wait.

415
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:44,778
The charm.

416
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:09,378
Kazuha, I brought him!

417
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:11,378
Ran...

418
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,678
The match is over.

419
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:15,178
Victory by default!

420
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,678
-What? -Where have you been?

421
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:20,878
Heiji, you idiot!

422
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,778
Shall we go?

423
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,478
You're not going to meet Mr. Hattori?

424
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:29,378
I'd like to meet my future husband

425
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:33,078
under better circumstances.

426
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,578
This is because you took your sweet time solving that mystery.

427
00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:41,478
You idiot, you slowed me down with your nonsense about Zatoichi.

428
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:45,578
Solving? Were you sticking your nose into some case again?

429
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,378
I can't stand detectives.

430
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:52,478
What an awful way to live.

431
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,178
"Next Episode"

432
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,678
Genta!

433
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:02,478
No one's escaped from my mini-patrol car on these streets before!

434
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:06,278
I'm hungry.

435
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:10,878
-Genta! -Genta!

436
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:14,178
Darn it. My tracking glasses aren't working.

437
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:16,278
His badge must be broken.

438
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:20,378
Next Conan,

439
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:24,378
"The Mini-Patrol Car Police's Big Chase"

440
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,421
Ready, and...

441
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,521
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,421
"Yumi and Naeko"

443
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,221
Once again, you're an idiot, Heiji!

444
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,421
This time you truly were an idiot.
