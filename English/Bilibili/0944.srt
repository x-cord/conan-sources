You're lucky it was just a scratch.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,570
We were worried, you know.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,970
We heard you were taken to the hospital.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,570
Sorry, sorry.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,170
That Kagura guy protected me.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,970
It was unfortunate for the both of us.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,570
But because of me, your arm...

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,570
It's not your fault.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,470
Don't worry about it.

"Sumito Kagura (26)" -Besides, I might be able to use this.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,770
Use this?

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,670
So, did they catch the culprit?

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,470
No, not yet.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,870
Darn it. Who would do something like that?

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,970
Either way, they sure did cause a lot of trouble.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,670
All the patients here were collateral damage, right?

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,270
Yeah.

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,870
That Otsubo guy lives in Aobadai.

"Kikuhide Otsubo (33)" -That's pretty far away, right?

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,770
I happened to come to Beika City,

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,170
and look what happened to me.

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,470
I'm so unlucky.

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,770
How truly unfortunate for you.

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,870
Hey, Kagura.

26
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,170
Are you okay?

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,270
Kochiyama, Haruka. You guys came.

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,270
Who called us to come visit him?

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,070
"Go Kochiyama (26)" -Right, Haruka?

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,870
"Haruka Ibe (24)" -Yeah. You sounded like you were about to cry.

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,770
I broke my arm. Look.

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,770
You're really unlucky.

33
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,770
But I'm going to be compensated again.

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,870
Again? In that case...

35
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,370
Smile, Kagura.

36
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,170
Look happy.

37
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,970
I'll earn more likes for you.

38
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,570
There you go again.

39
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,570
You guys are hopeless, Kagura and Kochiyama.

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,270
What's wrong with these people?

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,770
He suffered an injury.

Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,770
Injured as part of collateral damage

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,970
for a hilariously strange reason.

00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,969
"Yotsubishi Bank"

51
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:13,769
It started with a phone call made to this bank.

52
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,769
Hello, this is the Yotsubishi Bank Beika branch.

53
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:23,469
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

54
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,869
They'll all explode in one minute.

55
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,169
Evacuate the building!

56
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,069
Shocked by the threat,

57
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,669
the bank told all customers and employees to evacuate.

58
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:40,469
However, the panicked customers caused collateral damage

59
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:44,269
to the people who happened to be passing by in front of the bank.

60
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,269
Pushed to the ground by the people rushing out of the bank,

61
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:52,269
Genta and several others were injured and taken to the hospital.

62
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,369
The phone used to place the call

63
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:01,169
was determined to be a public phone near the bank.

64
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,769
Because there was no explosion

65
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,769
and not a single explosive was found,

66
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:09,069
it was thought to be a prank.

67
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,869
Though the bank promised to cover their medical expenses

68
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:18,069
and compensate the victims,

69
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,069
it was an unfortunate incident for everyone involved nonetheless.

70
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,369
However...

71
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:28,269
You three seem unusually happy.

72
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,569
But I mean...

73
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:31,669
Right?

74
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:32,969
Yeah.

75
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,869
Kagura suffered collateral damage about half a month ago.

76
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,369
I was out hiking alone.

77
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,569
I suffered collateral damage from an unexploded bomb.

78
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,269
I remember that.

79
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,969
So you were the victim who suffered collateral damage.

80
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,969
Unlucky, right?

81
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,169
But because of all the money he received from the construction company,

82
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,769
he was able to pay off all his debts at once.

83
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:24,469
The nerve of this guy.

84
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,069
Kochiyama's pretty cheeky, too.

85
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,769
The next day, he took me back to the construction site.

86
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,169
Is here good?

87
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,569
No. Go farther back.

88
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,169
Okay.

89
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,869
Smile more.

90
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,269
Look happy!

91
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,869
He used me to get likes.

92
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,369
This is it.

93

when he suffered collateral damage from an unexploded bomb.

96
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,569
He's an unlucky man.

97
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,669
But look at him smiling after he received compensation.

98
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,669
Shameless, right?"

99
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,669
Indeed.

100
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,269
They say a wise man profits by his mistakes.

101
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:15,969
"Tanuki Ponkichi" -So this Tanuki Ponkichi name...

102
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,569
That's me.

103
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,169
Sorry.

104
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,669
So since something similar happened today,

105
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,369
Kagura will be compensated,

106
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:34,469
and Kochiyama plans to get more likes out of him.

107
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,569
That's why you seem happy.

108
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:41,969
What a despicable pair.

109
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,969
It's a good thing

110
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,469
you were injured when you don't have any performances.

111
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,169
Performances?

112
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,769
He's an actor in some acting company.

113
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,469
As a token of friendship...

114
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,069
"Chonenten" -We're the Chonenten Acting Company.

115
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,169
Chonenten Acting Company?

116
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,169
Come to think of it,

117
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,769
isn't there a cafe with this name behind the station?

118
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,569
The chairman of our company runs that place.

119
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,569
I see.

120
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,269
There are photos of Kagura and you.

121
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:29,469
Huh? Kochiyama isn't on there.

122
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:32,069
Kochiyama is unrelated to the company.

123
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:34,769
He's an old friend.

124
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:39,669
But whenever we get together, we have a fun time.

125
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,369
They're three best friends.

126
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,369
Sounds like it.

127
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:49,069
Anyway, whoever called the bank...

128
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,469
I'm sure they only meant to prank them,

129
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:54,269
but they injured people totally unconnected to the bank.

130
00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:00,069
They must be feeling really bad about the stupid thing they did.

131
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,669
They'd better.

132
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:03,669
Right?

133
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,369
Yeah.

134
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:09,369
Let's have a drink tonight to cleanse you of this evil.

135
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,569
You'll be at your apartment, right?

136
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:12,669
Yeah.

137
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:15,069
I can't work like this.

138
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,369
"Nurse's Station" -Excuse me.

139
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:27,669
Could you give me the address of the Otsubo staying in that room?

140
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:28,669
What?

141
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,269
Genta Kojima who's also in that room is very grateful to him,

142
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,369
and wanted to surprise him with a thank you letter.

143
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,569
One moment.

144
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,669
Let's see...

145
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,269
Here it is.

146
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,469
This is a one-time thing.

147
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:47,069
Kikuhide Otsubo...

148
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,569
"How can this be a coincidence?"

149
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,869
You already uploaded the photo.

150
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,069
Good deeds should be done quickly.

151
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:55,269
Good?

152
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:59,769
Huh? You're leaving already?

153
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,969
Yeah. Everyone's been cleared to leave.

154
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,269
Genta should be coming soon, too.

155
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:11,269
Do you guys know Otsubo who was staying in the same room as you?

156
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:15,469
-No. -We don't know him. Why?

157
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:18,469
No reason. I just thought you might.

158
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,969
Bye!

159
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,069
Yeah.

160
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,969
Bye.

161
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:25,569
Where have you been, Conan?

162
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,069
Sorry, sorry. I had to go to the bathroom.

163
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,869
Let's get started.

164
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:32,269
What? Started on what?

165
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,969
On finding the culprit, of course.

166
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,569
Genta was injured. We can't just ignore it.

167
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:39,969
Not just me.

168
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:44,369
That Kagura guy and all the others suffered a horrible fate.

169
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,969
We gotta catch the culprit.

170
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:51,669
Let's start by asking the police if they've found anything.

171
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,469
-Yeah! -Yeah!

172
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,669
Look at them. They're so excited.

173
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,069
What will you do?

174
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,569
Looks like they don't have any clues yet.

175
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:11,369
They're just starting to think about how to determine the culprit.

176
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,369
Hey, isn't that...

177
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:17,769
Tanuki Ponkichi. That's Kochiyama's new post.

178
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,969
"The man I introduced as my unlucky but shameless friend half a month ago

179
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:25,969
suffered more collateral damage!

180
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,969
Unbelievable, right?"

181
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:31,969
Two incidents in half a month?

182
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:35,869
Kagura really is unlucky.

183
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,269
-Yeah. -Yeah.

184
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,069
Unbelievable?

185
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,769
It really is.

186
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:42,969
What?

187
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,369
Could it be...

188
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,269
I'm not trying to sound like Kochiyama,

189
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,169
but this can't be a coincidence.

190
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,269
Conan, could it be...

191
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:54,269
The collateral damage from the bomb half a month ago

192
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,569
probably was a coincidence.

193
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:00,969
But it's possible he got a taste for the money he received then,

194
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,969
and tried to get some more.

195
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:07,369
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

196
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:12,369
He called the bank and caused a panic,

197
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:16,269
making it look like he suffered collateral damage.

198
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,069
It's not impossible.

199
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,469
He doesn't have any performances right now, right?

200
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:27,269
He was waiting for a time he could afford to be injured?

201
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:29,869
So, the culprit is Kagura?

202
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:34,569
Then, Kochiyama and Haruka...

203
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,769
He fooled them, too.

204
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,269
That is what it means.

205
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,869
But they're three best friends.

206
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:45,869
Let's investigate Kagura.

207
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:47,269
Let's ask around.

208
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,269
We could also follow him.

209
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,669
We might discover something.

210
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,369
Do it. I'm going to look into Otsubo.

211
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,569
Is he involved, too?

212
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,569
No,

213
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,269
but there's something about him that's bothering me.

214
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:04,569
Got it. Let's split up.

215
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:05,569
-Yeah! -Yeah!

216
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,736
"Izakaya Sasai" -Sorry, boss.

217
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,736
As you can see, I won't be able to work for a while.

218
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,436
Sorry.

219
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,136
It's fine.

220
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:31,436
Anyway, you really are unlucky.

221
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,136
I know.

222
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,536
I have no idea why I'm so unlucky.

223
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:40,136
Anyway, I'll call you later.

224
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,836
Sure. Take care.

225
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,436
Long time no see.

226
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,636
Look. Something crazy happened to me again.

227
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:02,236
-I saw the news. -It's like he's telling everyone.

228
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:06,536
"I'm simply a victim of collateral damage."

229
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:09,936
That could be his strategy to convince everyone that's what happened.

230
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:15,336
Huh? Our Kagura?

231
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,136
Yes. As the company chairman,

232
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,736
what kind of person do you think he is?

233
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:22,936
"Chiichiro Dewa (30)" -What kind of person is he?

234
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,736
He's a good-natured guy, right?

235
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,936
Yeah.

236
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,036
Right.

237
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,536
Are these guys in the company, too?

238
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,736
This is where we hang out.

239
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,736
Half a month ago,

240
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:37,836
Kagura suffered collateral damage from an unexploded bomb.

241
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,936
Do you know anything about that?

242
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,036
He didn't learn his lesson.

243
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:44,136
Afterwards he was saying,

244
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:48,836
"Maybe I'll suffer some more tasty collateral damage."

245
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,336
He did say that.

246
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,936
Like he was hoping he'd receive more money, right?

247
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,636
Even though that never happens.

248
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,336
I know.

249
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:00,936
This sounds like what Conan said.

250
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,936
Yes. He did it for the money.

251
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,136
Oh, Otsubo?

252
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,736
We're pretty close.

253
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:12,736
We're neighbors and have a lot of free time.

254
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:15,936
"I am a poet." -His life's purpose is finding odd and interesting things

255
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:21,636
to upload to social media for likes.

256
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:26,236
"Shiro Yasukawa (35)" -But he has a tough rival on social media.

257
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:27,636
A rival?

258
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,636
"Unexploded Bomb Explodes!"

259
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,436
He got a bunch of likes again.

260
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:37,436
Who is this Tanuki Ponkichi who keeps making interesting posts?

261
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,836
That's what he told me.

262
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:43,536
That's why he reacted like that upon learning

263
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:47,536
that Kochiyama is Tanuki Ponkichi, his rival.

264
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:51,536
But Otsubo said he wouldn't be beat.

265
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:53,136
I think it was two days ago...

266
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,436
I thought of a good idea.

267
00:15:56,436 --> 00:16:00,436
I'm going to find this unlucky man and follow him.

268
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:04,136
He is sure to suffer some misfortune again,

269
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,136
so I'll post about it first.

270
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,936
Stupid, right?

271
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:16,136
Otsubo came to Beika City

272
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:19,636
and suffered collateral damage not by coincidence,

273
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,736
but because he was following Kagura.

274
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,636
Which means...

275
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:25,936
Could it be...

276
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:32,436
Apparently, Kagura said he hoped to suffer

277
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:35,236
some more tasty collateral damage.

278
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:38,436
Since he couldn't just wait around for it to happen,

279
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:41,736
he made the bomb threat and caused a panic.

280
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:47,536
Is Kagura really such a bad person?

281
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:51,936
While following him,

282
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:54,336
he seemed like a very cheerful and sociable person.

283
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:58,036
Even though he'd just been injured, he never stopped smiling.

284
00:16:58,036 --> 00:17:01,536
The people he was talking to were smiling, too.

285
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,536
That's because he's going to be compensated.

286
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:09,536
But he didn't seem like a bad person who would trick his friends.

287
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:12,136
But he's an actor.

288
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:16,336
It's possible it was all an act.

289
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,336
You think so?

290
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,136
He told his actor friends

291
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:24,436
that he hoped to suffer more collateral damage

292
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,236
so he'd receive more money.

293
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,736
That could be his true nature.

294
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:30,236
Then it's decided.

295
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:32,436
The culprit is Kagura.

296
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:36,036
But the implausibility of the coincidence

297
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:38,036
isn't a strong enough basis for anything.

298
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,836
We need evidence.

299
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:43,936
That's where Kikuhide Otsubo comes in.

300
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:47,336
If he was following Kagura,

301
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:51,336
then it's possible he saw Kagura make the call.

302
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:56,236
I was waiting to confirm that,

303
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,836
but Otsubo hasn't come home.

304
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,436
We'll do all of it tomorrow.

305
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,536
Yeah.

306
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:04,636
We'll check in with Otsubo,

307
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:07,536
and do whatever it takes to find conclusive evidence.

308
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,236
Yeah...

309
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,536
I see.

310
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,436
So that's what happened.

311
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:24,736
I'll expose everything!

312
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:35,836
All right! Let's resume the investigation!

313
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:39,036
I'm going to check with Otsubo.

314
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,536
Then I'll...

315
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:43,436
Did something happen?

316
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:53,636
Otsubo?

317
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:54,636
No way!

318
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:57,036
Why him?

319
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,036
Kids, don't enter the crime scene.

320
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,236
Do you know him?

321
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:03,836
Yeah. Was he murdered?

322
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:04,936
Yeah.

323
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,436
We don't know the details yet,

324
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:10,536
but he was probably struck with a rock.

325
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:13,936
We think it happened around eight last night.

326
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:17,536
-Wait a minute. -You kids knew the victim?

327
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:23,536
You know the bomb threat made to that bank yesterday afternoon?

328
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:27,336
Yes. Though it turned out to be nonsense.

329
00:19:27,336 --> 00:19:30,036
Because it was a Friday at the end of the month,

330
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,936
it caused a huge panic.

331
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,236
Genta got caught up in it.

332
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:38,436
Otsubo was another one of the victims.

333
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,036
And the night of the incident,

334
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:46,736
the victim, Otsubo was murdered.

335
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:47,736
Inspector.

336
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:51,236
We'll have to investigate to see

337
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:56,336
if yesterday's bomb scare and this case are related.

338
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:57,336
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

339
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,636
Like Inspector Megure said,

340
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,936
I wonder if this is related to yesterday's incident.

341
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:11,636
Let's do whatever it takes to find our culprit ourselves, too.

342
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:13,336
-Yeah. -Let's do it.

343
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:18,936
It's possible Edogawa is right,

344
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:22,636
and Otsubo learned a grave secret about yesterday's incident

345
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:25,536
and was killed for it.

346
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,236
What? Wouldn't that mean

347
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:31,336
that Otsubo was killed by Kagura?

348
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,636
-Huh? -What?

349
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:40,336
Otsubo must've seen him yesterday

350
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,436
while following Kagura for social media fodder.

351
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:47,536
He saw Kagura calling the bank.

352
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:51,936
At the time, he probably didn't know he was making a bomb threat.

353
00:20:51,936 --> 00:20:53,836
After leaving the hospital,

354
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:59,736
Otsubo followed unlucky man, Kagura for social media fodder.

355
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:04,736
Something made him realize Kagura caused the bomb scare

356
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,636
and questioned him.

357
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,136
So that's what happened.

358
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:15,336
I'll expose everything!

359
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,936
Knowing that would only end poorly for him,

360
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:24,236
Kagura acted to silence him!

361
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:31,236
It's not impossible. It makes sense.

362
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,036
Right?

363
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,936
It makes sense, but...

364
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,736
There's something...

365
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:42,036
Let's tell Inspector Megure our reasoning.

366
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:45,036
Even if he killed him to silence him,

367
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:49,936
that reasoning assumes Kagura made the bomb threat.

368
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:51,236
Oh, right.

369
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:53,836
Since we don't have any proof of that,

370
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:58,136
the reasoning for Otsubo's murder is just speculation.

371
00:21:58,136 --> 00:22:00,736
You guys keep talking about evidence,

372
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,936
but even without it, I'll put the screws on him until he confesses!

373
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:06,536
-Genta! -Hey!

374
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,436
What should we do, Conan?

375
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:11,236
That might work.

376
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,236
What?

377
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,236
We won't give him a hard time,

378
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:18,536
but we might be able to pick something up by going directly to Kagura.

379
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:22,436
He might reveal something about himself.

380
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:26,436
Yeah. Let's go talk to Kagura.

381
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:56,436
"Next Episode" -Otsubo was?

382
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,936
So apparently, you heard it, too.

383
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:01,836
It's all starting to sound suspicious.

384
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:03,836
Conan...

385
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:06,736
A love triangle?

386
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:12,136
I don't understand!

387
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:14,736
I thought Kagura was just drinking a beer, but then...

388
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:24,336
Next Conan, "The Cost of Likes (Part 2)"

389
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,279
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,379
"A phone"

391
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:30,879
-These adults... -Like.

392
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,779
-No, wait. -Dislike.

393
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:33,879
I like that.
