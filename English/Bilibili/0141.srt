1
00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:03.782
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:05.882
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:07.682
Today's mystery is set in a huge mansion,

4
00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.682
there's so many questions before one gets married.

5
00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.382
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:13.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.882
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:59.695
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 1)"

9
00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.095
Look at all those people.

10
00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.495
Is there a festival or something going on?

11
00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.395
This is normal.

12
00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.795
It's always like this here on Saturday.

13
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:15.695
It's ridiculous, there's just so many people.

14
00:02:15.695 --> 00:02:17.895
This is like the Tenjin Festival in Osaka.

15
00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.395
You're right.

16
00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:21.195
It's like the crowd during cherry blossom viewing

17
00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.495
at the Mint Bureau in Spring.

18
00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.895
Who does he think he is,

19
00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.495
calling us out of the blue from Tokyo Station

20
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:28.895
and telling us to meet them

21
00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.495
because he wants a tour of Tokyo.

22
00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.395
What a pain.

23
00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:34.895
Don't complain, I'll bet you weren't doing anything anyway.

24
00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:36.795
Since we had to come to Tokyo,

25
00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:40.295
I thought we should take a good look around.

26
00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:42.495
So, what brings you to Tokyo?

27
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.095
We're going to a wedding,

28
00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:46.195
the son of one of my mom's friends is getting married.

29
00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:49.595
My mom was supposed to attend the wedding

30
00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:51.495
but she dropped an octopus ball pan on her foot

31
00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:53.695
and broke her toe.

32
00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:55.995
That sounds painful.

33
00:02:55.995 --> 00:02:59.095
So, you and Kazuha are going in her place?

34
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.095
That's right.

35
00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:01.695
She just tagged along though.

36
00:03:01.695 --> 00:03:03.395
That's not true.

37
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:06.095
I really didn't want to come

38
00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:07.995
but Heiji's mom asked me to keep an eye on him,

39
00:03:07.995 --> 00:03:10.995
that's why I'm here!

40
00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:12.895
What a laugh.

41
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:15.695
Wasn't it you who was so excited about going shopping in Shibuya?

42
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.595
Well then, shall I take you to the place I usually shop at?

43
00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.395
Never mind,

44
00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:22.495
I already know where I want to go.

45
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:24.995
I see.

46
00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:27.895
How cute.

47
00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.295
How about this? Does it look okay?

48
00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:33.295
I guess so, after all, you're pretty.

49
00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:35.095
If you like it, you'd better buy it quick

50
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:36.495
or someone else will.

51
00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.495
Yes, you're right.

52
00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:43.295
Boy, what's taking those guys so long?

53
00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:46.595
They're the ones who told us to hurry and do our shopping.

54
00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.095
Hey.

55
00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.295
Yeah?

56
00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:52.895
What are you mad about?

57
00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:56.895
You're mad aren't you? With me...

58
00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:03.795
You're dressed the same.

59
00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.695
-What? -Your shirt.

60
00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:08.195
It's the same blue border print, like Heiji's.

61
00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:10.595
That's just coincidence.

62
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:12.495
It's not just today.

63
00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:15.695
You both wore the same kind of turtle necks.

64
00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:18.895
I bet you two planned it.

65
00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:20.295
How disgustingly obvious.

66
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:22.195
Dressing alike in this day and age.

67
00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.595
I can't believe how outdated you are.

68
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:30.695
What's wrong with you? We're in the middle of the street!

69
00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:40.095
There! Now we're not dressed alike.

70
00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:44.095
You're a real nice girl.

71
00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:45.195
I am?

72
00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:49.195
This place is crowded too.

73
00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:55.595
Kazuha. Ask God to give you slimmer legs.

74
00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.395
Shut up. You idiot.

75
00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:02.295
Ran, why'd you change out of the shirt Eri gave you?

76
00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:04.195
I perspired so much.

77
00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:06.095
Ran, sorry.

78
00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:07.695
Forget it, it's nothing.

79
00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:18.195
Aren't you Heiji?

80
00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:20.795
Shigematsu?

81
00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:23.395
What a surprise running into you here,

82
00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:26.695
I thought you'd be at the house by now.

83
00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:28.695
Who is that man?

84
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.095
That man's a butler.

85
00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:34.395
He works for the family my mom's friend married into.

86
00:05:34.395 --> 00:05:36.495
Nice to meet you, I'm Shigematsu.

87
00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:39.495
Never mind me, what are you doing here?

88
00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:41.695
I'm accompanying her.

89
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:46.395
She wanted to get accustomed to the city before the wedding.

90
00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:47.895
You mean she's the...

91
00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:52.795
Yes. This is Kaede, she's getting carried to Kikuhito tomorrow.

92
00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:54.395
"Kaede Katagiri, Fiancee of Kikuhito Morizono"

93
00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.095
Pleased to meet you, I'm Kaede Katagiri.

94
00:05:58.095 --> 00:05:59.595
Hello.

95
00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:03.495
But if she's getting married to Kikuhito, why isn't he showing her around?

96
00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:06.695
We did ask him to come along but...

97
00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.595
It's my fault.

98
00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:12.395
I insisted on going to see the Tokyo Tower.

99
00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:16.295
The young master has had a fear of heights since he was a child.

100
00:06:16.295 --> 00:06:17.295
I see.

101
00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:22.595
And so what did you pray for?

102
00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:25.595
That we be blessed with children.

103
00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:26.995
For children?

104
00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:29.995
That's not how it looked to me.

105
00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:32.995
A woman about to get married is filled with mixed emotions.

106
00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:35.995
That's right, it's called marriage blues.

107
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.995
-Right? -Right?

108
00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:40.595
This is creepy, all of a sudden they're best friends.

109
00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:46.095
Wow, look at the size of this place.

110
00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:48.895
It hasn't change since I came here when I was a kid.

111
00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:50.395
Are you sure it's alright?

112
00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:52.395
For the rest of us to impose like this.

113
00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.895
Don't worry. Why don't you stay for dinner too?

114
00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:02.395
Hey, Sakuraba.

115
00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:04.495
These are our guests show some respect.

116
00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:05.795
"Yuji Sakuraba, Morizono family servant" -Pardon me.

117
00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:08.395
Mr. Morizono's cat got away again.

118
00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:09.995
How cute.

119
00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:11.695
Let me have a look.

120
00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:15.395
Ouch!

121
00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:16.995
Why you... Come back here Rebecca.

122
00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:19.295
Sorry.

123
00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:21.595
So, you must be her.

124
00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:23.695
My little brother's princess.

125
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:28.895
You may be the daughter of some big company president

126
00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:30.795
but prepare yourself.

127
00:07:30.795 --> 00:07:32.795
Starting today, I will teach you how to act

128
00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:36.295
in accordance with our family traditions.

129
00:07:36.295 --> 00:07:37.895
Yes.

130
00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:39.095
Just kidding.

131
00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:40.995
I'm Kikuhito's older sister Yurie.

132
00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:44.995
Have no fear, I live abroad so I won't be bothering you.

133
00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:46.395
Why Miss Yurie...

134
00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:48.495
I've got to give you a lot of credit though.

135
00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:49.795
I heard you came here quite often

136
00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:52.995
and finally hooked my playboy brother.

137
00:07:53.995 --> 00:07:55.495
No, Miss Yurie.

138
00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.295
It was your brother who fell in love with her at first sight.

139
00:07:58.295 --> 00:08:00.995
Oh my, wasn't it you who told me?

140
00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:01.995
Well...

141
00:08:01.995 --> 00:08:06.095
Oh well, you did bring them together though, didn't you?

142
00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:10.895
Lucky you, perhaps father will reward you in some form.

143
00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:11.895
Yes.

144
00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:20.595
So, you're that famous detective.

145
00:08:20.595 --> 00:08:23.295
Pleased to meet you, I'm Kogoro Mouri.

146
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.995
It's an honor to sit at the same table with someone such as yourself.

147
00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:30.895
I'm flattered.

148
00:08:30.895 --> 00:08:32.595
To tell you the truth,

149
00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.295
I dreamt of becoming a private detective once a long time ago.

150
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:36.495
Now tell me,

151
00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:41.095
how does it feel to be considered this century's greatest detective?

152
00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:44.095
Actually, I'm surprised myself

153
00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:45.595
by how smoothly I solved all those cases.

154
00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:48.795
I guess you could say it was as if I were dreaming.

155
00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.595
Dreaming. You're right about that, old man.

156
00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:54.495
Ouch.

157
00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.095
What do you mean by that?

158
00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:59.295
By the way, Shigematsu,

159
00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:01.295
will you bring me my camera?

160
00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:04.595
I want a photo of Mr. Mouri and me.

161
00:09:04.595 --> 00:09:05.895
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:10.295
And I'd like to see you later in my room.

163
00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:14.095
Your efforts brought those two together.

164
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.395
I want to show you my appreciation.

165
00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:18.195
You can ask for anything.

166
00:09:18.195 --> 00:09:19.895
I'm honored.

167
00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:21.495
And Sakuraba,

168
00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:24.295
my cat's missing again,

169
00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:26.895
will you go look for her?

170
00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:28.995
Of course.

171
00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:31.295
The cat's so capricious.

172
00:09:31.295 --> 00:09:33.395
She was very attached to my wife though.

173
00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:34.795
That do you mean "was"?

174
00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:36.595
My mother...

175
00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:39.295
"Kikuhito Morizono" -died 4 years ago.

176
00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.495
In a tragic traffic accident.

177
00:09:41.495 --> 00:09:44.895
Forgive me, this is my son, Kikuhito.

178
00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:50.095
Did you enjoy your tour of Tokyo, honey?

179
00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:52.195
Yes, very much.

180
00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:53.395
Honey?

181
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:54.595
Yeah.

182
00:09:56.095 --> 00:10:00.795
We'll stop by your office tomorrow after the wedding.

183
00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:03.595
-Sure. -See you tomorrow. Goodnight.

184
00:10:03.595 --> 00:10:05.395
Alright then, goodnight.

185
00:10:07.695 --> 00:10:09.795
What was that sigh for?

186
00:10:09.795 --> 00:10:11.695
I'm just relieved.

187
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.795
Every time I meet up with that guy, we end up involved in a case.

188
00:10:15.795 --> 00:10:18.495
By that guy, do you mean Ran's dad?

189
00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:19.495
Oh yeah, sure.

190
00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:21.795
Every time I'm with the old guy, it never fails...

191
00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:26.495
What was that?

192
00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.895
Someone broke the window on the 3rd floor!

193
00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:31.695
Ran, keep an eye on that window.

194
00:10:31.695 --> 00:10:33.395
Kazuha! Just in case,

195
00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.895
you'd better tell Shigematsu to meet us.

196
00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:35.995
Heiji?

197
00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:49.595
That's the room.

198
00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:55.195
Hey, everything alright?

199
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:56.895
What are you doing in there?

200
00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:58.395
On no! It's locked.

201
00:10:58.395 --> 00:10:59.395
Heiji!

202
00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:03.195
What is it? Where's Shigematsu?

203
00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.895
That's what's so strange.

204
00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:08.195
Everyone says they haven't seen him for awhile now.

205
00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:09.595
What will we do?

206
00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:12.595
He's supposed to have all the keys for the house.

207
00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:13.795
We don't have a choice.

208
00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:15.395
We have to break it down.

209
00:11:23.295 --> 00:11:24.695
It's blood.

210
00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:26.895
It continues into the next room.

211
00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:33.895
Hey. What's that?

212
00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:35.495
What in the world?

213
00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:53.784
Who screamed?

214
00:11:53.784 --> 00:11:54.884
What happened?

215
00:11:56.784 --> 00:11:57.784
Is something wrong?

216
00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.484
What's going on?

217
00:12:00.784 --> 00:12:02.484
He's been murdered.

218
00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:04.684
I'm talking about your butler,

219
00:12:04.684 --> 00:12:06.684
Shigematsu.

220
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:07.984
I don't believe it.

221
00:12:07.984 --> 00:12:09.084
That's ridiculous!

222
00:12:09.084 --> 00:12:11.084
Come on, you're kidding, right?

223
00:12:12.084 --> 00:12:13.084
Kaede.

224
00:12:13.084 --> 00:12:15.284
What're you two doing?

225
00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:17.184
Kaede, snap out of it.

226
00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:19.284
I called the police.

227
00:12:19.284 --> 00:12:22.684
Until they get here, I don't want anyone to move.

228
00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:26.284
It's locked.

229
00:12:26.284 --> 00:12:27.784
This side too.

230
00:12:27.784 --> 00:12:29.384
That's enough you two.

231
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.684
Hey!

232
00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.384
I don't want you two to touch anything.

233
00:12:37.384 --> 00:12:38.784
Hey, Ran!

234
00:12:38.784 --> 00:12:41.384
You were keeping an eye on this window weren't you?

235
00:12:41.384 --> 00:12:45.184
You didn't see anyone leave through here did you?

236
00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:48.884
No! I didn't see anyone!

237
00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:50.084
Which means?

238
00:12:50.084 --> 00:12:51.284
It can't be...

239
00:12:54.984 --> 00:12:57.984
Hey, didn't I just tell you not to touch anything.

240
00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:03.484
Listen!

241
00:13:03.484 --> 00:13:08.284
Shigematsu had all the keys to this house, didn't he?

242
00:13:08.284 --> 00:13:09.284
Yes.

243
00:13:09.284 --> 00:13:12.484
Wasn't there a spare for this room?

244
00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:14.484
We all have a spare for our own room

245
00:13:14.484 --> 00:13:20.384
but only Shigematsu had the keys to the rooms like these

246
00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:23.384
because it's not usually in use.

247
00:13:23.384 --> 00:13:27.084
Alright then, I just want to check on something.

248
00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:29.284
Check on what?

249
00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.984
The lock on this door we broke down.

250
00:13:32.984 --> 00:13:38.284
If the key to this door is really on this bunch of keys...

251
00:13:42.984 --> 00:13:44.784
And what if it is?

252
00:13:44.784 --> 00:13:46.284
Don't you see?

253
00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:50.484
We broke this door because it was locked.

254
00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:51.884
Wasn't it, old man?

255
00:13:51.884 --> 00:13:53.184
That's right.

256
00:13:53.184 --> 00:13:54.584
On top of that,

257
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:58.884
both windows in the room we found the body were locked,

258
00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:03.084
and furthermore, no one left through the window in this room.

259
00:14:03.084 --> 00:14:05.784
So, if the only key to this room

260
00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:09.384
was in Shigematsu's possession...

261
00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:11.784
I see what you mean.

262
00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.984
That's right.

263
00:14:12.984 --> 00:14:14.684
I think you know the answer.

264
00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:21.584
It's a murder behind locked doors.

265
00:14:28.184 --> 00:14:30.784
But Shigematsu could have locked himself in

266
00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:32.184
and committed suicide.

267
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:35.984
If he did, the weapon he used

268
00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:39.184
would be somewhere near the body.

269
00:14:39.184 --> 00:14:45.184
It's obvious Shigematsu was stabbed once in the chest.

270
00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.984
Someone somehow managed to disappear

271
00:14:46.984 --> 00:14:51.084
from this room along with the weapon,

272
00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:53.584
just like the mist.

273
00:14:53.584 --> 00:14:54.684
Give me a break.

274
00:14:54.684 --> 00:14:57.884
I'm getting married tomorrow.

275
00:14:57.884 --> 00:14:59.584
I don't know who's responsible

276
00:14:59.584 --> 00:15:01.484
but they've sure put a damper on things.

277
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.884
Kikuhito, how can you say such a thing?

278
00:15:03.884 --> 00:15:06.984
After something like this, we can't be concerned about a wedding.

279
00:15:06.984 --> 00:15:09.184
Come on, sister.

280
00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:12.984
The guy wasn't even a member of our family.

281
00:15:14.284 --> 00:15:18.184
Besides, I don't want to cancel our honeymoon.

282
00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:21.184
Shigematsu served our family well for many years

283
00:15:21.184 --> 00:15:23.084
and I'm sorry for what happened

284
00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:24.984
but the wedding will go on as scheduled tomorrow

285
00:15:24.984 --> 00:15:27.484
in a grand style.

286
00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:30.684
I'm sure he would have wanted it that way too.

287
00:15:30.684 --> 00:15:31.784
Right?

288
00:15:48.084 --> 00:15:49.484
Why you...

289
00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:52.484
Kikuhito, that's enough!

290
00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:55.884
Someone has died, what's the matter with you?

291
00:15:55.884 --> 00:15:57.284
You should be ashamed of yourself.

292
00:15:59.684 --> 00:16:04.184
Sakuraba lost his parents when he was very young,

293
00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:07.384
Shigematsu was like a father to him, you know that.

294
00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.984
Why can't you be more considerate of his feelings?

295
00:16:09.984 --> 00:16:13.884
Besides, Shigematsu was the very person

296
00:16:13.884 --> 00:16:16.384
who told me about Kaede being the right girl for you.

297
00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:20.784
And you know all too well how hard he worked as your assistant

298
00:16:20.784 --> 00:16:22.684
for the company I entrusted to you.

299
00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:26.284
How dare you talk about him in that manner?

300
00:16:27.284 --> 00:16:30.184
And Sakuraba, you're just as bad.

301
00:16:30.184 --> 00:16:34.984
You have no right to attack a member of the family you work for.

302
00:16:34.984 --> 00:16:37.084
Please be careful in the future.

303
00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:38.284
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:39.284 --> 00:16:43.384
Yurie, call Kaede's parents later.

305
00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:45.584
Tell them we're postponing tomorrow's ceremony.

306
00:16:46.584 --> 00:16:49.584
Didn't he just move?

307
00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:51.784
What are you talking about? You're crazy.

308
00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:01.884
Good grief, it was only the cat.

309
00:17:01.884 --> 00:17:04.084
Rebecca? Come here.

310
00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:07.784
Which means this cat must've been in here all along.

311
00:17:07.784 --> 00:17:11.284
But a cat can't talk.

312
00:17:11.284 --> 00:17:13.884
You get along well with that cat.

313
00:17:13.884 --> 00:17:17.284
Yurie's the splitting image of my late wife.

314
00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:18.884
Rebecca won't come close to Kikuhito or me

315
00:17:18.884 --> 00:17:21.784
unless it's feeding time.

316
00:17:25.184 --> 00:17:29.684
Sir, the police are here, what has happened?

317
00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:32.084
You needn't worry. I'll be right down.

318
00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:37.484
What happened to your leg?

319
00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:42.084
I was in the car with my wife when we were involved in the accident.

320
00:17:42.084 --> 00:17:44.484
I merely injured this leg but unfortunately,

321
00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:45.884
my wife was...

322
00:17:47.384 --> 00:17:50.884
Hr. Morizono, is it true your butler Shigematsu was killed?

323
00:17:50.884 --> 00:17:52.384
Will you be postponing your son's wedding tomorrow?

324
00:17:52.384 --> 00:17:54.684
There are rumors your son's company

325
00:17:54.684 --> 00:17:56.684
is involved in a bribery scandal,

326
00:17:56.684 --> 00:17:58.284
does that have anything to do with today murder?

327
00:17:58.284 --> 00:18:01.384
Stay back! You can ask questions later, later!

328
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.184
I'm Megure of the Metropolitan Police Department.

329
00:18:06.184 --> 00:18:07.584
Thank you for calling.

330
00:18:07.584 --> 00:18:09.984
I have most of the details.

331
00:18:09.984 --> 00:18:12.284
Wherever he goes, there's trouble,

332
00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:14.084
this jinx of a person filled me in.

333
00:18:14.084 --> 00:18:17.684
Who're you calling a jinx? You make me sound bad.

334
00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:22.984
The cases call out to me, the famous Kogoro Mouri.

335
00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:25.184
A murder in a locked room?

336
00:18:25.184 --> 00:18:30.684
Let's see. The door and the windows in this room were all locked.

337
00:18:30.684 --> 00:18:33.384
No one escaped through the window in the next room

338
00:18:33.384 --> 00:18:36.184
and on top of that, the murder weapon wasn't found at the scene.

339
00:18:36.184 --> 00:18:39.884
So yes, it was a murder in a locked room.

340
00:18:39.884 --> 00:18:42.184
A locked room.

341
00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:46.484
But how did you know there was a body in this room?

342
00:18:46.484 --> 00:18:48.584
I was outside

343
00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:50.684
but that window suddenly broke.

344
00:18:50.684 --> 00:18:53.284
So I came here and knocked on the door but there was no answer.

345
00:18:53.284 --> 00:18:56.084
I had no choice except to break the door down

346
00:18:56.084 --> 00:18:57.984
and that's when I found the body.

347
00:18:59.484 --> 00:19:04.084
But weren't you too hasty concluding it was murder?

348
00:19:04.084 --> 00:19:06.984
The victim could have stabbed himself in the chest,

349
00:19:06.984 --> 00:19:09.184
pulled out the knife

350
00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:11.184
and thrown it outside breaking the window it is possible...

351
00:19:11.184 --> 00:19:12.684
No, it isn't.

352
00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.684
We looked up as soon as we heard the window break

353
00:19:15.684 --> 00:19:17.584
but we didn't see any knife.

354
00:19:17.584 --> 00:19:19.684
What are you doing here?

355
00:19:19.684 --> 00:19:21.684
And look at the floor.

356
00:19:22.984 --> 00:19:24.884
If he threw it out the window,

357
00:19:24.884 --> 00:19:27.684
there should be more blood near the window.

358
00:19:27.684 --> 00:19:30.684
And these bloodstains look like they were made

359
00:19:30.684 --> 00:19:32.984
when the murderer dragged the victim in here.

360
00:19:34.284 --> 00:19:35.584
The window might've cracked accidentally

361
00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:39.584
when the killer and the victim fought

362
00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:41.784
or perhaps he saw me outside

363
00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:45.784
and used this chair to break the window to get my attention.

364
00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.784
Either way, when the window broke,

365
00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:51.984
the killer was still inside the room, I'm sure of that.

366
00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:55.384
-Inspector! -Yes?

367
00:19:55.384 --> 00:19:57.584
About an hour before the body was discovered,

368
00:19:57.584 --> 00:20:01.884
most of the servants were in the dining room having dinner

369
00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:05.784
and going over the plans for tomorrow's wedding.

370
00:20:05.784 --> 00:20:10.384
So, it seems the only ones without a clear alibi are these five.

371
00:20:10.384 --> 00:20:12.284
I got it.

372
00:20:12.284 --> 00:20:15.884
I'll want to talk to each one of you separately later on.

373
00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:18.184
We'll do a quick body check

374
00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:20.684
and have you wait in a room.

375
00:20:20.684 --> 00:20:23.484
Alright, I want every man to check the grounds

376
00:20:23.484 --> 00:20:26.184
and the neighborhood!

377
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.984
The weapon should be still be somewhere around here.

378
00:20:28.984 --> 00:20:30.684
We've got to find it!

379
00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:36.284
Hey, Kudo, how many you got?

380
00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:37.284
Four!

381
00:20:37.284 --> 00:20:39.984
I knew it. I've got four suspicions too!

382
00:20:39.984 --> 00:20:44.184
First is the weapon the killer took from the scene.

383
00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:47.184
The killer took so much time to lock everything up.

384
00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:48.884
If the weapon was found at the scene,

385
00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:52.284
it would have looked like a suicide.

386
00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:56.084
Second, the bloodstains from the body being dragged.

387
00:20:56.084 --> 00:21:01.184
What did the killer have to move the body?

388
00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:04.984
Third, the light was only on in the room we found the body.

389
00:21:04.984 --> 00:21:08.284
And the fourth is the most puzzling...

390
00:21:08.284 --> 00:21:10.184
-The cat. -The cat.

391
00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:13.084
Actually, I had five but I can't recall the last puzzle.

392
00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:14.484
Really? You too?

393
00:21:14.484 --> 00:21:16.784
Officer, please.

394
00:21:16.784 --> 00:21:18.684
Let me help you.

395
00:21:18.684 --> 00:21:20.184
It's out of the question.

396
00:21:20.184 --> 00:21:22.484
Please wait in the other room.

397
00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:26.184
But I can't just do nothing.

398
00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.184
Hey...

399
00:21:27.184 --> 00:21:29.684
Stop it, you fool.

400
00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:31.884
Don't you realize every time you do something rash,

401
00:21:31.884 --> 00:21:35.584
it causes trouble for our family.

402
00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:37.984
Don't forget your place!

403
00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:42.284
Are you alright?

404
00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:47.884
Who does he think he is anyway?

405
00:21:50.284 --> 00:21:51.984
I'm fine, really...

406
00:21:58.184 --> 00:21:59.584
It's matching.

407
00:22:02.184 --> 00:22:05.484
I'm not talking about your clothes, their pendants.

408
00:22:05.484 --> 00:22:06.884
Pendants?

409
00:22:06.884 --> 00:22:07.984
That's right.

410
00:22:07.984 --> 00:22:10.384
I saw it through his torn collar,

411
00:22:10.384 --> 00:22:13.784
Sakuraba's wearing the pendant as Kaede.

412
00:22:16.784 --> 00:22:18.884
-I wonder what it means. -You're right.

413
00:22:18.884 --> 00:22:22.284
The design's unique, it couldn't be coincidence.

414
00:22:22.284 --> 00:22:23.684
Hey, Kudo.

415
00:22:23.684 --> 00:22:25.084
I know.

416
00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:28.484
I think we've got another on our hands.

417
00:22:28.484 --> 00:22:31.684
Another password to help solve this murder.

418
00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:05.584
"Next Episode" -I think we should try it out

419
00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:07.984
on the veranda next door anyway.

420
00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:09.984
Try what out?

421
00:24:09.984 --> 00:24:11.584
You know what I mean.

422
00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:16.384
We're going to see if you can really get down from the veranda.

423
00:24:16.384 --> 00:24:17.884
Who's going to do it?

424
00:24:20.184 --> 00:24:21.884
Something's caught in the tree.

425
00:24:21.884 --> 00:24:23.484
What're you doing?

426
00:24:26.384 --> 00:24:27.884
Kudo!

427
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:29.584
Next Conan,

428
00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:33.305
"Murder Behind Locked Doors on the Night Before the Wedding (Part 2)"

429
00:24:34.286 --> 00:24:37.186
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:37.186 --> 00:24:38.286
"Bag"

431
00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:39.686
The famous detectives are on the case.

432
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:42.586
Inspector, I think we should really catch the perpetrator soon.
