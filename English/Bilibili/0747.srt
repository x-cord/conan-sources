1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,840
Sonoko invites Kyogoku to come to the Suzuki residence.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,640
But he ends up being disliked by Tomoko, Sonoko's mother.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,240
Moreover, he sees Sonoko getting all excited over talk of Thief Kid.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,040
Thief Kid?

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,440
What's going on?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,540
Advisor!

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,140
I, here am called Makoto Kyogoku.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm a greenhorn that is now courting Sonoko.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,540
You're Sonoko's boyfriend.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,740
And, just what do you want with me?

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,240
I've heard that you're in possession of a jewel

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
that a thief, what's his name is seeking.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,440
If so, I would like to offer you my services.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,540
Won't you please assign me, Makoto Kyogoku

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,440
to guard this for you at the foot of the table, if you will?

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,940
"Sonoko"

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,840
What kind of guy is he?

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,440
I hear that he practices karate.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
He's no ordinary karate practitioner, you know!

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,740
He has won 400 World Karate Championships with no losses,

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,140
an invincible prince of attacks!

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,840
Four... four-hundred championships, no losses?

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,740
Don't put any guards into the exhibition room of the jewel?

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,040
Thief Kid's coming to steal, you know?

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,440
Advisor Suzuki called me a while ago

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,840
and said that they would get in the way of the newest security systems.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,740
One man is being surrounded by men armed with guns?

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
Of course they're just airsoft pellets,

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,240
but still, with this number of men at this range...

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,540
Moreover, the man in the middle

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,340
is wearing a gas mask that interferes with his visibility.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,040
You'd think that it'd be impossible for him to avoid the pellets, huh?

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,940
He's the world's most formidable security system.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,640
Tomoko makes a proposal to Kyogoku

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,040
and Kid does likewise, to Sonoko,

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,540
each asking their target to make a bet with them.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,940
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

38
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,540
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,240
Thief Kid's surprising strategy.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Where will the security system battle lead to?

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,040
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:17,677
"Thief Kid vs. Makoto Kyogoku (Part 2)".

45
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,977
Hang in there, Makoto!

46
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,377
Sure thing.

47
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:25,377
I...

48
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,677
believe in you.

49
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:30,877
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

50
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:33,077
with these fists of mine!

51
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:37,177
Come along now, Sonoko.

52
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:54,677
I also have faith in you

53
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:58,377
and believe that you will keep your word.

54
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:01,077
Yes, I will.

55
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,477
Of course.

56
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:09,077
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

57
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:16,977
Won't you like to make a bet with me?

58
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:19,477
Make a bet?

59
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:20,677
Right.

60
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:24,777
If you succeed in protecting the jewel...

61
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,777
I'll accept that as fate,

62
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:30,277
and approve of you going with Sonoko.

63
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:34,877
If you fail and that thief surpasses you...

64
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,177
I'll have you give up Sonoko, no questions asked,

65
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,777
understand?

66
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:54,277
Kid, Kid, Kid...

67
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,777
-Kid! -Kid!

68
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,177
-Kid, Kid. -Kid!

69
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:08,377
What? A letter from Kid was delivered here to this museum?

70
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:12,377
On top of that, it's addressed to this man again?

71
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:13,577
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:15,377
About 100 letters. All at once.

73
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,677
"Makoto Kyogoku" -A hundred?

74
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:23,077
It looks like it has to be heated again.

75
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:28,477
Hey, hey, we can't be heating up all 100 letters, you know.

76
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:31,877
Please get ready some candles and candle stands.

77
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,277
I think we can save time by doing so.

78
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,277
Hey, somebody!

79
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:41,677
Bring some candles and candle stands!

80
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,377
What? What's this?

81
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:51,377
"I never let go of a prey I catch because I'm the world's greatest thief.

82
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,277
Nothing is impossible for the magician under the moon.

83
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:57,277
My opponent is the world's most formidable security system?

84
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:58,977
What a laugh."

85
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:04,477
I mean, none of these mean anything at all!

86
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,377
Stand back, move back!

87
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:10,677
Move back a bit more, please!

88
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:14,177
Please don't get any closer than this!

89
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,477
You can't call this an exhibition at all.

90
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,477
But, what is this anyway?

91
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,677
This large number of letters...

92
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:30,277
Is it to throw Kyogoku who's protecting the jewel off?

93
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,077
Or...

94
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,777
-Kid! Kid! Kid! -It is closing time.

95
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:38,777
Thank you for visiting today.

96
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:41,777
All guests please quickly leave the premises.

97
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,277
It is closing time.

98
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:47,977
Thank you for visiting today.

99
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:50,977
All guests please quickly leave the premises.

100
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:57,077
Okay, I'm ready when you are, Phantom Thief Kid!

101
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,577
I'll make you pay for all you've done so far!

102
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:04,177
Rather, he will!

103
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,077
I've got a bad feeling.

104
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:12,277
It seems that he's falling for Thief Kid.

105
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:14,277
What's the matter, Conan?

106
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,277
You look scary.

107
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,577
Ran!

108
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,077
What do you think?

109
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:25,577
I chose the most orthodox one.

110
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:28,177
I... I think it looks nice on you.

111
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:30,577
Oh? I'm glad!

112
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:35,877
Orthodox?

113
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:37,677
It's so open at the breasts.

114
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,977
Makoto!

115
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:44,877
This is the one I chose!

116
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,777
Don't forget, okay?

117
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:50,077
Okay.

118
00:08:56,977 --> 00:09:00,977
Well, there's five minutes to go before the scheduled time.

119
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:04,077
Will everyone please leave this exhibition room?

120
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:11,877
If anyone should come in here before all is completed,

121
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:14,377
I shall deem them to be my enemy

122
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:17,377
and repress whoever with all my might.

123
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:21,577
-Yes... -I got it.

124
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,877
I'll leave the rest to you.

125
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,977
Okay!

126
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,877
Be it us or anyone else,

127
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:42,077
don't let them into this room!

128
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:43,577
Yes, sir!

129
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,877
I've got to go to the ladies' room!

130
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,777
Hey!

131
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:53,377
Those are letters that were received from Kid, right?

132
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:54,577
Yeah.

133
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,377
There are so many.

134
00:09:56,377 --> 00:10:01,377
Did the person from the post office come to deliver them?

135
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:03,477
No. Sonoko told me

136
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,777
that the postman gave them to her directly a while ago.

137
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,777
Sonoko did?

138
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,677
Was she wearing those clothes back then?

139
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,377
Good work!

140
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,877
Yeah, she said that she changed first

141
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:20,077
and went outside to check things out,

142
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,777
then coincidentally saw a postman that she knew.

143
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,677
May I please have a look at the letters?

144
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,877
I won't take them out of the bag!

145
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:32,877
Hey!

146
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:37,677
It doesn't react to black light after all.

147
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,677
Which means...

148
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:42,877
Don't tell me that Sonko's...

149
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,377
Black... blackout?

150
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:59,277
I'm sorry, Makoto.

151
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:14,585
Kid, Kid, Kid!

152
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:19,085
Black... blackout?

153
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,385
Something's shining.

154
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,585
Moreover, there are a lot of them.

155
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,385
Florescent paint?

156
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:34,685
Huh? Something's rolling over here.

157
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:39,285
No! Ran, stay away from it!

158
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,885
Stay calm!

159
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,785
It's the usual anesthetic gas!

160
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:50,285
So long as you wear the gas mask, this is nothing!

161
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,685
Darn!

162
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,385
Why you, Kid?

163
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,285
This voice is Sonoko's.

164
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,685
Makoto! May I come in?

165
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,585
Makoto!

166
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,685
Sonoko, what on earth's the matter?

167
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,385
The Phantom Kid suddenly caused a blackout

168
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,485
and filled the entire museum with anesthetic gas!

169
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:47,085
I had this gas mask that I received from one of the officers

170
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,585
so I didn't fall asleep, you see.

171
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,985
Thief Kid fired his cards gun at all the other officers

172
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:54,385
and removed their masks.

173
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,485
What the...

174
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,585
Since there was something

175
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:05,085
that looked to be florescent paint on the gas masks,

176
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,885
Kid probably used it as a guide to...

177
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:12,785
Which mean that he's still nearby.

178
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,885
I think he already fled.

179
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:19,585
It seems that a card from Kid was received before the blackout

180
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,985
saying that he got hold of the jewel.

181
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,385
No way!

182
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,585
As you can see,

183
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:26,985
I've been wearing this jewel pendant around my neck right through.

184
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:30,185
At any rate, let's verify it in a bright place!

185
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,885
Whether the jewel is genuine or not.

186
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,185
It's hard to tell just by the light of the moon through the skylight.

187
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,185
If so...

188
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,385
Let's use candle light.

189
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,585
Right!

190
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,985
There were candles that were used to heat the letters up.

191
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:54,985
If I remember correctly, the genuine stone was green, right?

192
00:13:57,185 --> 00:14:00,485
It's red? It's shiny red!

193
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:04,085
So, Kid switched it for the genuine one after all.

194
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,085
But...

195
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:09,085
When on earth? How?

196
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:11,985
Okay, then.

197
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,685
For the time being,

198
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:18,585
I'll go hand this fake over to the Inspector.

199
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,285
Okay.

200
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:24,585
Will you go look after the officers who were put to sleep then, Makoto?

201
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:31,185
You...

202
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:34,485
aren't Sonoko, are you?

203
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:35,785
What're you talking about?

204
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,585
I'm really me!

205
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,285
Though this jewel may be fake.

206
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,985
The jewel's genuine!

207
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:45,485
Conan?

208
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:51,485
Alexandrite under sunlight with a strong blue green spectrum

209
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:56,085
or the florescent light within this museum is dark green in color

210
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:59,185
but if placed under incandescent light

211
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:01,185
with a strong red spectrum or candle light,

212
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:03,485
it turns vivid red.

213
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,985
In other words,

214
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:07,085
the reason why so many meaningless letters

215
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:10,385
that needed to be heated were sent over

216
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:14,985
was to have candles brought in here!

217
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:20,085
You hid those letters somewhere in this museum beforehand,

218
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,085
and after disguising yourself as Sonoko, probably passed them on, right?

219
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,585
If you sent them out through the post office

220
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,485
and by some mistake heat is applied to them,

221
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,885
your heating trick would go down the drain.

222
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,385
As proof this,

223
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:33,585
barcodes for separate management printed by the post office

224
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:36,885
weren't on any of the letters, were they?

225
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:40,885
That is, the invisible ink that reacts to blacklight.

226
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:45,385
Then, are you insinuating that Kid ripped off my clothes

227
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,485
to disguise himself?

228
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:48,585
No.

229
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:54,985
Sonoko took her clothes off herself and gave it to you, Kid!

230
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,285
In order to settle the bet that Sonoko made with you!

231
00:15:58,285 --> 00:15:59,885
Bet?

232
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:02,685
Yeah.

233
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:07,885
Whether or not you, Mr. Kyogoku would be able to see through

234
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:11,385
Kid disguised as Sonoko.

235
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,985
Heck! He dodged?

236
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,185
Rats, bummers!

237
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,485
Where'd he go?

238
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,885
Where is he?

239
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:51,085
The Green Emperor is mine!

240
00:16:55,785 --> 00:17:01,285
Well, you only have yourself to curse for your incompetence to fly.

241
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:04,585
Mr. World's Most Formidable Security System, no?

242
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,285
You rat...

243
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:12,885
Stand back.

244
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:13,985
Huh?

245
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,085
Broke the pillar with Karate?

246
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:30,385
Don't tell me that he plans to down the ceiling by breaking the pillar?

247
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,285
Monster!

248
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,685
I'd better split.

249
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,485
No joke.

250
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,285
He... he flew?

251
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,285
He's sure the world's most formidable.

252
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,885
Okay.

253
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,585
Will you please give it back to me?

254
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,685
The jewel

255
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,685
as well as Sonoko's heart.

256
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:20,085
Yes, since the jewel isn't what I was after,

257
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:23,685
I can give it back to you,

258
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,185
but not so with Sonoko's heart.

259
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:28,285
What?

260
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:34,385
It's not a question of giving anything back to you

261
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,785
because it hasn't been stolen to begin with.

262
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,985
At the point that I asked to make the bet with me.

263
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:49,785
Okay! I'll make the bet with you, but...

264
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:52,285
make sure you don't hurt Makoto.

265
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:56,585
Because he has a large tournament to compete in next week.

266
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,285
Who's there?

267
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,585
Thief Kid?

268
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,185
Well, well...

269
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:09,285
It seems that my coming here couldn't be kept a secret.

270
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,585
So, make up a story to tell your friend.

271
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,485
And, especially to that boy wearing glasses.

272
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:22,285
Well, unfortunately,

273
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,485
it seems you got slightly hurt.

274
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,985
But as for the bet, I completely...

275
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,885
lost to Sonoko!

276
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,285
What?

277
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:15,785
Your clothes and everything was taken off

278
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:18,685
and you were confined in the toilet compartment?

279
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,685
Is that true, Sonoko?

280
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:21,985
Yeah, I guess so.

281
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,585
He's merciless even to women!

282
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,485
Kid told you to say so, didn't he?

283
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:30,385
Otherwise, you'd be his accomplice.

284
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:31,385
Then, don't tell me

285
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:34,685
that the florescent paint on the gas mask was put there by...

286
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,685
Good work!

287
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,285
Back then!

288
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:45,285
Darn! That Kid!

289
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:52,485
But, you sure did a good job at protecting the jewel.

290
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:56,885
No, because Kid got away after all.

291
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,585
I offer my deepest apology.

292
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,785
No problem, no problem.

293
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:03,185
This challenge is postponed until next time.

294
00:22:03,185 --> 00:22:04,985
When I most certainly will...

295
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:07,785
Yes, sir! That time for sure.

296
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,285
Good response, sonny! That's indeed what I would expect

297
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,185
of the world's most formidable security system.

298
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:18,785
He's a pretty gallant young man, isn't he?

299
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,285
Yes.

300
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:25,585
He's honest, unsophisticated, polite and tough.

301
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,385
He tickles my fantasy.

302
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:30,585
She scares me.

303
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,885
I'm sorry, Makoto.

304
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,485
I sort of ended up testing you.

305
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,085
-No, don't be. -And...

306
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:43,385
when did you realize that it was Kid in disguise?

307
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:47,585
Like I was prettier than him, after all?

308
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:49,285
Well? Well?

309
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,485
That was it, wasn't it?

310
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,985
Well...

311
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:55,485
The fact is...

312
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:01,685
What?

313
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:07,285
Kid's index finger was longer than mine?

314
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,885
You mean that's seriously how you found out?

315
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:11,985
Yes. I've got this habit of

316
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:13,285
seeing right through the physical characteristics of my opponent

317
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:16,185
in the wink of an eye, you see.

318
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,385
Wasn't there anything else?

319
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:21,685
Like I've got a purer heart or something like that?

320
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:23,585
Purer?

321
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:29,085
Like, more chaste or untouched...

322
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,285
That's nothing to think so hard over!

323
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,485
I... I'm sorry.

324
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:33,885
Come on!

325
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:35,985
Well, it's said that due to hormones,

326
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:38,985
women have longer index fingers than ring fingers

327
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:42,585
and men are vice versa.

328
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,285
Although there seems to be a lot of exceptions.

329
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:48,885
Oh, my ring finger's longer!

330
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:52,585
"Next Episode"

331
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,585
I wonder if there was an accident there or something.

332
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:57,485
But those flowers...

333
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,185
I don't have it. You know, that...

334
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:03,985
You don't have it? Don't tell me...

335
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:09,185
Something smells after all.

336
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,685
Please don't tell anyone because it's embarrassing.

337
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,485
Yes, of course not!

338
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,085
Next Conan,

339
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:20,985
"Detective Love Story at MPD Headquarters (Confession)".

340
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:39,185
Next Conan's Hint:

341
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,285
"Masked Yaiba".

342
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,585
Boy, that was close!

343
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:44,185
There's another master of Karate.

344
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,185
I know her really well.
