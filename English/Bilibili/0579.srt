1
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,699
What? You saw Shuichi Akai?

2
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,499
Remember that robbery

3
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:31,699
at Tohto Bank at Beikacho the other day?

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,999
They reported on the news that the trial

5
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,399
for that incident started yesterday,

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,199
it seems that he was seen turning around towards the camera.

7
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,299
A man who resembled him

8
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:43,699
seemed to be among the people who were released.

9
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:50,299
Well, it's most probably some guy that just looks like him, though.

10
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,199
Because after all, you and me,

11
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,299
we confirmed with our own eyes.

12
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,099
That Akai who came walking right into our trap at Raiha pass,

13
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:05,299
was shot in the head by Kir's gun.

14
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,199
-Go get Kir. -What?

15
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:40,399
Sherry who got away appeared at Haido City Hotel.

16
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,199
Akai who tried to attack us, lured us to go

17
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:50,199
to the Mouri Detective Agency in Beikacho.

18
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,099
The hospital that the FBI confined Kir in

19
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,699
was the Haido Central Hospital.

20
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,699
"Haido Central Hospital"

21
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,899
And, the man who resembled Akai

22
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,999
appeared at the bank in Beikacho.

23
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,699
Beikacho and Haidocho are so near.

24
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,899
Do you think this is a coincidence?

25
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,399
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,499
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,199
There is a bomb scare at a department store.

28
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,799
What are the men in black after?

29
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,399
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,299
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,877
The man that we ran into on our way home from school

33
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,477
was called Mr. Kyozo Daita.

34
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,577
After realizing that he was planning on committing suicide,

35
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:27,477
we tried to somehow stop him from doing so and succeeded.

36
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,877
But, at that time I found out

37
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:32,577
from Genta and the others about an unexpected fact.

38
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:35,277
When we encountered the bank robbery,

39
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,577
they say that the man, who was also present

40
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,977
at the previous bus jack we got messed up in, was there.

41
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:44,377
That person can't possibly be...

42
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:48,577
In the meantime, a strange job offer

43
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:51,077
came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

44
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:52,477
The client asked us to solve a mystery

45
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,577
about red T-shirts that were being sent every week,

46
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,177
and asked us to talk to him.

47
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,977
The following day, in order to meet the client,

48
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:05,377
we went to the Beika Department Store.

49
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:09,877
FBI agent, Jodie was also there.

50
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,477
The person she is searching for is most probably,

51
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,677
that man.

52
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:23,277
"The 13 Black Suggestions"

53
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,477
"Beika Department Store"

54
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:34,677
Really, I tell you.

55
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,677
It's after 1 pm already.

56
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:41,277
The client hasn't shown up yet.

57
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:42,777
Forget it.

58
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,277
I'm quitting!

59
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,477
We're going home.

60
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:54,877
I wonder what this paper bag is?

61
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:56,977
Maybe somebody forgot it?

62
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:00,977
I don't think you should touch that.

63
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:07,577
Because I think there's a bomb inside it.

64
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,077
Bomb?

65
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,577
You said bomb?

66
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:13,077
How do you know?

67
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:16,377
Well...

68
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:20,277
Because I am also...

69
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,777
Look at me.

70
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,677
That's why.

71
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,477
A bomb?

72
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,877
I'm sorry, James.

73
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,377
I haven't finished lunch yet.

74
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,777
Hey, just how long do you intend to spend on lunch, Jodie?

75
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,777
Well, a lot of things have been happening

76
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:47,377
and I'm still at the cafe on the basement floor.

77
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:51,477
A lot of things? Any problem?

78
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,877
No, it's nothing like that.

79
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:57,277
Okay, after Camel comes out of the men's room,

80
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,477
and I finish drinking my ice tea,

81
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:01,677
we'll head on to join you there.

82
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,277
I wonder, what's gotten into her?

83
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:09,177
Jodie recently seems to have changed.

84
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:12,077
Ever since the robbery, I think.

85
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,477
She told me not to tell James

86
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,677
but I wonder what her concern about the black cap is?

87
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,977
Hold... Hold it...

88
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,977
Hold it there!

89
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,277
That was... It can't be...

90
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,677
It can't be!

91
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:52,677
Strange...

92
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:55,877
If a man with a burn who can't talk comes to shop,

93
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:59,077
I'm sure that one of the sales clerks should remember him.

94
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:02,577
Does that mean that there was no such person in the first place?

95
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,877
Then who was that guy that I saw?

96
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:11,777
Shu?

97
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:13,077
Sorry.

98
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:18,577
Shu.

99
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:21,277
Shu, is it you? It's you, isn't it, Shu?

100
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:23,077
Tell me that it's you, Shu!

101
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:27,477
What's it about?

102
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,377
The edge of the coaster is bent.

103
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,077
Was it bent to begin with?

104
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:41,477
Get out of here! This area is dangerous.

105
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,277
Shu!

106
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:50,877
Shu!

107
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:04,177
Why do you have something like that on your body?

108
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,077
I have no idea!

109
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:08,377
I was attacked from behind in the men's room and passed out.

110
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:12,377
When I came, a masked man had wrapped this around me.

111
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,077
That man told me

112
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:17,977
to put paper bags in front of the escalator

113
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,677
as well as in front of the stairs too, so I did.

114
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:25,777
He threatened to set the bomb off if I didn't listen to him.

115
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,277
At any rate, get the police!

116
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:30,177
-Call the police, won't you... -No, you can't!

117
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,877
Because he told me that the moment the police

118
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,177
approached this department store,

119
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:36,677
he would push the bomb switch to set it off!

120
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,877
And of course,

121
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,377
he told me that even if one person flees from this floor,

122
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:41,877
that's it.

123
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:44,577
No way... Can't be!

124
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:47,577
What did the man want?

125
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,077
He wanted to find

126
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:55,177
the sender who puts of the 13 red T-shirts in this bag.

127
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,977
He needs to be found at any cost.

128
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,577
-Red T-shirts? -What?

129
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:04,777
Yes. He said that...

130
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,877
the sender is definitely on this floor!

131
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,977
He's definitely on this floor?

132
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:18,477
"Beika Department Store"

133
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:20,877
Hey... Are you serious?

134
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:24,677
He said that if he can't find the sender of the T-shirts,

135
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:27,477
he's going to blow up the bomb?

136
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:34,377
Yes. The masked man who wrapped the bomb around my body said so.

137
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:39,177
Moreover, he tells you that the sender is on this floor too?

138
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:40,977
Yes.

139
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,077
He said that if the person turns up,

140
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:49,677
he won't push the switch of the bomb.

141
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,877
Hey! You heard what he just said, didn't you?

142
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:53,477
I don't know what your problem is,

143
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:56,577
but come out you, sender of the load of red T-shirts!

144
00:10:56,577 --> 00:10:58,977
If you're here, please come on out!

145
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:08,577
I guess nobody's coming out.

146
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:09,777
Yes.

147
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,577
He was saying to turn off the escalators

148
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:16,777
and to make sure that the elevator doesn't stop on this floor too.

149
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,377
I see.

150
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,177
He plans to keep all the people confined here

151
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:24,877
until he finds the sender of the T-shirts.

152
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,777
It can't be.

153
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,777
No way, no darn way!

154
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,177
Hey, hold it!

155
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:32,477
Hold your horses! Hey!

156
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,677
Calm down, hey!

157
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:36,777
Everyone, calm down!

158
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:38,277
Hey!

159
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,599
Excuse me. Please stay on this floor.

160
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,899
Calm down!

161
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,199
You heard what he said, didn't you?

162
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,399
The culprit is saying

163
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,999
that he wants to find the one who send him the red T-shirts

164
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,899
and that he's sure that the sender is here on this floor.

165
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,599
He also saying that if anyone flees from this floor,

166
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,599
he's going to switch the bomb on!

167
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,799
Of course calling the police is the out of the question!

168
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,599
Even if one person acts on his own, there's going to be victims.

169
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,399
I mean, that's what he said, right?

170
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,599
Yes.

171
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:02,999
Excuse me,

172
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:06,199
but could you call the person in charge

173
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,199
and have the escalators stopped

174
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,699
as well as not make the elevators stop on this floor.

175
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:15,599
-Yes, sir. -Of course not to use stairs too.

176
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:20,599
Please make sure too that no one contacts the police!

177
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,999
Because it is very likely that the culprit is here

178
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:27,799
and watching everything that we're doing.

179
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,599
All right.

180
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:35,499
So, what are we going to do now?

181
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,699
Why don't we take a look?

182
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,299
At the mysterious red T-shirts

183
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:43,999
that are being sent to him every week!

184
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,999
What? Did I mention it?

185
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:48,699
That they were being sent every week?

186
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:54,099
A client who seems to know the bomb man asked us to do some checking.

187
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:58,299
We were told by the person who red T-shirts sent to him every week,

188
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,699
would come after noon to the sports goods floor

189
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,699
of the Beika Department Store

190
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,399
and would like me,

191
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,899
Kogoro Mouri's help on the matter!

192
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,299
Kogoro Mouri...

193
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,399
You mean that famous detective?

194
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,299
Yes. That's why,

195
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:21,399
I will find the sender of the red T-shirts and bomb man right away!

196
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,999
Well, keep your distance and watch.

197
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,499
Yes...

198
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:31,799
What?

199
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,399
A man with a burn scar on his right cheek

200
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,599
left this store a while ago?

201
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,699
Is that true?

202
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,399
Yes. Right after you left to go outside

203
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,699
to answer the call that you received.

204
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:49,999
That man, wasn't he wearing a cap like this?

205
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,699
Yes, he was.

206
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,299
Is he Mr. Akai?

207
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:00,699
I passed him in the men's room a while ago.

208
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,399
With a man who looks exactly like Mr. Akai with a burn scar.

209
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,599
No way! Is he here?

210
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,499
Yes. I lost track of him, though.

211
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:13,399
But, what brings him here?

212
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,299
What? Then don't tell me that the person you said

213
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,299
you saw during the bank robbery was...

214
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,699
Yes, exactly!

215
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:25,899
I was looking for him because he disappeared in the hustle and bustle

216
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,199
after the case.

217
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,599
Then I realized that the mark on the back of the cap

218
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:35,599
was an original design by the Beika Department Store.

219
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:39,099
So, I came down looking for a clue or something!

220
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,299
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,399
I wasn't too sure myself,

222
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,599
so I couldn't tell any of the agents yet.

223
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:50,299
Besides, it seems as though he lost his memory and can't talk,

224
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,499
so I couldn't confirm anything either.

225
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,299
You see...

226
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,099
Is it possible that this is a trap that they set?

227
00:15:58,099 --> 00:15:59,399
What?

228
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,799
You said so yourself too!

229
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,999
That Shuichi Akai died!

230
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,699
You also confirmed the fingerprints of the corpse, didn't you?

231
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,399
There's no way that he's alive!

232
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,199
But...

233
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,199
The fingerprints of Conan and you were found,

234
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,599
along with fingerprints of the man

235
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,699
who burned to death a while ago.

236
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,599
If it's Shu, I'm sure he'll do something about the situation!

237
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:27,099
Besides, just what kind of trap do you propose this to be?

238
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:31,199
Well... maybe they're up to something

239
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,199
and trying to throw us off by confusing us.

240
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,899
The riot police?

241
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,499
Why?

242
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,399
Come to think of it, something happened on the floor above.

243
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,399
People were shouting that the elevator wouldn't stop on it.

244
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,799
If so, I'm sure that the man with the burn is Shu!

245
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,899
What?

246
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:59,499
Look! This is a message that the man with the burn secretly gave me.

247
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,199
What?

248
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,199
Then, Mr. Akai somehow found out beforehand

249
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,199
that something was going to happen at this department store and...

250
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,199
Yes.

251
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,099
There's no doubt that he already got his memory back.

252
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,099
But, what's going on?

253
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,799
What on earth is going on, Shu?

254
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,099
According to the torn piece of paper of the courier

255
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,999
that had been peeled off, where the T-shirts were inside,

256
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,199
the T-shirts that were sent 7 weeks, 6 weeks and 5 weeks ago

257
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:38,099
were all two each,

258
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,199
but for some reason the one sent 4 weeks ago,

259
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,199
was just one.

260
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:46,899
Then, 3 weeks, 2 weeks ago and last week,

261
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:52,699
two red T-shirts were sent again.

262
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:55,199
I wonder if there's any meaning to it?

263
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,299
I wonder...

264
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:01,399
They total 13 T-shirts in all, unlucky number...

265
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,899
Hey, don't come near me!

266
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,599
I mean you're carrying a bomb!

267
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,699
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:11,899
There something red on the shoulder

269
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:14,899
part of the coat you're wearing, sir.

270
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,199
Hey... if it's red,

271
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,299
is it has something to do with what's happening too?

272
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,399
Oh, I think it's somebody's lipstick.

273
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:27,499
Because the train I took here was quite crowded.

274
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:28,999
Is that so...

275
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,899
Anyway, you go and stay some distance away for a while.

276
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,599
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:38,299
There something more inside the package

278
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:41,999
-that the T-shirts were in. -What?

279
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:46,099
Isn't this the receipt of the T-shirts when they were bought?

280
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,199
The number of T-shirts that were bought match too.

281
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,799
A receipt?

282
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,399
Yes.

283
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,799
There's a receipt of the T-shirt for the package

284
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,799
with one T-shirt inside!

285
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,599
They seem to be inside the other packages too!

286
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,699
-What? -Look.

287
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,599
Certainly, the date shown on the receipt

288
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,799
and the date on the courier invoice match,

289
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,599
so we can tell that it was sent the same day it was bought.

290
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,399
Since the receipt is ripped,

291
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,899
it's impossible to tell where the item was bought.

292
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:26,799
But something is in view only on the receipt

293
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,099
for the T-shirts bought last week.

294
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,999
See, it wasn't ripped off clean enough,

295
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,799
so a mark of something is in view.

296
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,099
This is...

297
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:39,899
It's the mark of the Beika Department Store here!

298
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,499
Besides, doesn't it bother you that all the items were

299
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,299
bought at the same time, 12:28 pm?

300
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,499
I see! That's why the bomb man

301
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:57,199
is so sure that the sender is on this floor!

302
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,299
Because he found out that the sender

303
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,199
was buying the T-shirts here afternoon!

304
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,599
Wait a sec.

305
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,999
But why is this sports item floor?

306
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,599
Maybe because this T-shirt is an underwear?

307
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,799
"Underwear" -It's written on the receipt too.

308
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,099
You know, it's a polyester wear that is worn

309
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,099
when jogging that sucks up perspiration and dries quickly!

310
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,799
I get it!

311
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,899
Do you know where this is sold?

312
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,299
I think it's sold in the fitness wear section.

313
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,999
Please take us there!

314
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,299
Yes, sir. This way.

315
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,699
Strange.

316
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,999
The receipts till two weeks ago are torn,

317
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,599
so you can't tell where the items were bought.

318
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,299
Why did the sender make such a mistake just this week.

319
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,799
Besides...

320
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,999
What's the matter, Conan?

321
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,899
Did you notice something again?

322
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,399
Oh, yes...

323
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:01,999
I was thinking that this receipt is strange.

324
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,099
Strange?

325
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,499
Because... Look.

326
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,499
If the sender wanted to hide the place,

327
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,999
he could've just torn off the upper left part,

328
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,599
but the upper right part is torn off too.

329
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,399
Maybe this person is just not too reliable?

330
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,799
Even the T-shirts are folded messily.

331
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,899
-What? The way they're folded? -Yes.

332
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:28,099
See! There's a strange crease on this one T-shirt.

333
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:31,399
If you fold this T-shirt, according to the crease...

334
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,699
This is how it looks.

335
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,999
This is...

336
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:39,699
Couldn't it be...

337
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,999
What shall we do? Shall we force entry?

338
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,699
No, wait.

339
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:51,699
It seems that the bomb man said that if the police approach,

340
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:54,499
he would set the bomb off.

341
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:55,899
But...

342
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,199
According to the informant, the bombs are...

343
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,199
We can't rely on that information.

344
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:04,199
They may have said that just because they want to be safe.

345
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,599
We've got no choice now but to wait

346
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,099
for the bomb man to make his move.

347
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,199
Hey.

348
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:16,299
How long do I have to wait?

349
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:19,199
For a phantom that's not even around.

350
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,499
Hold horses, Chianti.

351
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:23,499
The info we got of a man who resembles Akai,

352
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,899
is going into the department store is certain.

353
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,799
I'm going to check with my own eyes

354
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,499
whether that guy is really a phantom or not.

355
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:35,599
If it turns out that he isn't a phantom,

356
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,799
in that exact moment,

357
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,599
you're going to become a phantom.

358
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,099
Kir.

359
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:08,399
Transform!

360
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:11,799
I'm so overjoyed I can't contain it.

361
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,899
Because then, I could kill him all over again.

362
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:20,599
Wait, Dad. That's right near the bomb.

363
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,199
I won't allow the bombs to explode.

364
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:28,599
In the name of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

365
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,099
Next Conan,

366
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:33,556
"Black Time Limit Closes In"

367
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:51,051
Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,251
"T-shirt"

369
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,551
There's no time left! Where's the culprit!

370
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:56,951
Darn it!

371
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,039
That's not it?
