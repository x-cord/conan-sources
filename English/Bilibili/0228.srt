1
00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:20.832
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.732
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:24.632
The potter's wheel turns at the pottery making class.

4
00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:26.632
Everyone is curious about the words on the tea cup.

5
00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:28.132
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:32.132
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:02.568
"Murder At The Pottery Making Class (Part 1)"

9
00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:04.868
Hey Ran, look.

10
00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:07.768
Ta-da!

11
00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:09.668
Kyoku Shin?

12
00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:12.468
Don't tell me you've started taking karate lessons?

13
00:02:12.468 --> 00:02:13.968
Good grief, take a closer look!

14
00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:16.868
Can't you read? It says Kyogoku Makoto.

15
00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.968
I was just kidding.

16
00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:20.768
Isn't this the tea cup you made

17
00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:23.268
in the pottery class you've started going to?

18
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.568
For goodness sakes.

19
00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.268
But Sonoko,

20
00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:28.468
are you going to give this to him?

21
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.368
Isn't this a little small?

22
00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.568
I know. That one's mine.

23
00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:35.768
The one for Makoto...

24
00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:37.168
Right here!

25
00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:42.168
It's huge.

26
00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:44.568
But why's your name on it?

27
00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.468
The answer's so obvious.

28
00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.568
The man I love is in a country far, far away...

29
00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.568
The only way I can make him remember me

30
00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:55.668
is through those far spaced telephone calls.

31
00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:01.468
And that's where this tea cup handmade by Sonoko comes in!

32
00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:04.368
He won't be able to forget me with this, now will he?

33
00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:07.968
But Sonoko, didn't you send him a sweater before?

34
00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:09.668
The one you bought at the store.

35
00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.168
-Oh, that. I changed my mind. -Huh?

36
00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.868
You were right, Ran. It's not fight to cheat.

37
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:16.368
And besides, no matter how hard I work on a sweater,

38
00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:19.068
he can only use it in the winter.

39
00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:22.168
But take a tea cup, he can use it every day, right?

40
00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.768
Well, that's true.

41
00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:27.068
Besides, I guess I'm worried.

42
00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:29.568
Makoto's very kind.

43
00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:30.968
I'm afraid some girl will come along

44
00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:32.868
and take advantage of him.

45
00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:35.568
For instance, there could be a lonely widow

46
00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:37.168
who's just lost her beloved husband

47
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:39.568
and Makoto says something kind to comfort her

48
00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:42.068
and she ends up stalking him...

49
00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:50.968
What a cruel person.

50
00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:52.968
To widow such a beautiful woman as yourself

51
00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:55.768
in order to pay for his sins...

52
00:03:58.168 --> 00:03:59.668
Young detective...

53
00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:08.868
My lady.

54
00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:11.468
If it pleases you, you may cry inside my arms.

55
00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:24.668
No, you mustn't.

56
00:04:24.668 --> 00:04:29.168
But young detective, I...

57
00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.868
My lady.

58
00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:36.068
Ran?

59
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:38.768
What's the matter, Ran?

60
00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:40.968
Hey, Sonoko! Didn't you say

61
00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:44.068
you were going to that pottery class every Sunday?

62
00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:46.068
Yes, but why?

63
00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:48.768
What is it? Are you interested in it?

64
00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:50.768
Well, yes, a little.

65
00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:56.368
"Three weeks later"

66
00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.968
You're pretty good for a beginner.

67
00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:06.868
Mr. Mino.

68
00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:10.868
Too bad though, those letters spoiled that cup.

69
00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:12.868
What does it mean anyway?

70
00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:16.668
Well... it doesn't really mean anything.

71
00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:19.568
I see. Well, keep up the good work!

72
00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:21.368
Come on, what was it? What did you write?

73
00:05:21.368 --> 00:05:23.368
It's a secret. Top secret!

74
00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:27.068
You didn't, by chance, write "I love Shinichi", did you?

75
00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:28.968
Of course I didn't!

76
00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:31.668
-Then, let me see it! -No!

77
00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:33.568
Little boy, what are you doing here?

78
00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:35.168
I'm not doing anything.

79
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.968
Did you come with somebody?

80
00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:39.068
Attention, everyone!

81
00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:41.168
Does anyone know this child?

82
00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:42.568
Conan?

83
00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:46.068
Why did you come here?

84
00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:49.268
Don't tell me you followed us here.

85
00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:52.468
Uncle Kogoro asked me to come here and check on things.

86
00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:53.768
That's strange.

87
00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:56.668
Dad came here last week to look around.

88
00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:59.468
I mean...

89
00:05:59.468 --> 00:06:02.668
I get it! It was Shinichi.

90
00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:05.468
I'll bet he's here

91
00:06:05.468 --> 00:06:08.668
because Shinichi asked him to check up on us.

92
00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.968
He wants to make sure you're not fooling around on him.

93
00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:12.268
Fooling around?

94
00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:13.768
No, you're wrong!

95
00:06:13.768 --> 00:06:17.168
Shinichi wouldn't do anything that stupid.

96
00:06:18.468 --> 00:06:21.668
That's the face of someone who's been paid off.

97
00:06:21.668 --> 00:06:24.668
How much'd he pay you? 100 yen? 200 yen?

98
00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:25.768
What a cheap skate.

99
00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.868
It's no problem.

100
00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:29.768
He's come all this way.

101
00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:32.968
How about it, little boy? Do you want to making something?

102
00:06:32.968 --> 00:06:34.568
Is that all right, sir?

103
00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.768
Fine, I'll demonstrate how to do it.

104
00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:45.868
Have you met the famous Kikuemon?

105
00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:48.868
Yes. His students taught me

106
00:06:48.868 --> 00:06:51.368
their techniques and about color and things.

107
00:06:51.368 --> 00:06:52.868
Isn't that right, Ran?

108
00:06:52.868 --> 00:06:53.968
Now I understand.

109
00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:57.168
I knew you kids picked up too fast for beginners.

110
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:58.968
I really envy you.

111
00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:02.068
You're friends with a living National Treasure.

112
00:07:02.068 --> 00:07:05.568
Well, not exactly. He asked to see my father.

113
00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:08.568
But they were there, a murder took place

114
00:07:08.568 --> 00:07:11.968
and Ran's father did a brilliant job solving it, didn't he?

115
00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:15.068
Huh? He solved it, you mean?

116
00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:19.168
Oh, didn't my father tell you when he was here last week?

117
00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:21.968
The truth is, my father's name is Kogoro Mouri.

118
00:07:21.968 --> 00:07:23.968
He's a private detective.

119
00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:26.568
Yes, I've heard of him.

120
00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:28.468
Isn't he called "Sleeping Kogoro"?

121
00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:31.168
How exciting! I'm a huge fan of his!

122
00:07:31.168 --> 00:07:33.768
Boy, things are lively here today, huh?

123
00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.368
Motoo, you're back.

124
00:07:37.368 --> 00:07:39.268
I just got in.

125
00:07:39.268 --> 00:07:43.168
I'll go change and help you, father.

126
00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:45.468
Yes, sure. Thank you.

127
00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.068
What? Life insurance?

128
00:07:52.068 --> 00:07:54.168
He made you take one out?

129
00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:57.668
Yeah. My father-in-law was pestering me to sign up,

130
00:07:57.668 --> 00:07:59.968
he said just in case something happens.

131
00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:01.168
Good grief.

132
00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:03.368
I heard that at one time he was a talented potter

133
00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:06.368
and everyone thought he'd be a new leader in the field,

134
00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:07.968
but ever since his daughter died in that accident,

135
00:08:07.968 --> 00:08:11.968
he's changed and now he's just an old drunk

136
00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:13.468
that likes to play with mud.

137
00:08:13.468 --> 00:08:15.868
Aren't you being terribly cold

138
00:08:15.868 --> 00:08:18.668
to your late beloved wife and her father?

139
00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:21.268
Beloved my foot!

140
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:23.668
I was going to divorce her

141
00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:25.268
as soon as I got my hands on as much money

142
00:08:25.268 --> 00:08:27.068
as I could from selling the things the old man made

143
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:29.168
but she went and died on me, just like that.

144
00:08:29.168 --> 00:08:30.668
Don't let it bother you so much.

145
00:08:30.668 --> 00:08:33.268
Mr. Mino's not young. He won't live much longer.

146
00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:36.968
Yeah. When he dies, let's fold up this operation

147
00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:39.168
and open our own place.

148
00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:41.568
If we sell the pieces in the warehouse,

149
00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:44.468
I'm sure they'll bring a good price.

150
00:08:44.468 --> 00:08:47.668
By the way, who's the benefactor on that policy?

151
00:08:47.668 --> 00:08:50.468
You, of course.

152
00:08:50.468 --> 00:08:55.068
You've always been my woman. In the past and even now.

153
00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.368
I'm so happy!

154
00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:59.968
Then, you won't mind dying to repay my debts?

155
00:09:06.268 --> 00:09:08.468
-Father! -Mr. Mino.

156
00:09:08.468 --> 00:09:10.268
Kikuyo, here you are.

157
00:09:10.268 --> 00:09:12.368
I'm going to go check the kiln,

158
00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:15.368
take care of the students for me.

159
00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:16.568
Yes, sir.

160
00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:21.268
Isn't this a new necktie?

161
00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:25.868
Yes. Kikuyo gave it to me last night for my birthday.

162
00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:29.768
I told her I didn't look good in beige.

163
00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:31.068
That's not true.

164
00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:34.568
I think it looks very nice around your neck.

165
00:09:37.768 --> 00:09:41.068
-Come on, Ran! Let me see it! -I said no!

166
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:45.968
Everybody's going to see it anyway when it gets fired up!

167
00:09:50.368 --> 00:09:52.768
I am so sorry! Is it broken?

168
00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:55.768
No, mine's okay.

169
00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:57.368
Then, what was that sound just now?

170
00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:59.568
Didnt' it come from the storage mom?

171
00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:01.468
I'm going to go have a look.

172
00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:02.668
Okay.

173
00:10:07.668 --> 00:10:08.768
I just want you to know!

174
00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:10.468
If you look at it, we're no longer friends!

175
00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:12.968
All right.

176
00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:23.568
Mr. Mino.

177
00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:27.368
Oh, my hand slipped and I dropped a plate.

178
00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:31.968
Thanks. Would you mind finishing up here?

179
00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:33.968
Of course not.

180
00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.768
Ouch!

181
00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:47.768
Is something wrong?

182
00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:51.468
It seems like something was mixed in with the soil.

183
00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:53.368
I guess it was a piece of the plate I cracked,

184
00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:55.868
it must've been on my clothes.

185
00:10:55.868 --> 00:10:59.068
I'll go get the first aid kit.

186
00:10:59.068 --> 00:11:00.868
Do you know where it is?

187
00:11:00.868 --> 00:11:04.368
Yes, it's on the upper right shelf in the storage room.

188
00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:07.668
Then bring it right away.

189
00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:10.868
For goodness sakes.

190
00:11:10.868 --> 00:11:12.768
Please be careful.

191
00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:16.468
To a potter, hands are most important.

192
00:11:16.468 --> 00:11:18.768
Is there something on my face?

193
00:11:18.768 --> 00:11:20.868
No, it's nothing.

194
00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:23.968
By the way, I haven't seen Motoo around.

195
00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:26.068
Now that you mention it, neither have I.

196
00:11:27.268 --> 00:11:29.068
Hey, Motoo!

197
00:11:29.068 --> 00:11:31.468
Motoo?

198
00:11:31.468 --> 00:11:33.368
He wasn't by the kilns either.

199
00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:35.068
How strange.

200
00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:37.668
This storage room's the only place we haven't looked.

201
00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:40.468
He wouldn't be in here.

202
00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:44.468
The only place you could hide in here is in that cabinet.

203
00:11:44.468 --> 00:11:47.368
Besides, I opened it just a little while ago

204
00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:50.668
to get the first aid kit and he wasn't inside.

205
00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:54.568
The cabinet...

206
00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:56.268
A piece of cloth...

207
00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:57.668
is sticking out from under the cabinet door.

208
00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:03.468
Isn't it one of the aprons you use in class?

209
00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:06.868
You're right. It's the same pattern as the one we're wearing.

210
00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:08.968
Good grief. This is like the ostrich hiding its head

211
00:12:08.968 --> 00:12:10.668
but leaving its body in plain sight.

212
00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:12.768
Come on out, the game's over.

213
00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:15.268
-Motoo. -Wait! I'll open it.

214
00:12:37.076 --> 00:12:39.976
Motoo! What's wrong, Motoo?

215
00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:42.876
-Motoo... -Snap out of it!

216
00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:44.476
Wake up, Motoo!

217
00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:46.876
-Someone call an ambulance, quick! -All right!

218
00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:50.676
I think it'd be better to call the police too.

219
00:12:50.676 --> 00:12:52.776
-What? -Hurry!

220
00:12:52.776 --> 00:12:53.776
Yes, sir!

221
00:13:00.476 --> 00:13:02.676
Motoo...

222
00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:09.076
The strangulation victim is Motoo Mino,

223
00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:11.776
31 years old, a white collar worker.

224
00:13:11.776 --> 00:13:15.176
Was he a student of this pottery making class too?

225
00:13:15.176 --> 00:13:18.676
No, he lived here.

226
00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:22.576
He was married to my daughter who died 2 years ago.

227
00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:24.776
I see. My condolences.

228
00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:29.476
My name is Muneyuki Mino. I run this pottery making class.

229
00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:32.876
She's my assistant, Kikuyo Kasama.

230
00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:36.176
Please tell me what the victim did after he got home.

231
00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:38.876
He got home around 5 pm as usual,

232
00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:41.876
then he said he was going to change into an apron

233
00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:44.076
and help me in the class.

234
00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:46.076
But some time passed and he still hadn't shown up

235
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.076
so we all went to look for him.

236
00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:51.676
Isn't that right, Kikuyo?

237
00:13:51.676 --> 00:13:52.876
Yes.

238
00:13:52.876 --> 00:13:56.576
This storage room was the only place we hadn't looked

239
00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:59.576
and then Mr. Mino opened the cabinet...

240
00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:04.576
And his body... Motoo's body...

241
00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:08.376
It's amazing that you found him there.

242
00:14:08.376 --> 00:14:09.976
You weren't playing hide and seek,

243
00:14:09.976 --> 00:14:12.276
who would've thought a person would be inside there?

244
00:14:12.276 --> 00:14:15.376
It was so obvious. The apron was sticking out.

245
00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:17.776
-Isn't that right, Ran? -Yes.

246
00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:19.076
Apron?

247
00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:20.776
It was sticking out.

248
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.576
Part of the apron he was wearing

249
00:14:22.576 --> 00:14:25.776
was sticking out from under the door.

250
00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:28.476
Do you know how long it was like that?

251
00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:30.376
No, I don't.

252
00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:32.776
I remember now. It wasn't sticking out

253
00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:35.776
when we were cleaning up the broken plate.

254
00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:37.876
What do you mean?

255
00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:41.876
I accidentally dropped a plate in front of that cabinet.

256
00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:44.176
The students heard the sound and came running,

257
00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:46.376
I asked them to clean it up for me.

258
00:14:46.376 --> 00:14:49.576
I guess I dropped it right after Motoo left the storage room

259
00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:52.776
after changing into his apron.

260
00:14:52.776 --> 00:14:56.076
Huh? You and the victim were in here together?

261
00:14:56.076 --> 00:15:00.876
Yes, the aprons are kept in this cabinet.

262
00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:04.576
That's why he always changed in here.

263
00:15:04.576 --> 00:15:07.376
See. His jacket's hanging right over there.

264
00:15:08.376 --> 00:15:11.776
There's several overalls hanging next to his jacket.

265
00:15:11.776 --> 00:15:13.276
What are these?

266
00:15:13.276 --> 00:15:15.776
Those are also for the students use.

267
00:15:15.776 --> 00:15:17.776
When making large pots and such,

268
00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:20.976
an apron isn't big enough to protect their clothing.

269
00:15:20.976 --> 00:15:25.276
I see. But I wonder what the victim was doing in here?

270
00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:27.276
Actually, while I was looking for Kikuyo,

271
00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:30.876
I happened to find her here with Motoo.

272
00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:33.076
-Is that true? -Yes.

273
00:15:33.076 --> 00:15:37.876
I was helping him change. Then Mr. Mino came in

274
00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:38.976
and he asked me to look after the class

275
00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:41.076
because he was going to the kiln.

276
00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:42.776
And then what did you do?

277
00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:45.976
I did as I was told. I went back to the classroom.

278
00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:50.976
So Mr. Mino, you were here with the victim alone.

279
00:15:50.976 --> 00:15:52.176
Is that correct?

280
00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:54.376
Wait just a minute, officer!

281
00:15:54.376 --> 00:15:57.376
You're not implying that I killed him, are you?

282
00:15:57.376 --> 00:15:58.676
Like I already told you,

283
00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:03.376
Motoo left the room before I broke the plate.

284
00:16:03.376 --> 00:16:06.776
If I'd killed him and hid his body in the cabinet,

285
00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:09.576
the students would have noticed the apron sticking out

286
00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:13.176
from under the door when they were cleaning up.

287
00:16:13.176 --> 00:16:17.276
Perhaps the apron got stuck when you came back

288
00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:22.076
and checked the body after the students had finished cleaning up.

289
00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:24.276
I don't think so.

290
00:16:24.276 --> 00:16:27.176
While we were cleaning up, Mr. Mino went to the kiln,

291
00:16:27.176 --> 00:16:29.476
and when we finished cleaning up

292
00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:31.976
and went back to the classroom,

293
00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:35.076
Mr. Mino was already there.

294
00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:39.876
After that, he was always beside Conan working on something.

295
00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:41.476
Isn't that right, Conan?

296
00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:44.676
Conan?

297
00:16:44.676 --> 00:16:46.076
Yes.

298
00:16:46.076 --> 00:16:49.176
Mr. Mino was with us the whole time

299
00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:51.376
until we found Motoo's body,

300
00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:54.076
he couldn't possibly have put the body in the cabinet.

301
00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:56.876
I see. So it must have gone like this,

302
00:16:56.876 --> 00:17:00.176
after you all had cleaned up the broken plate,

303
00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:03.776
the killer called the victim to this storage room and killed him.

304
00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:07.076
Or the murder could have taken place somewhere else

305
00:17:07.076 --> 00:17:10.576
and the body brought back here when no one was looking.

306
00:17:10.576 --> 00:17:15.176
I just remembered! Maybe Kikuyo saw the killer's face.

307
00:17:15.176 --> 00:17:16.176
What?

308
00:17:16.176 --> 00:17:19.276
I cut my finger while I was working

309
00:17:19.276 --> 00:17:24.476
and Kikuyo came to the storage room to get the first aid kit.

310
00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:27.476
That was just before we began our search for Motoo

311
00:17:27.476 --> 00:17:30.276
so I just thought that maybe...

312
00:17:30.276 --> 00:17:32.176
Did you see anyone?

313
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.676
No, no one.

314
00:17:33.676 --> 00:17:36.276
Where is the first aid kit kept?

315
00:17:36.276 --> 00:17:39.376
On the upper right shelf of that cabinet.

316
00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:42.576
What? So you're saying you opened the cabinet?

317
00:17:42.576 --> 00:17:45.176
Yes, I did but there was nobody inside.

318
00:17:45.176 --> 00:17:46.476
That's the truth!

319
00:17:46.476 --> 00:17:49.476
Inspector! After examining the victim's neck,

320
00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:52.676
I've determined the victim was strangled

321
00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:55.476
with this necktie we found around his neck.

322
00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.476
But that is strange.

323
00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:01.276
Why did the killer tie the necktie around the neck?

324
00:18:01.276 --> 00:18:07.076
How awful. Kikuyo gave that necktie to him for his birthday.

325
00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:10.676
I... I didn't give that to him!

326
00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:15.076
You didn't? He told me you did though.

327
00:18:15.076 --> 00:18:17.076
What is the meaning of this?

328
00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:19.876
Well... He said he didn't know where it came from,

329
00:18:19.876 --> 00:18:23.776
he found it in his bag along with a birthday card.

330
00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:26.376
He really believed it was from me,

331
00:18:26.376 --> 00:18:28.476
he thought I was just too shy to admit it.

332
00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:32.076
Now that you mention it, he was mumbling something

333
00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:34.076
when he walked out of the storage room.

334
00:18:35.676 --> 00:18:38.976
Something about money turning people into monsters

335
00:18:38.976 --> 00:18:41.576
and that his birthday had just come

336
00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:44.976
but he would be eaten by a monster.

337
00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:46.676
Eaten by a monster?

338
00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:51.076
The truth is, officer, I want to tell you about that...

339
00:18:57.476 --> 00:18:59.876
All right, Takagi. Check up on that right away.

340
00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:01.076
Yes, sir!

341
00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:04.676
Excuse me. Do you have a pen or something?

342
00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:06.576
Mine's run out of ink.

343
00:19:06.576 --> 00:19:07.776
Of course.

344
00:19:07.776 --> 00:19:09.476
I'll go get one.

345
00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:12.476
I'm sure there's some in the classroom.

346
00:19:26.076 --> 00:19:28.276
Aren't those scissors?

347
00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:32.176
Didn't the man from the crime lab ask for a pen?

348
00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:35.376
Yes, you're so right.

349
00:19:35.376 --> 00:19:37.976
And will you take a look at that? That's my cup.

350
00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:40.576
It's almost finished.

351
00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:42.876
See?

352
00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:45.376
You really like pottery making, don't you?

353
00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:47.776
Yes, I love it!

354
00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:49.576
Besides, I want to finish this up

355
00:19:49.576 --> 00:19:51.476
because I don't want to be like that man who died

356
00:19:51.476 --> 00:19:53.776
and leave things half done.

357
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.376
Half done?

358
00:19:55.376 --> 00:19:57.276
You mean you didn't notice?

359
00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:59.276
His shirt sleeves were rolled up

360
00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:01.576
but the length was different.

361
00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:02.576
Huh?

362
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.076
You know what it looks like?

363
00:20:04.076 --> 00:20:06.676
It looks like he was attacked

364
00:20:06.676 --> 00:20:09.476
while he was changing into his apron and helping in class.

365
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:15.076
But sonny, maybe one sleeve got pulled down

366
00:20:15.076 --> 00:20:17.176
while he struggled with the killer.

367
00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:19.076
That's right!

368
00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:22.676
Then the killer must've pulled his necktie too.

369
00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:23.876
His necktie?

370
00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:28.376
Yes, his necktie pin was really low.

371
00:20:28.376 --> 00:20:31.476
And the button hole was stretched out too.

372
00:20:32.976 --> 00:20:36.176
But maybe the necktie pin was a little too low.

373
00:20:36.176 --> 00:20:40.376
Maybe he likes putting it there.

374
00:20:40.376 --> 00:20:42.276
And maybe it's his style

375
00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:44.676
to wear shirts with different length sleeves.

376
00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:48.376
But sir, you like both the left and right evenly, don't you?

377
00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:52.276
I mean when Mr. Motoo fell out, you were standing on the left

378
00:20:52.276 --> 00:20:55.076
but you deliberately went around to the right side and yelled.

379
00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:59.576
You actually wanted to fix the length of his sleeve, didn't you?

380
00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:07.676
Also, his apron was sticking out from the right side of the door

381
00:21:07.676 --> 00:21:12.576
and it would've been natural to open just the right side

382
00:21:12.576 --> 00:21:16.576
but you opened both sides at the same time.

383
00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:20.976
Yes, I guess you're right.

384
00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:24.576
I like things even.

385
00:21:25.376 --> 00:21:27.276
I'm finished!

386
00:21:27.276 --> 00:21:30.276
It's my tea cup! Pretty good, huh?

387
00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:33.976
Yes, that's really quite good.

388
00:21:33.976 --> 00:21:35.376
But you know, sonny,

389
00:21:35.376 --> 00:21:37.976
it appears as if you're worried about something.

390
00:21:37.976 --> 00:21:40.676
You're either hiding some deep, dark secret

391
00:21:40.676 --> 00:21:44.376
or debating about something important.

392
00:21:44.376 --> 00:21:46.976
I'm right, aren't I?

393
00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:49.876
The soul never lies.

394
00:21:49.876 --> 00:21:52.176
You're very good, sir.

395
00:21:53.276 --> 00:21:56.276
I think you should take care of your own affairs

396
00:21:56.276 --> 00:22:00.376
before meddling in other people's.

397
00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:04.776
But this is the cup you made, sir.

398
00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:05.776
What?

399
00:22:05.776 --> 00:22:09.676
While you were busy looking through the desk,

400
00:22:09.676 --> 00:22:12.276
I put yours over here.

401
00:22:12.276 --> 00:22:15.476
I thought for sure you'd catch on.

402
00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:18.776
And if this is your tea cup,

403
00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:22.776
then you must be hiding something.

404
00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.476
Mr. Mino, what are you hiding?

405
00:22:29.376 --> 00:22:30.676
Tell me.

406
00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:05.776
"Next Episode" -Where can I find the evidence?

407
00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:09.476
Sorry, kid.

408
00:24:09.476 --> 00:24:11.276
A necktie.

409
00:24:11.276 --> 00:24:12.476
This is...

410
00:24:12.476 --> 00:24:17.776
Miss Kikuyo, it seems you have debts totalling 10,000,000 yen.

411
00:24:17.776 --> 00:24:20.576
Yes, I do. I found a nice condominium.

412
00:24:21.576 --> 00:24:23.876
I've finally found it.

413
00:24:23.876 --> 00:24:26.676
Proof only a professional potter would leave behind.

414
00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:33.576
Next Conan, "Murder At The Pottery Making Class (Part 2)"

415
00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:36.694
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:36.694 --> 00:24:38.594
"Necktie pin"

417
00:24:38.594 --> 00:24:39.894
In the next episode, the tea cup is fired up!

418
00:24:39.894 --> 00:24:42.194
Pottery and crime are alike, once broken, it's the end.

419
00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:43.394
Hey, that was pretty good!
