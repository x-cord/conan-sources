1
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.140
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.840
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.440
A killing occurs in a magician's house.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.740
Magic, gimmick or trick.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.840
Conan and Heiji solve it, both together!

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:56.925
After going through

10
00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:59.225
some incident at Dogo Hoshikawa's magic show,

11
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:04.225
we were invited to Mr. Masakage, a legendary magician's house.

12
00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:06.425
Also, it happened to be the day

13
00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:11.725
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared 10 years ago.

14
00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:15.225
We were at Mr. Masakage's house with his pupils.

15
00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:18.725
If we're really going to do a show together,

16
00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:22.325
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

17
00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:23.725
What?

18
00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:27.125
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

19
00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.325
and tie myself to it.

20
00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.025
I'll have the audience fire it up,

21
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:36.925
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

22
00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:40.825
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

23
00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.125
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

24
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.225
Okay, I found it.

25
00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:06.125
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (House)"

26
00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:10.825
Oh god. What was that scream?

27
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:12.825
Was that the second floor?

28
00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:15.725
What's wrong?

29
00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.425
Tenko's in trouble!

30
00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.125
She's bleeding from her head. She's not moving!

31
00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:21.425
Are you serious?

32
00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:26.725
Shoots. Her body's already cold.

33
00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:28.025
Oh no.

34
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.725
Tenko!

35
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:32.125
Oh my god.

36
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:36.025
It looks like it's been more than 30 minutes since she died.

37
00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.425
So, you two found her?

38
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.425
Well, Mr. Hoshikawa was with us too.

39
00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:42.625
He just went into that room to call the police and ambulance.

40
00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.125
Will you please hurry? Please!

41
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.325
Okay. Yeah.

42
00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:52.625
Hey, Hattori, look.

43
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.425
The window is open.

44
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:02.625
If the murderer did jump off the window into the shrubbery,

45
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:06.025
he could easily run away from the rear gate.

46
00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.725
Heiji, come over here!

47
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:09.425
What is it?

48
00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:11.825
You gotta see what happened to the room next to the one

49
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:14.225
Tenko was found lying on the floor!

50
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:15.425
What?

51
00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:18.325
What the heck is this?

52
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.425
Tell me, what is this room?

53
00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:25.125
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

54
00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.225
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

55
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.825
Is there anything that's really important in this room?

56
00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:32.125
No. It's mostly clippings from books and magazines

57
00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.325
that you can find in any bookstore.

58
00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:37.425
He used to show us those clippings.

59
00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:43.125
If any, it would be the file which even I wasn't allowed to see.

60
00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:49.325
It is Mr. Masakage's notes on all the gimmicks about his original tricks.

61
00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:51.725
We call it "Masakage's notes".

62
00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:55.325
Masakage's notes.

63
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:04.225
Hey, look who's here.

64
00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:05.325
When did you get here?

65
00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.125
Oh, just this morning!

66
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:10.325
I came here just to see a magic show today

67
00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:13.325
because this stupid girl said

68
00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:17.225
"I feel like watching some miracles" or whatever.

69
00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.425
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

70
00:05:19.425 --> 00:05:23.925
Actually, the fact that I always see you at crime scenes is a miracle.

71
00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.225
All right. So why were you in this house?

72
00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.425
We met three magicians at the magic show,

73
00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:31.525
and they invited us to their master's house, which is here.

74
00:05:31.525 --> 00:05:36.125
And then, one of them happened to be murdered by somebody.

75
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.525
So the lady who was murdered was also a magician?

76
00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:41.025
Her name is Tenko Himemiya.

77
00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.625
She was pretty famous outside Japan.

78
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.825
We were just planning to have a collaboration magic show

79
00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:49.125
all the three of us together.

80
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:51.325
But I never thought it was gonna be like this.

81
00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:53.925
Okay. So who found her first?

82
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.725
Me, and those ladies over there.

83
00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:02.025
Dinner was ready, so we went to call Tenko.

84
00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:05.725
This is her master's room. We thought she might be here.

85
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:10.625
When we came up here, there was nothing in the hallway at first.

86
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:14.625
But when I turned on the light since it was dark, the breaker went down,

87
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:18.225
and after the light turned back on,

88
00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:20.925
Tenko was lying at the end of this hallway, just over there.

89
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.225
I see.

90
00:06:22.225 --> 00:06:24.125
The fact that this hallway was dark

91
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:25.925
was part of this homicide plan, I think.

92
00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:28.725
The killer loosened the light bulb beforehand.

93
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:32.325
So if somebody comes to the hallway, turn on the light

94
00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.525
and cause a blackout.

95
00:06:35.325 --> 00:06:39.325
I found that some work was done on this switch to trigger a short circuit.

96
00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:41.225
Also, beside the dead body

97
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:44.325
is the reference room where the important file was stored.

98
00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:47.125
And there is no window in that room which people can go in and out of.

99
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.725
One more thing, the window in Mr. Masakage's room was left open.

100
00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:52.425
Considering all these,

101
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:56.225
it is likely that the person manipulated the switch

102
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.225
so he can safely steal Masakage's notes and run away.

103
00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:00.925
To run away?

104
00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:02.825
That's right. If the breaker has goes down,

105
00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:06.225
somebody has to reset the breaker on the first floor, right?

106
00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:11.225
While somebody is downstairs, the murderer jumps out of

107
00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:15.325
the window of Mr. Masakage's room and runs away.

108
00:07:16.525 --> 00:07:20.325
But it didn't go like the murderer planned.

109
00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:24.125
In this house, there's usually only one woman living alone.

110
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.525
But today, she had seven guests.

111
00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:30.225
Not only that, Tenko came into the reference room

112
00:07:30.225 --> 00:07:32.325
without turning on the light,

113
00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:37.125
and saw the murderer, so he had to kill her.

114
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:41.625
After that, the murderer went back to searching for Masakage's notes.

115
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:44.925
But now, other visitors came by, Kazuha and the others

116
00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:46.525
came up to call Tenko.

117
00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:48.325
Fortunately for him, the breaker had gone down.

118
00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:51.625
So he put Tenko's dead body in the hallway and ran away.

119
00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:54.325
There was a plenty of time to run away

120
00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:58.025
because the people were struck with the dead victim.

121
00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:01.125
-I see. -Well, if you think logically,

122
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:03.625
it seems that an outsider committed this crime.

123
00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.825
Although he failed to steal the notes,

124
00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.425
-there is one possible suspect among us. -Among us?

125
00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:12.925
It's the person who caused the blackout. Mr. Hoshikawa!

126
00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.025
What?

127
00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:16.525
You were here during the blackout.

128
00:08:16.525 --> 00:08:18.425
It wasn't that hard for you

129
00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:21.625
to move Tenko from the reference room to the hallway,

130
00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.725
then go back to where the girls were

131
00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:27.325
-before the lights turned back on, right? -That's impossible! I think.

132
00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:29.225
-Right? -Yeah.

133
00:08:30.525 --> 00:08:31.725
Because...

134
00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:36.025
We were holding Mr. Hoshikawa while the power was out.

135
00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:38.525
Holding him?

136
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:40.625
-Why? -Why?

137
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.525
What do you mean why?

138
00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:45.325
Because it was dark and scary.

139
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:48.725
Are you sure it was this guy?

140
00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:50.325
Yes, I am!

141
00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:56.825
I was holding Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this.

142
00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:59.825
And I was holding Kazuha like this.

143
00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:03.925
See? Mr. Hoshikawa couldn't do it!

144
00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:07.525
It's just like the case of Doctor Araide, isn't it, Conan?

145
00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:09.725
-Yes. -Idiot.

146
00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:11.925
I mean it was just a mere blackout, and you're not a kid anymore!

147
00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:15.925
Well, Heiji. They're girls. They couldn't help it.

148
00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:18.025
Huh? What's with you?

149
00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:23.625
By the way, where were you during the blackout?

150
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:27.725
I was taking a nap in the room right below the bookroom.

151
00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:33.425
I went into his room to wake him up. That was when the power went out.

152
00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:36.825
Okay, then there's no way you guys murdered the victim.

153
00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:40.425
So, it is likely that the murderer was an outsider?

154
00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:43.525
Anyway, could you tell us more about that important file?

155
00:09:43.525 --> 00:09:46.825
It's my husband, Mr. Masakage's notes

156
00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.825
and it is filled ideas on his original tricks.

157
00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:51.925
Oh! I remember

158
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:55.025
I used to watch Mr. Masakage's show on TV when I was a kid!

159
00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:59.425
His magic included beautiful assistants and fantastic illusions!

160
00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:02.125
I've have heard that too.

161
00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:06.025
God, I still remember it!

162
00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:09.925
Actually, I was his assistant.

163
00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:14.025
Oh, I see. Where is he now?

164
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:17.625
Somebody told me he disappeared.

165
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.225
Is that true?

166
00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:22.225
Yes. It was today 10 years ago.

167
00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.725
He used to go on outings suddenly without notice.

168
00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.325
So I wasn't really worried at first.

169
00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:30.525
Half a year past but he never came back.

170
00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:34.925
Hoshikawa, Handa and Tenko are live-in students.

171
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:38.125
But they left and became independent.

172
00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:41.225
So this is actually our reunion for the first time in 10 years.

173
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:44.125
So you're the one who called everybody?

174
00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:46.425
Actually, it was me.

175
00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:47.825
I told them to come here so that we could discuss

176
00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:49.825
the collaborative magic show together.

177
00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:53.225
Well, I used to come here on this day every year

178
00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:56.225
and have dinner with Mrs. Masakage.

179
00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:57.225
All right.

180
00:10:57.225 --> 00:11:02.925
Was there anybody who hated or held a grudge on Mr. Masakage?

181
00:11:04.925 --> 00:11:08.425
According to Hattori's deduction,

182
00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:12.025
it is likely that the murderer knew that Mrs. Masakage is living alone,

183
00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:16.825
as well as being knowledgeable about the layout of the room and such.

184
00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:21.625
Mr. Masakage's notes would've been worth quite a price, I would figure.

185
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:24.325
Would somebody who would've been interested in getting a hold of it

186
00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:25.625
ever have come by here?

187
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:28.325
But master is not the kind of person

188
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:30.625
anyone would want to hold a grudge against.

189
00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:34.525
Actually, there was a man

190
00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:38.325
who visited here many times, saying that he wanted to see my husband.

191
00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:40.525
I just thought he was one of his fans, so I let him in.

192
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.725
But as soon as he went into my husband's room.

193
00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:44.325
He started yelling,

194
00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:49.125
"Come out, you thief! You stole my trick!"

195
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.325
Like this.

196
00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:55.325
Handa, I told you about this story before, didn't I?

197
00:11:55.325 --> 00:11:57.625
Yes, I think you did.

198
00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:59.925
What did the man look like?

199
00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:03.225
Oh, it was 5 years ago. I don't really remember how he looked.

200
00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:07.825
The layout of the house seems to have changed a bit after that incident.

201
00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:09.925
Although it could just be my imagination.

202
00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:11.825
The layout has changed?

203
00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:14.125
Ran, what's wrong?

204
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:18.725
I just thought something's changed before and after Tenko was murdered

205
00:12:18.725 --> 00:12:21.425
but I don't know what it is.

206
00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:23.125
Oh, you think so too?

207
00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:24.925
What? You too?

208
00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:28.025
Yeah, but I don't know what it is either.

209
00:12:28.025 --> 00:12:31.325
Maybe I should call Shinichi and ask him what it is.

210
00:12:31.325 --> 00:12:32.625
Oh?

211
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:34.925
I thought his number was unlisted?

212
00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:36.825
Yeah, but he finally gave it to me!

213
00:12:36.825 --> 00:12:39.725
Shoots! I didn't turn it off! Where's it?

214
00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:41.525
Okay, then call him and ask.

215
00:12:41.525 --> 00:12:44.325
Kudo is a genius!

216
00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:46.025
If you tell him about this case,

217
00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:48.025
he'll probably say that he's gonna solve it with Heiji...

218
00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:52.825
Sorry, I think I'm going to keep this cell phone

219
00:12:52.825 --> 00:12:54.525
until we crack the case.

220
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:58.725
-Hey! Heiji! Give it back to her! -Hey!

221
00:13:00.725 --> 00:13:03.725
Okay. Now, let's hear the truth behind this murder.

222
00:13:03.725 --> 00:13:06.925
Right, Mr. Genius?

223
00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:10.125
What do you mean, "truth"?

224
00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:11.425
You liar!

225
00:13:11.425 --> 00:13:14.525
You said it a while ago. Something that's bugging you.

226
00:13:14.525 --> 00:13:16.125
Yeah. Just a little.

227
00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:21.225
First of all, why did the murderer choose today of all the other days?

228
00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:26.425
Yeah. Today is the day Mr. Masakage disappeared 10 years ago.

229
00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:29.525
If the murderer was familiar with the inside details of this house,

230
00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:32.325
that person should've been aware that

231
00:13:32.325 --> 00:13:34.025
Mrs. Masakage would not be alone today

232
00:13:34.025 --> 00:13:36.425
because Mr. Handa had been visiting her every year.

233
00:13:36.425 --> 00:13:39.025
Secondly, why can't we find the splattered blood

234
00:13:39.025 --> 00:13:40.525
of the victim, Tenko anywhere?

235
00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:42.025
If my deduction is correct,

236
00:13:42.025 --> 00:13:44.625
she must've been murdered in the hallway or the reference room,

237
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:46.225
but there's no blood whatsoever in these places.

238
00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:47.725
You're right.

239
00:13:48.425 --> 00:13:51.925
Destruction of evidence seems too well-prepared

240
00:13:51.925 --> 00:13:54.325
for a murder that happened accidentally.

241
00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:56.625
Yeah. We should be able to find blood

242
00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:57.925
between the tiles on the floor

243
00:13:57.925 --> 00:14:01.425
or in between the spaces of the wooden pillar.

244
00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:02.525
And thirdly...

245
00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:04.425
Oh, you mean there's some more?

246
00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:06.125
Kazuha.

247
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.925
I don't know what it is, but something's bugging me.

248
00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:15.825
You know, she's acting frivolous, lighthearted and all that.

249
00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:18.725
It just irritates me. I can't concentrate on my deduction.

250
00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.325
Why is it?

251
00:14:33.689 --> 00:14:35.289
Why is it?

252
00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:44.889
Look, I don't think it's about her just being frivolous or lighthearted.

253
00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:47.889
It's more than her just being frivolous and lighthearted

254
00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:49.789
with another guy, don't you think?

255
00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.789
Oh yeah! You're right! That must be it!

256
00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:53.689
How did you know, Kudo?

257
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:54.689
Huh?

258
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:57.289
-What? -Kudo?

259
00:14:57.289 --> 00:14:59.689
Hattori! What's wrong with you?

260
00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:03.589
No...

261
00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:05.989
Dude, I mean! It's the dude.

262
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.889
That dude on TV said the temperature went up to 39 degrees yesterday.

263
00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:10.389
It was hot, wasn't it?

264
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:13.489
Oh yeah, I remember I saw something like that on TV

265
00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:15.389
at the airport this morning.

266
00:15:15.789 --> 00:15:19.089
All right. So, why am I feeling irritated? Don't you know?

267
00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:22.389
Kudo.

268
00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.289
Hattori. You know what?

269
00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:30.989
Cause you are a kid.

270
00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:32.689
Gosh!

271
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:37.389
I'm not letting a brat call me a kid, you brat!

272
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:39.189
Oh, Heiji!

273
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.989
What're you getting all upset over a child for?

274
00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:44.689
Oh, poor Conan!

275
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:46.689
What do you mean poor Conan?

276
00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:48.889
He's the one who started talking nonsense!

277
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:51.789
Oh, come on, you're the one.

278
00:15:51.789 --> 00:15:56.489
So, besides your husband's pupils, Mr. Hoshikawa and Mr. Handa

279
00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:00.989
were there any other magician friends of your husband who visited you?

280
00:16:00.989 --> 00:16:04.989
Well, 10 years ago, until my husband disappeared,

281
00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:07.589
many people had been visiting this house,

282
00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:09.389
so I can't really tell who was who.

283
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:12.489
Since my husband designed and built this house,

284
00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:16.289
he would even invite the people he just met at work over too,

285
00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:17.889
wanting to show this house off.

286
00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:20.789
I see. So he designed and built this house.

287
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:24.389
Yes. In fact, he showed them not only this house,

288
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:27.189
but also the tricks that could be done only in this house.

289
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:30.689
Therefore, even more people came here after hearing about it.

290
00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:34.489
The Christmas tree magic was a really popular one.

291
00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:37.289
Especially during the Christmas season, you know.

292
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.289
Is anything wrong?

293
00:16:41.289 --> 00:16:43.089
No.

294
00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:47.689
Sorry. This has nothing to do with the case, I guess.

295
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:50.689
Okay. So, could you tell us what kind of trick it was?

296
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:52.689
Well...

297
00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:56.089
Only master can explain that trick.

298
00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:59.189
But since he's disappeared,

299
00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:04.089
there's no way we can figure out how it works.

300
00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:07.789
The man that you mentioned visited you 5 years ago.

301
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:10.589
Could you tell us more in detail about him?

302
00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:19.189
If he really said that your husband Mr. Masakage stole his trick,

303
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:22.289
then it is probable that he really wanted to see the Masakage notes,

304
00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:26.189
because that's where he kept his ideas regarding the magic tricks.

305
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:31.389
If we assume the murderer sneaked into this house to steal the notes,

306
00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:33.989
and silenced Tenko, since she saw that person

307
00:17:33.989 --> 00:17:37.189
searching for the notes in the reference room.

308
00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.689
It's plausible to think that

309
00:17:38.689 --> 00:17:41.589
the visitor from 5 years ago is the killer.

310
00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.889
His height or something characteristic about his face.

311
00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:46.789
Anything. Anything you can remember, Mrs. Masakage.

312
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:50.089
Yeah, I'm trying but I can't.

313
00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.589
Do you remember whether he was Japanese or not, right?

314
00:17:52.589 --> 00:17:53.989
Oh yeah.

315
00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:58.389
He was speaking fluent Japanese, and his hair was black.

316
00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:03.089
I don't know what kind of hair style he had since he was wearing a hat.

317
00:18:03.089 --> 00:18:08.189
Also, he had sunglasses on and his face was covered with a beard.

318
00:18:08.189 --> 00:18:12.789
So I couldn't really tell how he looked. I really can't.

319
00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:17.689
He seemed to be taller than me though.

320
00:18:17.689 --> 00:18:21.689
A face with a beard, wearing a hat, and sunglasses, huh?

321
00:18:21.689 --> 00:18:24.789
Maybe he was disguising himself.

322
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:26.589
Probably.

323
00:18:26.589 --> 00:18:29.089
Anyway, have you checked whether Masakage's note

324
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:30.589
have actually been stolen or not?

325
00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:32.989
No. But, I heard that he kept it put away somewhere

326
00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:34.589
in the reference room,

327
00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:36.289
I never knew exactly where it was though.

328
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:38.789
Maybe it wasn't there from the beginning

329
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.289
because master took it with him when he disappeared.

330
00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:43.789
Okay, then, we should take a look at the photo albums!

331
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.089
Photo albums?

332
00:18:45.089 --> 00:18:46.789
There should be pictures

333
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:50.089
since there were so many visitors in this house, right?

334
00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:52.289
Maybe we can find the man in those pictures!

335
00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:54.689
Or at least someone that looks like him.

336
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.189
I see.

337
00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:58.289
Mrs. Masakage, where do you keep your photo albums?

338
00:18:58.289 --> 00:19:00.089
In my husband's room.

339
00:19:02.189 --> 00:19:04.189
What is this, Mrs. Masakage?

340
00:19:04.189 --> 00:19:07.189
This door cannot be opened completely.

341
00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:11.289
Oh, that. My husband wanted to make his room big,

342
00:19:11.289 --> 00:19:13.889
so he narrowed the hallway.

343
00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:15.689
He must hate a small rooms.

344
00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:19.189
He was a great magician, but certainly not a great architect.

345
00:19:19.189 --> 00:19:20.589
I see that.

346
00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:23.189
Kudo.

347
00:19:23.189 --> 00:19:24.389
Yeah.

348
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.789
What are you guys doing there?

349
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:27.789
Oh.

350
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:29.789
You're not coming in?

351
00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:39.589
How is it, Mrs. Masakage?

352
00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:42.789
Did you find anybody that looks like the man you met 5 years ago?

353
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:44.589
No. Not yet.

354
00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:47.889
You sure have a lot of pictures, Mrs. Masakage.

355
00:19:47.889 --> 00:19:50.589
Hey, Heiji. I think it's impossible to find the picture of the man

356
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.189
from among these pictures, don't you?

357
00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:55.789
We aren't looking for the man. We are looking...

358
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:57.289
I found it!

359
00:19:59.189 --> 00:20:02.289
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

360
00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:05.189
Look, the tree is standing at the end of the hallway.

361
00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:07.789
That's actually where Tenko was lying on the floor, right?

362
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.689
There must be something behind it.

363
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:13.689
Hey! Look at this, Kudo.

364
00:20:13.689 --> 00:20:16.189
A picture of the three young pupils.

365
00:20:16.189 --> 00:20:18.289
Maybe this is...

366
00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:23.089
She must be hiding something.

367
00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:25.889
What? What is it? What's going on?

368
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:29.989
It's that. There.

369
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:32.389
The thing on the ceiling.

370
00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:35.389
Isn't that a screen for a projector?

371
00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:37.289
What about it?

372
00:20:37.289 --> 00:20:41.089
People usually put that kind of screen on the wall, right?

373
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:42.889
Cause they don't wanna watch it too close?

374
00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:45.189
It's better to watch it that way.

375
00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:47.589
But it's not like that here.

376
00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:49.989
See? It's so far from the wall.

377
00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:51.989
Don't you think it's strange?

378
00:20:53.589 --> 00:20:55.689
You're right. It is strange.

379
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:58.789
It's no ordinary screen, actually.

380
00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:02.989
It is cut so that people can go through it.

381
00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:05.189
You guys have probably seen it.

382
00:21:05.189 --> 00:21:07.989
You know the trick, when a real person comes out of the screen

383
00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:09.989
that you're watching!

384
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:12.889
Oh, yeah I know. I've seen it before!

385
00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:14.689
We used that screen for practice.

386
00:21:14.689 --> 00:21:17.089
That's why it's not on the wall.

387
00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.989
It was such a long time ago.

388
00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:22.789
You used to come here and practice together.

389
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:28.389
But now, you're on your own. This room is no longer in use.

390
00:21:28.389 --> 00:21:31.589
Without master and this room,

391
00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:34.189
we couldn't have become successful like we are right now, seriously.

392
00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:36.789
Every magic has a gimmick, there is no exception.

393
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:38.989
And that's why we practice.

394
00:21:38.989 --> 00:21:45.589
We practice a lot until nobody can recognize how the trick works.

395
00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:50.489
Who would think that there's a cut on that screen?

396
00:21:50.489 --> 00:21:52.889
It never crossed my mind.

397
00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:56.889
They used to come to this room everyday back then.

398
00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:59.689
They used to check on when they should come out of the screen

399
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:01.989
and tried to avoid unnecessary shadow on the screen.

400
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:03.189
Shadow!

401
00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:05.189
Yes, the shadow!

402
00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:08.689
Oh yeah. It was the shadow of the vase. It looked different!

403
00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:10.589
The shadow of the vase?

404
00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:13.189
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

405
00:22:13.189 --> 00:22:15.789
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

406
00:22:16.989 --> 00:22:20.289
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

407
00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:22.589
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

408
00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:24.889
so we could see the patterns!

409
00:22:24.889 --> 00:22:26.489
It doesn't make sense!

410
00:22:26.489 --> 00:22:28.989
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

411
00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:30.889
The shadow of the vase.

412
00:23:59.889 --> 00:24:02.589
The moonlight. The vase.

413
00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:05.789
Then, the murderer is an outsider.

414
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:08.089
But why did she lie?

415
00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:10.689
Because she figured out who it was.

416
00:24:10.689 --> 00:24:13.689
From the way Tenko's dead body was placed

417
00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:16.289
and from the way we found her.

418
00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:19.089
What?

419
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:21.589
There's nothing.

420
00:24:21.589 --> 00:24:23.589
-What? -It vanished?

421
00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:25.389
Next Conan,

422
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:29.589
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Solution)"

423
00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.616
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:32.616 --> 00:24:34.416
"Shadow"

425
00:24:34.416 --> 00:24:36.816
Next week, we'll squash the case.

426
00:24:36.816 --> 00:24:39.520
You don't want to squash the case, we need to crack it!
