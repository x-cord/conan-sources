1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.340
Let's go to the hospital!

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.640
Ran?

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.040
Let's go to the hospital

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.740
and after you're well,

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740
you're going to have to tell me

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.340
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.940
Ran.

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.940
I feel too, that your deduction

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.140
may be right.

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.840
That's why...

11
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.240
That's why until you go to the hospital,

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.640
I'm never going to let go. Never let go!

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240
Shinichi.

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.140
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived,

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.240
the table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.940
The condition set for the engagement was to stop smoking.

17
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.240
But an unexplainable explosion occurs.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.740
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

21
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.879
"Blue Sparks of Hate (Part 1)".

22
00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.679
Ran, wake up! Ran!

23
00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.279
Conan?

24
00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:52.879
Why?

25
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.779
-Is your cold okay? -Yes.

26
00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.979
Heiji and the others left for the airport

27
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.879
to go back to Osaka on Mr. Mouri's car.

28
00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.179
I see.

29
00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.579
By the way, Ran.

30
00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.779
Won't you please let go of my hand already?

31
00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.379
I'm sorry, did it hurt?

32
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.579
Not at all!

33
00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.079
But that's strange.

34
00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.779
I was holding on to Shinichi's hand,

35
00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.179
but I suddenly felt faint and...

36
00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.579
That's because I shot you with this spare tranquilizer gun.

37
00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.579
It's probably because you were really tired,

38
00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.479
but you kept holding his hand all the way.

39
00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:37.179
Even after Shinichi carried you into this car.

40
00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.779
Where's Shinichi? Is he also in Dad's car?

41
00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.879
No, after riding with us for a while,

42
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.279
he got better

43
00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:49.979
and left to finish a case that he was working on.

44
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.179
Which means he brushed my hand away and left?

45
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:55.379
That deduction freak prince.

46
00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.979
Freak prince...

47
00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.779
But how vexing,

48
00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:02.779
after I swore that I would never let go...

49
00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.679
How stupid. Take a good look

50
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.379
at the left side of Shinichi's sweater.

51
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.679
It's cut from the top of the sleeve to the bottom

52
00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.279
and fastened together with a safety pin.

53
00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.779
That's proof that he wore his sweater with his left hand blocked.

54
00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.779
So, you have no reason to feel vexed.

55
00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.579
Oh, no. A cold again?

56
00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:32.279
Nope! I'm fine! Just fine.

57
00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.979
Thanks to the little lady putting the lady of the detective agency

58
00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.779
to sleep with the tranquilizer gun.

59
00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.279
You succeeded in keeping your secret despite holding her hands

60
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.879
as well as shrinking again in the car.

61
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.479
Holding hands?

62
00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.279
Who did you hear about it from?

63
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.879
I heard about it from an old man called Agasa on the phone.

64
00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.079
Doc, you didn't have to tell him.

65
00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.279
And? Did you get that drug?

66
00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.279
The one that would make your body normal again.

67
00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.179
It's better to have that drug on you just in case, right?

68
00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:13.679
Yeah, I think so too.

69
00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.779
Hey, you guys! Didn't I tell you not to look?

70
00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.579
Hey, Kudo.

71
00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:22.579
Never mind. Ignore that.

72
00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:25.379
We're all on the way to go camping.

73
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.679
And? And then what happened?

74
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:36.679
I told Ai to give me 100 tablets of the drug for now.

75
00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:38.479
Hundred?

76
00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.779
Yeah.

77
00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.879
I thought it wouldn't be enough unless I had that many but...

78
00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.779
I already warned you

79
00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:46.379
that each time you drink that drug,

80
00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.979
the more your body will build up resistance to it,

81
00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.079
and it will become more and more ineffective.

82
00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.779
Don't blame me if you eventually really won't be able

83
00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.879
to get back your adult body.

84
00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.179
Well, but for you who wants to look good

85
00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.679
in front of that girl at the detective agency,

86
00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:05.479
even a 100 tablets isn't going to last you a week.

87
00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.679
How dare she talk like that?

88
00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:09.279
Hey, Kudo.

89
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.079
The little lady said that it's not good,

90
00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:13.879
but isn't it better for you

91
00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.279
to tell the detective agency lady the whole truth?

92
00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.679
You probably want to tell her how you really feel too, don't you?

93
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.379
Idiot! It's nothing like that,

94
00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.279
and I can't let things go that way!

95
00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.879
What can't you let go?

96
00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.679
Aren't you going camping?

97
00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.279
Oh, no. Well...

98
00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.779
Idiot! I'm going camping in the mountains,

99
00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.079
there's no way there'll be a squid there.

100
00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.479
You're talking about something like that on the phone?

101
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.879
No, I'm finished talking on the phone.

102
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.379
Hey! Hold it.

103
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.379
He hung up.

104
00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.879
Geez.

105
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:59.679
I'm so excited about the camping grounds we're headed for!

106
00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:03.879
Yes! It seems like a place with nice scenery.

107
00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:07.179
By the way, what would you like for dinner tonight?

108
00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:09.579
I bought a lot of foodstuffs along!

109
00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:11.379
Okay, I want a barbecue then!

110
00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:14.279
That's what you always want, Genta!

111
00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.379
Conan, what about you?

112
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.479
I guess the usual, curry over rice.

113
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:19.779
What about you, Ai?

114
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:21.079
I don't really care.

115
00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:23.679
Anything that's edible is fine with me.

116
00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.879
Oh, no sweat!

117
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.079
It seems she's been this way all the way from this morning.

118
00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.279
I'm sure she's upset over something that's not worth worrying over again.

119
00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.379
Don't tell me you ran out of gas again?

120
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:50.879
Didn't you have your car checked before you left?

121
00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:55.379
Yeah, so the engine's working just great,

122
00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:58.179
but I guess I ran out of gas.

123
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.479
Well, it's almost sundown,

124
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:05.679
so let's hurry and call somebody to bring gasoline here to us.

125
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:09.479
Yeah. I thought so too, and was just about to call him.

126
00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:10.479
Him?

127
00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.579
Remember, the man who lives next door to me

128
00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:18.479
since the fire incident the other day, Subaru Okiya.

129
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:19.979
He told me that he was going to be home all day today

130
00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:21.679
without anything to do.

131
00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:24.979
I'm sure he can get here in less than two hours.

132
00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:27.179
This place is out of service range of the cell phone!

133
00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:31.579
What're we supposed to do out in the mountains like this?

134
00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.079
There's still some distance to go

135
00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:36.079
before the camping grounds, is there?

136
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:39.679
Well, we've got three choices.

137
00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.179
We can walk back to the service station

138
00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.479
that we passed by 30 minutes ago,

139
00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:47.179
buy gasoline and come back.

140
00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:50.679
We can wait here till a car comes by

141
00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:54.479
and have that car take us to a service station

142
00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:56.079
or...

143
00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:58.979
we could go up to that villa on top of the mountain

144
00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:01.779
and borrow the phone.

145
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.279
Well, to go back to the service station,

146
00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.979
it would take more than two hours.

147
00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:10.079
It would be pretty tough waiting here for a car to pass by

148
00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:13.179
because we virtually saw no oncoming cars on our way here.

149
00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:16.579
So, I think it's best we go up to that villa

150
00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.979
where the light is on.

151
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:20.679
It's a nice house!

152
00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.779
A place where a princess would be living!

153
00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:25.879
I wonder if they'll serve us gorgeous food when we get there?

154
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:28.279
Like a full course French dinner?

155
00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.479
I prefer Italian!

156
00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:33.179
I thought we came to go camping, you guys.

157
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.779
Stop! Stop! Stop!

158
00:09:48.979 --> 00:09:50.879
Is anything wrong?

159
00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.379
I'm very sorry,

160
00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:56.079
but could you give me a ride to the nearest service station?

161
00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:58.779
"Goki Sudo (34), IT Company President" -Yes, I don't mind,

162
00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:00.679
but will you give me a bit more detailed information?

163
00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:05.479
Well, we're on our way to the camping ground

164
00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:08.079
but ran out of gasoline.

165
00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:10.579
This place is also out of service range of the cell phone,

166
00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.679
so we were at a loss what to do.

167
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.179
I see, so that's the story.

168
00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:16.979
Then,

169
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:19.179
why don't you stay here forever?

170
00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:20.579
Old fart!

171
00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.479
What's with that guy?

172
00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:31.879
What a snob!

173
00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:33.679
He's the pits!

174
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.879
Well, we may have to ask that snob

175
00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:38.979
to do us a favor again, though.

176
00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:41.879
What? Why?

177
00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:43.279
That car just now

178
00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.879
is a classic car that's preferred by the rich

179
00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:47.579
and requires ridiculously high maintenance cost.

180
00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:50.279
A guy driving around in that kind of car

181
00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:54.079
may just be the same guy that built an extravagant villa like that

182
00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.679
out in the mountains, so...

183
00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.979
No way!

184
00:10:57.979 --> 00:11:00.879
Let's not ask a guy like him!

185
00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.179
Yeah.

186
00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:03.779
I would rather

187
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:06.779
just wait here for another car to come by than ask someone like him.

188
00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:09.879
Well, there's a possibility that the man we just saw

189
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.479
was heading for a totally different place and not that villa.

190
00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.379
I don't think it'll hurt to at least give it a try?

191
00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:18.079
That's right.

192
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:21.279
Let's leave our luggage in the car and go there.

193
00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.979
Right, maybe if we all ask together...

194
00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:28.179
We should at least take a flashlight along with us too, then.

195
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:30.279
It's getting dark.

196
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.879
There's one in the pocket behind the driver's seat,

197
00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:33.879
so will you get it for me?

198
00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.679
Okay, sure!

199
00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:40.179
What's with you?

200
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.879
Acting like a queen and all.

201
00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:44.479
Is that what it looks like to you?

202
00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.579
I don't know what's got into you,

203
00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.179
but we're out camping, you know.

204
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.279
An explosion?

205
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:00.979
That... that is...

206
00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:03.779
the emblem that was on the car we just saw!

207
00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.079
Conan?

208
00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:10.779
If it was the car we just saw,

209
00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:12.679
why'd it explode?

210
00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:15.379
Was it loaded with explosives to begin with?

211
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:18.079
Then, is it that he didn't let us on,

212
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:20.879
because he didn't want us to get mixed up in the explosion?

213
00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:23.979
That can't be. He didn't look that way at all.

214
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:32.079
Goki!

215
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.179
No, Ena! It's dangerous!

216
00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:35.779
But...

217
00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:38.279
The fire station and ambulance have already been contacted!

218
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.679
No!

219
00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:40.979
Ena!

220
00:12:40.979 --> 00:12:43.979
Is that Goki that you're calling...

221
00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:45.679
The one with brown hair, has a beard on his chin,

222
00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:49.579
was wearing a white wool sweater and a black fleece jacket?

223
00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:51.479
Who are you?

224
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.079
I happened to pass a person driving a classic car

225
00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:57.279
that looked just like him a while ago.

226
00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:16.332
The victim is Mr. Goki Sudo, age 34.

227
00:13:16.332 --> 00:13:18.932
I hear he's the president of an IT business,

228
00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:23.332
that brought him a lot of cash which after he built this villa.

229
00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:24.832
The cause of the fire

230
00:13:24.832 --> 00:13:26.332
was a cigarette that he was holding in his mouth.

231
00:13:26.332 --> 00:13:27.532
A cigarette he was holding in his mouth?

232
00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:30.932
Yeah, a poly tank in the garage

233
00:13:30.932 --> 00:13:33.032
just happened to be knocked over

234
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:35.132
and the gasoline that had vaporized was all over the garage

235
00:13:35.132 --> 00:13:37.232
when Mr. Sudo came along in his car.

236
00:13:37.232 --> 00:13:39.432
He opened the door of the garage

237
00:13:39.432 --> 00:13:42.132
and parked his car inside

238
00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:45.332
with a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

239
00:13:45.332 --> 00:13:48.432
The minute he got off the car, he caught fire.

240
00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:51.632
The fire enveloped his car too and boom!

241
00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.332
A burnt black cigarette butt was found too.

242
00:13:55.332 --> 00:13:56.932
That can't be!

243
00:13:56.932 --> 00:14:00.332
"Ena Ginbayashi (31), Sudo's fiance" -Goki said that he quit smoking!

244
00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:02.832
For me, because I don't like cigarettes.

245
00:14:02.832 --> 00:14:04.932
And who are you?

246
00:14:04.932 --> 00:14:08.132
She's Ena Ginbayashi, Sudo's fiance.

247
00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:10.832
Every weekend,

248
00:14:10.832 --> 00:14:14.332
we all gather here to have a party,

249
00:14:14.332 --> 00:14:17.332
but tonight, Sudo said that he would be announcing something.

250
00:14:17.332 --> 00:14:18.632
It's about our wedding.

251
00:14:19.632 --> 00:14:22.532
He was scheduled to announce the date of our wedding

252
00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:25.932
because it's been set!

253
00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:29.932
And yet... And yet what a terrible thing to have happened.

254
00:14:31.532 --> 00:14:34.632
The burnt remains of a marriage registration were found.

255
00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:37.232
So I guess that's true.

256
00:14:37.232 --> 00:14:41.732
But I think he lied to you about quitting smoking.

257
00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:46.232
There were a lot of cigarette butts in the ashtray of his car

258
00:14:46.232 --> 00:14:49.932
and near his body, there was a cigarette butt that was burnt black too.

259
00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:51.532
There was a bag on the ground

260
00:14:51.532 --> 00:14:56.732
and inside it there were an unopened box of cigarettes and a lighter.

261
00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:58.532
No... no way.

262
00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:01.632
I just told him a while ago, to please not smoke too.

263
00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:02.932
A while ago?

264
00:15:02.932 --> 00:15:05.032
Just about an hour ago,

265
00:15:05.032 --> 00:15:09.832
I got a call from Goki saying that he was headed this way.

266
00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:12.432
That's when Ena told him,

267
00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:14.032
"If you don't quit smoking,

268
00:15:14.032 --> 00:15:16.332
I'm calling off the engagement."

269
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:19.332
Was that call really from Mr. Sudo?

270
00:15:19.332 --> 00:15:22.032
Yes, I'm the one who answered the phone,

271
00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:24.532
and I got on the line again before hanging up too.

272
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:26.932
Which means on top of not quitting smoking,

273
00:15:26.932 --> 00:15:31.132
he used poly tanks that are not recommended for storing gasoline.

274
00:15:31.132 --> 00:15:33.432
In other words, he brought it upon himself.

275
00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.832
This case is definitely an accident.

276
00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:38.132
No, you can't really say that.

277
00:15:38.132 --> 00:15:39.132
What?

278
00:15:39.132 --> 00:15:43.432
Because if Mr. Sudo got off the car with a lighted cigarette in his mouth,

279
00:15:43.432 --> 00:15:47.632
he would've had to light his cigarette a while before he got off, right?

280
00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:53.132
But the unsealed box of cigarette hasn't been found anywhere.

281
00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:57.732
That's right, isn't it, forensic officer?

282
00:15:57.732 --> 00:15:59.332
Is... is that true?

283
00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:01.532
Yes, nothing's been found anywhere,

284
00:16:01.532 --> 00:16:03.432
neither in the car nor in the garage.

285
00:16:03.432 --> 00:16:06.332
But why isn't it around?

286
00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.932
It could be because that cigarette butt

287
00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:12.432
was on the ground of the garage before Mr. Sudo came.

288
00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:16.332
Hey, Conan!

289
00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:18.132
Just what do you mean?

290
00:16:18.132 --> 00:16:19.932
Please explain!

291
00:16:19.932 --> 00:16:22.032
This is not a plain accident,

292
00:16:22.032 --> 00:16:24.232
but rather an accident that's been set up.

293
00:16:24.232 --> 00:16:26.632
This could be a case of homicide.

294
00:16:26.632 --> 00:16:28.632
Are you serious, Conan?

295
00:16:28.632 --> 00:16:29.732
Yeah.

296
00:16:29.732 --> 00:16:33.132
The poly tank that was in the garage

297
00:16:33.132 --> 00:16:35.132
happened to be knocked over.

298
00:16:35.132 --> 00:16:38.932
The gasoline vaporizes and fills the entire garage.

299
00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:43.032
Then Goki comes along in his car and goes into the garage.

300
00:16:43.032 --> 00:16:44.732
He stops his car

301
00:16:44.732 --> 00:16:45.732
and holds a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

302
00:16:45.732 --> 00:16:48.032
He catches fire as soon as he gets out of the car

303
00:16:48.032 --> 00:16:49.732
and it explodes.

304
00:16:51.932 --> 00:16:54.632
The cigarette butt that was the cause of the fire

305
00:16:54.632 --> 00:16:57.532
was found in the garage.

306
00:16:57.532 --> 00:16:58.832
At first glance,

307
00:16:58.832 --> 00:17:01.232
it looks to be nothing but an accident,

308
00:17:01.232 --> 00:17:03.532
but if the unsealed cigarette box

309
00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:07.532
that he took the cigarette out of isn't anywhere in sight,

310
00:17:07.532 --> 00:17:09.132
the cigarette butt

311
00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:11.432
must've been here in the garage

312
00:17:11.432 --> 00:17:14.032
even before Mr. Sudo got to the garage.

313
00:17:15.432 --> 00:17:17.032
It could be mistaken evidence

314
00:17:17.032 --> 00:17:19.232
that the culprit deliberately left behind,

315
00:17:19.232 --> 00:17:21.532
to make this look like an accident.

316
00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:24.532
Wow, Conan!

317
00:17:24.532 --> 00:17:26.232
Just as expected of you!

318
00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:28.032
But sonny,

319
00:17:28.032 --> 00:17:30.832
we've been investigating inside the garage for a while now

320
00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:34.432
but nothing like an igniting device was found.

321
00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:39.632
But Mr. Sudo didn't have a cigarette case on him either, did he?

322
00:17:39.632 --> 00:17:40.732
No.

323
00:17:40.732 --> 00:17:42.832
If so, something's just not right.

324
00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:45.232
If you check closer, I'm sure something would come up.

325
00:17:45.232 --> 00:17:47.432
It was his last cigarette.

326
00:17:48.832 --> 00:17:51.932
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

327
00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.632
out the window of the car before coming into the garage

328
00:17:54.632 --> 00:17:57.532
because that was going to be his last cigarette?

329
00:17:57.532 --> 00:18:04.032
Goki used to always crumple up empty cigarette boxes and do so.

330
00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:08.032
So, if we look around the area of this villa,

331
00:18:08.032 --> 00:18:10.232
we'd be able to find empty cigarette boxes?

332
00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:11.932
I guess so.

333
00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:14.232
But I think it's been a while

334
00:18:14.232 --> 00:18:16.432
since he threw away empty boxes of cigarettes.

335
00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:20.132
If Goki lied about not smoking anymore,

336
00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:23.932
don't you think he would avoid disposing the butts around the villa?

337
00:18:23.932 --> 00:18:27.132
If that's the case, we'll have to investigate a wide area,

338
00:18:27.132 --> 00:18:29.132
and that'll be a hell of tough work.

339
00:18:29.132 --> 00:18:32.632
There was a deep valley alongside the road too.

340
00:18:32.632 --> 00:18:34.732
But that's all I can come up with.

341
00:18:34.732 --> 00:18:36.432
Hey, Miss.

342
00:18:36.432 --> 00:18:40.432
Do you really believe that Mr. Sudo quit smoking?

343
00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:45.832
If you knew that Mr. Sudo was smoking in secret,

344
00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:46.832
all you had to do

345
00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:49.332
was knock down the poly tank in the garage with the gasoline inside.

346
00:18:49.332 --> 00:18:50.732
What do you think you're saying?

347
00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:54.532
Nobody noticed Mr. Sudo smoking in secret!

348
00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:55.732
Yes!

349
00:18:55.732 --> 00:18:57.332
After he said he was going to quit smoking,

350
00:18:57.332 --> 00:18:59.332
he didn't smoke at all!

351
00:18:59.332 --> 00:19:02.932
But that's only in front of you people, right?

352
00:19:02.932 --> 00:19:06.432
We met Mr. Sudo a little before the incident

353
00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:08.732
but since he would easily lie about anything,

354
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.732
I thought that you as his fiance

355
00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:14.032
would've known about it.

356
00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:15.832
Easily lie?

357
00:19:15.832 --> 00:19:19.032
Yes, on our way to the camping grounds by car,

358
00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:21.032
we happened to run out of gas,

359
00:19:21.032 --> 00:19:24.832
so we stopped Mr. Sudo's car that happened to pass by.

360
00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:28.832
I asked him if he would drive me to the service station but...

361
00:19:28.832 --> 00:19:30.532
He was a real snob!

362
00:19:30.532 --> 00:19:32.232
When doc went over to the driver's seat

363
00:19:32.232 --> 00:19:33.632
and explained the situation to him...

364
00:19:33.632 --> 00:19:36.832
At first, he said he give us a lift and yet!

365
00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:39.032
He gave a super snide remark and drove off.

366
00:19:39.832 --> 00:19:43.232
Why don't you stay here forever? Old fart!

367
00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:46.032
Hey, hey, that's terrible!

368
00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:48.732
I hate to talk about people who are no longer here,

369
00:19:48.732 --> 00:19:51.432
but he really didn't look to be someone who'd be keeping his promise

370
00:19:51.432 --> 00:19:53.732
about not smoking.

371
00:19:53.732 --> 00:19:56.532
It's true that it's something that Sudo would say, but...

372
00:19:56.532 --> 00:19:58.932
I thought that he kept to his promise of not smoking.

373
00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:02.632
Yes, because Sudo was head over heels over Ena.

374
00:20:02.632 --> 00:20:06.032
And besides, if he were... That is if...

375
00:20:06.032 --> 00:20:08.532
he were to be secretly smoking behind my back

376
00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:10.732
and I found out about it,

377
00:20:10.732 --> 00:20:14.332
I did tell him on the phone in front of everyone, before he came here

378
00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:19.532
that if he didn't quit smoking, I would nullify our engagement!

379
00:20:19.532 --> 00:20:21.432
It's unthinkable that after hearing what I said,

380
00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:24.932
he would get off his car holding a lighted cigarette in his mouth.

381
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:27.832
Do you think I could've foreseen that he would do something like that?

382
00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:30.332
It's just as she says.

383
00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:34.132
So long as she told him not to smoke in front of everyone,

384
00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:37.532
it's difficult to prove that this is a case of homicide.

385
00:20:37.532 --> 00:20:39.932
No, the cause of the fire is not the cigarette.

386
00:20:41.132 --> 00:20:44.432
I don't know if he really quit smoking or not,

387
00:20:44.432 --> 00:20:49.132
but I don't think he was smoking in his car today.

388
00:20:49.132 --> 00:20:51.632
When Doc stopped his car,

389
00:20:51.632 --> 00:20:54.232
I also went up to the driver's seat,

390
00:20:54.232 --> 00:20:56.532
but he didn't smell of cigarette.

391
00:20:56.532 --> 00:20:59.532
Then, why did the fire start in the garage?

392
00:20:59.532 --> 00:21:02.632
Beats me, I don't know for sure yet,

393
00:21:02.632 --> 00:21:06.332
but I'm pretty sure that Ena is the one who set it up.

394
00:21:10.232 --> 00:21:12.032
Remember?

395
00:21:12.032 --> 00:21:17.332
Ena at first cried and bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

396
00:21:17.332 --> 00:21:19.332
who said that the cause of the fire was a lit cigarette.

397
00:21:19.332 --> 00:21:23.232
Goki said that he quit smoking!

398
00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:26.732
But even before you had time to take that in,

399
00:21:26.732 --> 00:21:27.732
in answer to my remark

400
00:21:27.732 --> 00:21:31.632
that it's strange that no unsealed box of cigarettes is around...

401
00:21:31.632 --> 00:21:33.732
Maybe he threw the empty box of cigarettes

402
00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:36.832
out the window of the car before coming into the garage.

403
00:21:36.832 --> 00:21:40.832
If she really believed that he had quit smoking,

404
00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:43.832
she would've agreed with my remark, right?

405
00:21:43.832 --> 00:21:47.632
And said something like, "See, so he quit smoking after all!"

406
00:21:47.632 --> 00:21:49.132
True.

407
00:21:49.132 --> 00:21:52.832
However, if her contradictory remark

408
00:21:52.832 --> 00:21:55.732
was that of the culprit, it makes sense.

409
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.932
She bit back at Inspector Yuminaga

410
00:21:57.932 --> 00:22:00.132
because she wanted to appeal the fact that

411
00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:02.832
she didn't know Goki was smoking behind her back.

412
00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:05.332
And she argued back at me saying that the cause of the fire

413
00:22:05.332 --> 00:22:07.432
was unmistakably from a lighted cigarette,

414
00:22:07.432 --> 00:22:10.632
because that what she wanted to get through.

415
00:22:10.632 --> 00:22:13.232
It seems that Ena wants to make it look like

416
00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:16.232
"an accidental fire that was caused by a lighted cigarette" no matter what.

417
00:22:16.232 --> 00:22:18.832
What? So, it's not an accident after all?

418
00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:21.332
Are you saying that the fire ignited by itself?

419
00:22:21.332 --> 00:22:22.932
But there's a saying that goes,

420
00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:25.232
"No smoke rises, where there is no fire", isn't there?

421
00:22:25.232 --> 00:22:28.532
That's why I'm thinking that over now.

422
00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:30.432
There's got to be something!

423
00:22:32.032 --> 00:22:34.132
A trick that can be used

424
00:22:34.132 --> 00:22:37.032
to set the garage on fire without using an igniting device.

425
00:23:59.932 --> 00:24:02.732
"Next episode"

426
00:24:02.732 --> 00:24:05.832
That's the emblem of Goki's car.

427
00:24:07.632 --> 00:24:11.632
A classic car, a wool sweater.

428
00:24:11.632 --> 00:24:13.332
Stopping over...

429
00:24:13.332 --> 00:24:15.932
I see. That's why it's the classic car.

430
00:24:19.932 --> 00:24:21.832
She had schemed to make Mr. Sudo himself

431
00:24:21.832 --> 00:24:24.532
the ignition device!

432
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:25.932
Next Conan,

433
00:24:25.932 --> 00:24:29.032
"Blue Fireworks of Hate (Part 2)".

434
00:24:40.832 --> 00:24:42.632
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:44.832
"Wool sweater".

436
00:24:44.832 --> 00:24:46.232
There's a fuzzball on your sweater.

437
00:24:46.232 --> 00:24:47.432
That because it's wool.

438
00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:48.632
There's a price tag on your sweater.

439
00:24:48.632 --> 00:24:49.946
That's because it's a bargain sale.
