1
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:09,357
Hei, come on out already!

2
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:11,557
That's enough!

3
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:14,557
It's time to go home!

4
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:19,457
Where did he go?

5
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,257
Awesome!

6
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,857
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

7
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,957
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

8
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,257
Today's detective squad experiences something a bit different.

9
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,357
They have a treasure battle in a haunted storeroom.

10
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:12,057
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:13,957
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:16,057
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:06,321
"Treasure Battle in the Monster Storage Room (Part 1)"

14
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,621
Okay, then. Let's review the deeds

15
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,821
that we the detective squad has been performing recently.

16
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,721
First, it's the red, white and yellow case, right?

17
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:22,121
You mean that Kaito Sugiura's apartment arson case, right?

18
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,621
He said that when night comes,

19
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:33,521
there's a guy that does suspicious things!

20
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,421
As for Mr. Black and White,

21
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:40,221
I'll clear everything in black and white right here and now.

22
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:45,821
Who of everyone here is the yellow arsonist?

23
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:51,521
There was a red person and a white person written in Kaito's diary.

24
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,721
And the yellow person was the arsonist, right?

25
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:57,621
Conan was the black and white person, right?

26
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:01,021
Conan solved the mystery of red, white and yellow

27
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,621
and the culprit was arrested.

28
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,921
When Conan scores a point,

29
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:06,721
it's the same as we the detective squad scored the point too!

30
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:11,721
Of course, since Conan is also a member of the detective squad.

31
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,621
And the Ikkaku rock incident!

32
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,921
The message that the woman victim left behind,

33
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:20,321
"mackerel, carp, red sea bream, and flatfish".

34
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,821
The rock that is behind you,

35
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,421
there's something written on it.

36
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:33,521
"Mackerel, carp, red sea bream and flatfish".

37
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,021
Conan?

38
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,621
That message was solved and the culprit was arrested.

39
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,821
Conan did it.

40
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,021
We, the detective squad did.

41
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,921
Absolutely.

42
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:54,121
And the incident of the TV station that my father got messed up in.

43
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,421
I'll go take a look!

44
00:04:58,421 --> 00:04:59,421
Conan!

45
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,321
You guys stay right there and don't move!

46
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,721
Cut out playing dumb already!

47
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,321
I heard with these very ears of mine

48
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:13,021
what you just spitted out, you see!

49
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,921
If you like,

50
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,521
I can shove my knuckles way down beyond your throat

51
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:19,221
and pull the Japanese paper out

52
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:22,621
along with the lunch you ate today, how about it?

53
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:26,621
Oh, no, I'll confess.

54
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,721
My dad really did his thing during that incident!

55
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:33,721
But, we didn't do anything at all back then, did we?

56
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,421
Conan left without us.

57
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:39,421
It's okay because dad and the detective squad did their thing.

58
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,921
I guess so.

59
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:44,021
Don't forget the Shirosaki Hot Spring case, too.

60
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,021
Right!

61
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,321
In order to search for the whereabouts of Ran who disappeared.

62
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,121
We, the detective squad, together with Heiji Hattori,

63
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,821
high school detective of the west, formed a formidable team.

64
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,521
Conan rode is skateboard

65
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,121
despite using crutches and started a great chase.

66
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,021
The crab bun, crab ice cream,

67
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:06,321
and crab stick were delicious.

68
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,521
There were the bank robbers, too!

69
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,721
And the incident that occurred

70
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,421
when we went to watch the Gomera movie.

71
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,521
We really did out thing then, didn't we?

72
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:18,221
-Thanks to Conan! -You mean the detective squad did it!

73
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:22,021
I went and told Ms. Kobayashi that we finished cleaning.

74
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:25,021
Okay, then, let's head home!

75
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,621
What? A robbery case?

76
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:33,321
Could it be the one that was aired on TV again today?

77
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,421
Yes, please take care and make sure to lock the door.

78
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,121
They're a band of thieves that are stealing jewellery

79
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:42,921
and antiques in this vicinity,

80
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,021
and they've already broke into five places this month already.

81
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:50,321
But, this is an elementary school, there's nothing to steal.

82
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:53,321
No... Nothing beats prevention.

83
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,821
Let me know right away if something comes up.

84
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,621
I'll fly right over.

85
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,621
Okay.

86
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,221
Inspector Shiratori is here again.

87
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,221
He was here yesterday too, right?

88
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:07,321
Yep, he is a workaholic.

89
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:11,221
Yes, because the police's job is to protect the citizens.

90
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,421
No, Inspector Shiratori's job

91
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:16,021
belongs with Investigations 1st division of vicious crimes.

92
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,721
He mainly takes care of murder cases.

93
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:22,021
Investigations 3rd division is in charge of thefts.

94
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,921
Well, a flashy theft

95
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,521
like the one committed by Thief Kid

96
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:30,821
who gives out warnings before committing the crime

97
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,421
would be investigated by the 2nd division though.

98
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,321
Then, why's he here?

99
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,221
He's not even in charge.

100
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,521
Oh, well, that's because...

101
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,621
It can't be helped, right?

102
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:45,221
To Inspector Shiratori, Ms. Kobayashi is...

103
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,221
Here, this is for you.

104
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:51,221
A token of my appreciation for helping me a while ago.

105
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,321
Cherry blossoms?

106
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,421
Cherry blossoms are the mark

107
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:59,521
that all the people of the police have on.

108
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:04,221
Strong, kind, cool and the flower of justice!

109
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,721
His destiny.

110
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:13,521
His destiny?

111
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:20,821
Hey, he told you not to say anything about it

112
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:24,121
because he wanted to tell her himself when the time was right.

113
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,521
Oh, really?

114
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,921
Love comedy guys

115
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,821
who can't express their real feelings

116
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:33,221
and cause confusion in women really annoy me.

117
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,121
You better not be referring to me.

118
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,621
Well, I think you they make a good couple, though.

119
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,221
She ignore me.

120
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,921
Ms. Kobayashi is a fan of Ranpo Edogawa and loves criminal cases.

121
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:48,321
Inspector Shiratori can probably tell her a lot the investigations.

122
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,421
Talking about cases,

123
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,721
Mitsuhiko was saying during lunch break, wasn't he?

124
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,021
Yeah.

125
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:58,321
Yes, right. Something about "hearty storeroom", was it?

126
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,421
Not hearty, but...

127
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,021
haunted storeroom.

128
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:08,421
Haunted storeroom?

129
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,021
Takuma in our class,

130
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:12,421
said that when he was playing hide-and-seek

131
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,021
at his relative's house in Beikacho 5 chome

132
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,621
with his friend,

133
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:20,721
He couldn't find his friend at all

134
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:24,021
and figured that the only place left to look for him was the storeroom.

135
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,421
So, he climbed a tree,

136
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:28,921
and peeked into the window of the storeroom.

137
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:34,021
He said he saw expensive looking artworks inside.

138
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,321
He says that he also saw someone

139
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:39,921
behind the treasure looking towards him.

140
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:45,721
Wasn't it the friend that he was playing hide-and-seek with?

141
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:50,121
Takuma thought so to and tried to go inside,

142
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,821
but the door was locked and he couldn't open the door.

143
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:56,521
Although he called his friend's name, his friend wouldn't come out.

144
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:00,321
So he went to ask the owner of the house to open the door.

145
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:01,921
But he was told that

146
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:04,621
the door of the storeroom hadn't been opened for years,

147
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,521
so nobody could've possibly made it inside.

148
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,721
And, so he gave up looking for his friend?

149
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:16,021
No. Takuma insisted that someone was inside,

150
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:17,821
and had the door opened.

151
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,621
When they went inside,

152
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,921
the person he saw as well as all the treasure were gone.

153
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:27,621
Takuma was puzzled,

154
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:31,721
but heard the following story from the owner of the storeroom.

155
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:37,121
Nothing important should be placed in the storeroom.

156
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:39,321
If anything is placed inside it, it will disappear instantly.

157
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,121
Because the treasure will be swallowed by the monster storeroom

158
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:44,121
that has a big appetite,

159
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:52,621
Don't tell me that the friend he was looking for was eaten up?

160
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,521
No, because he seems to have shown up

161
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,721
from a different place afterwards.

162
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:00,721
But, because of the shock,

163
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:05,521
Takuma seems to be haunted by nightmares every night.

164
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:07,821
He was absent, too.

165
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:13,521
I see. A haunted storeroom with a big appetite.

166
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:18,821
It is indeed the strange, eerie world of Ranpo Edogawa.

167
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,321
Ms. Kobyashi.

168
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,621
Where's Inspector Shiratori?

169
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,421
He left a while ago, humming a tune.

170
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,221
Never mind that, the problem is the storeroom.

171
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,621
We, the detective squad have to solve the case

172
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:35,121
of the haunted storeroom as soon as possible,

173
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:39,821
so that Takuma won't have to worry anymore.

174
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:41,921
-Let's go! -Wait!

175
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:46,621
I'm the advisor for the detective squad, you know? Don't ignore me!

176
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,421
Gosh.

177
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:54,021
If Ms. Kobayashi comes along, things get complicated.

178
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,121
She would says things like don't go in there,

179
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,421
or it's time to go home already.

180
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,321
She will just gets in the way.

181
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:04,821
Okay, since that storeroom in question is in 5 chome.

182
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,321
You want to get together

183
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:09,621
at the Mouri Detective Agency that's in the same district.

184
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:13,521
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Then, go inside and wait for me.

185
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,321
I'm going to leave a note to Ran

186
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,321
saying that I might be coming home late today.

187
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,321
It's something to look forward to, isn't it? The haunted storeroom.

188
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,721
But, what if the storeroom is really a monster?

189
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:32,221
No need to worry.

190
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,521
I'm sure that Conan will solve it

191
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,721
and find out that it's not a monster.

192
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,021
Yes!

193
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,221
I agree.

194
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:40,721
Come on...

195
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:45,421
All of you are always so dependent on Conan.

196
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:49,621
Don't you want to show him what you can do without him at times?

197
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,021
What?

198
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,021
That's impossible.

199
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,321
Because Conan's really smart.

200
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:01,121
He knows a lot of strange things, too.

201
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,521
I'm talking about your attitude.

202
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:07,021
You'll never grow up if you stay the way you are.

203
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,321
Uh, where are you going?

204
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,321
To the restroom.

205
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,221
I'm growing,

206
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:18,721
my mom told me that I grew again today.

207
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:23,021
But, I'd kind of like to see it.

208
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,521
The surprised look on Conan's face!

209
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:36,521
Yeah!

210
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,421
Yes, if only once, I'd like to see him depressed

211
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:42,621
because we solved the case without him.

212
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,821
No, what we just said...

213
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:46,821
Were all jokes.

214
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,621
All lies.

215
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:56,821
Sorry, thanks for waiting.

216
00:13:56,821 --> 00:14:00,421
What're you all doing gathered around the desk?

217
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,321
Nothing.

218
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:06,221
Pops Kogoro went to the horse race and isn't home.

219
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,921
Huh? Where's Haibara?

220
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,721
Did you call me?

221
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:14,721
Let's hurry over to that storeroom, then!

222
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,821
Let's go there quickly and solve the case in a jiffy!

223
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:22,321
No case is left unsolved when it comes to we, the detective squad!

224
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,221
You guys are really out to get, aren't you?

225
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,221
Oh, does it look that way?

226
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:31,121
Well, us today...

227
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,021
It's true, that we're slightly different from the usual!

228
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,021
I don't care what.

229
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,721
But don't let your enthusiasm get the best of you.

230
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,421
Okay...

231
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,121
Let's go.

232
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,527
Oh, you're Takuma's friends.

233
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,527
That's why you came to check on the storeroom?

234
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:14,027
-Yes! -Because we're members of the detective squad!

235
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:17,227
Well, it's good that you're full of curiosity,

236
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:18,627
but be careful not to get too involved.

237
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,227
That the storeroom will eat you.

238
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:23,727
So he says.

239
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,427
We'll be fine, because most ghost stories

240
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,727
are illusions created out of the fear we have in our hearts.

241
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,327
They are no mysteries that cannot be solved in this world.

242
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,327
There is no such thing!

243
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,327
Yeah.

244
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:39,727
It looks pretty old, but it's unexpectedly an ordinary storeroom.

245
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:44,427
It seems to have been built during the last days of Tokugawa.

246
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:53,027
What're you doing?

247
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,627
I'm taking pictures.

248
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:58,527
We're going to attempt solving the mystery of the storeroom soon.

249
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,027
So I see nothing wrong with taking pictures

250
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,027
of the surroundings around the storeroom.

251
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,427
That's right.

252
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:07,327
There, it's opened. Let's go inside.

253
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,827
Well, there's nothing inside, though.

254
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:16,127
It's really spacious.

255
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,727
But it's pitch dark and you can't virtually see anything.

256
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,627
The only thing that can barely

257
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:24,727
be seen is the light seeping in,

258
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:28,227
from the window over there by the ceiling.

259
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:31,927
Okay, let's go take loads of pictures of inside the storeroom.

260
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,227
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

261
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,327
Conan?

262
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,427
Warning everybody to watch their steps

263
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,127
while you go and have a great fall.

264
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:49,127
Wrong. These stairs...

265
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:52,127
There are footprints of somebody having walked here.

266
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:58,327
Moreover, only in the centre of the storeroom.

267
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:01,127
It's not the footprints of a child.

268
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,827
That's an abacus?

269
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:09,727
The footprints are connected with the abacus

270
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,427
that is embedded into the wall.

271
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:20,927
There's something strange about the balls on the abacus.

272
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:24,927
Hey, there's nothing in there, is there?

273
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:27,927
I'm closing the door, so come on out!

274
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:29,927
Oh, okay.

275
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,827
Hey, you guys, let's go!

276
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:36,027
Okay...

277
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,727
Are you satisfied, detective squad?

278
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,927
Yes, sort of.

279
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,127
Bye, then.

280
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:49,627
Oh, but can we check the storeroom again after sundown?

281
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:52,227
We promise to be quiet till then!

282
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:53,527
Please!

283
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:56,127
Okay, I don't mind.

284
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,827
I don't think you'll find anything, though.

285
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:04,527
It's that window, that Takuma looked in from, right?

286
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:08,527
Yes, because that's the only window there is.

287
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,927
So, let's not wait till sundown,

288
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,827
but go take a look now.

289
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:17,427
And look at the treasure that Takuma saw.

290
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,227
Are you okay, Conan?

291
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,327
Please don't fall.

292
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,027
I'll bet you won't find anything.

293
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:29,827
We just looked inside a while ago!

294
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:32,027
I'm just going to confirm once more.

295
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,227
I'll come down as soon as I look inside the storeroom.

296
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:45,527
Bring that old man back here right away!

297
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,527
Hey, I don't think there's anything, though.

298
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,727
See?

299
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:58,027
No way...

300
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,827
And did you see anything?

301
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:05,827
I saw it there, just a while ago.

302
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:08,427
The floor was filled with...

303
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,127
a heap of treasure!

304
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:19,327
Uh, you really saw it, didn't you?

305
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,327
Yeah.

306
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:28,927
Just a while ago when I looked in from that window, I saw it!

307
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:31,727
The treasure filling the floor of the storeroom,

308
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,627
a heap of artworks and antiques!

309
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:38,927
But, isn't there's nothing?

310
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,427
That's why there's got to be something!

311
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,327
A way in which the treasure is made to vanish.

312
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,127
Maybe the floor's rigged or maybe the ceiling.

313
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:51,427
No, I don't think it's the ceiling.

314
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,527
What?

315
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,427
Proof of this is this picture that was taken with the cell phone!

316
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,827
This was taken when you climbed the tree

317
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,427
near the storeroom a while ago and looked inside.

318
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,627
The position of the window

319
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,927
is at about 2 meters from the top of the roof,

320
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:10,627
And that window also as viewed from inside the storeroom,

321
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,627
is about 2 meters from the ceiling!

322
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,127
In other words, there's no space on the ceiling

323
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,727
to set up some gadget!

324
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,827
Right.

325
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:24,627
Then all that's left is this floor.

326
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:27,927
Yeah. The floor probably comes off

327
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,727
and the real floor with the treasure all over it comes rising up.

328
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,327
No!

329
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,427
That's not possible either!

330
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:37,627
It's impossible!

331
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,427
What?

332
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:43,227
Come over here and look! See, this!

333
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,427
The detective squad badge.

334
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:51,127
The badge is surrounded with pencil lines.

335
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:55,127
I drew them! It's a mark showing where I put it!

336
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,627
My badge is over this way!

337
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:03,527
See! Mine hasn't moved either, right?

338
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:07,727
Yeah, moreover, it's pretty far from where Genta's one is.

339
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:08,927
I see.

340
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:13,127
In other words, there's no trace of this floor having slided

341
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,727
or tilted over a wide space.

342
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:19,127
Therefore, Conan's deduction about the floor opening up

343
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:23,227
and the real floor rising up is off the track.

344
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:27,127
You guys are pretty good,

345
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,827
You think so?

346
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,627
Please wait!

347
00:21:32,627 --> 00:21:34,727
Is something the matter, Mitsuhiko?

348
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,227
There's something strange about this storeroom after all!

349
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,227
What's strange about it?

350
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:43,527
It's gone! My badge that I'm sure I put here!

351
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,727
What?

352
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,927
Are you sure you put it here?

353
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:52,927
Yes, over there. I'm sure I left it standing against the wall.

354
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,527
Are you sure it's not on the floor somewhere?

355
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:59,227
I looked for it but couldn't find it!

356
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:03,627
Then, could it be that only the floor and wall around here moved

357
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:06,927
and the badge fell into the space in between.

358
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,427
Or...

359
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:13,427
could it be that someone who is hiding in this storeroom took it away.

360
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,227
Someone?

361
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,527
Don't tell me that...

362
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:20,827
A monster?

363
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,727
No way!

364
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,027
Didn't you say that ghosts

365
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:28,127
are illusions created out of the fear that people hold in their hearts?

366
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,427
True.

367
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,827
Well, at any rate,

368
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:34,927
there's no doubt that something's going on in this storeroom.

369
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:38,427
A trick similar to magic,

370
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:41,227
where the treasure can be put in and taken out in a short time.

371
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,027
"Next Episode" -"Investigations should be done speedily"

372
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,627
is basic!

373
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:15,127
Darn! Is it Ms. Kobayashi the one who is giving them ideas?

374
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:21,327
It seems that the floor is a bit farther than before.

375
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,027
Far?

376
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,927
Maybe it ate up the treasure that Conan saw a while ago,

377
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,927
so the storeroom got big.

378
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,527
Could it be...

379
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:33,227
Next Conan,

380
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:36,809
"Treasure Battle in the Monster Storeroom (Part 2)"

381
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,954
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:56,054
"Ceiling"

383
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,854
Conan, we'll make you say "I lose" next week!

384
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,454
-I lose. -You're supposed to say it next week.
