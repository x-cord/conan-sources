"Teitan High School" -One, two, three, four,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,840
five, six, seven, eigth, nine, ten.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,140
One, two...

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,240
I give up.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
You're pretty good like always.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Kazumi!

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,540
"Kazumi Tsukamoto(18)" -What brings you here?

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,840
"Former Karate Captain" -I thought I'd flex my body a bit

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,340
because I've been doing nothing but studying for exams recently.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,240
Mouri, be my partner a while, will you?

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,840
Yes. It's my pleasure.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,440
Give it all you got, okay?

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,940
Of course.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
Brooding over passing seasons

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,340
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,140
Rooster Man appears at the shrines.

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,340
And the mystery of the 9 monkeys emerges.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:53,303
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 1)"

22
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:57,203
"Ranburi Shrine, Second Rooster Day"

23
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:59,603
Quite a festival, isn't it?

24
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:02,603
So many different kinds of bamboo rakes are being sold.

25
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,603
Just as would be expected of Tori no Ichi.

26
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,903
This is the first time I've been here,

27
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,503
but I didn't think it be so grand.

28
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:12,103
What kind of rake did you guys come to buy anyway?

29
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:15,603
Isn't the rake to make business prosper.

30
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:18,403
Huh? Well...

31
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:22,603
You see, Ran has a karate competition coming up, right?

32
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:26,703
Right, I'm getting one to help me win again.

33
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:29,603
Does the rake sold at the Tori no Ichi have that kind of an effect?

34
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:31,003
Yes, it does.

35
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,003
Long time ago, Prince Takeru Yamato who won in battle,

36
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:36,803
went to offer thanks to the shrine

37
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,903
on the day of the rooster in November

38
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:42,603
and hooked his weapon on the pine tree of the shrine.

39
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:43,803
That was the start of what became

40
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,403
to be known as the Big Rooster Festival.

41
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:47,303
The market that was set up on the day of that festival

42
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:48,903
became the Tori no Ichi.

43
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:52,403
Wow, Conan, you sure know a lot.

44
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:55,003
There are other stories of stars starting to shine

45
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,603
on the day of the rooster in November

46
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,203
and Bodhisattva appearing.

47
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:00,603
There are yet various other stories that refer to the origin

48
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:02,103
of the Tori no Ichi as being the harvest festival

49
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:03,903
of the farmers and so forth.

50
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,903
Thus, the rake became somewhat

51
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,503
of a lucky charm for winning battles,

52
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:11,103
good fortune and prosperous business.

53
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,703
And, you saw all that on TV, right?

54
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:17,103
Oh, yeah, on the evening news.

55
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,803
Ran!

56
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:22,403
I found it, here it is!

57
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:26,603
The thing that Ranburi Shrine is known for

58
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:29,603
Lovely oracle!

59
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,803
It's an oracle that appears only during Tori no Ichi every year.

60
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,603
It tells you exactly what type of girl

61
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,603
for the boy that you like thinks is ideal for him!

62
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,303
Sonoko, you're taking it too seriously.

63
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,203
An oracle is just an oracle after all, you know.

64
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,603
Don't you know?

65
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:46,203
Sawako of class C did exactly as the oracle said

66
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,203
and confessed her feelings, and it turned out just great!

67
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,903
What? Really?

68
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:54,403
What're they doing?

69
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,403
Beats me.

70
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:59,103
Okay, I got my oracle.

71
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:05,703
So I wonder what Kyogoku's ideal type of girl is?

72
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,803
Shinichi's ideal type is...

73
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:12,103
Come to think of it, Shinichi said before that...

74
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:17,003
I have things that I want to ask about and say, too.

75
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,203
So, wait, okay?

76
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:25,003
Shinichi.

77
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:30,303
According to my deduction, the stuff you want to ask me

78
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:34,503
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

79
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,903
Do you know, Shinichi?

80
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,503
I want to ask you if you care for me or not.

81
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,303
If your question is the same as mine,

82
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:59,803
is it possible...

83
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:03,103
Oh my god, just as I thought.

84
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,703
Aren't you going to open it, Ran?

85
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,603
No, I'll look at it alone when I get home.

86
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,203
No way!

87
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,703
Hey, wait.

88
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,203
Well...

89
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:19,203
Let's see what Shinichi's ideal type is.

90
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:20,803
In order to capture that heart of a nervous

91
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,703
and old-fashioned type like him.

92
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:24,803
It's best to be a Japanese woman with all the traditional graces.

93
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:28,303
Tomboys and girls that prefer flashy fashion are a no-no!

94
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,803
Stay graceful and refined.

95
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:35,103
It will surely bring you closer together.

96
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,503
It says.

97
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,703
I wonder if it's really true, though?

98
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,103
About him being the nervous type and old-fashioned?

99
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:45,903
Well, Shinichi is very attentive to details

100
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:48,603
so I guess you could say he's the nervous type.

101
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,903
I guess so.

102
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:52,503
He's really not interested in fashion or anything like that,

103
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,903
so maybe he is the old-fashioned type after all?

104
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:58,303
Oh my, madam, you casually admitted, didn't you?

105
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,503
That you like Shinichi.

106
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,003
No! I'm just...

107
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:06,003
Sure, sure! You can go on and confirm later

108
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:09,903
what your detective lover boy's ideal type is.

109
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,603
I'm going to the ladies room!

110
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,903
Hey... Thief!

111
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,903
Ran! Nab him!

112
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,803
Acting tomboy is a no-no.

113
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:37,903
Come on.

114
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:41,903
You should've just beat that guy up like usual with your karate.

115
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:43,603
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,603
Well, so long as you're not hurt, Ran, it's okay.

117
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:50,103
There wasn't anything all that valuable in that bag anyway.

118
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,203
What happened? What is going on?

119
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,303
A purse snatcher, purse snatcher!

120
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:58,903
The strap of my bag was cut off with a knife and my bag was stolen.

121
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:02,403
The culprit was wearing a mask.

122
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:03,403
A mask?

123
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,003
Yep. The mask of a funny face.

124
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,003
The mask of a funny face?

125
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:10,703
I saw it on the news last week.

126
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,603
The rooster man has struck again at the Tori no Ichi.

127
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:19,303
In succession to the Ichi no Tori that was held at the Sundei Shrine,

128
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:22,603
he struck again yesterday at the Ni no Tori

129
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,003
that was held at the Ranburi Shrine,

130
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,403
wearing the mask of a funny face.

131
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,603
The visitors at the shrine were struck one

132
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,103
after another by this purse snatcher.

133
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,103
The Rooster Man was given name

134
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,803
from his appearances at Rooster Festivals

135
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:37,303
and his cocky thieving acts

136
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,603
who is thought to strike elsewhere again.

137
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,803
The police plan on increasing the number officers

138
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,103
dispatched in preparation for the San no Tori festival

139
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:47,003
that is coming up at the end of this month.

140
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:50,303
But there are nearly 30 shrines

141
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:51,403
that are holding the Tori no Ichi

142
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,803
just in the Tokyo area, you know.

143
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,303
If within the entire Kanto district,

144
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,703
it would add up to no less than 50.

145
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,303
Can they really arrest him?

146
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:01,303
But, Sonoko was saying

147
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:02,703
that she's determined to go to the next Tori no Ichi

148
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:05,003
that'll be held at Ranburi Shrine

149
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,403
because she wants to take revenge!

150
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:12,103
How can you be so sure that he'll appear again at that shrine?

151
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,203
Beats me. She did sound confident, though.

152
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,003
Maybe she's planning on outwitting him

153
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,003
and thinks that he'll appear there again?

154
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:20,703
Well, he could go for the general notion

155
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,003
that a culprit never appears a second time

156
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:26,003
in a place that he has already struck once.

157
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:28,603
Then, why don't you guys go on your own!

158
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,603
I'm not going because it's too troublesome.

159
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:36,503
I guess it's tough to get hot over a Rooster Man.

160
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:39,703
"Third Rooster Day"

161
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,803
What's the matter, Ran?

162
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,003
It's unusual for you to be wearing a skirt?

163
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,603
Oh, it's just that

164
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,503
I figured this would be more appropriate

165
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,103
because it's cold today.

166
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,003
Oh, talk for yourself, Sonoko.

167
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,703
You're dressed more subdued than usual too, aren't you?

168
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,503
Oh? Well, at any rate.

169
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:05,503
Let's go take revenge!

170
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:08,803
But, do you know where the Rooster Man is?

171
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:12,103
No! Let's go pick out an oracle again!

172
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:15,103
The revenge you're referring is the oracle?

173
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,903
Lovely Oracle?

174
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:20,903
I'm going to pick out a good one this time!

175
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:24,003
The oracle is meaningless that way.

176
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:29,803
It's the Rooster Man! He's appeared again!

177
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,803
-What? -Did he really appear?

178
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:37,703
What's with that knapsack?

179
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,403
It's the Rooster Man's.

180
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:43,003
The Rooster Man threw it at the guys that went after him.

181
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:45,603
And, which way did the Rooster Man go?

182
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,703
He went running towards the park on the other side.

183
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,803
Hey, Conan?

184
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:00,503
Is there anything in here that was taken from you, Sonoko?

185
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:04,403
This is my bag!

186
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:07,403
So, he's the culprit himself and not somebody that copied him.

187
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,403
There's blood on the shoulder strap of the knapsack.

188
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,103
Uh, which way did Rooster Man come fleeing from?

189
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,703
Yeah.

190
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:21,303
See, where there are a crowd of people from around there.

191
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:30,703
Hey, are you okay? Get a hold of yourself.

192
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,103
I'll get an ambulance right away.

193
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:36,103
Uh, was he attacked by Rooster Man?

194
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,503
Yeah. I heard a groan,

195
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:40,703
so I looked in that direction

196
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,203
and saw a person wearing a mask of a funny face

197
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,803
distancing away fleeing so.

198
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,203
Rooster Man probably tried to get away with this man's belongings

199
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,103
and stabbed him because he resisted.

200
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,903
It's not Rooster Man.

201
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,503
It's a monkey.

202
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:01,603
Monkey?

203
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,603
Hey, hey, just what does that mean?

204
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,603
What do you mean by monkey?

205
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:08,403
Weren't you stabbed by Rooster Man?

206
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:13,403
He... he's trying to say something.

207
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:15,803
But his voice...

208
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,003
9?

209
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:30,503
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

210
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,603
Not Rooster but Monkey.

211
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:35,903
9. What on earth does it mean?

212
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:38,003
9 monkeys?

213
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:41,603
What did he wants to say?

214
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,050
I see.

215
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,150
So, it's a play on words tori otoko-Rooster Man and mono tori-thief.

216
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,050
That's why he's called Rooster Man.

217
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,850
But, he's gone a bit too far this time,

218
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,050
trying to take the life of another.

219
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,550
We've identified the victim who was attacked by Rooster Man.

220
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,750
He is Mr. Shiro Masuko who resides in Haidocho, age 21.

221
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
A university student who is studying

222
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,650
to pursue literature at Tohoto University.

223
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,250
Oh, I hear the victim was taken to the hospital,

224
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,750
but did he regain consciousness?

225
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Oh, no.

226
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,650
The bag of that university student

227
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,350
was also found in the knapsack,

228
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,350
and we verified his identity from his driver's license that was inside.

229
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,150
And, how's the university student doing?

230
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,250
Fortunately, his stab wound is shallow

231
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,750
but he's passed out

232
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,450
from the pain of his wound and from shock.

233
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,450
The doctor says that

234
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,450
he should be regaining consciousness in a little while.

235
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,350
And? What brings you all here?

236
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,350
To take revenge, revenge!

237
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,050
The other day, Sonoko's bag was snatched by the Rooster Man

238
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,050
at the Ni no Tori that was held at this shrine.

239
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,650
That's why we were staking out here at the Ranburi Shrine!

240
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,150
I deduced that he'd try to outwit everyone and reappear here.

241
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,850
No, you came to pick out another oracle, didn't you?

242
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,650
Of course. I already got my bag from Rooster Man's bag.

243
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,650
Oh, no. That's evidence, so we can't give it back to you yet.

244
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,350
So, it's just not somebody imitating the culprit, then.

245
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,750
No. We're having victims from both Ichi no Tori

246
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,450
and Ni no Tori come here to confirm things.

247
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,750
But, it seems that the culprit who appeared here at San no Tori

248
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,550
is also the same person as the one who appeared at the other two shrines.

249
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,950
But, the only clue we have is that the culprit

250
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,450
was wearing the mask of a funny face.

251
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,750
There are other clues!

252
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,850
When everybody was saying that

253
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,750
it seemed like the victim was stabbed by Rooster Man,

254
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,850
the victim said it wasn't a rooster, but rather a monkey.

255
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,850
A monkey?

256
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,650
And he also showed 9 fingers like this.

257
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,950
So, the culprit could be someone

258
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,850
having something to do with a monkey and the number 9.

259
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,350
Monkey and the number 9?

260
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,850
9 monkeys.

261
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,850
9 (Kyu). Monkey(saru).

262
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Kusaru (rotten)?

263
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,150
Maybe the culprit is rotting.

264
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,450
I'm sure that he's rotten to the gut.

265
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,950
This is no time to be playing with words.

266
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,550
Inspector, we arrested Rooster Man!

267
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,150
Really?

268
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,650
Oh, but there're three of them.

269
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,850
Three of them?

270
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,750
The people who went after Rooster Man

271
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,950
saw him run inside the toilet

272
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,550
and reported it to the police.

273
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,850
So, when you got there after getting the report,

274
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,350
the onlookers were all around the toilet.

275
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,250
And, when you called out to tell the man to come out of the toilet,

276
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,250
the ones who came out were those three men?

277
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,950
Yes, sir. According to eye-witness reports,

278
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,250
it's certain that Rooster Man ran into the men's room.

279
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,050
After the three were taken out,

280
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,250
we checked inside the toilet

281
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,650
and found a knife, down jacket

282
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,150
and mask of a funny face stained with blood disposed of inside.

283
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,250
I think it is unmistakable that Rooster Man went into this toilet!

284
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,350
Yes.

285
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,850
Besides, according to the onlookers,

286
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,550
everyone was scared that no one entered the toilet

287
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,650
until we arrived at the scene,

288
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,650
so I think those three are the only ones who could be Rooster Man.

289
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,550
I see.

290
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,850
Okay, I'd like to talk to each of you one by one.

291
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,050
Please give me your name and your purpose for coming here.

292
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,750
"Tatsuo Hino (45)" -My name is Tatsuo Hino.

293
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,750
After buying this rake at Tori no Ichi,

294
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,550
I happened to stop over at the restroom here, before heading home.

295
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,650
I've been having stomach trouble lately.

296
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,750
See, I even have medicine for it on me, too.

297
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,050
You're Rooster Man, aren't you?

298
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,750
I mean, you look just like a monkey!

299
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,450
It's... it's true that he resembles a monkey.

300
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,350
Yes.

301
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,350
Hey, hey, you're looking not for a monkey, but Rooster Man, aren't you?

302
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,550
The person who was stabbed said...

303
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,650
It wasn't a rooster but a monkey.

304
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,850
But, I don't think he was referring to the face.

305
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,950
Rooster Man was wearing the mask of a funny face,

306
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,950
so he couldn't have seen the face, right?

307
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,650
Right.

308
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,350
I... I came here not to come to the Tori no Ichi,

309
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,450
but rather to communicate with other gamers.

310
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,350
Communicate with other gamers?

311
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,750
We exchange items and maps that are used in games

312
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,750
through network communication.

313
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,450
Since a lot of people come to the Tori no Ichi,

314
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,850
I figured I could communicate with many people here.

315
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,650
See, I got to communicate with 10 people today.

316
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,650
I confirmed that in the restroom.

317
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,250
Okay, and what's your name?

318
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,750
We haven't gotten it from you yet, have we?

319
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,250
"Hisami Sarukawa (20)" -Hisami Sarukawa.

320
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,850
Saru (monkey). Saru (monkey)!

321
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,250
So, you're Rooster Man!

322
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,350
Sonoko!

323
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,050
But, I was never called "Saru"!

324
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,050
My name is Hisami, so my nickname is taken

325
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,950
from the kanji character of my name "Kyu", so I'm called Kyu-chan.

326
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,850
-Kyu? -What?

327
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,250
The victim indicated just before passing out,

328
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,850
the number 9 along with the word monkey!

329
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,850
But, I don't think the victim would know the snatcher's name.

330
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,350
True.

331
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,450
"Shinji Mizunoe (32)" -I'm Shinji Mizunoe.

332
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,250
I stopped by at the restroom on my way

333
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,450
to buying a rake for the company that I work for.

334
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,550
Because I couldn't buy one at Ni no Tori.

335
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,350
I actually went to buy one during Ichi no Tori,

336
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,850
but before I got to buy it, my bag with my wallet inside

337
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,750
was snatched from me by Rooster Man.

338
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,050
So, you were also victimized by Rooster Man?

339
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,350
Yes, sir. Thanks to him, all I get to eat recently is lunch

340
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,850
bought at convenience stores, because I don't have money.

341
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,350
The same with today. I'm sure I've got the receipt.

342
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,450
I wonder where I put the receipt?

343
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,350
We can figure out the victims pretty quickly.

344
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,150
Yes, sir. If we check inside the knapsack of Rooster Man,

345
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,150
it's very likely that...

346
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,950
Is there anything in the bag that was taken from you

347
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,250
that will prove that it belongs to you?

348
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,150
Like a driver's license or I.D.?

349
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,450
I think that a bank book in my name, is inside.

350
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,550
You can check the kanji character of my name

351
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,150
that's written "Shin". Please see for yourself.

352
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,250
Okay. Check it right away.

353
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,750
Yes, sir.

354
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,350
You don't seem to have anything to do with monkey or the number 9.

355
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,750
I'm a monkey in animal fortune telling though.

356
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,350
Animal fortune telling?

357
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,150
Outdated mean, how long ago was that stuff popular.

358
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,850
By the way, I hear that you two were also victims at the Ni no Tori,

359
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,950
but what rake did you come to buy?

360
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,150
Well...

361
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,950
They came to pick the Lovely oracle.

362
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,050
Lovely oracle? What is that?

363
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,150
It's an oracle that is offered every year during Tori no Ichi.

364
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,550
I have it on me now.

365
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,350
There's a button inside together with coins.

366
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,750
Where did I get this?

367
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,450
Ran! Nab him!

368
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,050
What's the matter?

369
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,050
It's a purse snatcher! A snatcher!

370
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,450
This could be the button from Rooster Man's clothes!

371
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,650
What?

372
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,650
Well, I bumped into Rooster Man.

373
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,850
I'm sure that I picked it up at that time

374
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,050
when I was picking up the coins and put it in my coin purse.

375
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,350
But, it could've been on the ground to begin with, right?

376
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,250
But, if it's what you say it is, it could be very important proof.

377
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,950
If among the three, there is one

378
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,850
that has clothes on that's missing the same button,

379
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,050
then he's unmistakably Rooster Man!

380
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,750
We would like to check inside your house immediately,

381
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,950
would that be okay?

382
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,350
No, it's fine with me.

383
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,350
If you explain the situation to mom, it's okay.

384
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,650
If that's going to clear me from being a suspect,

385
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,450
I don't mind.

386
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,650
Then, let's take a picture of this button right away

387
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,250
and pass it out to the investigators.

388
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,750
Have them confirm it immediately.

389
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,750
Strange. The fact that Ran picked up a button that may be

391
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,450
the Rooster Man's was found out of the blue just now.

392
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,650
And yet, those three don't seem to bothered what so ever.

393
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,850
Rooster Man appears at Tori no Ichi,

394
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,550
wears the mask of a funny face,

395
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,950
then steals the bags and belongings of others.

396
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,350
In other words, he's a purse snatcher.

397
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,350
He didn't hurt anyone today,

398
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,550
but on the night of San no Tori,

399
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,850
he ended up stabbing university student, Mr. Shiro Masuko

400
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,050
with a knife and wounded him seriously.

401
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,450
In the knapsack that Rooster Man left behind,

402
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,950
the things of the people he stole from were inside.

403
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,450
Therefore, he didn't seem to be a copy cat either.

404
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,250
And just before Mr. Masuko passed out,

405
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,950
he left behind the messages "monkey" and the number "9".

406
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,950
What on earth do they mean?

407
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,250
Is Rooster Man really among the three people

408
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,250
who are thought to be suspects?

409
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,850
It's not going to be all that simple to solve this case.

410
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,550
"Next Episode" -The victim knew the culprit.

411
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,850
That's why it was the 9th monkey.

412
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,150
What? You know who Rooster Man is?

413
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,650
You mean you figured out what the "monkey" and "9" means?

414
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,350
Something's wrong!

415
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,650
Ran's not answering her phone from some time ago.

416
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,050
Next Conan,

417
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,913
"The Tori's Pledge of Monkey and Rake (Part 2)"

418
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:20,077
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,077
"Oracle"

420
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,377
Maybe I'll go pick out an oracle too.

421
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:25,177
It's unlucky for those who are in love, though!

422
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,756
I'll never pick an unlucky one up!
