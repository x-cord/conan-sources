1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
A racing second hand,
a glittering shooting star!

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.550
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.050
Today's case is a sad memory
hidden behind bandages!

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.430
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.140
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.589
During the birthday party
of the Nagato Group president,

8
00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:41.669
Mitsuaki-san, husband of
2nd daughter Yasue-san,

9
00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.719
was attacked by someone
in the room below!

10
00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.179
The eldest son, Hideomi-san,
appeared on the veranda

11
00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.759
with a knife in his mouth!

12
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.559
We rushed to the room
below but were too late...

13
00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:58.089
Mitsuaki-san had been
impaled on the fence below!

14
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.589
Two days later, Hideomi-san's
body was found in the pond,

15
00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:06.419
along with his will!

16
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:08.839
It seemed certain
that he had done it...

17
00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.369
There's something
unnatural about that will!

18
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.879
In other words, Hideomi-san had
been murdered before it happened!

19
00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.549
"The Case of the Eminent
Family's Strange Deaths (Part 2)."

20
00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.509
What?! Nobody left?!

21
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.469
None of them left the premises.

22
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.439
They went inside before evening...

23
00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.439
Your father told us
to be especially alert, too...

24
00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.169
There's no mistake.

25
00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.589
After all, we only left the front
door for one or two minutes

26
00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.259
when we discovered
the body with you.

27
00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.049
Hideomi-san must've used
that chance to enter the pond

28
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.829
from the other direction.

29
00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.039
The late Mitsuaki-san was
the only one who went outside.

30
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.259
Mitsuaki-san did?! When was this?!

31
00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.469
I'd say about 9:30...

32
00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.759
He said he was
looking for Hideomi-san...

33
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:15.139
He was searching all over.
Between trees, around the pond...

34
00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.099
Anything strange
about Hideomi-san lately?

35
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.019
Yeah! Anything at all!
Like, was anything bothering him?

36
00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.259
Not sure. He didn't talk much.

37
00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:27.529
Oh, yeah! His meals!

38
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.629
His meals?

39
00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.699
He ate much more than usual the
day of the murder and the day before!

40
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.409
Yeah! He even ate dessert for once!

41
00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.049
It was surprising because
he rarely even ate breakfast!

42
00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.339
Say, did Hideomi-san
always wear the same bandages?

43
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.799
No, Yasue-san changed
them every three days.

44
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.809
I think they were last changed
two days before the incident...

45
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.759
Wait, there was something weird!

46
00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.309
One of his sheets
disappeared three days ago!

47
00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.019
Did you count right?!

48
00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:00.549
Yeah...

49
00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.729
Hey, Kudo! Come with me!

50
00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.589
Over here!

51
00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.759
Check it out.

52
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.859
The bottom of Mitsuaki-san's
and Yasue-san's veranda.

53
00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.829
What's that mark?
It's like something hit it...

54
00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:19.419
And that's the veranda
Mitsuaki-san was pushed off of...

55
00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.919
Hey!

56
00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.169
There's some here, too!

57
00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:28.259
But, there's a lot more on this one.

58
00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.679
Whose room is that?

59
00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:31.299
Nobuko-san's.

60
00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:33.429
Seems mighty fishy...

61
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.259
Alright! Let's check it out!

62
00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.189
You sure about this, Kudo?!

63
00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.639
This makes us no different than thieves!

64
00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.649
It's fine!

65
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:49.259
No, it's not fine...

66
00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:53.709
It's the phone! What do we do?!

67
00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.789
This is Nobuko.

68
00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.999
He's got some guts...

69
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.299
So, what is it you want?

70
00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:07.169
Remember those drunken messages
you left me two days ago?

71
00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.759
What time two days ago?

72
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.089
You mean you forgot?

73
00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:18.169
You left a bunch of half-hour
messages before 10:00 at night...

74
00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.769
Oh, I did?

75
00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.509
You don't remember,
so never mind. Bye!

76
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:30.239
10:00 pm two nights ago
was when the murder happened!

77
00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:31.339
Yeah.

78
00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.589
That at least means the
bandaged man on the veranda

79
00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.459
wasn't Nobuko-san.

80
00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:40.569
That means only
Hideomi-san coulda done it!

81
00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.459
Let's look around his room for now!

82
00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.919
All these books!
He was a writer, all right!

83
00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.879
Just look who's
trashing the place up...

84
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.549
An answering machine!

85
00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:56.769
We got some messages here!

86
00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:57.509
Really?!

87
00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:58.839
Let's listen!

88
00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.589
Hi! This is Yamada
from Literature Era!

89
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.299
I'll be at the usual
place at 1:00 tomorrow

90
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:08.989
to discuss your next manuscript!

91
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.419
October 31st, 1:28 pm.

92
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.579
October 31st?
That's the day before the incident...

93
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.169
This is Yamada.
I'm at the usual coffee shop.

94
00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.709
November 1st, 3:04 pm.

95
00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.709
This is Yamada.
I waited for six hours.

96
00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.219
I guess you can't come,
so I'll be going.

97
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.679
Hey! Don't tell me
Hideomi-san was actually--

98
00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.589
Yeah, right! His estimated
time of death was...

99
00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.189
There was a way after all!

100
00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:56.149
Yeah! And only that
person could've done it!

101
00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.449
Which means...

102
00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.299
...it should be here!

103
00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:04.709
If our theory is correct,
it's probably in here...

104
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:06.119
Bingo!

105
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.629
A muddy sheet!
Oh, and a swimming cap!

106
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.089
Found what I was looking for, too!

107
00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:22.469
Here you are, Hattori-kun!

108
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:26.429
Give Miyuki-san her pen back now!

109
00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:28.759
Sorry! I forgot!

110
00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.939
We're leaving now, Conan-kun.
It's already dark out...

111
00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:34.399
What time is it?

112
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.359
10 to 7:00...

113
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.819
Great! The store's still open!

114
00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:44.379
Ran-neechan!
Could you buy these for us?

115
00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.879
Oh, and do you know who used
the room above Nobuko-san's?

116
00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.249
I am for now...

117
00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.209
Then, please have everyone
come there in one hour!

118
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:57.729
I'll watch this runt until then!

119
00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:58.679
Wait!

120
00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:01.259
Tell old man Kogoro
to come right away!

121
00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.719
What's with them?!

122
00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.679
We put the old man to
sleep with the tranquilizer gun...

123
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:11.509
We had them buy everything
we need for our theory...

124
00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:13.649
And our logic is flawless!

125
00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:17.129
But, we forgot something important...

126
00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.109
Yeah.

127
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:21.069
The proof. We have no proof!

128
00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:24.529
We were so focused on our
theory that we completely forgot...

129
00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:27.259
Hey. What time is it?

130
00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:30.859
7:40. They'll be here in ten minutes.

131
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:33.709
Why didn't you realize it!

132
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:35.879
Aren't you the great eastern detective!

133
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.629
Shut up! You're the western...

134
00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.619
Wait!

135
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:42.219
Why did that person...

136
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.139
Now I see!

137
00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:46.099
So that was it!

138
00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:49.589
OK! We'll begin in
ten minutes, as scheduled!

139
00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:56.359
What's wrong?

140
00:08:57.049 --> 00:08:58.819
Say, Hattori.

141
00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:03.279
Have you ever killed someone?

142
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:11.209
We're here, Hattori-kun.
What's this about?

143
00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:13.459
Huh? Where's Hattori-kun?

144
00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:16.379
It was I who called you here.

145
00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:18.019
You did?

146
00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:19.339
What's going on?

147
00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:24.009
I finally figured out
who killed Mitsuaki-san

148
00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:26.759
and threw Hideomi-san
into the pond!

149
00:09:27.089 --> 00:09:31.169
Hey, now. It was Hideomi-san
who killed Mitsuaki-san!

150
00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:34.129
Then he poisoned
himself in the pond!

151
00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:38.729
Even the handwriting
on the will matched up with--

152
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:43.149
The phone...

153
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.869
Now, then, Inspector.
Please pick it up.

154
00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:53.009
Do so and the tragic night
Mitsuaki-san died on the fence

155
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.289
will play out once more!

156
00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:02.329
Hello?

157
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:03.769
Heya! It's me!

158
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.329
Oh, it's just you...

159
00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:08.009
What the hell're you doing?!

160
00:10:08.009 --> 00:10:09.469
Hey! What's going on?!

161
00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:12.549
Someone cut the lights and attacked--

162
00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:13.949
Where are you?!

163
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:16.439
The room below! Take a look!

164
00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:24.199
What the...

165
00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:25.969
What is going on?!

166
00:10:25.969 --> 00:10:28.659
I don't know!
But we have to save him!

167
00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:30.119
Stop right there.

168
00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:36.619
This was how the killer
drove everyone from the room...

169
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:42.589
to hide the terrifying truth
that happened in here afterward.

170
00:10:54.084 --> 00:10:56.414
W-Who are you?!

171
00:10:58.084 --> 00:10:59.584
It's me.

172
00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:01.264
Hattori-kun?!

173
00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:07.694
The alarming phone call
and the knife and bandaged face

174
00:11:08.284 --> 00:11:14.404
were all an act by Mitsuaki-san
to frame Hideomi-san!

175
00:11:14.404 --> 00:11:19.244
That's absurd! The killer was
covered in Mitsuaki-san's blood!

176
00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:22.374
And there were cuts
on Mitsuaki-san's body!

177
00:11:22.374 --> 00:11:26.244
Those cuts he made himself.

178
00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:30.584
The blood was applied to
the bandaged face with a syringe.

179
00:11:31.084 --> 00:11:34.584
The bandages and hat
likely belonged to Hideomi-san.

180
00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:38.414
So he wore a swimming
cap to keep his own hairs out.

181
00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:42.014
We found the syringe and
cap in Mitsuaki-san's room!

182
00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:47.234
But, Mitsuaki-san was the one murdered!
Why would he do all that?

183
00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:50.944
Most likely to murder President Nagato.

184
00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.124
The president?!

185
00:11:52.124 --> 00:11:56.414
Yes. The same president
his accomplice drugged.

186
00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:57.904
Accomplice?!

187
00:11:57.904 --> 00:11:59.294
That's right.

188
00:11:59.294 --> 00:12:03.624
The plan was probably for
Mitsuaki-san to kill the president

189
00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:08.624
and return below while his
accomplice kept everyone downstairs.

190
00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:12.544
But, he was killed
by his accomplice instead.

191
00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:15.874
Killed by the
person who stayed behind...

192
00:12:15.874 --> 00:12:19.174
...you, Hyuga Miyuki-san!

193
00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:22.144
Miyuki-san did it? No way...

194
00:12:22.144 --> 00:12:25.374
Mitsuaki-san musta been shocked

195
00:12:25.374 --> 00:12:29.124
to see you on the veranda
of the supposedly-empty room.

196
00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.814
So much so that he fell off!

197
00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:37.284
But, then he should've
fallen with the knife on him!

198
00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:42.704
He likely tossed his knife, bandages,
and hat outside before his climb.

199
00:12:43.064 --> 00:12:46.664
Mitsuaki-san planned to strangle
the president with the grappling hook

200
00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:48.664
in his jacket pocket!

201
00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:53.124
Naturally, Miyuki-san's
only target was Mitsuaki-san.

202
00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:58.134
Nobody would suspect
a dead man had used a trick!

203
00:12:58.134 --> 00:13:00.684
Then what was that grappling hook?

204
00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:02.544
That's simple.

205
00:13:03.294 --> 00:13:08.524
She pulled his rope in,
grabbed the weight on the opposite end,

206
00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:11.704
then lowered it onto the railing below.

207
00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:15.044
When she tossed the other end over...

208
00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:20.044
the weight hit the bottom of the
veranda and it stopped on its own!

209
00:13:20.044 --> 00:13:23.704
As proof, there are marks
on the bottom of the verandas

210
00:13:23.704 --> 00:13:27.834
in the president's room
and Mitsuaki-san's room.

211
00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:31.794
And, on Nobuko-san's
veranda below us.

212
00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:36.754
Miyuki-san probably tested it the
day before to see if it was possible.

213
00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.254
The day before?

214
00:13:38.254 --> 00:13:41.344
Yes. The president had heard it.

215
00:13:41.344 --> 00:13:42.794
He did...

216
00:13:42.794 --> 00:13:46.554
Yes. And the sound of someone
running through the hall.

217
00:13:46.554 --> 00:13:51.544
Those footsteps belonged to Miyuki-san,
who was calculating the time

218
00:13:51.544 --> 00:13:55.874
to run from Mitsuaki-san's
room to the spare key and back.

219
00:13:55.874 --> 00:14:02.244
In other words, she had planned
this murder the day before!

220
00:14:02.244 --> 00:14:07.204
Are you saying she killed Hideomi-san, too?
And what about the will?!

221
00:14:07.204 --> 00:14:13.244
I already told you, Inspector.
Her only target was Mitsuaki-san.

222
00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:14.164
What?!

223
00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:16.624
The will was written by Hideomi-san,

224
00:14:16.624 --> 00:14:19.634
who committed suicide the day before.

225
00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:21.554
The day before?!

226
00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:22.374
Yes.

227
00:14:22.374 --> 00:14:27.204
Miyuki-san most likely
found him dead in his room

228
00:14:27.204 --> 00:14:30.014
and then devised this murder!

229
00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:36.484
But, Mori-kun. The coroner
calculated his time of death--

230
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:37.984
The ground.

231
00:14:37.984 --> 00:14:38.794
Eh?

232
00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:42.544
If you put a body in the
ground and deprive it of air,

233
00:14:42.544 --> 00:14:45.154
it will decay at 1/8 the normal rate.

234
00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:49.794
She probably had Mitsuaki-san
help her wrap him in a sheet,

235
00:14:49.794 --> 00:14:54.164
and then they secretly buried
him by the pond in the morning!

236
00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:58.334
There were already lots of
holes for trees to be planted in,

237
00:14:58.334 --> 00:15:01.254
so nobody would notice an extra one.

238
00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:04.214
So, who threw him in the pond?

239
00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:06.124
Mitsuaki-san.

240
00:15:06.124 --> 00:15:10.294
He dug him up and threw him
in there just before the murder...

241
00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:12.814
While pretending
to look for him, of course...

242
00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:16.984
But, we saw Hideomi-sama
the day of the murder...

243
00:15:17.294 --> 00:15:23.944
Nope. What you saw was a
disguised Miyuki-san or Mitsuaki-san.

244
00:15:24.584 --> 00:15:28.454
It was clear once we
checked his answering machine

245
00:15:28.454 --> 00:15:32.794
that he was dead
the day before the murder!

246
00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:38.164
But, why did Mitsuaki-san
go along with Miyuki-san's plan?

247
00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:41.704
She probably told him this,

248
00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:45.454
"I have a good way for
you to take the title of president

249
00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:48.974
and place all the
blame on Hideomi-san."

250
00:15:48.974 --> 00:15:56.524
That can't be! He saved her life!
She couldn't possibly frame him!

251
00:15:56.844 --> 00:15:59.874
Besides, you don't even have proof!

252
00:15:59.874 --> 00:16:02.484
Do you have the time, Miyuki-san?

253
00:16:02.844 --> 00:16:05.944
What's that have
to do with anything, Dad?

254
00:16:05.944 --> 00:16:08.904
Oh? What happened to your watch?

255
00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:12.124
Um, I just forgot to--

256
00:16:12.524 --> 00:16:16.584
No, you didn't forget to
put it on. You can't put it on.

257
00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:20.644
Because its strap broke.

258
00:16:21.884 --> 00:16:24.664
When you pushed
Mitsuaki-san off the veranda,

259
00:16:24.664 --> 00:16:28.044
he caught on to your watch strap.

260
00:16:28.424 --> 00:16:33.054
If he tore it off, your watch
would land with his body.

261
00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:39.984
Flustered, you used something
on you to stab his right hand!

262
00:16:39.984 --> 00:16:43.064
Something? Don't tell me it was...

263
00:16:43.414 --> 00:16:45.024
her pen?!

264
00:16:45.024 --> 00:16:49.824
Yes. She removed the cap
with her mouth and stabbed him

265
00:16:49.824 --> 00:16:52.864
with her father's keepsake pen!

266
00:16:55.454 --> 00:16:58.914
But, how did you find that out?

267
00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:05.134
I took the cap off to write some
notes and saw the tip was bent!

268
00:17:05.374 --> 00:17:10.554
Not even a fire could
bend something like that!

269
00:17:10.554 --> 00:17:13.514
But, why would Miyuki-san do that?!

270
00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:15.834
The fire was probably the cause.

271
00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:21.484
If our theory is correct, the ones
who started that fire twenty years ago...

272
00:17:22.044 --> 00:17:24.444
...were Hideomi-san and Mitsuaki-san!

273
00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:26.444
What?!

274
00:17:26.444 --> 00:17:33.744
Assuming Hideomi-san didn't fix
his burn scars to atone for his sin...

275
00:17:33.744 --> 00:17:38.374
And if there was more to his will
in which he confessed everything...

276
00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:40.624
...everything would fit.

277
00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:45.584
Now I see. It was revenge for
her parents who died in the fire...

278
00:17:45.584 --> 00:17:48.554
But, one thing doesn't make sense.

279
00:17:48.954 --> 00:17:53.954
Why did you make Nobuko-san
angry so we'd find Hideomi-san?

280
00:17:53.954 --> 00:17:56.244
You did that on purpose, right?

281
00:17:56.244 --> 00:18:00.044
The police would've
found him soon enough...

282
00:18:04.204 --> 00:18:08.994
I didn't want to leave him
in that cold water any more...

283
00:18:12.494 --> 00:18:13.574
Miyuki-san!

284
00:18:14.374 --> 00:18:17.284
Stay away!
There's gasoline inside here!

285
00:18:17.284 --> 00:18:19.204
Hey, now! Don't do anything foolish--

286
00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.244
I'm serious!

287
00:18:21.244 --> 00:18:22.334
Miyuki-san...

288
00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:27.964
The detective's right! His will
explained everything about the fire!

289
00:18:28.494 --> 00:18:34.124
They had to pay...
The carefree Mitsuaki...

290
00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:37.394
and Hideomi-san,
who never said a word about it...

291
00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:40.814
But, I...

292
00:18:40.814 --> 00:18:43.734
...couldn't help but
fall in love with him!

293
00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.194
He risked his life to save me!

294
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:52.904
He always came to cheer
me up after I lost my family!

295
00:18:53.244 --> 00:18:57.994
And he accepted my proposal!

296
00:19:00.624 --> 00:19:03.744
But Hideomi-san is gone now...

297
00:19:03.744 --> 00:19:08.294
I'm all alone again...
I have to hurry to him...

298
00:19:08.294 --> 00:19:09.294
No!

299
00:19:09.624 --> 00:19:10.794
That's pointless.

300
00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:14.804
There's only water inside.

301
00:19:20.874 --> 00:19:23.184
Why? Why?!

302
00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:27.814
Why?! Why?! Why?!

303
00:19:28.294 --> 00:19:33.784
His fire lit so easily!
Why won't mine?!

304
00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:43.794
Y'know, Kudo. Maybe we
shoulda let her die after all...

305
00:19:43.794 --> 00:19:44.704
Don't be dumb.

306
00:19:45.204 --> 00:19:47.414
A detective who
corners someone with logic,

307
00:19:47.414 --> 00:19:51.544
but lets them commit suicide,
is no different from a murderer.

308
00:19:51.544 --> 00:19:57.474
Pains me to hear that. Only the
"perfect" you could say such a line!

309
00:19:58.124 --> 00:20:01.474
There's no such
thing as a perfect person.

310
00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:03.614
Even I'm just one person...

311
00:20:05.044 --> 00:20:06.484
Just one person...

312
00:20:18.454 --> 00:20:21.994
Besides, I'm sure
"he'll" save Miyuki-san.

313
00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:23.064
"He"?

314
00:20:23.064 --> 00:20:25.034
That's enough, Hyuga-kun.

315
00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:29.954
No more foolish talk
about following Hideomi...

316
00:20:29.954 --> 00:20:31.464
Sir!

317
00:20:31.744 --> 00:20:35.164
Your mother wasn't that sort of person.

318
00:20:35.164 --> 00:20:39.474
What would you know?!
You never knew her!

319
00:20:40.084 --> 00:20:41.954
But I did!

320
00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:46.414
After all, that pen of yours
is a present I gave your mother

321
00:20:46.414 --> 00:20:51.394
when she transferred to my grade school!

322
00:20:52.624 --> 00:20:56.864
It seems you thought
it was your father's, though.

323
00:20:57.294 --> 00:21:01.574
I won't ask you to
forgive what Hideomi did,

324
00:21:01.574 --> 00:21:05.584
but you're still young!
Your life's just begun!

325
00:21:06.414 --> 00:21:09.414
Live strongly for Hideomi, too!

326
00:21:09.414 --> 00:21:12.794
I'm certain your
mother wishes that as well!

327
00:22:45.434 --> 00:22:46.454
Shin-Yokohama Station

328
00:22:46.454 --> 00:22:47.804
What?!
Shin-Yokohama Station

329
00:22:47.804 --> 00:22:51.764
His first love was
Miyuki-san's mother?!

330
00:22:51.764 --> 00:22:57.234
Yeah, probably. So he made
up that lie to cover for her.

331
00:22:57.704 --> 00:23:02.874
I thought he lied and said,
"Miyuki-san was with me the whole time,"

332
00:23:02.874 --> 00:23:06.454
as atonement for his son,
but I guess it had another meaning!

333
00:23:06.454 --> 00:23:09.544
I bet he wanted to see his first love

334
00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:13.124
because he saw her
image in Miyuki-san's face!

335
00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:18.834
Alright, Kudo. Don't tell me
you knew that the whole time!

336
00:23:19.794 --> 00:23:21.174
You said "Kudo" again!

337
00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:24.704
Don't tell me "Kudo" means--

338
00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:29.664
No, I said, "Kudoi (annoying)!"

339
00:23:29.664 --> 00:23:32.374
This runt wanted
details about the incident, more

340
00:23:32.374 --> 00:23:34.434
so I called him annoying!

341
00:23:37.744 --> 00:23:39.664
You're from Osaka, all right!

342
00:23:39.664 --> 00:23:41.504
I'm the Japanese king of comedy!

343
00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:57.794
So, when the killer struck at
Maejima-san with the wooden sword,

344
00:23:57.794 --> 00:24:03.804
this cell phone in
