1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.440
Hey. Have you heard of urban legend?

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.740
Yes. A rumor that spreads gradually of occurrences

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.840
that seem possible, yet impossible.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.240
I know!

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.640
Like "Kuchisakeonna" (woman with her mouth torn to her ears)

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.340
and "Jinmenken" (a dog with a human face), right?

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.040
Yeah. One of them is...

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.940
The dark tower.

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.640
It's a tower with no entrance or window. A mysterious tower.

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.240
Yeah! It's standing tall in the Kyodo Garden,

11
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.540
that pitch black one.

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.940
Keep your voice down.

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.240
Kyodo...

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.540
Come to think of it, she is Nanami Kyodo.

15
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.640
Yeah.

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240
She's Ran's senior in the karate club called Kyodo.

17
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.440
They're making stuff like this.

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.840
A toy company?

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540
A stationary store, right?

20
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.140
No, no.

21
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.240
This is a place where they make lens, mirrors and optical goods.

22
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.940
See.

23
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.540
Don't touch!

24
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.840
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.640
Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.840
I brought it because I thought Conan and the others would like it.

27
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.640
Thank you, Nanami.

28
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.840
It's beautiful!

29
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.040
Wow!

30
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.240
Let me see it, too!

31
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.940
It's really something!

32
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.240
It changes one after the other!

33
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.640
Hurry and change!

34
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.340
-Nanami. -Huh?

35
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.940
About what you said a while ago,

36
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.540
you seem to be in a tough situation.

37
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.640
There are a lot of treasure in the Kyodo residence!

38
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940
-You thought so, didn't you? -Huh?

39
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.740
Yes... well...

40
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640
Momoe came here too because she thought we were loaded.

41
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.740
It's the name my present mother.

42
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.240
Things between my father and her don't look good, though.

43
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.840
Did you think that the family of rich people are complex?

44
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.540
Unfortunately, we're running out of money too, though.

45
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.740
I sure wish that you at least find the treasure.

46
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.540
Momoe is convinced that there is some.

47
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.040
You mean, treasure?

48
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.040
Where is it?

49
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.140
Did you come to discuss where the treasure is?

50
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.140
No, she just came to let off steam.

51
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.940
I'm sorry!

52
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.840
That's exactly true, so what can I say?

53
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.040
But, I see...

54
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.740
Why not go on a treasure hunt while you're at it, you guys?

55
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.740
Okay!

56
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.040
Hey, Nanami.

57
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.140
If you say something like that and get them excited...

58
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.740
It's worth the try.

59
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.140
If by chance they happen to find it,

60
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.540
Mom can use it as alimony to split with Dad.

61
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.040
In other words, I'd be doing my parents a favor.

62
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
Oh no...

63
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.240
How about it, people?

64
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.340
Would you like to go on an adventure?

65
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.540
-Aye! -Aye!

66
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.540
The vivid colored memories of summer

67
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540
solve mysteries all season round.

68
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.640
The dark tower that stands in the suburbs.

69
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.840
What is the secret behind no entrance no windows?

70
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

71
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

72
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.740
His name is Detective Conan!

73
00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:03.881
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 1)"

74
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.281
It's almost like a park.

75
00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:12.481
Is this the whole yard?

76
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.681
Just as would be expected of the Kyodo residence.

77
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.281
That, isn't it?

78
00:05:18.681 --> 00:05:21.381
Yeah. It's the dark tower.

79
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:27.481
It doesn't have an entrance or any windows.

80
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.281
It's said that sometimes a mysterious laughter

81
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:32.281
is heard from the roof.

82
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.481
It's been 40 years already

83
00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.681
since my grandfather, Seitaro Kyodo built it.

84
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.581
He must've been an engineer who liked to take things overboard.

85
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:42.581
I hear that he set up a lot of tricky gadgets in the mansion.

86
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:45.781
The dark tower is one of them, too.

87
00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:49.081
Dad is planning to sell the tower, land and all.

88
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:50.881
You mean the yard and all?

89
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:51.881
Yeah.

90
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.881
But, if so, the treasure hunt will go down the drain, right?

91
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:58.581
So, that's why you mother's getting flustered.

92
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.281
I don't want to!

93
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.381
I'm not selling the place off along with its treasure knowing about it!

94
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:04.781
This is no time to be saying selfish things!

95
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.581
This is the last chance we have to rebuild the Kyodo family!

96
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.081
I can't be playing along with your dreams!

97
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:11.881
It's no dream.

98
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:15.081
Tsutomu remembers well, and yet...

99
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.881
It was a bit before grandfather died.

100
00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.881
I can't be held responsible for such an old story.

101
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:25.081
But you did hear about the treasure, didn't you?

102
00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:28.281
Well, yes, I did hear about it, if you put it that way.

103
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.881
See, even Tsutomu's saying so!

104
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:33.781
They've been that way for the longest time.

105
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:36.481
I'm sorry you had to see something unsightly like that.

106
00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:38.981
I'm sure adults have their reasons.

107
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:43.581
Mom's always biting at Dad too, at home.

108
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:45.981
I'm the one being consoled.

109
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.281
Okay, why don't we go look at the tower first?

110
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.281
-Aye! -Aye!

111
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:54.381
It's quite tall, isn't it?

112
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.581
How's the roof?

113
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:57.881
There are no windows,

114
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:59.881
so I'll bet the inside is pitch dark.

115
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:02.781
I wonder why your grandfather made this?

116
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:04.981
It's the hiding place for the treasure!

117
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:07.181
It's most natural to think of it that way.

118
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:09.481
If so, there should be an entrance!

119
00:07:09.481 --> 00:07:13.781
-Okay, let's go look for it! -Aye!

120
00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:16.881
Haven't you heard about the treasure from you father?

121
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.381
Not at all.

122
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.781
Maybe because he was a son-in-law.

123
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:23.481
Maybe Mom who died heard about it.

124
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.481
And one more person Mr. Nagase may have heard about it.

125
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:27.581
What kind of person is he?

126
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:31.181
He was an engineer too and grandpa's assistant.

127
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:34.581
He's living in the annex of our house.

128
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:36.181
I don't know.

129
00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:38.181
Just a hint would do.

130
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.681
Doesn't anything come to mind?

131
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.481
No matter how many times you ask me,

132
00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:44.581
I know nothing of the treasure.

133
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:46.281
Is that all you want?

134
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.481
If so, if you will excuse me.

135
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:51.781
Mr. Nagase!

136
00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:53.681
I'm sure he knows something.

137
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.681
He's not very friendly, but I don't think he would lie.

138
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:58.981
It's about time you forget about it.

139
00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:00.781
If there's no treasure,

140
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.881
I can't get much alimony either, you know.

141
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.281
You don't mind me going to court to file our divorce, then, do you?

142
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:09.681
Momoe, you don't have to go that far.

143
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:11.981
I'll be going then.

144
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:15.281
Tsutomu.

145
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:19.781
Everybody's making fun of me.

146
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:24.181
I heard about the treasure in town.

147
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.781
Calm down.

148
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:28.381
There's no need to lend an ear to such rumors.

149
00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:29.881
More than that...

150
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.081
Even if there's no entrance in the tower,

151
00:08:37.081 --> 00:08:38.581
if you dig a tunnel through here,

152
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:40.281
you can get inside from the main house, can't you?

153
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.281
It would be a large construction.

154
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:44.481
Maybe grandpa would've done it.

155
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:45.881
For example...

156
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:49.481
See, the garden light over here?

157
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.881
Okay, look at the tower through the arch.

158
00:08:56.081 --> 00:08:57.181
My eyes...

159
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.081
I... Something's happening to me.

160
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.781
Something's wrong?

161
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.381
A wall of lens is in between.

162
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:05.681
Good work, boy, exactly!

163
00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:07.581
Huh? Since when?

164
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:15.281
This is also a prank that grandpa build.

165
00:09:15.281 --> 00:09:16.381
I wouldn't be surprised

166
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:17.681
if there were an underground passage or something.

167
00:09:17.681 --> 00:09:20.781
Nanami. You've got quite a party there.

168
00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:24.681
Mom. She's my friend in high school, Ms. Ran Mouri.

169
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.881
She's my ma, Momoe.

170
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.581
I keep telling you to speak more like a girl.

171
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:31.481
Thank you for being my daughter's friend.

172
00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:34.781
I'm sorry we came here in large numbers.

173
00:09:34.781 --> 00:09:36.981
You were talking to big brother, weren't you?

174
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:39.881
Did he recall anything that would be of use?

175
00:09:39.881 --> 00:09:42.781
Something about a blue button,

176
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.181
but he doesn't understand what it means.

177
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:46.381
Who are they?

178
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.281
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad...

179
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:52.781
They say they'll help look for the treasure.

180
00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:54.981
If so, they'll most welcome here, right, Ma?

181
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.781
Yes, yes. I'm counting on you.

182
00:09:57.781 --> 00:09:59.181
See you then.

183
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.181
Kids like them can't possibly be of any use.

184
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:06.181
She doesn't truest us, does she?

185
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:08.881
-No. -What a strong perfume.

186
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:14.081
Besides, she was wearing really long fake nails.

187
00:10:17.581 --> 00:10:21.181
How long does this connecting corridor extend?

188
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:23.881
It makes a 90 degree turn right there

189
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.081
and is connected to the storeroom of the annex.

190
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:27.981
Miso, soy sauce and sake used to be store there,

191
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:29.981
but now it's just a mere storeroom.

192
00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:34.981
Nagase.

193
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:36.581
What're you doing in the storeroom?

194
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:54.881
Treasure hunting sounds hard.

195
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:57.381
And did you find anything?

196
00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:59.281
Yes. I think that if there's any treasure,

197
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:01.481
it would be in that tower.

198
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:03.781
A tower without an entrance or any windows

199
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:05.381
is too suspicious!

200
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:09.381
Absolutely, but there's no way in it, so it can't be helped.

201
00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:11.881
What did they do when they were building it?

202
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.781
You can't construct it without a way in or out, can you?

203
00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:17.381
Yeah. That's true, but...

204
00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:19.681
I'm sure we'll find it if we look for it!

205
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:22.881
So, that's their conclusion.

206
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.881
So, will you please tell them what you know, Tsutomu?

207
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:27.581
Okay.

208
00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:29.181
When I was seven years old,

209
00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:32.181
I had a fever close to 104 degrees Fahrenheit because of a cold.

210
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:34.881
It was when Mom came to see me with Grandpa.

211
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:38.881
They were talking at my pillow side.

212
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:40.081
Taeko.

213
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.481
I'll tell just you about the story of my treasure.

214
00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:47.581
By the time I realized it, they were both gone.

215
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.681
I got anxious and went looking for them.

216
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:02.781
I think I fainted while I was looking for them.

217
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:05.981
When I came to, Mom was taking care of me.

218
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:11.481
Tsutomu. Did you come after us?

219
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:15.081
So, you sniffed the smell of the treasure, eh?

220
00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:21.181
Is that all of what you remember?

221
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:24.781
No. There's something new that I recalled.

222
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:28.181
Grandpa pointed to a three-colored button and said...

223
00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:31.281
"If you press that button, that's the treasure."

224
00:12:31.281 --> 00:12:32.781
What color was the button?

225
00:12:32.781 --> 00:12:35.181
The one that Grandpa pointed to was "blue."

226
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:39.081
Lightning?

227
00:12:39.081 --> 00:12:41.881
Hold it. I recall one other thing!

228
00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:45.481
When I went after Mom, I disappeared!

229
00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:48.281
That's right. There's no other way to put it.

230
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:51.181
-What do you mean? -Mean?

231
00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:52.881
Well, that is...

232
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:54.981
I don't remember anything else.

233
00:12:54.981 --> 00:12:58.581
But that should've been the entrance to the treasure!

234
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:00.281
And there's still more.

235
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:01.981
I was crying while walking along,

236
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:04.881
then I got big, the minute I got small

237
00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:07.181
and then I saw many split images of myself.

238
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.481
Stop!

239
00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:11.981
You were just delirious because of you fever!

240
00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:15.681
So, the treasure exits.

241
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:18.081
All we need to do now is to split up and look for it.

242
00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:20.281
Will you help us too, Tsutomu?

243
00:13:20.281 --> 00:13:22.781
Unfortunately, I'm not interested.

244
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:24.481
-What? -What?

245
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:27.581
Getting vegetables ready

246
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.381
is more of an important hobby to me.

247
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.481
It's just like him.

248
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.781
The Kyodo Manufacturing Company

249
00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.781
will go bankrupt in his generation.

250
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.681
No, it won't!

251
00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:42.481
Because we'll find the treasure!

252
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:43.981
Yeah.

253
00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:49.181
I'll be looking forward to it, young detectives!

254
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:50.781
-Yeah! -Yeah!

255
00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:52.681
The tower's getting pretty close.

256
00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:55.881
Huh? I don't see any tower.

257
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:58.081
No. That's ridiculous.

258
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:02.081
Why? I can see the tower from this window!

259
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:05.581
I see. This is no ordinary glass.

260
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:07.381
A 3-D picture is set into it.

261
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:09.281
Investigation starts!

262
00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:15.281
The weather outside is different in every window!

263
00:14:15.281 --> 00:14:17.481
This window is sunny!

264
00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.881
This is cloudy.

265
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:21.081
I wonder which the real weather is?

266
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:23.981
This is for real!

267
00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:27.281
It's Mom's voice!

268
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:32.481
Mom! Mom!

269
00:14:32.481 --> 00:14:34.281
Your brother...

270
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.181
Children, stay away!

271
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:40.481
Momoe! Momoe!

272
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.081
Get the ambulance, quick!

273
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.581
I already called for it!

274
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:46.281
What's going on?

275
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:51.681
It looks like she fell off the tower.

276
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:53.981
But this tower...

277
00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:55.381
Doesn't have an entrance.

278
00:14:55.381 --> 00:14:57.981
There's no way she could've made it up there!

279
00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:14.332
"Police"

280
00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:20.132
And it was show time for us.

281
00:15:20.132 --> 00:15:22.432
"Children, stay away" he says.

282
00:15:22.432 --> 00:15:25.332
We're unmistakably authorized personnel too and yet!

283
00:15:27.532 --> 00:15:30.632
Is it an accident or a case?

284
00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:33.332
Mouri, you sure catch on fast.

285
00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.032
Well, you see...

286
00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:36.832
I was wondering what we're going to have for dinner.

287
00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:40.232
And when I called Ran and this is what came up.

288
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:44.232
Did she fall off the tower despite not being able to get in?

289
00:15:44.232 --> 00:15:47.032
No, I don't think so.

290
00:15:47.032 --> 00:15:49.732
Maybe the corpse was put on the grass.

291
00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:52.132
We heard her scream, you know.

292
00:15:52.132 --> 00:15:54.732
Maybe it was a recording?

293
00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:57.032
What? A recording?

294
00:15:57.032 --> 00:15:59.532
A simple trick.

295
00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:01.932
Somebody hit her head in a different place

296
00:16:01.932 --> 00:16:04.132
and carried her body over here.

297
00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:05.132
No matter who sees this,

298
00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:07.832
they would think she fell off the tower.

299
00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:11.832
But this dark tower has no entrance.

300
00:16:12.632 --> 00:16:15.632
In other words, the culprit would be would be narrowed down

301
00:16:15.632 --> 00:16:17.932
to somebody that didn't know that there is no entrance.

302
00:16:17.932 --> 00:16:20.832
It's a beginner's concept as far as mysteries are concerned.

303
00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:22.432
All the members of the Kyodo family know

304
00:16:22.432 --> 00:16:25.032
that they cannot enter the tower, but...

305
00:16:26.232 --> 00:16:28.532
Of course then the one who becomes suspicious

306
00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:31.232
is somebody who's come here for the first time!

307
00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:32.432
For example...

308
00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:35.632
For example... Me?

309
00:16:35.632 --> 00:16:37.132
Of course not!

310
00:16:37.132 --> 00:16:39.732
But like Officer Takagi says,

311
00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:42.132
the rumor's going around town too

312
00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:46.032
that there is treasure in the tower but it can't be entered!

313
00:16:46.032 --> 00:16:48.832
-Right, that's it! -What?

314
00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:50.332
The culprit carried the corpse over

315
00:16:50.332 --> 00:16:52.832
to make it look like she fell off the tower.

316
00:16:52.832 --> 00:16:55.932
If so, the police will thoroughly check the tower!

317
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.732
As a result, the treasure will be found!

318
00:16:58.732 --> 00:17:02.332
I see. Is that the reason the corpse was moved?

319
00:17:02.332 --> 00:17:03.832
Which means that the culprit is...

320
00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:06.132
In other words, everyone in this Kyodo family

321
00:17:06.132 --> 00:17:08.632
is to be suspected.

322
00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:10.632
So we're back to scratch.

323
00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:11.832
My God!

324
00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:13.432
Inspector!

325
00:17:17.332 --> 00:17:20.132
So the company as well as the family has problems.

326
00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:23.532
And everyone is capable of committing the crime.

327
00:17:23.532 --> 00:17:25.732
Everyone except for that young lady.

328
00:17:25.732 --> 00:17:30.032
Only since the Father and the Son is not for the treasure,

329
00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:33.532
so you deduction doesn't have grounds.

330
00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:36.332
But there is one person who was sure that there would be treasure.

331
00:17:36.332 --> 00:17:37.732
Right?

332
00:17:37.732 --> 00:17:40.332
I'm sure that, that person is the culprit!

333
00:17:40.332 --> 00:17:43.932
Unfortunately, it's the victim.

334
00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:47.832
Conan, what do you think?

335
00:17:47.832 --> 00:17:50.132
Do you think she died of an accident?

336
00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:52.232
I'm sure we've got a case!

337
00:17:52.232 --> 00:17:55.332
Unfortunately, we can't be sure yet.

338
00:17:55.332 --> 00:17:58.032
We met her in the yard.

339
00:17:58.032 --> 00:18:01.032
There wasn't enough time to move the body.

340
00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:02.832
True.

341
00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:06.632
It's most natural to thin that she fell off the tower.

342
00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:09.832
Which means that the victim found the entrance

343
00:18:09.832 --> 00:18:12.732
right after she met us?

344
00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:14.432
Maybe it's this way.

345
00:18:14.432 --> 00:18:16.032
She was lured into the tower

346
00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:17.832
by the culprit who was knowledgeable about it,

347
00:18:17.832 --> 00:18:19.432
and was pushed off!

348
00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:24.832
Maybe the culprit is still hiding in the tower.

349
00:18:24.832 --> 00:18:28.132
But we've got to find the entrance.

350
00:18:28.132 --> 00:18:29.432
Exactly.

351
00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:31.132
Even if we find the entrance,

352
00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:32.632
we don't need to go inside.

353
00:18:32.632 --> 00:18:36.632
The lady was walking near the garden light, wasn't she?

354
00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:39.432
If there was an entrance, it has to be in this direction.

355
00:18:39.432 --> 00:18:41.132
Do you have any clue?

356
00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:44.032
The old man called Seitaro was an engineer.

357
00:18:44.032 --> 00:18:46.532
I think he hid it with things

358
00:18:46.532 --> 00:18:48.232
like the glass and lens that we just saw.

359
00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:50.732
-Huh? -What's the matter?

360
00:18:51.832 --> 00:18:53.532
This looks suspicious!

361
00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:57.032
I disappeared... or so I thought...

362
00:18:57.032 --> 00:18:58.432
This trace...

363
00:18:58.432 --> 00:19:00.332
Is it a door?

364
00:19:00.332 --> 00:19:02.832
I found it! The secret entrance!

365
00:19:02.832 --> 00:19:04.532
All right.

366
00:19:07.132 --> 00:19:09.932
Looks impossible, it's rusty.

367
00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:13.332
If she went in,

368
00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:15.432
she would've gone through a plain normal entrance.

369
00:19:15.432 --> 00:19:17.332
-I guess so. -Right.

370
00:19:17.332 --> 00:19:19.432
Let's try somewhere else.

371
00:19:20.632 --> 00:19:22.732
Become a giant, become a dwarf.

372
00:19:22.732 --> 00:19:24.932
Many splits of myself.

373
00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:27.032
Disappear...

374
00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:29.832
How beautiful!

375
00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:34.432
Amazing!

376
00:19:34.432 --> 00:19:37.132
The entire floor is like a planetarium!

377
00:19:38.132 --> 00:19:40.032
Who knows what will happen.

378
00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:42.132
Stay together, okay?

379
00:19:42.132 --> 00:19:44.732
Hey, Ayumi!

380
00:19:44.732 --> 00:19:46.432
You shouldn't go off alone.

381
00:19:46.432 --> 00:19:48.632
But...

382
00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:50.332
-Let's go together. -Yep.

383
00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:52.432
Ai, too?

384
00:19:52.432 --> 00:19:54.932
This is the ladies room.

385
00:19:54.932 --> 00:19:56.332
I see.

386
00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:02.932
I'll catch up with you right away, so go on ahead.

387
00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:04.532
Yep.

388
00:20:06.632 --> 00:20:09.132
Disappear?

389
00:20:09.132 --> 00:20:11.632
It can't be.

390
00:20:11.632 --> 00:20:13.832
Wind?

391
00:20:13.832 --> 00:20:15.932
Maybe...

392
00:20:23.132 --> 00:20:25.832
Ai, are you still in there?

393
00:20:25.832 --> 00:20:27.632
Ai's gone!

394
00:20:27.632 --> 00:20:28.732
What?

395
00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:31.232
Hey, Ai!

396
00:20:31.232 --> 00:20:34.632
-Ai! -Ai!

397
00:20:35.832 --> 00:20:37.832
There's wind coming from the space.

398
00:20:39.132 --> 00:20:41.532
Ai!

399
00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:46.032
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

400
00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:48.432
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

401
00:20:48.432 --> 00:20:50.632
Okay, let's search there!

402
00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:53.332
It smells of liquor!

403
00:20:53.332 --> 00:20:56.132
I'm used it because of Dad!

404
00:20:56.132 --> 00:20:57.932
There's a mirror!

405
00:20:57.932 --> 00:21:00.632
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

406
00:21:00.632 --> 00:21:02.832
Standing it there is just sham.

407
00:21:02.832 --> 00:21:04.832
It's on very tightly.

408
00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:07.732
This is probably the entrance that she went through.

409
00:21:07.732 --> 00:21:12.032
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

410
00:21:12.032 --> 00:21:14.232
How would he disappear?

411
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.832
There's a mirror here, too.

412
00:21:17.932 --> 00:21:19.132
This smell...

413
00:21:19.132 --> 00:21:21.732
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

414
00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:24.932
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

415
00:21:24.932 --> 00:21:28.032
Her smell is all over this area.

416
00:21:29.832 --> 00:21:31.032
What's up?

417
00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:32.532
Disappeared!

418
00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:35.732
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

419
00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:39.332
It switched to a screen!

420
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:42.132
A picture's being taken from there!

421
00:21:42.132 --> 00:21:43.432
Rubber tape?

422
00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:44.932
A person can go under it!

423
00:21:44.932 --> 00:21:47.132
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

424
00:21:47.132 --> 00:21:49.432
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

425
00:21:52.732 --> 00:21:54.132
Hey!

426
00:21:54.132 --> 00:21:55.532
What shall we do?

427
00:21:55.532 --> 00:21:58.532
What shall we do, Conan?

428
00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:09.632
Ai?

429
00:22:09.632 --> 00:22:10.932
Ai!

430
00:22:10.932 --> 00:22:13.132
It's not like her to scream like that.

431
00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:14.432
I'll be right over!

432
00:22:14.432 --> 00:22:16.432
Stay here, Ayumi!

433
00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:19.632
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

434
00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:28.232
Okay, let's go!

435
00:22:28.232 --> 00:22:30.132
Don't ever let go of my hand.

436
00:22:30.132 --> 00:22:32.032
Okay!

437
00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:12.032
"Next Episode" -The kid's are gone?

438
00:24:12.032 --> 00:24:13.832
Let's go look for them one more time.

439
00:24:13.832 --> 00:24:17.132
Maybe Mr. Nagase knows something I don't.

440
00:24:17.132 --> 00:24:18.932
Mr. Nagase...

441
00:24:18.932 --> 00:24:20.632
Mr. Nagase disappeared!

442
00:24:23.532 --> 00:24:26.132
Everybody's not going to be found just by making a fuss.

443
00:24:26.132 --> 00:24:28.132
More than that's let's think...

444
00:24:30.032 --> 00:24:31.632
This is...

445
00:24:31.632 --> 00:24:33.932
Conan.

446
00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:35.332
Next Conan,

447
00:24:35.332 --> 00:24:39.432
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 2)"

448
00:24:55.032 --> 00:24:57.132
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:57.132 --> 00:24:59.532
"Circle and Triangle"

450
00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:01.232
-First of all, the treasure! -No.

451
00:25:01.232 --> 00:25:02.332
What? Why?

452
00:25:02.332 --> 00:25:04.628
Because there was a strange person there.
