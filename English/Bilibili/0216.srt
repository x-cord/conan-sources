1
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,932
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,832
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:24,832
Today is part 2 of a true suspense story.

4
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,532
Get ready for a surprise when you find out who the killer is.

5
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,232
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:30,232
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,532
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,391
While we were driving along the coast,

9
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:01,791
our car broke down and we end up spending the night

10
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,291
at the villa of a lawyer called Tachibana.

11
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,891
However, the following day,

12
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,291
right in front of our very eyes,

13
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,491
the boat that Mr. Tachibana was on capsizes

14
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:14,891
and he drowns to death.

15
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,591
It looks to be that Mr. Tachibana was killed by a man

16
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,991
with the initials T.K that was blackmailing him.

17
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:28,991
It was thought that the man was Tatsuya Kumada,

18
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,691
a man that Mr. Tachibana had won an innocent verdict for five years ago.

19
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:34,591
Therefore, we rushed over to his place,

20
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,591
but what we ended up seeing was...

21
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,791
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in.

22
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,891
What... What is this?

23
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,191
The suspect Kumada...

24
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,691
has committed suicide.

25
00:02:55,691 --> 00:03:01,691
"Bay of Revenge (Part 2)"

26
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,391
-Please back away. Please. -Please back away.

27
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:10,691
It looks to be he used this chair to commit suicide.

28
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,691
But, this rope is sure tied in a strange way.

29
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:18,391
The rope is tied to the railing of the veranda.

30
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:21,291
Could it be because if it were tied the ordinary way to the pillar,

31
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,291
his feet would touch the ground?

32
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,091
Well, there was a loud noise upstairs.

33
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:36,791
Like something toppling over, just once through.

34
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,891
About what time was it?

35
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:42,291
Maybe a little after 7:00 pm in the evening.

36
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,791
It fits the estimated time of death

37
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,391
which is thought to be around 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

38
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:49,891
About 7:00 pm?

39
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:54,691
Then I'll be of no help because I got back at about 7:15 pm.

40
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:56,091
I see.

41
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:57,591
But, that's strange.

42
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:02,991
When I got home, I heard Mr. Kumada's washing machine running.

43
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,991
Are you sure about that?

44
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,391
Positive.

45
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:08,991
It sure is strange for one who is contemplating suicide

46
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,491
to want to wash clothes.

47
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,891
Just as I thought, this is...

48
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,791
Hey! What do you think you're doing? Look out!

49
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,791
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,591
Which boat was Mr. Tachibana riding in?

51
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,691
The one to the very right, at the end.

52
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,691
I want to go take a look at it.

53
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,791
Hey...

54
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,791
Are you investigating on the case or something?

55
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,291
Yes, I'm a detective.

56
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
You're working hard.

57
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,891
What is this scratch?

58
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,491
Did you find something?

59
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,391
Was this scratch always here?

60
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:56,391
Oh, my. I've seen it first the first time! It's still new.

61
00:04:56,391 --> 00:05:00,391
I wonder if Mr. Tachibana or the police who found the boat did it.

62
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:02,291
What a bummer.

63
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,991
The boat that was stolen was found,

64
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,291
but the anchor is stolen, why is all this happening to me?

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,891
The anchor?

66
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,391
Yes, the one that is used to keep the boat

67
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,591
from drifting away while fishing.

68
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:17,891
This type of anchor is thrown into the sea.

69
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:22,591
The one for the big boat over there was stolen, wire and all.

70
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,891
See, it was the same type as this one here.

71
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,591
It hasn't been found yet?

72
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,591
Nope! I was told it wasn't in the boat that was found this morning,

73
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,691
nor anywhere in the vicinity either.

74
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:38,291
On top of that, the anchor for the boat that was found was also gone.

75
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,691
I get the picture.

76
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,091
I'm back!

77
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,491
Welcome back.

78
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,991
Conan! Where were you?

79
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,891
What are you doing with Mr. Sakuraba, Ran?

80
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,691
I was cleaning!

81
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:03,291
And Mr. Sakuraba just came back after taking Johan for a walk!

82
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,291
Mr. Sakuraba, the case about Mr. Kumada five years ago,

83
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,491
what kind of a case was it?

84
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:13,591
I can't tell you because it's confidential.

85
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:17,891
What a childish thing to say.

86
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,991
Ms. Sugimura. Where were you all this time?

87
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,491
On a trip! I saw the news and I came right back!

88
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,791
I see.

89
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,691
And, is the killer the one called T.K?

90
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,691
Yes.

91
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,691
You know about Mr. Tatsuya Kumada?

92
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:37,591
Oh, my. You already know his name?

93
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:40,791
He used to be an elite working for a securities company.

94
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,391
But, one of his subordinates, Masahiko Tsuruta

95
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,291
embezzled his client's money.

96
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,891
After this, Tsuruta committed suicide.

97
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:49,391
However, after Tsuruta's diary was found,

98
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,991
it turned out that Kumada was the one who had actually embezzled the money.

99
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,391
Kumada was then arrested

100
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,991
for suspicion of framing a murder.

101
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,691
However, the person living below Masahiko Tsuruta's room

102
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:05,191
heard something fall around 10:00 pm.

103
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,891
But, at that time, Kumada was at a Karaoke snack shop.

104
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,891
His alibi was verified,

105
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:15,491
and he was released with no charges pressed against him.

106
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:19,491
That's exactly how it looks this time.

107
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,291
Ms. Sugimura.

108
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,391
Why do you who has only come to the office three years ago,

109
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,791
know of the case that happened five years ago?

110
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,991
I was just checking on who the initials T.K

111
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,791
that was signed on the letters were.

112
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,191
I also checked a little on Mrs. Tachibana too.

113
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:36,591
I hear that your father committed suicide because of your husband,

114
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,391
right, Mrs. Tachibana?

115
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:43,591
How you must've had a grudge towards your husband?

116
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,591
So much, as wanting to kill him.

117
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,091
Talk for yourself!

118
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,091
What?

119
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:52,691
I hear you've embezzled quite a large sum of money.

120
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:55,991
I'll bet you killed my husband because he found about it.

121
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,691
Don't be ridiculous!

122
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,891
How's it going, Dr. Agasa?

123
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,991
I found out that the address he was at during the hearing

124
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,491
was in the same prefecture, Chiba.

125
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:18,291
The family of the late Masahiko Tsuruta include his mother, Tamiko

126
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,691
and his little brother, Katsuhiko.

127
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,691
His mother and little brother?

128
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:40,391
Granny, is there a house around here where a Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta lives?

129
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:43,691
What? Masahiko's house?

130
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,291
See, it's right over there.

131
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,891
There is nobody there, though.

132
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:50,591
Why not?

133
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:55,591
His mother, Tamiko and little brother, Katsuhiko moved away.

134
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,291
After all, they've been through so much after what happened.

135
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:03,591
He was such a smart child who went to a school in Germany.

136
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,991
The house won't sell because it's in a place like this.

137
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:10,991
It seems that they used to come back to take care of it off and on.

138
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:14,391
But, since about a year ago, nobody's come around at all.

139
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,891
Johann.

140
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,191
I get it!

141
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,291
So, that's what happened!

142
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,091
It seems that sleeping pills of the same substance

143
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,091
as those found in Mr. Tachibana's body,

144
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,091
was also found in Kumada's body.

145
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,391
It was also found in the whisky left in the bottle.

146
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:59,191
Therefore, it was concluded that

147
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,191
Kumada committed suicide by taking sleeping pills

148
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:03,491
after killing Mr. Tachibana.

149
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,391
Gosh! When is it?

150
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,591
Don't be kidding.

151
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:11,091
Come, this way...

152
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,091
What's in here?

153
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,691
This file, I wonder what it is?

154
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:17,891
"Account Book"

155
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,191
An account book.

156
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,991
So, the renown detective is going to give his famed deduction?

157
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:31,791
What on earth is there to deduce at this point?

158
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,591
Well... please have a seat everyone.

159
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:39,291
I will now disclose the truth of

160
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,991
what happened to Mr. Tachibana and Mr. Tatsuya Kumada.

161
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:45,691
The truth? Hasn't the case been closed?

162
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:49,691
Are you saying that the conclusion that we have reached is not correct?

163
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,891
Exactly, Mr. Tatsuya Kumada was also killed

164
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:57,691
by the same person who killed Mr. Tachibana.

165
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,391
And, the killer is here with us!

166
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,491
What on earth are you talking about?

167
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:09,191
I will explain it to you right now.

168
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,480
The same sleeping pill was detected

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,580
in both the bodies of Mr. Tachibana and Mr. Kumada.

170
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,880
In other words, after putting Mr. Tachibana to sleep and killing him,

171
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,980
the killer, he did likewise to Mr. Kumada.

172
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,580
Moreover, he set it up to look as if Mr. Kumada committed suicide.

173
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,980
Is there anyone who was able to do something like that?

174
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,580
There are three people who could've carried it out.

175
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,280
Ms. Yaeko Kamei,

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Mr. Yuichi Sakuraba,

177
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,480
and Mr. Tachibana, himself.

178
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,380
But, Yaeko was with us when the boat capsized!

179
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,580
Which means...

180
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Wait a minute!

181
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,180
I was at the office in Tokyo at that time too.

182
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,780
No... the problem is not where you were

183
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,680
when the boat capsized!

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Preparations to kill Mr. Tachibana

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,380
was made so many hours in advance and completed.

186
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,080
All that had to be done was wait.

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,580
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

188
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,180
I see! You mean the man that we saw...

189
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,280
the man who was wearing the red baseball cap!

190
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes, he is the killer.

191
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,480
But that was more than two hours before the boat capsized.

192
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,980
How on earth did he make the boat sink?

193
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,780
All you have to do is think why the killer committed the crime yesterday.

194
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,680
As you already know, yesterday was spring tide.

195
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,180
Yes, it was spring tide indeed,

196
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,780
and we did have some difficulty in the search.

197
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,480
Can't you figure it out?

198
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,180
Spring tide is caused by great difference in water level

199
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,180
between low tide and high tide.

200
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,980
That's why the killer committed the murder yesterday.

201
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,080
Could you give us more details?

202
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,380
The man wearing the red baseball cap who we saw

203
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,680
approached Mr. Tachibana's boat,

204
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,180
and pulls the life jacket off Mr. Tachibana.

205
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,580
Then, he throws the anchor that he had stolen together

206
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,680
with the boat into the sea!

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
The killer hooks the claw that is tied on to the end of the rope

208
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,780
onto Mr. Tachibana's boat.

209
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,180
If set up this way,

210
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,880
when the water level rises because of high tide,

211
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
the anchor is pulled and tilts,

212
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,280
and when the boat capsizes, the claw comes off and sinks into sea.

213
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Mr. Tachibana is thrown into the sea

214
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,980
and drowns.

215
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,080
What a way to commit murder!

216
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,580
The rental boat owner did call to say that his anchor had been stolen.

217
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,580
That's why the anchor of the boat that was stolen was missing?

218
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,880
Right, that anchor has probably sunk under the sea.

219
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
They should be searching the area where the accident occurred today.

220
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,180
-Hey! -Yes, sir!

221
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,880
I'll ask the station about it!

222
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,580
But, why would someone do something cruel like that?

223
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,280
Everything was done to create an alibi.

224
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,280
The killer went through all this to create an alibi for himself

225
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,480
during the time the boat was capsizing.

226
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Yes, thank you!

227
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Mr. Mouri! They seem to have found the anchor

228
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,980
right below the area where the boat capsized!

229
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,680
The rental boat owner just verified the anchor a while ago.

230
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,980
Moreover, they found a claw on the end of the rope.

231
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,880
Let me continue.

232
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
The killer who returned to shore,

233
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,380
and left the cap with Kumada's name on in back on the boat,

234
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,180
so that suspicion would focus on him.

235
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,180
According to the investigations officers, that cap was Kumada's!

236
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,580
No hair or anything of any other person was found on it.

237
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,580
The killer must've used a similar type of cap for disguise.

238
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,180
The killer probably go a hold of Kumada's cap

239
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,580
when they saw each other or something.

240
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,280
The killer and Kumada must've known each other.

241
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,880
As evidence of that, the killer went to Kumada's residence

242
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,280
and was able to make him drink whisky with a sleeping drug in it.

243
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,380
Then after standing Kumada's body up against the sliding door,

244
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,280
the killer wound the rope around his neck.

245
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,780
The rope that was pulled through the railing of the veranda

246
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,980
and using this as a point of support,

247
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,480
the killer probably pulled on the rope with all his might.

248
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,580
The rope was then tied onto the railing of the veranda,

249
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,980
and the sliding door opened.

250
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,280
Finally, the killer set the chair in place.

251
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
That's it.

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,680
But, at around 7:00 pm when the person downstairs heard a sound,

253
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,580
everyone here has an alibi.

254
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,480
Well, the killer doesn't need an alibi for that specific time either.

255
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,880
Just what do you mean?

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,780
This is the same trick as the one Mr. Tatsuya Kumada

257
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,880
had used to kill Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta five years ago.

258
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,280
-What? -What was that?

259
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,980
The washing machine that was running after 7:00 pm.

260
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
The killer tied a string around the spinner

261
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,580
in the centre of the washing machine

262
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
so that it would be wound as the washing operate.

263
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,180
Then a hoop is made at one end of the string

264
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,980
and hooked onto the back of the chair.

265
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,880
All that is left to do is to set the timer of the washing at 7:00 pm.

266
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,580
When the washing machine starts, the string is wound,

267
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
and the chair falls down.

268
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,980
I'll have them check the washing machine right away!

269
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,980
Which means that Mr. Tachibana was killed around 1:00 pm.

270
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,180
Kumada's estimated time of death is between 6:00 pm and 7:30 pm,

271
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,980
so before 7:00 pm and around 6:00 pm,

272
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,780
the person who does not have an alibi at this time is the killer.

273
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,880
Let's take you, Mr. Sakuraba, for example,

274
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,280
you left here around 1:00 pm

275
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,680
and returned after 7:00 pm.

276
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Please wait a minute!

277
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,480
There are many who had a grudge against Mr. Tachibana!

278
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,580
Did you check all those people already?

279
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Sakuraba, what did you come to pick up at the office yesterday?

280
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,880
Moreover, why at about the same time

281
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
Mr. Tachibana's boat had just capsized?

282
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,080
I...

283
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,180
Mr. Sakuraba, did you come to get this account book?

284
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,580
So, that you could make it look as if Ms. Sugimura used the money!

285
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,980
You!

286
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,180
I... I'm sorry.

287
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,580
I was going to adjust the book with Mr. Tachibana last night to set you up

288
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,180
and make it look like you used the money that he lavishly used.

289
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,280
That's why I was relieved to hear that Mr. Tachibana passed away.

290
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,180
Mr. Sakuraba! Just what do you mean by you felt relieved!

291
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,780
I was sick and tired of assisting Mr. Tachibana's wrongdoings!

292
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,380
He threatened me saying that

293
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,680
I wouldn't be able to function as a lawyer in the future

294
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,880
if I didn't do as he said.

295
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,280
I was ready to break down any minute.

296
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,980
Mr. Sakuraba, we'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

297
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,080
No! I didn't kill him!

298
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
If you resist, we'll arrest you hear on the spot!

299
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
Please believe me!

300
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm not the one who killed Kumada and Mr. Tachibana.

301
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,580
I'm innocent!

302
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,680
That's enough!

303
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,580
Mr. Sakuraba didn't kill anyone.

304
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,580
The one who killed them both is me!

305
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,480
No way!

306
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,680
Ms. Yaeko.

307
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
I was waiting for you to confess.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,880
I knew you were not the type of person

309
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,280
who could frame somebody up and keep silent about it.

310
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,180
Yaeko could've put sleeping pills in Mr. Tachibana's thermos any time.

311
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,280
That day, after we all left,

312
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,980
you disguised yourself as Kumada and left from the back door.

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,280
You then, approached Mr. Tachibana's boat.

314
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,180
Soon later, you witnessed Mr. Tachibana's boat capsize together with us.

315
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,980
When you went shopping at sundown,

316
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,380
you parked the car in the parking lot of the supermarket,

317
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,980
disguised yourself again and headed for Kumada's place.

318
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Isn't that right?

319
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,380
Please take a look at this.

320
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,880
Conan found this name plate

321
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,580
in the yard of Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta's house.

322
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,280
Johann?

323
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,880
Yes, if you read it in German, it's read "Johan".

324
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
This probably is the name

325
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,980
that your son used in Germany when he was an exchange student,

326
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,480
isn't that right, Mrs. Tamiko Tsuruta?

327
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,480
What?

328
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,580
You mean Yaeko is...

329
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,980
Yes, the mother of Masahiko Tsuruta

330
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
who was killed by Kumada.

331
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,880
I should've realized sooner.

332
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,580
Yesterday, Johan chased the boat you were riding at the cape.

333
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,880
I'm sure that Johan knew it was you despite your disguise.

334
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,180
My younger son passed away last year too,

335
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,180
so Johan is the only one left to me now.

336
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,280
I lied saying that he was a stray and came to live here with him.

337
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,880
I fought with all my might in court,

338
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,280
and yet no one recognised me.

339
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,280
I aged all of sudden from the inappropriate sentence of the hearing.

340
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,980
And...

341
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,180
Six months ago, Kumada finally appeared.

342
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,980
I happened to hear about the trick using the washing machine

343
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,280
from the other side of the door.

344
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Kumada was promising Mr. Tachibana that

345
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,880
he'd pay any amount Mr. Tachibana wanted to handle the case.

346
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,780
Mr. Tachibana won Kumada an innocent verdict

347
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,280
despite knowing that he had killed Masahiko.

348
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,480
I followed Kumada back to his apartment that day,

349
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,680
and thought up the idea of killing him and Mr. Tachibana

350
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,280
when I saw the red baseball cap that he forgot here.

351
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,680
And you started sending letters of blackmail

352
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,180
that looked to have been mailed from Kumada to Mr. Tachibana.

353
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,180
Yes, I've been so scared since yesterday.

354
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,480
But, I'm really relieved now.

355
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,780
You were expecting to get arrested to begin with, weren't you?

356
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,880
That's why you went ahead and committed the crime

357
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,580
despite a detective like me being here.

358
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,780
I guess so.

359
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,280
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

360
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,780
Dad! Now what?

361
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,480
Weird, and I just got it repaired.

362
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,580
When are we ever going to make it back to Tokyo?

363
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,880
Please help us!

364
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,580
We just need to get to Tokyo!

365
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,980
Maybe more cars will stop if took his place?

366
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,680
Never mind, let's stay here and watch the ocean a while longer.

367
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,180
Well, why not?

368
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Hey!

369
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,280
Do something!

370
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,380
"Next Episode"

371
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,580
Hey, Ran!

372
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,180
What's wrong?

373
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,380
Ran!

374
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,980
I remember that something like this happened before.

375
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,880
When there were a series of high school girls being hit-and-run...

376
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,580
Next Conan,

377
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,280
"Inspector Megure's Sealed Secret (Part 1)"

378
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:31,598
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:33,098
"Accessory"
