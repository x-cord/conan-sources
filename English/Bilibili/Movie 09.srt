1
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,130
Iceberg ahead!

2
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,230
Hard a port!

3
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,630
Captain!

4
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,830
Captain?

5
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,730
Are you okay?

6
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,730
Sorry for the intrusion.

7
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,030
Captain...

8
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,830
Captain!

9
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,130
Please hold on!

10
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,930
Captain!

11
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,330
First...officer.

12
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,030
It's beautiful.

13
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,030
Such a beautiful sunset.

14
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,430
I wish Shinichi could see this view.

15
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,530
I'm seeing it.

16
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,330
What...What's wrong?

17
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,630
You'll be able to see it better from up here.

18
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,630
It's true that I can see better now,

19
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,830
but it's so embarrassing.

20
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,630
We saw that, Conan!

21
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,330
Crap.

22
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,130
Let me down, Miss Ran!

23
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,130
We saw that! We saw that!

24
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,230
We saw that!

25
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,330
You were acting cute in front of Miss Ran again, weren't you?

26
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,430
Idiot!

27
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,730
It's not like that.

28
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,130
You're blushing, Conan.

29
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,330
What are you talking about?

30
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,630
It's because of the sunset!

31
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,330
Really? He's blushing!

32
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,330
Idiot, I'm not!

33
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,430
Idiot, I'm not!

34
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,130
What are you talking about?

35
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,630
I said it's because of the sunset.

36
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,730
It's the same as that time.

37
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,530
What's the same?

38
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,630
Nothing.

39
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,930
What is it? Tell me!

40
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,830
I told you it's nothing.

41
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,230
How can I believe there's nothing?

42
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,100
(Detective Conan Strategy above the Depths)

43
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,330
I am a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

44
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,430
When I went to the amusement park with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

45
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,230
I witnessed a man in black carrying out a suspicious transaction.

46
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,930
As I was too focused on the transaction,

47
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,930
I failed to notice his accomplice approaching from behind.

48
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,430
He made me take the poison.

49
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,330
When I woke up,

50
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,030
my body had become smaller.

51
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,130
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

52
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,930
not only would my life be in danger,

53
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,830
I would also endanger my family and friends around me.

54
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,530
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa,
I decided to conceal my true identity.

55
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,430
When Ran asked for my name,

56
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,530
without time to think it over, I took the name of Conan Edogawa.

57
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,430
In order to collect information about those guys,

58
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,330
I moved in with Ran whose father is a detective.

59
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,330
I'm from Teitan Primary School Grade 1, Class B, Genta Kojima!

60
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm his classmate, Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya!

61
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
Ayumi Yoshida!

62
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,730
And our apprentice, Conan!

63
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,130
Along with Ai...

64
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,930
We're the Detective Boys!

65
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,830
This sparkling detective boys badge on my chest
contains a microscopic transceiver.

66
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,730
It has a communication function. It's absolutely wonderful!

67
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,730
This thing that's emitting light is a wristwatch flashlight.

68
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,630
It's waterproof, so you can even use it in the sea!

69
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,930
Both of them are Professor Agasa's inventions.

70
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,930
In order to help the shrunken me,

71
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,330
the professor invented these unique gadgets one after another.

72
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,430
Especially this Voice-Changing Bowtie,

73
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,230
and this Stun-Gun Wrist-watch.

74
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,930
Thanks to these two gadgets,

75
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,730
the famous detective "Sleeping Kogoro" was born.

76
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,530
Don't you think Haibara...

77
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,830
is a little bit cool? Or rather... mature for her age.

78
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,030
Of course she is.

79
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,030
Ai Haibara.

80
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,230
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

81
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,130
She used to work with those men in black.

82
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,930
In order to escape from the organization,

83
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,530
she took the same drug as me.

84
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,930
After that, her body also shrank.

85
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,130
That's how...

86
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,030
I changed from a high school detective to
an elementary school detective.

87
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,730
I have solved difficult cases one after another,

88
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,230
In the meantime, I have been secretly trying to
find out who those men in black really are.

89
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,230
But, Mr. Mouri...

90
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,130
Could you please work a little harder on your deductions?

91
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,230
Although my body is smaller, my mind is still sharp.

92
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,930
I am the famous detective that solves all the mysteries.

93
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,130
Only one truth will prevail!

94
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,530
It's so spacious!

95
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,130
It's so luxurious!

96
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,730
Of course it is.

97
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,430
Speaking of Yashiro Group,

98
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,330
it's a pretty big financial group.

99
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,530
This is the first cruise ship built by Yashiro Shipbuilding Company
at a cost of 100 million yen.

100
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,730
It's gotta be luxurious!

101
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,230
Distinguished guests.

102
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,130
Are you Mr. Mouri?

103
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,130
Yes.

104
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,030
We're preparing your seats right now.

105
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,530
Please wait for a moment.

106
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,230
Professor.

107
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,830
What's that?

108
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,230
This?

109
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,930
It's just a regular IC Recorder.

110
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,930
I thought I could use it to record my thoughts
when I get any ideas for new inventions.

111
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,330
Oh, right.

112
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,930
Speaking of new inventions...

113
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,330
Cufflink speakers.

114
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,730
It also has the ability to transmit sound.

115
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,030
That's pretty cool.

116
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,630
Not bad.

117
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,930
Cufflinks?

118
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,330
That's great.

119
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,630
I'll borrow them for a while.

120
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,730
But these are...

121
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,730
Idiot!

122
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,930
These things are made for dashing men like me.

123
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,130
It's too early for a brat like you.

124
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,630
But...

125
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,130
Dad,

126
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,030
those are...

127
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,630
It's okay, Miss Ran.

128
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,930
I probably don't need to use them inside this ship anyway.

129
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,930
Mr. Mouri.

130
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,130
You must be the famous detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

131
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,830
It's me.

132
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,130
Great!

133
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,530
What's with this guy?

134
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,430
I'm a script writer, Hironari Kusaka.

135
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,530
I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Mouri.

136
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,230
So kind of you to say this.

137
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,430
This is Miss Minako Akiyoshi.

138
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,030
She's the sub-leader of the design team for this cruise ship.

139
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,030
She was also the one who came up with its beautiful name "Aphrodite".

140
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,430
I'm Akiyoshi.

141
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,230
Nice to meet you.

142
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,630
I'm Mouri.

143
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,530
She's beautiful.

144
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,530
Excuse me... Mr. Mouri...

145
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

146
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,030
Your seats have been prepared.

147
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,930
Ah, sorry. Can you add two more seats?

148
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,530
You don't mind, right, Mr. Mouri?

149
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,130
Then, please follow me.

150
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,930
Don't you think he's a bit strange?

151
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,430
Why?

152
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,630
If it were the usual him...

153
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,030
Speaking of Aphrodite,

154
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,630
she is the goddess of love and beauty.

155
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,130
Compared to this boat,

156
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,030
this name would be better suited for you.

157
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,330
That's what he would say, isn't it?

158
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,430
Maybe it's because Miss Minako looks like my mother.

159
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,530
I see.

160
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,230
Now that you've mentioned it, they do look alike.

161
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,930
In other words, she's the type that Mr. Mouri is unable to handle.

162
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,430
In fact, I'm writing a drama based on a luxury cruise ship.

163
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,030
I met Miss Akiyoshi while I was interviewing her.

164
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,730
Indeed.

165
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,230
I see.

166
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,830
By the way, Mr. Mouri, you were invited, right?

167
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,230
Or did they hire you to investigate something?

168
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,630
How can I put this?

169
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,630
Well, it's not like that.

170
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,430
What does that mean?

171
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,430
The ones invited were actually Miss Sonoko's parents.

172
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,230
Her father is the president of Suzuki Group.

173
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,130
But my parents couldn't make it.

174
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,530
So I came in their place.

175
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,930
Then I thought the more the merrier.

176
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,930
So the eight of us got invitations as well.

177
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,030
So that's how it was.

178
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,730
It's just like we're their substitutes.

179
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,230
I see.

180
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,730
I see...

181
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,430
By the way, what kind of story are you writing?

182
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,030
Is it about a one-week trip around the world on a luxury cruise ship?

183
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,730
That sounds interesting.

184
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,630
Yeah?

185
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,730
Maybe it's a story like the disast rous Titanic
that sank on its maiden voyage.

186
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,930
Ai...

187
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,530
Speaking of sinking,

188
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,530
there was an accident
where a Yashiro's cargo ship collided with an iceberg, right?

189
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,830
Yes, it was an accident during the winter 15 years ago.

190
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,430
I heard it was due to the misjudgment of the captain.

191
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,830
One staff member died.

192
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,330
And the captain ended his life along with the ship.

193
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,830
Really?

194
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,130
What if this ship sinks too?

195
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,730
I can only swim 7 meters.

196
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,130
Don't worry.

197
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,730
The Aphrodite has a very good captain.

198
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,130
There are no icebergs around this part of the ocean.

199
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,030
Anyway, if the ship sinks, the first people
to be rescued will definitely be those people there.

200
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,930
Huh?

201
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,730
Is that Mr. Niimi?

202
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,730
The former Prime Minister?

203
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,530
And his wife.

204
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,430
And then, the ones in show business...

205
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,930
Aren't those the Uruashi Sisters?

206
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,330
No matter where I see them, they always look so hot!

207
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,630
Those people are all guests invited by
the president of the Yashiro group.

208
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,830
Speak of the devil.

209
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,130
President Yashiro and his daughter have arrived.

210
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,630
After President Yashiro's daughter

211
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,430
got married, she succeeded her father
and became the Chief of Yashiro Shipbuilding Company.

212
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,630
Speaking of which,

213
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,230
Chief Takae's husband

214
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,030
died in a traffic accident not long ago.

215
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,330
He did?

216
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,730
Mr. Hideto Yashiro was my superior.

217
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,030
He was also the leader of this cruise ship's design team.

218
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,930
I see.

219
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,330
I heard that while he was driving,

220
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,630
he had a heart attack and drove off a cliff.

221
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,130
It's the captain!

222
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,330
He's so cool!

223
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,030
He's Captain Wataru Kaidou.

224
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,030
Remember that accident 15 years ago

225
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,530
that we talked about earlier?

226
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,630
He was the first-mate of that ship.

227
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,930
What? It's suspicious?

228
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,630
About Hideto Yashiro's accident?

229
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,830
Yes.

230
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,930
He happened to have a heart attack while going downhill.

231
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,730
That doesn't feel right.

232
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,430
But according to the local police's investigation,
there wasn't anything suspicious, right?

233
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,430
That's true, but...

234
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,730
Fine.

235
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,830
It's not a bad thing to investigate until you're satisfied.

236
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,330
I'll contact the local police there.

237
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,130
Thank you so much.

238
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,430
Well, Officer Sato...

239
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,630
Do you need my help?

240
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,730
You still haven't finished your report yet, have you?

241
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,030
Chiba.

242
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,130
Give me a hand.

243
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,130
Okay.

244
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,330
Well, since our drinks are all set...

245
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,530
Let me do it, Mr. Mouri.

246
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,630
Then, to this pleasant cruise trip...

247
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,730
and...

248
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,730
to Ran, the winner of the Kanto Karate Tournament.

249
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,430
Cheers!

250
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,230
Cheers!

251
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,730
Thank you.

252
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,030
Sonoko, you were really...

253
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,530
Miss Ran!

254
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,930
You're the winner of the karate tournament. That's amazing!

255
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,930
And it's the Kanto tournament!

256
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,230
Awesome!

257
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,630
Awesome, awesome!

258
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,730
Did Kudo send you any gift to congratulate you?

259
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,930
Shinichi?

260
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,430
I told him on the phone.

261
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,730
He said, "Really? Not bad."

262
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,430
Is that all?

263
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,030
Anyway, he has been busy solving his cases.

264
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,530
That deduction maniac.

265
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,730
That was after I said congratulations a million times as Conan.

266
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,630
I'm so full!

267
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,630
The steak was really delicious.

268
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,530
I wish I could have it everyday.

269
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,330
Next is dessert, right?

270
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,030
What's wrong?

271
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,830
I feel a little seasick.

272
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,630
Yeah, I'm a little dizzy too.

273
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,630
Dad, you drank too much alcohol!

274
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,930
Ran, don't embarrass me.

275
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,730
Geez...

276
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,530
Your father is interesting.

277
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,030
No, he's just an old alcoholic.

278
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,230
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,630
I think I gotta go back and rest in my room.

280
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,030
Are you okay?

281
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,730
I have medicine in my room.

282
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,530
See you later.

283
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,330
Take care of yourself.

284
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,230
Hold on,

285
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,330
Dad...

286
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,130
Are you sure you're okay?

287
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,130
Kogoro Mouri

288
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,930
is A-OK, over!

289
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,530
Don't worry, Miss Ran.

290
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,030
All that's left is just to put him in bed to sleep.

291
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,230
Sorry.

292
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,830
Then, Conan...

293
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,430
Can you take care of Dad for me?

294
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,330
Professor, I'm really sorry about this.

295
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,130
It's okay.

296
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,830
It's okay, it's okay.

297
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,130
Good night, Miss Ran.

298
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,730
It's open, professor.

299
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,330
Then, we're leaving too

300
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,130
Then, Conan...

301
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,330
Can you take care of Dad for me?

302
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,130
Sorry to be disturbing you!

303
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,230
What are you guys doing all together?

304
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,530
We're discussing what present we should
give Miss Ran to celebrate her victory.

305
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,430
What are these?

306
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,830
Beautiful, right?

307
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,530
We picked them up from the island we passed today.

308
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,730
We want to use them to make a gold medal for her!

309
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,430
Shinichi didn't prepare any gift. Miss Ran must be very sad.

310
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,030
Good luck with that, then.

311
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,230
I'm going to take a bath.

312
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,130
Take a bath?

313
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,730
What? Want to join me?

314
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,730
No... Thanks...

315
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,530
Please allow me to confirm your schedule for tomorrow.

316
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,330
Your breakfast will be at 7:00 a.m.
I'll bring a western-style meal set to your room.

317
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,530
After that, the Chief will play squash with Mrs. Niimi from 9:00 a.m.

318
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,730
We have reserved a court on the 7th floor for you.

319
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,330
After 30 minutes, the president will play billiards with Mr. Niimi.

320
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,430
We've reserved the pool bar on the 3rd floor for you.

321
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,730
After the squash game,
the Chief will return for a change of clothes at 9:30 a.m.

322
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,230
This feels so good.

323
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,630
Yeah, enjoying my morning tea in the salty breeze...

324
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,130
is really nice.

325
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,030
Yeah, it's really nice.

326
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,030
Very nice.

327
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,030
This way, please.

328
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,330
Okay.

329
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,230
Did you see? Chief Takae's beautiful legs?

330
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,730
She really doesn't look like she's in her 50s!

331
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,230
Come on! How can you think of such things this early in the morning?

332
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,330
Professor, it's about time, right?

333
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,530
Time for your classic lame riddles!

334
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,230
We know it's just a matter of time before you ask.
Then ask us faster. We're already waiting!

335
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,130
He's being humiliated by kids too.

336
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,530
Okay, then. As you wish,

337
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,230
I'll give you a riddle related to the cruise.

338
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,230
During the cruise, Genta has received some treatment
at the medical room on the ship.

339
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,630
Which of the following illnesses does Genta have?

340
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,730
1. He ate too much and hurt his stomach.

341
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,230
2. He sprained his ankle after tripping.

342
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,330
3. He was out too long in the sun and got heat stroke.

343
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,030
Okay, which one is correct?

344
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,730
If it's the usual Genta, then it should be the first choice.

345
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,130
Wrong answer!

346
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,030
It's not the first one, because I never hurt my stomach
no matter how much I eat.

347
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,930
I've figured it out.

348
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,130
Me too.

349
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,830
But this riddle is too difficult for kids, isn't it?

350
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,930
Because English...

351
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,930
Sonoko!

352
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,530
English? English is the hint?

353
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,230
The second hint is ship (fune).

354
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,830
Ship (fune)?

355
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:37,930
I got it!

356
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,130
It's the second one! He sprained his ankle.

357
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,230
Fune in English is ship, right?

358
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,830
And Genta put a medicine pack(shippu) on his ankle!

359
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,230
Correct.

360
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,130
Also, "Yuujou" is friendship in English.

361
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,230
"Uwasabanashi" is gossip

362
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,930
It should be gossip, shouldn't it?

363
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,830
Then, we'll see each other at 10:00 a.m.

364
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,130
So ship refers to "shippu".

365
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,530
Say, Mitsuhiko...

366
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,130
But if I sprain my ankle
while crossing the sea(goukai), I'll regret(koukai) it, right?

367
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,830
What does that mean?

368
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,630
You're not as smart as I thought.

369
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,230
Oh right...

370
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,530
When should we give her that present?

371
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,530
We could give her now.

372
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,430
How about this?

373
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,730
Ran.

374
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,630
Let's go get one last round of drinks.

375
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,430
Okay.

376
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,030
I must drink as much as I want.

377
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,030
You've already drunk a lot.

378
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,630
This is just the beginning, all right?

379
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,730
We're going too!

380
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,730
Let's go get some drinks!

381
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,730
What kind of juice is better?

382
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,730
Let's go!

383
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,130
Wait for me!

384
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,330
What are these kids so excited about?

385
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,330
Coming.

386
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,230
I know the secret you've been hiding for 15 years.

387
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,530
At 10:15 a.m.,

388
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,630
go to the basement marina.

389
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,830
I see.

390
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,930
The accident happened right outside of his villa.

391
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,730
Let's go check out his villa.

392
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,830
Okay.

393
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,230
What should we do now?

394
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,230
It's still a little cold to go for a swim.

395
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,830
I'm going to change my clothes.

396
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,830
Change?

397
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,030
Actually, I got an invitation from the Uruashi Sisters.

398
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,130
They said they wanted to hear
the stories of the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.

399
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,530
See you later.

400
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,330
He's really something, huh?

401
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,730
When did he get the invitation?

402
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,630
Let's forget about him.

403
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,730
So, what do you want to do, guys?

404
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,630
I want to play hide-and-seek.

405
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,330
It seems like fun.

406
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,530
Let's play!

407
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,030
Hide-and-seek? How nostalgic.

408
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,130
We played it a lot when we were kids.

409
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,230
In the park and the vacant lands of the new community.

410
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,930
I even played it in elementary school once.

411
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,430
Really?

412
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,330
Sorry, I'll pass.

413
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,430
Let's play together, Conan!

414
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,430
You're always trying to be a lone wolf!

415
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,930
Come to think of it, I was rejected by Shinichi at that time too.

416
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,430
All right! Let's play hide-and-seek together!

417
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,930
I suppose it'll kill some time.

418
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,030
What about you, professor?

419
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,630
I have made reservations for a massage.

420
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,830
What an old man!

421
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,730
So, here are the rules.

422
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,230
The time limit is 30 minutes.

423
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,030
The hiding area is from the first floor to the seventh floor,

424
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:08,130
excluding passenger cabins,
employee-only areas, toilets and observation rooms.

425
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,230
How's that?

426
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,930
Agreed!

427
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,430
Then, please gather around.

428
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,630
Rock, paper, scissors!

429
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,030
Okay, Sonoko is the seeker.

430
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,730
Wait... Wait a minute.

431
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,730
No, no, no.

432
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,130
It's impossible to find 6 people in 30 minutes

433
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,730
on such a big ship!

434
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,630
Then, how about we make an exception, and add an extra seeker?

435
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,730
So we'll have two seekers?

436
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,430
It doesn't matter. Just change the rules.

437
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,430
Then, let's play rock, paper and scissors again!

438
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,630
I hope we'll work well together.

439
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,030
So do I.

440
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,730
What a unique combination.

441
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,330
Right...

442
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,930
Can I borrow your detective badge?

443
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,430
Why?

444
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,830
If there are two seekers,
it will be hard to know who's been caught, right?

445
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,230
We need to use these badges to communicate.

446
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,130
Don't lose it.

447
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,730
Then, 5 minutes left. We'll start at 9:50 a.m.

448
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,830
If the seekers find everyone by 10:20 a.m., the seekers win.

449
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,030
Okay, we won't lose.

450
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,330
Too bad, but we'll win.

451
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,230
Because...

452
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,230
We have Conan.

453
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,230
You think too highly of me.

454
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,030
Okay, let's go.

455
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,930
Hurry up and hide!

456
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,930
We're going.

457
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,930
Wait for me! I'll find you one by one.

458
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,230
Miss Ran hasn't noticed it yet.

459
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,930
She'll notice it while we're playing hide-and-seek.

460
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,230
She'll be surprised!

461
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,830
Yes.

462
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,330
I got it!

463
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,830
Oh no!

464
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,830
I guess this isn't a good place.

465
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,330
What time does the movie start?

466
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,430
It's at 10:00 a.m., right?

467
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,930
We gotta go now.

468
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,730
Hurry up.

469
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,530
It's going to start.

470
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,530
Too bad.

471
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,130
Yes!

472
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,930
I never thought I'd be the seeker.

473
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,130
But, it's not bad to be on the seeker once in a while.

474
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,230
Five minutes have passed.

475
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,730
I'll look from the 5th floor and up.

476
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,830
I'll leave the lower floors to you, all right?

477
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,830
All right.

478
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,330
Hey, Kudo!

479
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,230
Haibara.

480
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,230
I guess you don't even realize you're playing hide-and-seek, do you?

481
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,730
Okay, I got one.

482
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,830
How did you know?

483
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,430
Of course a food lover would hide at a restaurant.

484
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,930
Haibara...

485
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,530
You borrowed it from the professor, right?

486
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,230
This is exactly being too smart for your own good.

487
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,930
All right, come on out.

488
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,730
I thought this was a good hiding place.

489
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,830
Not at all. You're still 10 years too early to beat me.

490
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,130
Hello, this is Akiyoshi.

491
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,730
Miss Minako, it's Kusaka.

492
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,230
Then, to get right to the point,
let's start with the list of characters.

493
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,230
Nanami Okazaki,

494
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:12,930
age 20.

495
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,230
Served as an attendant on the luxury cruise Southern Cross.

496
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,130
Next, I'll read the story.

497
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,130
Nanami Okazaki loves the sea.

498
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,230
Maybe it's because she was born and raised by the sea.

499
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,430
She loves its vastness more than anything else.

500
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,330
Although we've easily found the four of them...

501
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,730
As expected, the last one turned out to be the hardest one.

502
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,230
Is Miss Ran so good at hiding?

503
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,330
She's like a ninja, a ninja!

504
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,930
Would an ordinary elementary school kid
climb on ceilings and dive in ponds?

505
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,530
Ceilings?

506
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,530
Ponds?

507
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,930
Amazing!

508
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,730
She's had a lot of stamina since she was a kid.

509
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,830
12 minutes left. Let's keep looking for her.

510
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,430
This isn't the right place either.

511
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,230
10:11 a.m.

512
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,530
Only 9 minutes left...

513
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,830
Hello! It's me, Mouri!

514
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,130
I'll avenge my father's death!

515
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,930
I'm starting the countdown.

516
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,230
5 seconds left.

517
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,130
4.

518
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,230
3.

519
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,230
2.

520
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,330
1.

521
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,530
0.

522
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,530
We won in hide-and-seek!

523
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,830
It's all thanks to ninja Miss Ran!

524
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,930
Right, right!

525
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,330
Miss Ran!

526
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,330
I told you we'd win, right?

527
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,030
Where were you hiding, Miss Ran?

528
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,230
You were kicking the soccer ball the entire time, right?

529
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,930
I knew it all along.

530
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,130
It seems like Miss Ran hasn't noticed it yet.

531
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,530
That's strange.

532
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,130
Maybe s he's too slow.

533
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,830
Is she still looking?

534
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,730
What?

535
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,030
So cold.

536
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,030
What's going on?

537
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,530
A box?

538
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,030
Am I in a box?

539
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,330
No! Someone help me!

540
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,330
Somebody! Please help me!

541
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,430
Help! Help!

542
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,230
Help me!

543
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,030
What?

544
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,930
What happened, Miss Sonoko?

545
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,830
Help me!

546
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,830
Calm down, Sonoko.

547
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:11,730
Where are you now?

548
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,530
A box! I'm in a box!

549
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,430
Hold on, Sonoko, I can't hear you.

550
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,330
Say it again.

551
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,230
Did the batteries die?

552
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,330
Damn. It was because...

553
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,030
You're cold, Sonoko?

554
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,230
Freezing?

555
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,930
If so...

556
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,230
It's the freezer!

557
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,430
What are you doing?

558
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,030
Where is the freezer?

559
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,130
The freezer?

560
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,830
Please, my friend is in danger.

561
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,830
It's on the second basement floor.

562
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,130
There are so many!

563
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,130
Which one is it?

564
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,430
Let's split up and find her.

565
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,430
Okay.

566
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,230
Miss Sonoko.

567
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,030
Miss Sonoko.

568
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,430
Sonoko?

569
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,930
Are you there?

570
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,630
Miss Sonoko?

571
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,930
Where are you?

572
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,930
She's not here.

573
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,930
Let's go outside.

574
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,530
It's freezing.

575
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,430
Where is she?

576
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,030
Sonoko... Sonoko...

577
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,630
Damn it! Where?

578
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:28,830
Where is she?

579
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,930
Could it be that... she's already dead?

580
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,230
Don't say such unlucky things!

581
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,030
But there isn't any other place that's cold, is there?

582
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,630
Dead?

583
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,730
It's there!

584
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,130
This ship has a place like this?

585
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,730
It's surprising.

586
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,730
It's heavy.

587
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,530
Sonoko!

588
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,030
Sonoko...

589
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,530
Take her to the sick bay immediately!

590
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,030
I'm alive again.

591
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,930
There's no need to worry.

592
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,830
Just keep her body warm.

593
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,830
After a little more rest, she'll be able to move around.

594
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,930
Thank you.

595
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,530
Thank god, Sonoko.

596
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,730
But...

597
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,430
Who would play this kind of prank?

598
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,830
Prank?

599
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,730
This is not a prank.

600
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,230
This is an attempted murder.

601
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,330
Please call the police immediately.

602
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,530
Got it.

603
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,830
Tell me more details.

604
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,530
Where were you attacked?

605
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,930
At the basement marina.

606
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,530
When I was there to look for Ran,

607
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,030
I was suddenly hit on my shoulder by a stick or something.

608
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,530
Then I passed out.

609
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,230
What about the face of the attacker?

610
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,230
I think I saw it,

611
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,430
but I can't remember.

612
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,430
And the time?

613
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,130
I remember that.

614
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,730
It was at 10:11 a.m.

615
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,030
10:11 a.m.

616
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,230
I see.

617
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,730
The mortuary is only a few feet away from this place.

618
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,130
But why was Miss Sonoko attacked?

619
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,830
This is...

620
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,130
President Yashiro's metallic fan.

621
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,330
Why would it be in such a place?

622
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,130
He's not in the room.

623
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,730
Mr. Mouri!

624
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,030
The captain talked to the police...

625
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,930
This is President Yashiro's room.

626
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,730
The Uruashi Sisters told me that earlier.

627
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,230
Come to think of it, someone came out of this room just now.

628
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,030
What do you mean by someone?

629
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,230
I couldn't see his face.

630
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:54,330
Because he was wearing a windbreaker with a hood.

631
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,930
When was that?

632
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,930
It was around 10:15 a.m.

633
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,830
Is that true, Mr. Mouri?

634
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,530
That's strange.

635
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,930
Neither of them wore a windbreaker.

636
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,830
Chief Takae should be the only one in the room at that time.

637
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,930
The purpose of wearing a windbreaker with
a hood in the hallway was to hide his or her face, wasn't it?

638
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,430
Could something have happened to the Chief?

639
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,430
Chief!

640
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,530
It's Tsujimoto!

641
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,430
Chief!

642
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,730
You have a master key, right?

643
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,030
But...

644
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,530
Chief! Sorry for intruding!

645
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,930
Chief!

646
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,630
Don't move!

647
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,530
Stay here.

648
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,430
How could this happen?

649
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,730
Who would do this?

650
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,730
I'm afraid she's been dead for 30 minutes.

651
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,430
I'll go and tell the captain.

652
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,930
I'll go to the president.

653
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,730
Looks like she was killed just after she came out of the bathroom.

654
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,230
The blood on this side has been wiped clean.

655
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,330
Why?

656
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,830
Why only the blood on this side?

657
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,330
What the hell are you doing?

658
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,830
It hurts.

659
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,030
Geez!

660
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,130
Mr. Mouri!

661
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,130
Mr. Niimi said that President Yashiro
left the billiard room and never came back.

662
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,630
What did you say?

663
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:42,130
Maybe President Yashiro is in some trouble as well.

664
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,030
Thanks for coming!

665
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,930
Mr. Mouri!

666
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,930
Thank you for coming, inspector.

667
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,530
Where's President Yashiro?

668
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,130
He's still nowhere to be found.

669
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,430
The crew split up and searched the entire ship.

670
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,530
Anyway, whether in the air or on the waters,

671
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,930
wherever you go, cases follow you, right, Mr. Mouri?

672
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,630
Will it be in space next time?

673
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,130
Go there by a rocket?

674
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,130
How is that possible?

675
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,230
What?

676
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,830
The president's fingerprints?

677
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:47,730
Yes.

678
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,130
Most of them were found near the hatch
of the basement marina where the blood was discovered.

679
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,930
Of course, the blood near the hatch matched that of President Yashiro.

680
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,330
Thank you.

681
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,730
Keep up the good work.

682
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,230
Also, inspector.

683
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,630
According to the staff at the basement marina,

684
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,630
the hatch appeared to have been opened.

685
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,530
And it was just a short time ago.

686
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,430
What?

687
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,230
Fingerprints,

688
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,130
bloodstains.

689
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,530
And the opened hatch.

690
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,330
If so, inspector, I'm afraid...

691
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,430
I'm afraid President Yashiro was attacked
by someone in the basement marina,

692
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,330
and was pushed into the sea through the hatch.

693
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:30,430
I believe we can safely assume that.

694
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,830
Maybe you're right.

695
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,030
Shiratori.

696
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,130
Contact the Coast Guard.

697
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,030
Ask for a sweep of the surrounding waters.

698
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:37,930
Got it.

699
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,230
Takagi!

700
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,930
Yes, sir.

701
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,530
I want to ask the Niimi couple a few questions.

702
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,930
Bring them here.

703
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,430
Yes, sir!

704
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,230
Then, Conan.

705
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,130
Yes?

706
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,530
We'll take care of the rest.

707
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,330
You return to your room.

708
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,230
Don't go outside unnecessarily.

709
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,330
The murderer is probably still on this ship.

710
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,530
Okay.

711
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,930
There's a cake too.

712
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,130
It looks delicious.

713
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,730
Roast beef...

714
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,430
I suppose it's okay to eat it one in a while...

715
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,130
Not even once in a while.

716
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,830
Oh right, professor...

717
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,830
How about we bring Miss Ran and Miss Sonoko's meals to them?

718
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,430
They must be hungry too.

719
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:39,030
No, it's better to leave Sonoko to the doctors.

720
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,130
Miss Ran also said she'd eat later, so don't worry about it.

721
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,030
Is that so?

722
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,430
Mitsuhiko.

723
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,230
Do you think she found the gold medal?

724
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,130
I don't think Miss Ran has the time
to think about this kind of thing now.

725
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,330
You have a point.

726
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,930
Where is Conan?

727
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,330
Now that you've mentioned it, he's not here...

728
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,030
Did he leave us behind and went to
help the police with the case again?

729
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,530
Maybe so.

730
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,230
He seems to be very good at this kind of hide-and-seek.

731
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,230
Thank you for your cooperation.

732
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,830
I probably don't need to say this,
but please find the culprit as soon as possible.

733
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,530
Now then.

734
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,130
If Chief Takae returned to her room after the squash game

735
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,530
and got killed after taking a bath,

736
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,830
then we can safely say that the person wearing the windbreaker

737
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,630
who passed by Mouri must be the culprit.

738
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,630
After that, the suspect went to the basement marina,

739
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,130
and murdered President Yashiro,
who had an appointment with that person there.

740
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,130
In that case, the timing matches.

741
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,330
That means...

742
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,530
these two cases were most likely done by the same culprit.

743
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,930
Mouri.

744
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,730
What about the culprit's physical stature?

745
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,730
This person was about 170 cm tall.

746
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,030
And seemed pretty skinny.

747
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,530
We can't tell whether this person is a male
or female just by the height.

748
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,630
Come to think of it, the murdered Chief Takae
was about the same height as well.

749
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,230
Miss Tsujimoto.

750
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,330
You sure this is that windbreaker?

751
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,030
Yes.

752
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,230
Each passenger was given one as a souvenir for being on this ship.

753
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,530
But if they really wanted to,
it would be easy for the crew to get one, right?

754
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,930
Shiratori,

755
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,630
s peaking of the culprit's motives...

756
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,330
I believe it was an act of revenge.

757
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,330
The victim's wallet and jewelry were still there.

758
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,430
There were no sighs of the lock being picked.

759
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,130
Either the victim opened the door and let the culprit in,

760
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,330
or the culprit had a master key and sneaked in.

761
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,130
These are the only two possibilities.

762
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,530
Mr. Misaki, who holds the master keys?

763
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,830
There are quite a few.

764
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,430
Including me, of course.

765
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,030
And the guards, Natsuhi who took care of the Chief,

766
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,130
and the attendants in charge of the guest rooms.

767
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,530
They all have keys.

768
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:04,830
I see.

769
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,730
Inspector.

770
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,330
The culprit targeted the victim when she was alone.

771
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:14,630
In that case, is it possible
that the culprit knew the victim's schedule?

772
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,830
Miss Tsujimoto.

773
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,730
You were the one in charge of their schedules, right?

774
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,430
Right.

775
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,830
Who else knew about their schedules?

776
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,230
Except the chief purser Mr. Misaki,

777
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,330
I never told anyone.

778
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,030
That is to say,

779
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,830
if you were 10cm taller,

780
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,630
or if Mr. Misaki's weight was 10kg less,

781
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,130
you two would become the most suspicious ones.

782
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,530
There's one more thing.

783
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,430
Whether Sonoko's incident

784
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,730
has anything to do with these two cases.

785
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,330
Come to think of it,

786
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,130
you passed by the suspect,

787
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,630
and didn't even see the suspect's face...

788
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,230
Yeah... that's embarrassing.

789
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,030
But inspector...

790
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,330
This place is a closed room above the ocean.

791
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:07,530
The culprit must be somewhere on this ship.

792
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:12,730
That means, including the passengers and crew, there are only 600 suspects here, right?

793
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,930
Anyway, Takagi...

794
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:18,930
Keep questioning the passengers
and see if there are any other witnesses.

795
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:19,830
Yes, sir.

796
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,130
Mr. Misaki and Miss Tsujimoto.

797
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,230
Please tell us more about the passengers and crew.

798
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,330
Understood.

799
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,030
Just like Officer Shiratori said,

800
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,230
when did the culprit know about the Yashiro family's schedule?

801
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,230
Miss Natsuhi said she didn't tell anyone.

802
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,630
That is...

803
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,230
That's right. If someone used that...

804
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,530
I have something to ask Miss Natsuhi!

805
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,130
Conan!

806
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,930
Where did you come from, brat?

807
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,630
Did you talk about today's schedule
in the president's room last night?

808
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,330
When I sent them back to the suite after dinner,

809
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,730
I confirmed the schedule with them both.

810
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:11,230
Then, was there any time yesterday
when no one was in the president's room?

811
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,730
Let me see...

812
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,930
Yesterday, President Yashiro said he was tired,

813
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:18,330
he was resting in his room until dinner.

814
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,830
The only time the room was empty was during dinner.

815
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,130
I see.

816
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,830
You little brat...

817
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,630
You've been listening to our conversation, haven't you?

818
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,430
Ouch!

819
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,730
Mr. Misaki!

820
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,030
Was there any passenger who didn't come to dinner?

821
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,930
No, I believe all of them were there.

822
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,230
If so, the culprit should be one of the crew members.

823
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:52,530
I'm sorry, I think I gotta go back and rest in my room.

824
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,630
Were you interviewed by Mr. Kusaka?

825
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,630
Mr. Hironari Kusaka?

826
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:01,930
Yes, I have.

827
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,630
Then did any master key go missing after that?

828
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,130
Don't go too far.

829
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:09,930
How could that happen?

830
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:11,630
Well, actually...

831
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,330
About 3 weeks ago,

832
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,830
we found that one of them was gone.

833
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:17,430
It really happened?

834
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,730
Furthermore, just as Conan said,

835
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,030
it was right after the interview with Mr. Kusaka.

836
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,730
Wait a minute.

837
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,030
Who is it?

838
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,730
I mean that Mr. Kusaka.

839
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,630
He's a script writer.

840
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,630
He has been here many times for interviews.

841
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,930
I see...

842
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,630
So, Conan...

843
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,430
Is there anything suspicious about that person?

844
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,530
Mr. Kusaka returned to his room in the middle of dinner.

845
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,130
He said he was seasick.

846
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,630
I was thinking he might be hiding
in the president's room and eavesdropping.

847
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,930
Idiot! He's not a kid like you!

848
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,930
He wouldn't be hiding in there.

849
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,230
A bug.

850
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,130
Maybe he left a listening device in the president's room at that time.

851
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,230
I see.

852
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,130
What do you think, Mouri?

853
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,330
What's that Mr. Kusaka's physical stature?

854
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,030
Come to think of it, it does resemble the culprit's.

855
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,130
All right, let's meet Mr. Kusaka.

856
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,630
I see... A listening device...

857
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,430
As expected of the famous detective Kogoro Mouri.

858
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,730
Not like that. This time it was thanks to Conan's idea,

859
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,430
and we did a bit of reasoning.

860
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,730
Is that so?

861
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,830
But this reasoning is not correct.

862
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,830
Because at 10:15 a.m.,

863
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,330
I was on the phone with Miss Minako in this room.

864
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,630
Miss Minako? That designer?

865
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,130
Because I couldn't use my cell phone at sea.

866
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,530
So I used this phone.

867
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,530
The exact time you were on the phone is...

868
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,430
From 10:00 a.m., it lasted about 30 minutes.

869
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,830
Just check out the phone records
and you'll know the exact time, right?

870
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,330
Then what was the phone call about?

871
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,430
If you don't mind.

872
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,830
I was just done writing the script draft.

873
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,230
So I thought I could get her opinions on it.

874
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,530
Script draft?

875
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,730
The draft for a drama based on a luxury cruise ship.

876
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,630
She once gave me advice about cruise ships.

877
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,830
Cruising Love Story.

878
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,630
I even specially asked for a single room,

879
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,730
so that I could finish this without being disturbed by anyone else.

880
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,930
But why didn't you see her in person to talk about it.

881
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,630
After all, you're on the same ship.

882
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:45,030
Because she's still single.

883
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,330
It's inappropriate to visit her room.

884
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,630
If at a cafe or a lounge, there could be someone listening to us.

885
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,030
Stealing of ideas happens quite often

886
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,330
in my line of work.

887
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,030
I see.

888
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,530
From what I can see, Mr. Kusaka is innocent.

889
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,430
We don't know until we confirm his alibi.

890
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,130
I'm thirsty.

891
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,630
Then let's hurry up.

892
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,430
What's wrong, Mr. Mouri?

893
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,630
I think that lady must've caught his eye.

894
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,730
She was quite beautiful, after all.

895
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,830
I've heard about the case from Mr. Misaki.

896
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:42,130
It's true that Mr. Kusaka called at precisely 10:00 a.m.

897
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,930
We talked for about 30 minutes.

898
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,830
He came to ask for my advice on his script draft before.

899
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,930
So this morning, when we drank tea,

900
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,930
he said he was going to finish the story soon,

901
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,430
and he wanted to hear my opinion.

902
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,530
He said he would call me at 10 a.m.,

903
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,130
and told me to wait in the room at that time.

904
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,030
I see.

905
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,130
As long as we can confirm that.

906
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,130
Thank you for your time.

907
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,330
I guess Mr. Kusaka's alibi has been confirmed.

908
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,630
As long as those two are not accomplices.

909
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,830
The phone in his room isn't a wireless phone.

910
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,830
Which means, he couldn't arrive at the crime scene
while speaking on the phone.

911
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,530
What's up, Mr. Mouri?

912
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,830
You're thinking about Minako, right?

913
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,030
After all, she's a beautiful woman too.

914
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,530
From the above...

915
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,130
Mr. Tome!

916
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,830
Inspector Megure.

917
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,030
How's the investigation going?

918
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:52,130
We're mostly done.

919
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,430
There isn't anything special.

920
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,730
Is that so?

921
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:01,730
But there were traces of reddish brown liquid wiped off
on the floor near the body.

922
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,730
Reddish brown liquid?

923
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,730
Mr. Tome.

924
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,130
Wasn't that blood?

925
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:07,130
No.

926
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,630
The color looks similar,

927
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,630
but it didn't respond like blood.

928
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,330
Then what was it?

929
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,130
Inspector Megure.

930
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,230
I've questioned all the passengers and crew members on the 6th floor.

931
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,830
We haven't found any witnesses.

932
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:23,830
I see.

933
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:28,130
The welcome party starts at 5:00 p.m.

934
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:32,930
Before that, let's split up and ask the other passengers.

935
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,530
Yes, sir.

936
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,030
Then, inspector.

937
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,330
We'll go back to headquarters with the evidence we've collected.

938
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,630
Thank you for your hard work.

939
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,730
Excuse me!

940
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,830
I've been looking for you.

941
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,830
Can I ask another question?

942
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,030
Sure, Mr. Little Detective.

943
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,830
What do you want to ask?

944
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,830
What was your phone call with Mr. Kusaka like?

945
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,830
Well...

946
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,530
How should I put it?

947
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,430
He was reading the story and I was just listening.

948
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,230
Just listening?

949
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,030
If I interrupted, he'd get angry.

950
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,430
He would say, "Please be quiet".

951
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,830
That's why I don't usually interrupt him.

952
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,330
Then, until Mr. Kusaka finished the story,

953
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,730
you were just listening in silence?

954
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,130
Yes.

955
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,230
After about 20 minutes, when the story was finally finished,

956
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,830
he asked me how it was.

957
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,930
Then I told him it was interesting.

958
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:44,830
It's done.

959
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:46,530
Here.

960
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,330
Thank you...

961
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,530
Are you feeling better, Sonoko?

962
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,530
I'm fine now.

963
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,030
We shouldn't have played hide-and-seek
if we knew it would be like this.

964
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,630
Don't say that.

965
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:05,730
Speaking of which...

966
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,930
Before we started playing hide-and-seek...

967
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,730
Too bad, but we'll win.

968
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,830
Because...

969
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,330
What were you going to say after that?

970
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,530
Didn't I tell you I played hide-and-seek
once during elementary school?

971
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:22,730
That was during the school open day when I was in first grade.

972
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,430
I asked Shinichi to come play at that time, but...

973
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Shinichi, are you listening?

974
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,260
Shinichi...

975
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,560
Let's play hide-and-seek.

976
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,060
It's fun!

977
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,060
Sorry, but I'll pass.

978
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,760
The soccer game is coming up.

979
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,660
That cocky brat!

980
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,560
He's been acting like that since he was a kid?

981
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,160
After that, we decided to play without Shinichi.

982
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,060
Under the stage in the gym,
there was a space used to store things, remember?

983
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,560
There were many folding play mats and other stuff, right?

984
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,360
On the side of the stage,
there was also a small space behind the stairs.

985
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,660
So you hid in there?

986
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,060
I thought if I hid there, no one would find me.

987
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,560
Then the teacher who came to check on things pushed the stairs back.

988
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,060
I couldn't get out.

989
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,060
Then what happened?

990
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,560
No one could find me,

991
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,260
and I couldn't get out. So I didn't know what to do.

992
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,760
But Shinichi found me easily.

993
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:33,760
On the way home, I asked Shinichi how he knew I was hiding there.

994
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,060
The Monster in School.

995
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,560
In that movie,

996
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,760
the kids who hid in the school building
were all eaten by the monster, right?

997
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,560
That means, the chance of you hiding in
the school building would be zero.

998
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,560
Wait a minute, how did you know I watched that movie?

999
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,860
Every time you passed by that video store,

1000
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,260
you always glanced at the movie poster.

1001
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,660
Even though you always say you're afraid of monsters,

1002
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,160
I know you'll definitely watch those movies.

1003
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,660
So, the only place you could hide would be
somewhere outside the school building.

1004
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,560
You like animals,

1005
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,960
so you wouldn't hide in the hen house,
because that would scare the chickens.

1006
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,960
At that time, the seniors in the basketball club
were organizing the sports equipment.

1007
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,260
If you were hiding in the sports equipment room,
you wouldn't have gotten stuck there.

1008
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,760
The pool is currently under construction.

1009
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,960
So all that's left is the gym.

1010
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,060
That's why I figured you were there.

1011
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,660
I remember that, during PE class,

1012
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,260
you peeked behind the stairs once, right?

1013
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,460
How's that? Surprised?

1014
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,760
So you've been watching me all along, Shinichi?

1015
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,460
You idiot, I haven't.

1016
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,660
Your're blushing.

1017
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,060
What are you talking about?

1018
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,460
It's because of the sunset.

1019
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,060
Okay, okay, I finally understand.

1020
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,860
When you said "It's the same as that time" yesterday,
you were referring to this, huh?

1021
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,460
Then, what you said at that time should be...

1022
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,860
We'll win.

1023
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,860
Because...

1024
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,760
the only one who can find me is Shinichi.

1025
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,160
Am I right?

1026
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,960
It's not like that!

1027
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,060
You're blushing!

1028
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,060
What are you talking about?

1029
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,560
It's because of the sunset.

1030
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,860
Mr. Mouri...

1031
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,460
What did he find Kusaka for?

1032
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,960
Coming.

1033
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,060
So it's you this time, boy.

1034
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,160
I came to play.

1035
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,860
I took a look at this earlier. It's really a cool laptop!

1036
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,060
I use it to work.

1037
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,160
This is not something for kids to read.

1038
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,460
Okay.

1039
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,060
It's the same as professor's.

1040
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,660
Why can't I hear anything?

1041
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,060
Brat.

1042
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,260
Get out.

1043
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,660
Not surprising, he won't keep the evidence forever.

1044
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,060
Our hard-earned trip turned out to be a disaster.

1045
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,460
Don't say that, Genta.

1046
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,160
This is a serious case.

1047
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,060
I see.

1048
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,960
But why do humans always have to hurt each other?

1049
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,660
If only we could all live in harmony.

1050
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,660
That's impossible.

1051
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,060
Because humans have emotions.

1052
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,760
Something invisible and fickle,

1053
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,160
something hard to deal with.

1054
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,560
If it's friendship and love, then that's fine.

1055
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,560
But if there's some setback

1056
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,460
that turns it into jealousy or hatred,

1057
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,960
thoughts of murder will come along.

1058
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,860
But my Mom and Dad always fight with each other,
but they still get along well.

1059
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,160
That's because they can understand each other.

1060
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,860
Ai was right.

1061
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,060
Humans always hurt others or get hurt by others over trivial matters.

1062
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,060
If you want to stop it from happening,

1063
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,360
you must have a kind heart and be able to empathise.

1064
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,160
Empathise?

1065
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,660
Professor!

1066
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,860
I want to borrow something from you, professor.

1067
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,560
A seat belt buckle.

1068
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,460
Chiba, come here for a moment.

1069
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,060
Yes.

1070
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,460
Did you find something?

1071
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,960
Look at this.

1072
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,760
Is it a seat belt buckle?

1073
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,460
Don't you think it looks like something was tied there?

1074
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,360
There is a thread-like burn mark, right?

1075
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,060
Really.

1076
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,160
It's roughly the width of a kite string.

1077
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,660
Kite string?

1078
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,560
What are you doing, Mr. Mouri?

1079
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,760
I'm going to the maiden voyage party. It's about to start.

1080
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,160
Mr. Mouri.

1081
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,460
Inspector Megure wants to see you for a bit.

1082
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,860
Inspector?

1083
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,060
I'll be right there.

1084
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,460
I'll come with you.

1085
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,160
You stay here and change your clothes.

1086
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,460
I see.

1087
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,460
There is also something suspicious about Hideto Yashiro's accident.

1088
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,160
According to Inspector Sato's investigation,

1089
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,160
the kite string mark on the seat belt is suspicious.

1090
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,960
How's that, Mouri?

1091
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,560
Can you think of anything?

1092
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,160
Even if you say so...

1093
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,260
What about the other items left behind?

1094
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,260
Right.

1095
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,660
There was a burnt can that looked like a juice can,

1096
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,060
and also some little things left behind.

1097
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,360
It is said that they've all been disposed of.

1098
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,660
A can and kite string?

1099
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,060
If someone used that...

1100
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,460
Were you surprised?

1101
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,060
You little brat!

1102
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:40,660
I was planning to shake a Coca-Cola and make it spurt out.

1103
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,360
But there was no Coca-Cola for sale.

1104
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,460
Coca-Cola? How dare you...

1105
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,360
I thought my heart was going to stop.

1106
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,360
Speaking of being scared by the can...

1107
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,160
Stun grenade.

1108
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,260
Perhaps the culprit used a stun grenade.

1109
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,660
That's right.

1110
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,460
What's that, Shiratori? That stun something...

1111
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,060
Stun grenade, also known as a flash bomb.

1112
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:10,260
With a bright flash and an explosion,
it stuns the opponent's movement.

1113
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,160
It's shaped and sized like a can

1114
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,660
and it's also a type of hand grenade.

1115
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:18,960
For example, the culprit tied a kite string to the stun grenade
which had its pin pulled out already,

1116
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,960
then tied that kite string to the seat belt buckle.

1117
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,560
When the victim tried to pull down the seat belt buckle...

1118
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,660
I see.

1119
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,060
Even if he didn't have a heart attack,

1120
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,460
he couldn't drive after he passed out.

1121
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,260
Thus the car just ra n downhill in one go.

1122
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,160
But it's not that easy to get a stun grenade...

1123
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,160
No. In this era, one can get anything as long as he really wants.

1124
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,560
And if the purpose was to give the victim a shock,

1125
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,460
t here was no need to use a real grenade.

1126
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,260
A larger firecracker could work too.

1127
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:06,960
Inspector.

1128
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,260
We just got a message.

1129
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,260
It seems that the body of President Yashiro has been found.

1130
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,760
Captain.

1131
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,560
I have something that I wish to talk to you about.

1132
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,760
What is it?

1133
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,260
It's about the welcome party at 5:00 p.m.

1134
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,260
I hope you can cancel it.

1135
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,060
If the culprit is planning another round of crimes,

1136
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,360
there's a good chance that he'll try to
use the confusion during the party.

1137
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,660
But this is...

1138
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,560
Please cooperate with us, captain.

1139
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,360
No, inspector.

1140
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,660
Let the party go on as usual.

1141
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,560
Everything will come to light there.

1142
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,660
Could it be that... Mouri...

1143
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,560
Are you going to do it again? The usual thing?

1144
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,160
But he's not asleep.

1145
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,160
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

1146
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,660
Well, let's enjoy ourselves.

1147
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,060
I'll make up for the half day I spent lying in bed!

1148
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,960
Sonoko, that's enough...

1149
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,960
Say, let's go ask Miss Ran.

1150
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,360
About the you-know-what.

1151
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, we should.

1152
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,760
A gold medal made from sea shells?

1153
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,160
The string was too short, so we could only make it into a bracelet.

1154
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,660
So you really didn't notice it.

1155
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:42,760
What a pity.

1156
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,360
Sorry. I'll go look at it later.

1157
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,660
Anyway, I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I'm really happy.

1158
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:57,260
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Aphrodite.

1159
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,760
I will be your host for tonight's party.

1160
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,960
My name is Natsuhi Tsujimoto.

1161
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,660
Thank you all.

1162
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,660
First of all, I would like to introduce
the main crew members on this ship.

1163
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,660
First is Mr. Naoya Misaki, the chief purser.

1164
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,660
Next is the doctor on board, Doctor Hitoshi Mizukubo.

1165
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,460
And our chef, Katushiko Siomi, who is in charge of food and beverage.

1166
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,860
Do you know who the culprit is?

1167
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,660
And our first-mate, Yousuke Izawa.

1168
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,360
But I haven't found any conclusive evidence yet.

1169
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,460
Now then, I've kept you waiting.

1170
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,860
Our captain.

1171
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,260
Mr. Wataru Kaidou.

1172
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
Before I give my speech,

1173
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,360
I'd like to introduce to you the wonderful woman
who designed this ship.

1174
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,860
The designer, Miss Minako Akiyoshi.

1175
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,060
Captain!

1176
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,360
Is it true that Chief Takae was murdered?

1177
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,560
Rumor has it that President Yashiro is also missing!

1178
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,960
Well...

1179
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,660
You're police officers, right?

1180
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,360
Did you catch the culprit?

1181
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,260
Is it really okay to hold such a party as if everything is fine?

1182
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,660
Calm down, everyone, please calm down!

1183
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,560
What happened, exactly?

1184
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,260
No, it's...

1185
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,760
Mr. Mouri!

1186
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,160
Mr. Mouri?

1187
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,060
Everyone, please calm down.

1188
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,660
There is no need to worry.

1189
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,260
That gruesome serial murderer...

1190
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,060
has already been identified by me, Kogoro Mouri!

1191
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,660
We've been waiting for you, great detective!

1192
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,460
The murderer who killed Chief Takae Yashiro and President Entarou...

1193
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:55,860
is...

1194
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,760
Miss Minako Akiyoshi!

1195
01:07:59,160 --> 01:07:59,860
It's you!

1196
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:09,860
This was her revenge for Hideto Yashiro's accident
which occurred half a year ago.

1197
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,860
That accident was actually a murder orchestrated
by Entarou and his daughter.

1198
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,360
But... but why would Miss Akiyoshi want to avenge Mr. Yashiro's death?

1199
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,560
It's probably because Miss Minako and Mr. Hideto were lovers.

1200
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,760
Hold on, Mr. Mouri.

1201
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,560
I did respect Mr. Yashiro as a great senior.

1202
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,660
But I didn't have any affair with...

1203
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,860
And I have an alibi.

1204
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,060
I was on the phone with Mr. Kusaka in my room during the murder.

1205
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:41,960
That's true.

1206
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:48,260
But in fact, you let Mr. Kusaka read his story for about 20 minutes.

1207
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,660
In the meantime, you didn't say anything.

1208
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:51,560
That means...

1209
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,160
you don't have an alibi for that period of time.

1210
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,760
That's enough!

1211
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,260
If Mr. Kusaka had stopped in the middle and asked me something,

1212
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,860
he'd know I was not on the other end of the phone, right?

1213
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,660
I'm not as stupid enough to create an alibi like that!

1214
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,660
Even so, if you insist on saying that I'm the culprit,

1215
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,660
please show me the proof.

1216
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,260
You have that, right, Mr. Mouri? The proof...

1217
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,260
Well...

1218
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,760
Could it be that...

1219
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:24,060
he suspected Miss Minako just because she looks like my Mom?

1220
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,060
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

1221
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,660
No, sorry.

1222
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,060
I need a little bathroom break...

1223
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,560
Break?

1224
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,860
Found it.

1225
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,360
Inspector!

1226
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,560
Should we do something while everyone is still laughing?

1227
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,860
But...

1228
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,660
Don't worry, Inspector Megure.

1229
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,860
I already know who the real culprit is.

1230
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,060
Is it true, Professor Agasa?

1231
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,760
Great!

1232
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,960
This time it's the professor's deduction show!

1233
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:01,260
Do you know the original meaning of the word "cruise"?

1234
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,360
It refers to an act of piracy

1235
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:08,360
That is, to keep searching for a prey on the voyage.
That is the origin of that word.

1236
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,560
There is a pirate on this ship as well.

1237
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,060
This pirate doesn't plunder others' wealth.

1238
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,960
Instead, this pirate is actually a murderer
who plunders others' lives.

1239
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,160
That's right

1240
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,660
This pirate is

1241
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,460
the script writer, Mr. Hironari Kusaka.

1242
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,460
It's you.

1243
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:26,960
You're talking nonsense.

1244
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,760
Didn't you hear what Miss Minako said?

1245
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,360
I was reading her my script draft over the phone
during the time of the murder.

1246
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,860
Is this the story you were reading?

1247
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,360
Nanami Okazaki loves the sea.

1248
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,960
Maybe it's because she was born and raised by the sea.

1249
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,160
She loves its vastness more than anything else.

1250
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,660
What a simple trick.

1251
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,560
You recorded your story in advance, and played it by the phone.

1252
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,460
With that, you went out to commit the crime during that time.

1253
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,160
Impossible! I should have deleted all that!

1254
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,260
Deleted?

1255
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,560
No, you thought it was deleted, but it wasn't.

1256
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:12,360
Such an important thing like this could kill you,
if you don't make sure it was deleted.

1257
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,260
You fabricated the evidence, didn't you?

1258
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,560
That tape.

1259
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,460
You used his voice to record it, right?

1260
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,860
Right.

1261
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,160
But there's another conclusive evidence.

1262
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,560
Inspector, that's not enough to prove that I'm the murderer, isn't it?

1263
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,560
Of course we have the evidence.

1264
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,860
Look, it's right there.

1265
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,660
What's wrong with you?

1266
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,160
There's a blackish part mixed with your red ones.

1267
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,260
Isn't that... blood?

1268
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,160
Blood?

1269
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,360
Please show us, Mr. Kusaka.

1270
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,860
Oh right.

1271
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,160
After you did those bad things,
you checked how you looked in the mirror.

1272
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,660
But the color of your hair is very similar to blood,
so you didn't notice it.

1273
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,960
You should remember this.

1274
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,060
Blood will clot as time goes on,

1275
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,660
and it's color will change.

1276
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,760
Could you please take off the scarf around your neck?

1277
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,260
If my deduction is correct,

1278
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,460
there should be some bruises there.

1279
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,260
They're nail or finger marks left by President Yashiro

1280
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,960
when he desperately fought back against your attack.

1281
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,560
Sorry to offend you.

1282
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,360
Mr. Kusaka.

1283
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,060
May we hear your story in detail in another room?

1284
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,760
Hold on. Stop it.

1285
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,460
I still have this.

1286
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,860
A trump card up my sleeve!

1287
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,460
Nobody move!

1288
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,660
Or I'll detonate the bombs!

1289
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,660
Bombs?

1290
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,860
If you don't want the ship to sink,
then listen carefully to what I'm going say!

1291
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,060
It's him!

1292
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,860
He is the guy who attacked me!

1293
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,260
You finally remembered?

1294
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,260
Anyway, please calm down for now.

1295
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,060
Why are you doing this?

1296
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,460
I'm taking revenge for my father!

1297
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,360
Revenge?

1298
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,660
15 years ago,

1299
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,160
the crew member who died in
the accident of Yashiro Shipbuilding Company cargo ship

1300
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,960
was my father!

1301
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,060
So that's it... That was...

1302
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,460
Two years ago,

1303
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,360
I heard it from one of my father's
former colleagues who came to visit his grave...

1304
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,160
A strange rumor about the accident.

1305
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:32,660
At that time,

1306
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:36,560
the Chief of Yashiro Shipbuilding Company,
Entarou, and Executive Takae

1307
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,460
planned to sink the cargo ship for its insurance

1308
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:47,260
and get rid of Captain Okita,
who had been working for the welfare of the crew.

1309
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,160
They even roped in the first-officer, Kaidou.

1310
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,960
You got talked into it

1311
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,460
and put sleeping pills
in the captain's coffee to make him fall asleep.

1312
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,960
After that, you crashed the ship to an iceberg on purpose.

1313
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,360
At the same time, you detonated the bombs you'd set up beforehand.

1314
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,060
The locations to put the bombs...

1315
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,560
were most likely suggestions from the designer, Hideto Yashiro, right?

1316
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,460
How could Mr. Yashiro...

1317
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,060
How did you kill President Yashiro?

1318
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,660
He got on top of me and choked me with his hands.

1319
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:30,060
So I used a Judo throwing technique to throw him into the sea.

1320
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,060
And then, just like you did before,
I was planning to blow up the ship,

1321
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,660
and kill you in the confusion.

1322
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,660
What a ridiculous delusion.

1323
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:43,960
Hold on. Anyway, please remove your finger from the remote button.

1324
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,660
Shut up! Don't come any closer!

1325
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,560
He's gone!

1326
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,760
I won't let you run away!

1327
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,560
Conan!

1328
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,160
Get him!

1329
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,160
Damn it!

1330
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,960
Wait, Conan!

1331
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,160
Wait for us!

1332
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:31,960
You guys...

1333
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,360
We'll go with you.

1334
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,860
We can't let you be the hero all by yourself.

1335
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,060
Haibara...

1336
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,460
Just like they said.

1337
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,960
Hold tight.

1338
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:35,860
Shift to the left!

1339
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,260
Now to the right!

1340
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,460
We passed him!

1341
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,660
Haibara, take the wheel!

1342
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,760
Conan!

1343
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,960
You made it, Conan?

1344
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,960
Great!

1345
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,860
The Detective Boys did it again!

1346
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,460
Hey, you guys!

1347
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,560
Hey, are you okay?

1348
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,160
How can you guys do this?

1349
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:51,360
He's a murder suspect!

1350
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,760
What if something happened to you?

1351
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,660
Sorry for that.

1352
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,560
Inspector Megure!

1353
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,560
How many bombs did he set up?

1354
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,160
Izawa, how is the situation?

1355
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:26,960
Captain.

1356
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,660
The explosion caused several holes to appear in the ship's hull.

1357
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,760
How about the watertight doors?

1358
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,160
They're closed.

1359
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,260
The water is going from Zone 3 to Zone 4.

1360
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,260
What?

1361
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,960
Captain, please give the order to abandon ship.

1362
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,760
There is black smoke ahead, over.

1363
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:42,560
Captain!

1364
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,660
All personnel abandon ship.

1365
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,860
All passengers!

1366
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,660
This is first-officer, Izawa.

1367
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,860
Please put on your life jackets
and move to the deck on the first floor.

1368
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,560
This is not a drill.

1369
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,660
I repeat.

1370
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,660
This is not a drill.

1371
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,760
All crew members, please guide the passengers.

1372
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,260
It's not here.

1373
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,860
The gold medal those kids were talking about? Where did it go?

1374
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:18,860
Ran!

1375
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,360
We're going. Hurry up.

1376
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,560
Ran, let's go.

1377
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,660
Please don't panic.

1378
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,860
There's still plenty of time.

1379
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,860
Please continue moving without pushing.

1380
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,660
Dad, where's Conan and the others?

1381
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,360
No need to worry about them.

1382
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:48,660
Inspector Megure said they went chasing after Kusaka in a motor boat,

1383
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,560
and they were picked up by a nearby yacht.

1384
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,960
That's good.

1385
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,460
Ran, you two leave in this boat.

1386
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,360
I'll take the other one.

1387
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,160
But...

1388
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,460
Then, see you later.

1389
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,160
Dad!

1390
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,260
Don't rush. Please follow the person in front of you.

1391
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,260
Once you hit the water, get away from the ship as soon as possible.

1392
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,760
If you get sucked down by the ship's whirlpool, no one can save you.

1393
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,860
Got it.

1394
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,960
Honey, it's hot and stuffy here.

1395
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,960
Suck it up. This is an emergency.

1396
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,660
But it's really hot. I just can't put up with it.

1397
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,360
I remember now.

1398
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,760
What?

1399
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,760
I dropped it where I hid for the game.

1400
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,960
That gold medal?

1401
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,960
I'm lowering the raft. Hold on tight.

1402
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,460
I'm getting off.

1403
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:40,960
Ran!

1404
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,760
I'll go get it. Just go ahead.

1405
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,460
But...

1406
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:46,460
It's just a medal made from shells,

1407
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,360
but to me, it's a very precious treasure.

1408
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:50,860
I'll see you later.

1409
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,760
Wait, Ran!

1410
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,960
Found it! This is it!

1411
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,260
We're really lucky.

1412
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,860
There happened to be a ship nearby.

1413
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,260
Are the people left on that ship all right?

1414
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,660
That's worrying.

1415
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:37,860
Relax, she must be in a lifeboat.

1416
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:43,060
Kusaka said he was planning to kill Mr. Kaidou in the confusion,

1417
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,260
but even so, aren't there a bit too many bombs?

1418
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,060
It's like he was really trying to sink this ship.

1419
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:56,360
And come to think of it,
isn't that trick he used for his alibi too simple?

1420
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,560
If Miss Minako had talked to him in the middle,

1421
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,460
that trick would fall apart right there, wouldn't it?

1422
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,760
He probably tested it several times.

1423
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,860
Maybe after he confirmed the fact that she would never interrupt,

1424
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,260
then he thought he could use it to create an alibi.

1425
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,960
It's true that she said it.

1426
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,460
If I interrupted, he'd get angry.

1427
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,260
Inspector Megure.

1428
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,160
I just heard the report from the Coast Guard.

1429
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:26,060
They found a fruit knife stabbed into President Yashiro's back.

1430
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:26,760
What?

1431
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,060
What does that mean?

1432
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,160
Kusaka didn't mention anything about a fruit knife.

1433
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,960
It was at 10:11 a.m

1434
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,260
About 10:15 a.m.

1435
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,660
No, it wasn't Kusaka.

1436
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:43,460
Then who on earth was it?

1437
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,360
She really doesn't look like she's in her 50s!

1438
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,960
Conan!

1439
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,660
Where are you going, Conan?

1440
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:58,760
Conan!

1441
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,560
Why is it?

1442
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,460
Something just doesn't feel right.

1443
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,560
I feel like if I just let this continue,

1444
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,960
I'd lose something that I'll never get back. I just have that feeling.

1445
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,460
Are you referring to the case?

1446
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,260
Maybe.

1447
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,160
Perhaps.

1448
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,860
Conan.

1449
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:25,860
The case?

1450
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,460
Are you sure this is the only reason?

1451
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,260
Kudo.

1452
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,260
If my deduction is correct,

1453
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,460
then the real culprit is...

1454
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,160
Captain.

1455
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,760
The evacuation of the passengers is now complete.

1456
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,860
I'll take the life raft.

1457
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,160
You just go find the other crew members and leave with them first.

1458
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,860
Understood.

1459
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,660
Huh? Won't you sink with this ship?

1460
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,160
Captain?

1461
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,860
What are you doing here?

1462
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,160
Hurry and get out of this ship!

1463
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,160
Do you still remember this?

1464
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,060
My father's favorite thing when he was alive.

1465
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,760
Origami boat?

1466
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,160
Are you...

1467
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,260
Right.

1468
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,360
I am the daughter

1469
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:36,660
of Captain Okita, whom you
and the Yashiro family conspired to murder 15 years ago.

1470
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,460
I'm so sorry.

1471
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,060
I've destroyed the remaining life rafts.

1472
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,860
How come...

1473
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,460
Don't move!

1474
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,660
It's a bit cramped here.

1475
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,460
Let's go somewhere spacious
and have a long chat about this while enjoying the salty breeze.

1476
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,560
It was half a year ago.

1477
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,860
Kusaka came to interview me for his drama series.

1478
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,360
But he was a bit too eager to know about
Yashiro and his daughter, who had nothing to do with the interview.

1479
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,860
He was even sweating.

1480
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,060
So, when he left to go to the bathroom...

1481
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,360
I saw the truth behind the sinking of the Yashiro Number 1.

1482
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:48,960
That was Kusaka's real purpose.

1483
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,460
Although I didn't believe it was true,

1484
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,060
I went to ask Hideto Yashiro the following day.

1485
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,860
After drinking a bit of liquor, he spilled everything.

1486
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,160
The sinking of that ship was not an accident,

1487
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,060
but an orchestrated event.

1488
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,560
He didn't know that I was Captain Okita's daughter.

1489
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:15,260
I'm sorry.

1490
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,260
I was ordered by the Chief.

1491
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,460
Don't make excuses!

1492
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,960
I'll let you go to hell with Yashiro and his daughter.

1493
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:27,060
Just like my father who died in vain.

1494
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,360
Damn it! Let me get there in time!

1495
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,960
Please, let me go...

1496
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,460
Goodbye, captain.

1497
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,660
Stop it!

1498
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,560
So, as suspected, you're the real culprit.

1499
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,160
Miss Minako Akiyoshi.

1500
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,660
Mr. Mouri...

1501
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,160
Don't move!

1502
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,160
Sorry, but that gun doesn't work anymore.

1503
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:10,760
I found it in your room during my bathroom break.

1504
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,560
Captain.

1505
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:23,160
I'll have a long chat with you later.

1506
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,360
Miss Akiyoshi.

1507
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,060
Based on my deduction...

1508
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,060
Let's stop it.

1509
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,360
All three of us are going to die anyway.

1510
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,660
Talking about your deduction on a sinking ship...

1511
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,760
is pointless.

1512
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,660
How can I stop?

1513
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:45,460
Revealing the truth is what a detective lives for.

1514
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,460
I'm afraid you already knew about Kusaka's plan

1515
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,760
to kill the four of them, including Hideto.

1516
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,760
But there was a part of his plan which was impossible to achieve.

1517
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,960
So you killed Hideto before Kusaka could do it,

1518
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,560
and made it look like he died of a heart attack.

1519
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,060
You used a self-made stun grenade.

1520
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,160
After Hideto died,

1521
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,160
Kusaka changed the four murders to just three,

1522
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,060
and decided to use you to create an alibi.

1523
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:24,260
Knowing that, you decided to
use his plan to take revenge with your own hands.

1524
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:28,260
First, you set up bombs separately from Kusaka's bombs.

1525
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,660
This is a ship you designed.

1526
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,760
You know best which parts would
make this ship sink if they were blown up.

1527
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,960
Then, at 10:00 a.m. this morning,

1528
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,260
you answered a phone call from Kusaka.

1529
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:42,560
Just as he started reading the story, you dashed out of your room.

1530
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,660
You knocked out Chief Takae who was taking a bath,

1531
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,960
put on the bathrobe and pretended to be Chief Takae.

1532
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,460
After that, Kusaka sneaked in.

1533
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,460
He thought you, wearing a bathrobe, were Chief Takae.

1534
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,060
You pretended to try to grab his knife,

1535
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,760
and deliberately stabbed it into your stomach
where you'd put a fake blood bag.

1536
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,860
After Kusaka left, thinking he had done what he came for,

1537
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:11,260
you killed Chief Takae.

1538
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,160
Then you wiped away the fake blood that dripped onto the floor,

1539
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,460
put on the windbreaker and walked out of the room.

1540
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:39,760
At that time, I thought it was because
you didn't want your face to be seen that you turned your back to me.

1541
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,260
But then I realized,

1542
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,860
that person might be a woman.

1543
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:48,360
She did it because she was consciously trying to protect her chest.

1544
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,160
I see.

1545
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,660
That's why at that time...

1546
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,360
Afterwards, you went straight to the basement marina.

1547
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,060
When you got there, it was when the president

1548
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,060
was sitting on top of Kusaka and choking him.

1549
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,360
You quickly ran to the two of them,

1550
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,260
grabbed both feet of the president.

1551
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:13,660
Both feet?

1552
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,060
That's right.

1553
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,360
You went behind him without touching his feet,

1554
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,360
and stabbed him in the back.

1555
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,360
Right, right...

1556
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,460
Stabbed him in the back.

1557
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,560
Then, you left the scene as soon as possibly,

1558
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,360
letting Kusaka believe he did it.

1559
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,860
Everything has happened just as you planned.

1560
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,560
As expected of the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri.

1561
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:48,260
The reason why I used that man

1562
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,860
is because I knew you'd be on this ship too.

1563
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:53,660
In order to fool the eyes of the famous detective,

1564
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,060
it was necessary to design a fake culprit.

1565
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,060
Moreover, this culprit must believe that he was the culprit.

1566
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,660
One more thing.

1567
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,860
In the article on his laptop,

1568
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:09,160
he called my father, who went down with the ship,
the representation of an anachronism.

1569
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,660
I will never forgive anyone who insults my father.

1570
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,560
You are the one who can't be forgiven.

1571
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,660
Not only did you take the lives of those three,

1572
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,960
you put a lot of innocent people in danger as well.

1573
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:26,660
In the end, you even sank the ship you designed yourself.

1574
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:29,360
I've done many detailed simulations.

1575
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:30,760
The number of bombs,

1576
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,460
the amount of seawater entering the ship,

1577
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,860
the time it takes for the evacuation...

1578
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,160
then I would get what I wanted,

1579
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,560
the scene where that sneaky man standing over there

1580
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,760
die in this boundless ocean,

1581
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,560
just like my father,

1582
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,760
swallowed by loneliness and despair.

1583
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:47,460
Besides,

1584
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,960
Aphrodite is a goddess born from foam,

1585
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,460
it is her destiny to return to nothing.

1586
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:58,560
But since you've already figured out this much,
I guess I have no choice

1587
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:01,160
but simply turn myself in.

1588
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:10,960
I have my principles. I don't fight with women.

1589
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,260
Isn't that sexist?

1590
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,060
Mr. Mouri...

1591
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:32,460
How's that? Are you still sticking to your principles?

1592
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,260
It's not my principle to fight meaninglessly either.

1593
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,160
Didn't you say that all three of us would die here anyway?

1594
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,460
That's because you're getting in the way of my revenge!

1595
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:07,860
That boy...

1596
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,160
Shinichi?

1597
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,160
No, no, no...

1598
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,260
Should we finish this?

1599
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,760
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

1600
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,960
I hate to see a famous detective in such a mess, but...

1601
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,560
Mind your own business.

1602
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,560
Mr. Mouri...

1603
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,560
How unlucky

1604
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,560
that I had the famous detective suspect me from the very start.

1605
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,760
I guess I'm a lot like some woman you hate?

1606
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:54,960
Just the opposite.

1607
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:57,560
Because you look like her,

1608
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,660
I thought, as long as the culprit wasn't you, it would be fine.

1609
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:03,660
So I was trying to collect evidence to prove your innocence.

1610
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,560
But it turned out like this.....

1611
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:08,860
Mr. Mouri...

1612
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,360
Are you okay, Mr. Mouri?

1613
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,960
That was a good deduction, Mr. Mouri.

1614
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,460
What are you doing here?

1615
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,060
Forget about that for now. We gotta go!

1616
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:21,460
Go?

1617
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:22,760
We can't.

1618
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,160
The lifeboats have all left.

1619
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,960
The life rafts have all been destroyed by this woman.

1620
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,260
Captain!

1621
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,160
Captain!

1622
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:35,660
Captain!

1623
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,660
We're saved...

1624
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,260
Why is it? This feeling...

1625
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,660
The case has already been solved.

1626
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:51,060
Why do I feel restless and unsettled?

1627
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,460
The ship is going to sink soon.

1628
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,160
Please hurry up.

1629
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:03,560
It's your turn. Hurry!

1630
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,460
What are you doing? Get on!

1631
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:14,860
Where's Miss Ran?

1632
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,160
Ran has already gotten on a lifeboat, hasn't she?

1633
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,760
Mr. Mouri, aren't you with Ran?

1634
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:22,860
What happened?

1635
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:26,160
She said she was going back to her hiding spot to get her gold medal.

1636
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,860
So, I thought she was with you.

1637
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:29,760
That's it!

1638
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,260
Wait a minute!

1639
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,660
Where is Ran, exactly?

1640
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,060
Anyone?

1641
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:01,560
Anyone outside?

1642
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,460
Ran, you're really here!

1643
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,660
Shinichi, you'll definitely find me, right?

1644
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:19,860
Shinichi...

1645
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,760
Where is Ran?

1646
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:27,560
Miss Ran said she knew I was kicking
the soccer ball here the entire time.

1647
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,660
That means...

1648
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,260
She's up there!

1649
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,860
I will find you.

1650
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,660
I will definitely find you.

1651
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,260
Wait for me, Ran!

1652
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,960
Where is Ran?

1653
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:50,460
Calm down. Calm down and think.

1654
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,460
I found her easily at that time, didn't I?

1655
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:57,860
Come to think of it...

1656
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:00,960
How did you know where I was hiding?

1657
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,660
You were kicking your soccer ball the entire time, weren't you?

1658
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,060
Conan, you were kicking the soccer ball the entire time, right?

1659
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:08,860
I knew it all along.

1660
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,460
So that's it. Both that day and today...

1661
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,660
Mr. Mouri.

1662
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,060
Are there any places

1663
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,560
where you can hide around the floor?

1664
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,860
I found one!

1665
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,660
Damn it, it won't open.

1666
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:36,760
Mr. Mouri!

1667
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,460
It worked.

1668
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:50,860
Ran!

1669
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,160
Are you there, Ran?

1670
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:58,860
Dad...

1671
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:00,660
She's down there.

1672
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,360
We must hurry up, Mr. Mouri, or we can't make it.

1673
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,660
Damn it!

1674
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:08,960
Not good. Not good...

1675
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,060
If we don't turn around the lifeboat soon,
Ran and the others will die!

1676
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,260
Sorry, but I can't do that.

1677
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:15,660
If we get closer now,

1678
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,460
I'm afraid we'll get caught in the sinking ship's whirlpool.

1679
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:19,360
How can that be?

1680
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,660
The Coast Guard's rescue chopper!

1681
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:27,760
Great!

1682
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:35,660
It's a rescue chopper!

1683
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,860
Damn it...

1684
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:39,960
Let's go to the bow.

1685
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:50,260
Over here!

1686
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,560
Are you the only ones on the ship?

1687
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,160
Yes.

1688
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,760
Boy, just hold on a little longer.

1689
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,460
W e're going to save you right now.

1690
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,460
Listen, hold on to me.

1691
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,660
Now they're going to pull us up.

1692
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,160
Please hold on to your daughter firmly.

1693
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:30,260
Okay.

1694
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,260
Are you okay?

1695
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,160
Grab my hand!

1696
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,660
Damn it!

1697
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:28,160
Hold on tight, Conan...

1698
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,660
Are you all right?

1699
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,660
Boy.

1700
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:44,860
Give me your hand.

1701
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,160
We'll arrive soon.

1702
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,460
Thank you.

1703
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,460
The boat which your parents are in is closeby.

1704
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:12,160
So...

1705
01:46:12,460 --> 01:46:14,460
The reason you thought she was the culprit

1706
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:17,660
is because Kusaka's alibi was too simple?

1707
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,060
The reason such a simple alibi worked

1708
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:23,760
is because the one on the other end, Miss Minako.

1709
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:27,260
She wanted to use this alibi as well.

1710
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,460
Besides, the only one who could disguise herself
as Chief Takae, who had such a pair of beautiful legs,

1711
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,960
is Miss Minako with the same beautiful legs, right?

1712
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:36,760
I see.

1713
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:40,160
But how did you know where Ran was?

1714
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,460
That's because...

1715
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,460
I was more worried about you...

1716
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:47,260
I was actually kicking a volleyball,

1717
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,660
but Miss Ran said I was kicking a soccer ball.

1718
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,660
So I guessed she was hiding somewhere
where she could only hear the sound.

1719
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,860
But it's really disappointing.

1720
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,160
I'm glad that Ran was saved,

1721
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:03,760
but I thought the only one who could find and save Ran was Kudo...

1722
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,260
No, the reason she was saved is because...

1723
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,160
Miss Ran!

1724
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,760
We fixed the gold medal!

1725
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:15,660
This time we used a longer string so that you can put it on your neck.

1726
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:17,660
I'll put it on for you.

1727
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:26,760
Thank you.

1728
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,060
It looks good on you.

1729
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,660
I'll cherish it.

1730
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,760
T he reason she was saved is because

1731
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:40,260
there were those guys'

1732
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:43,160
who were empathetic.
