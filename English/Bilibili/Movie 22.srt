1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Awesome!

2
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,600
It flew by so fast!

3
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,950
It flies pretty high.

4
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,370
Let me see it too.

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,620
Me too.

6
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,700
W-Wait!

7
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,320
It can fly at 10,000 meters for 30 minutes.

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,950
That would be a world record for a drone.

9
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,200
But how do you control it at such a high altitude?

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,500
It's using satellite transmission.

11
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,500
That's why we can control it even if we're away from it.

12
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,550
It uses the images sent from the drone and

13
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,620
the latitude and longitude data to fly.

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,970
Direction, speed and camera.

15
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,410
It has to control all three things at the same time.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,950
It is difficult.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,770
But why did you make such a drone?

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,300
Why?

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,820
Of course because that's a man's dream!

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,270
If I have this, even if don't climb Mount Everest,

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,420
I can feel as if I have climbed it!

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,450
That's such a creepy laugh.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,770
Or rather, this invention could break all kinds of laws.

The Edge of Ocean, which will be opening next month,

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
is a befitting seaside city

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,450
designed with an abundance of water.

33
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,700
and consists of a wide variety of facilities.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,270
The Casino Tower that was built in the motif of seashells

35
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,750
serves as a lighthouse to ensure safety of the sea.

36
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,450
It overlooks the Edge of Ocean!

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,500
There is also a shopping mall near the Casino Tower,

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,820
which has a large waterfall and a sky garden.

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,320

And another concept is the Japanese “Wa”.

42

The interior of the International Convention Center incorporates

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,120
the beauty of the Japanese-style garden.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,270
There also are stylish restaurants on the ground floor.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
And look here!

A two-tiered monorail circling the perimeter of the site.

47

The summit will be held on May 1st.

52

The Metropolitan Police Department is in charge of the security.

53

Next, we bring you news of the unmanned probe, Hakucho.

(Detective Conan
Zero The Enforcer)

57
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,070
I am Shinichi Kudo, high school detective.

58
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,000
When I had gone to an amusement park with
my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

59
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,120
I witnessed a man in black making a dubious dealing.

60
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,070
While I was concentrating on watching the dealing,

61
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,670
I didn't notice his partner coming up behind me.

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,800
That man made me drink a poison

63
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,600
and when I woke up,

64
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,800
my body had shrunk.

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,720
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,250
they'll come after my life again

67
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,270
and can harm everyone around me.

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,050
I decided to hide my true identity with the advice of Professor Agasa.

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,220
When Ran asked me my name,

70
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,220
I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa on a whim.

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,420
To gather information about them,

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,170
I crashed at Ran's house, whose father is a detective.

73
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,270
These are Genta, Mitsuhiko and Ayumi.

74
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,500
They are my classmates after I became small.

75
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,770
And this is Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

76
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,820
She was originally a member of the Black Organization.

77
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,100
In an attempt to take her own life,

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,750
she took the same pills that I did,

79
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,400
and her body shrank.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,320

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,400
Tohru Amuro, aka Bourbon,
a member of the mysterious Black Organization.

82
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,020
His true identity is an undercover police officer belonging to "Zero,"
of the National Police Agency Security Bureau

83
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,000
that directs the Public Security Bureau (PSB) Police.

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,850
To camouflage his identity,

85
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,920
he is working at the coffee shop Poirot

86
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,870
while apprenticing under Detective Mouri.

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,270
He is a mysterious man.

88
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,150
Even though I've become smaller, my mind remains the same.

89
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,800

and only the Earth Return Capsule,
which is about 4 meters in diameter,

97

will re-enter into the atmosphere.

98

I see.

101
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,100

(Return Capsule Precision GPS)
a precision guidance system equipped with GPS,

103
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,520
and the landing area will be within a radius of 200 meters.

- That's dangerous!

- Don't!
- I want do it too!

where the Tokyo Summit will be held next week,

112

had not opened yet,

- there were no visitors.
- Professor!

- It could be terrorists.

- there was a massive explosion.
- Oh, the summit is next week, isn't it?

123

- It could be an accident.

124

a number of police officers were killed or injured.
Whether it was an accident

125
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,800
or an incident is not yet clear

I see.

132
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,620
If I think about it, a terrorist attack before the summit

133
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,770
would only lead to a tighter security during the actual event.

134

works at Poirot.

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,500
I think his name was Tohru Amuro.

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,020
Amuro-san?

(Metropolitan Police Department)

144
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,270
The result of the forensic work shows that

145
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,970
there were no explosives at the site.

146
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,850
There is a Japanese restaurant on the ground floor
of the International Convention Center.

147
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,650
There is a kitchen in the basement that
became the site of the explosion.

148
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,920
A large amount of gas was detected from there.

149
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,470
Therefore, I think we can conclude that it was a gas explosion.

150
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,050
Wait. That building has just been completed.

151
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,120
Gas leak is unlikely.

152
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,720
Yes. Actually, this gas line is the latest model.

153
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,700
It is possible to open and close the gas valve using the internet.

154
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,600
Then why would a gas leak occur?

155
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,470
It is possible that there was a flaw in that system all along.

156
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,850
Did they not do an inspection?

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,320
It was scheduled for today.

158
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,070
What do you mean?

159
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,370
At the Edge of Ocean,

160
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,150
they installed the internet connections today.

161
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,320
So, this morning, after a security check
by the PSB of the Metropolitan Police Department,

162
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,870
it was going to be inspected.

163
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,450
If that is the case,

164
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,650
there is a high possibility of this being an accident.

165
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,750
Hmm... If it is an attack on the summit,

166
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,170
(Beginning of the Summit)
it is meaningless unless the important people

167
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,020
from each country gather at the venue on May 1st next week.

168

Regarding the summit venue,

169
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,620
they're going to change the venue because of this incident.

I am Yuya Kazami from the PSB of the Metropolitan Police Department.

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
What about the ignition material that led to the gas explosion?

174
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,500
Not yet.

175
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,220
We are looking into the electrical equipment
in the criminal investigation.

176
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,370
The ignition material

177
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,720
could be a high-voltage cable.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,870
Really?

179
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,550
Did you find any construction error?

180
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,570
No.

181
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,700
However, we found fingerprints burned in
on the compartment door of the high-voltage cable.

182
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,620
You mean the fingerprints are from before the explosion?

183
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,520
Yes. The only people who entered the site
were the construction workers

184
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,950
and we, the PSB, who inspected the security this morning.

185
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,070
Therefore,

186
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,950
the fingerprints of the construction workers
and the police officers were checked against the database,

187
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,120
from which

188
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,020
they were found to match with those
of a former member of the Metropolitan Police Department's

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,150
That's ridiculous!

193
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,020
This is a lie, right?

194
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,700
Couldn't be!

196
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,250
I've never been to that place!

197
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,520
But we have Mouri-san's fingerprint from the site.

198
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,020
That's impossible!

199
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,750
Dad,

200
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,220
are you sure you didn't get drunk
and enter there without permission or something again?

201
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,270
I told you! I've never been to that place!

202
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,870
You're misunderstanding something!

203
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Even if you search, you won't find anything!

204
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,920
Now, now.

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,320
Excuse me.

206
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,120
Yes.

207
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,300
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

208
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,500
That detective.

209
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,820
He has a face injury. Is he okay?

210
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,620
Oh, Kazami-san?

211
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,270
When there was an explosion,

212
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,950
he seemed to be there.

213
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,970
I have to go to the bathroom.

214
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:55,870
What's up?

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
What? Your dad's being suspected by the police?

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,500
Yeah. Well, I think there's something wrong.

217
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,400
All right. I'll also look into it.

218
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,270
This alternative phone is hard to use.

219
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,250
Huh? Where's my phone?

220
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,770
Oh, Professor?

221
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,850
Shinichi? What's wrong?

222
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,870
I need you to do something for me.

223
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,620
How long are these guys going to do this?!

224
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,270
Get the hell out of here!

225
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,800
Yes...

226
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,700
My smartphone...

227
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,170
This is interesting!

228
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,120
Genta-kun, please slow down the speed a bit more.

229
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,750
Because we're filming with it.

230
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,200
Sorry, sorry.

231
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,300
But it's unbelievable how far it can fly.

232
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,820
You can control it from even 30 km away.

233
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,570
We've just flown it 20 km away from here.

234

I delivered a box to my aunt in Saitama.

235
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,600
Your aunt was super happy, wasn't she?

236
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,270
- Yes, she was.
- When did you do that?

237
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,220
But this screen is too small.

238
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,120
It's a little hard to see.

239
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,600
I wasn't originally planning for three people using it at once.

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,850
Professor, can you put a screen on my controller?

241
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,900
Put one on Ayumi's, too.

242
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,050
Right. Then, let's do quizzes!

243
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,470
Are you ready?

244
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,370
If you answer the quiz correctly,

245
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,050
I'll make each one with a monitor.

246
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,570
Here's the question...

247
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,070
(Professor Agasa's Quiz)

248
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,150
In the Japanese hiragana column,

249
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,720
which of the following is the largest in scale?

250
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,350
No. 1 “a” column, No. 2 “Ka” column,
No. 3 “Sa” column,No. 4 “Ta” column

251
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,800
What's this Scale?

252
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,150
I mean, which is of the largest size?

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,300
Even if you say the largest size...

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,250
“A” column has A, I, U, E, O.

255
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,670
In other words, think about “Ka” column as Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, Ko.

256
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Sa, Shi, Su, Se, So. Ta, Chi, Tsu, Te, To. Eh? I don't know!

257
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,770
Hey! Hold on, Ayumi-chan! Please don't move the camera!

258
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,400
Sorry.

259
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,650
Okay, I'll give you the first hint.

260
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,720
Swan.

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,650
Swan?

262
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,620
Hey, Ai-kun...

263
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,970
If I say Swan...

264
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,670
Swan Lake. It's a big lake. It's the “Mi” column!

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,150
Ah... That's not it...

266
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,470
Hint number two.

267
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,600
Hakucho (swan) will be back.

268
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,050
Is Hakucho-san coming home?

269
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,050
Then it's definitely the lake!

270
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,070
Home... Home...

271
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,970
I got it!

272
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,450
Hakucho, the unmanned probe, is coming back from space.

273
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,070
So, the correct answer is...

274
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,900
It's “A” column.

275
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,720
(A, I, U, E, O)
The middle letter of AIUEO is “U”.

276
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,320
In other words, it's “Uchu (universe).”

277
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,820
Because the universe is bigger than anything else.

278
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,370
Yes, correct. Good answer.

279
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,800
Hooray!

280
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,350
Geez Ai-kun, aren't you giving too many hints every time?

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,950
You know what, Professor?

282
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,620
I can't believe it. You do a quiz while controlling a drone.

283
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,870
It's not safe.

284
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,770
Besides, the filming that they are doing now

285
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,950
is not a play, unlike the Professor's quiz.

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Yes. Sorry.

287
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,950
We, the Criminal Investigation, the PSB,
and the Security Departments were going to inspect the site

288
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,050
before the summit,

289
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,650
and the PSB was in charge when the explosion happened.

290
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,520
That is why Detective Kazami was injured.

291
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,520
He was outside the building, so he only had minor injuries.

292
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,100
But the people who were inside the building...

293
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,920
I've heard on the news that some people died.

294
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,320
Yeah. I know I shouldn't be saying it this way, but...

295
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,370
the fact that only the police officers

296
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,500
were affected and not the civilians might have been a small mercy.

297
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,550
If the explosion had occurred during the summit,

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,370
the world would have panicked, right?

299
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,650
Yeah, but the Metropolitan Police Department,
especially the PSB, is already been blamed.

300
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,550
Though it can't be helped since the explosion accident
happened before the summit.

301
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,320
Accident?

302
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,270
No, because of the situation at the site,

303
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,800
it was supposed to be treated as an accident at first.

304
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,470
Uncle Kogoro's fingerprints were found at the site, right?

305
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,620
Yes. Kazami-san found them

306
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,770
and suddenly a possibility of crime came into picture.

307
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,800
Did Detective Kazami...

(Mouri Ran  Calling)

309
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,270
Thank you, Takagi-san. Bye.

310
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,720
Be careful on your way home.

311
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,770
Ran, what's wrong?

312
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,600

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,020
My dad is going to get arrested!

314
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,800
Damn!

315
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,870
I told you! I don't know!

316
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,900
We've found these on your confiscated computer.

317
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,820
The summit schedule and

318
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,570
the floor plans of the bombed International Convention Center.

319
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,050
That's a lie!

320
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,750
My dad would never save such things on his computer!

321
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,070
That's right! He's a super computer illiterate!

322
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,700
That's right! I can't do that!

323
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,850
Anyway, I'll ask you the details at the police station.

324
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,400
That's bullshit! As if I'd help the PSB voluntarily!

325
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,670
Then I will arrest you for obstruction of justice.

326
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,920
I just shook off your hand!

327
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,370
Hey!

328
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,070
What is this? This can't be real!

329
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,300

330
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,350
Hey, let go of me!!

331
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,320
- Acting violently will only increase the number of charges on you.
- Hey, What are you doing? Hey!

332
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,370
Get this shit off me!

333
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,320
Wait!

334
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,750
If Uncle Kogoro is the culprit,

335
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,670
what's his motive for blowing up the summit site?

336
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,850
Yes! Why'd I do that?!

337
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,350
I will ask about that during the questioning.

338
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,780
Hey, wait. Hey!

339
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,820
Dad!

340
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,830
Calm down, Ran. Let's call Kudo-kun right now.

341
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,030
I did!

342
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,460
I did call him...

343
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,950
Oh, no.

344
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,900
Why isn't he coming here at a time like this?

345
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,530
Wait!

346
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,270
He is a PSB Detective, right?

347
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,650
Who knows. I have no idea.

348
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,000
Both you and Detective Kazami are injured.

349
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,300
In other words, you were there too, right?

350
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,750
At the explosion site.

351
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

352
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,100
You went there to check in advance, didn't you?

353
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,450
I'm sure you saw the potential for terrorism then.

354
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:27,120
But as it is now, the explosion will be dealt with as an accident.

355
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,450
So, you made up a suspect. Am I wrong?

356
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,720
A person like you or the police officer like him could even tamper

357
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,650
with his computer and leave his fingerprints at the site, right?

358
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,320
You know,

359
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,250
the police don't care about stories without evidence.

360
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,420
Why are you doing this?

361
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,700
Because,

362
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,100
there are some things I must absolutely protect.

363
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,870
This time, Amuro-san might be my enemy.

364
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,870
Why not? Why aren't you defending dad?

365
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,220
Don't tell me! Do you really think that Uncle blew it up?

366
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,670
He can never do that.

367
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
Then why?

368
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,670
Lawyers don't defend their blood relatives.

369
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,000
Because there is a high possibility that the judge
might decide that it's not objective.

370
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,620
In other words, if I take his case

371
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,600
it might work against him.

372
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,050
Oh, no...

373
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,320
Don't worry. I'll find a good lawyer soon.

374
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,720
It's a pity. It's just as Furuya-san said,

375
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,250
if we could have known earlier,

376
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,100
our PSB colleagues would not have died.

377
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,450
Yeah, I didn't expect they'd blow it up before the summit...

378
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,960
Currently, we are looking into the list of domestic extremists

379
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,560
and international terrorists in the PSB.

380
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,750
what about you, Furuya-san?

381
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,620
We are looking into the transmission
that accessed the gas valve at the site.

382
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,220
Looks like they used a slightly different system.

383
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,420
What is it?

384
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,320
As soon as the investigation progresses,

385
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,670
I will inform you from within the PSB
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

386
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,250
Understood.

387
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,600
What's going on with that one?

388
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,500
Yes. I am going to plant 2291.

389
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,950
Furuya-san?

390
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,270
Understood.

391
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,030
This is... I knew it.

392
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,890
But...

393
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,720
Does this mean,

394
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,750
that there is evidence about access from

395
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,050
Kogoro Mouri's computer to the gas valve at the site?

396
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,620
Yes, sir.

397
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,970
The Cyber Crime Division reported about this.

398
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,420
Then it is settled.

399
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,670
Kogoro Mouri snuck in here, opened this door,

400
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,870
and tampered with the high-voltage cable.

401
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,200
Wait a minute! If so,

402
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,020
Mouri-kun should have been seen on the security camera.

403
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,000
No.

404
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,450
The internet has only been available at the site since yesterday.

405
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,320
Oh, no.

406
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,800
What is he saying in the interrogation?

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,420
Kogoro Mouri continues to deny.

408
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,220
Even if he is denying, we can still send him to the prosecutors.

409
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,000
Are you going to send him without knowing his motive?!

410
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,320
When we have the evidence, we can send him to the prosecutors.

411
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,470
As a police officer, that is obvious.

412
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,550
Wait a minute!

413
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,250
Something seems strange! Something seems wrong!

414
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,450
Do you think this many investigators are working on this

415
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,270
just because something seems strange, something seems wrong?

416
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,050
Is that so... Yes...

417
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,100
Oh, no! Why isn't anyone defending him?

418
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,670
Is it because it's a big incident?

419
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,870
That's right.

420
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,620
Also,

421
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,270
all the lawyers are hesitant because the suspect
they are defending is the famous Sleeping Kogoro.

422
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,370
That's why, all the lawyers are hesitant.

423
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,920
Come in.

424
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,950
Excuse me.

425
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,670
Inspector Shiratori.

426
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,920
I thought I'd better tell you before it becomes news.

427
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,150
What is it?

428
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,500
Mouri-san will be sent to the prosecutors.

429
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,600
Is there enough evidence to send him?

430
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,700
Mouri-san's fingerprints from the site.

431
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,770
The floor plans and the summit schedule that were in his computer.

432
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,070
Moreover, access logs to the flammables.

433
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,250
Those are enough to send him.

434
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,320
Why? Dad...

435
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,870
Mom...

436
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
Wait for me, Ran!

437
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,220
I'll definitely save Mister!

438
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,450
Professor, you said you found it.

439
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,150
Oh, You're here.

440
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,520
Look.

441
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,420
It certainly looks like a bomb.

442
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,050
You asked me to film the scattered debris, right?

443
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,620
She reconstructed the images

444
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,800
by piecing it together like a puzzle.

445
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,800
Right now, to identify the type of bomb,

446
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,770
Ai-kun is cross-checking every image

447
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,500
on the internet.

448
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,600
All right. I got it. The things it matches...

449
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,150
What?

450
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,490
I'll give you the details.

451
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,920
IoT pressure pot?

452
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,520
An excellent pressure cooker in the form of a pot.

453
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,700
(You can keep warm and simmer in this pot.)
Just set the pressure, temperature, and time from your phone.

454
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,620
(Quick Easy Operation Beautiful Design)
You can cook soups and other dishes...

455
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,600
Cooking?

456
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,800
In addition to the pressure pot,

457
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,770
there were frying pans and pots, and cutlery all over the place.

458
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,400
Looks like the explosion occurred
in the kitchen of a restaurant inside the facility.

459
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,600
What the hell?

460
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,120
Wasn't it a bomb?!

461
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,800
Hey! You asked us to look for explosives.

462
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,950
Ai-kun is doing her best, too.

463
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,650
This isn't not like you.

464
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,050
Sorry...

465
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,870
What's up? Did something happen?

466
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,270
Uncle Kogoro, he was sent to the prosecutors.

467
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,350
(kisaki ATTORNEY AT LAW)
(Kisaki ATTORNEY AT LAW)

468
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,050
Who's that?

469
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,020
What? What did you say?

470
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,300
(Kyoko Tachibana (29) Attorney)
I'm Kyoko Tachibana. Please let me defend Sleeping Kogoro.

471
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
These are the cases I have handled till now.

472
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,420
Nijoin University Extremist Incident and

473
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,670
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry spy case

474
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,400
So many PSB cases.

475
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,900
Then, she's perfect for this case.

476
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,070
Then, what was the outcome of your trials?

477
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,300
You sure know some difficult words.

478
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,700
I lost every one of them.

479
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,100
Oh, but the PSB cases are difficult, aren't they?

480
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,570
Yes.

481
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,250
As you know, the winning rate of cases indicted
by the prosecution is more than 90 %.

482
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,320
It goes up more if it is a PSB case.

483
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,770
I mean, there's no way we can win.

484
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,170
But I'm a freelance lawyer.

485
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,520
Freelance lawyer?

486
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,950
They don't have an office

487
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,320
and take jobs on their mobile phone.

488
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,400
That's why, I have to take it, even if it's a disadvantageous trial.

489
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,050
Is that why you want my dad's case...?

490
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
You're looking for a lawyer, aren't you?

491
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,220
I heard about it at the bar association. Let me try.

492
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,170
Oh well.

493
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,870
Ah, w-wait a minute.

494
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,470
No, Mom.

495
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,250
That lawyer doesn't want to win at all.

496
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,620
That certainly seems so.

497
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,020
But since she looks like a weak lawyer,

498
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,300
the prosecutors might underestimate her.

499
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,270
We can't win like that.

500
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,770
I think we should get a public defender.

501
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,850
In that case, I cannot interfere with dad's case.

502
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,020
But if it's her, I can do that.

503
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Even so, I'm still worried.

504
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,800
What's their name?

505
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,170
Goro-chan.

506
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,250
At the police station,

507
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,970
(Makoto Kusakabe, 40, Prosecutor)
you continued denying it.

508
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,070
Of course! I did nothing!

509
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,220
But there is a lot of evidence that you are the culprit.

510
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,020
I don't understand that, Mr. Prosecutor.

511
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,750
I think someone is trying to frame me!

512
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,100
For this bombing incident,

513
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,520
Regional Prosecutor Kusakabe of the PSB will be in charge.

514
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,250
Oh, my. This will be difficult.

515
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,370
Even though I rarely defend PSB cases, I still know his name.

516
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,850
Is he such a great prosecutor?

517
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,050
Same as Mr. Kisaki,

518
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,150
he is a brilliant prosecutor who never loses.

519
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,800
He's just the opposite of me.

520
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,670
I know about this case.

521
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,850
It's the “Nazu unauthorized access case”.

522
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,050
Nazu is an American space development organization?

523
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,350
That famous one?

524
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,420
Oh. Last year an employee of a game company accessed it for fun.

525
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,500
The prosecutor at that time was also Kusakabe-san.

526
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,170
And that trial also...

527
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,670
Of course, I lost it.

528
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,870
"Of course," she says...

529
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,700
As a result of his interrogation today,

530
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,600
it seems strange that Kogoro Mouri
has absolutely no motive for the terrorist bombing.

531
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,100
(Sayoko Iwai, 40, General Prosecutor)

532
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,670
Motive, huh...

533
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,020
But there is so much evidence.

534
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,570
Why don't we prosecute him tomorrow?

535
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,320
But...

536
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,050
For example, this record of him

537
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,150
allegedly accessing the gas valve at the explosion site.

538
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,770
(Kogoro Mouri)
It is possible that the suspect's computer was used

539
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,350
(Mouri Kogoro, International Convention Center Gas Valve, Unknown)
as a way station by a third party.

540
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,870
On top of that,

541
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,820
by leaving evidence such as floor plans and schedules on his computer,

542
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,420
it is entirely possible that he is been framed for the case.

543
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,570
Chief Kusakabe.

544
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,920
That is your own presumption, ignoring all this evidence.

545
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,550
General Iwai, we should let the police do an additional investigation.

546
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,020
Kogoro Mouri should be prosecuted.

547
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,150
This is the judgment from the PSB.

548
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,620
Do you understand?

549
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,300
Is that PSB our prosecutor's?

550
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,700
Or is it the National Police Agency’s?

551
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,000
That is all. Please leave.

552
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,800
Additional investigation was requested?

553
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,120
Yes, from Prosecutor Kusakabe.

554
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,820
Then, will the investigation lead to

555
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,370
dad not being prosecuted?

556
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,650
No, I don't think so. The additional investigation
seems to be at the discretion of Prosecutor Kusakabe,

557
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,270
and the PSB Police have decided to prosecute him.

558
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,650
Wait, why are the police involved in the prosecution?

559
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,350
The police are supposed to be

560
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,300
supervised by the prosecution.

561
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,970
Above all, prosecution is the exclusive province of the prosecutor.

562
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,700
Yes. It is exactly as you say.

563
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,220
But that is only in the case of a prosecutor's civil division,
a criminal investigation,

564
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,820
and the special investigation department.

565
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,250
As for the PSB,

566
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,270
I'm sure you know that the situation is a little different.

567
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,920
Oh, yes. That is only if we simply
say the Public Security Bureau, PSB.

568
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,720
The Metropolitan Police Department,
the National Police Agency, and Public Prosecutors Office

569
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,450
all have their own PSBs.

570
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,150
The results of their investigation
are sent by the police to the prosecutor's office.

571
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,170
The prosecutors receive them

572
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,250
and investigate the case once again.

573
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,720
Whether a suspect is to be prosecuted or not

574
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,050
is based on this investigation,

575
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,120
but it's quite common for the prosecutor to give the final decision.

576
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,400
Only the Public Prosecutor's Office of PSB is different.

577
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,620
To put it bluntly,

578
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,550
the National Police Agency's PSB
is much stronger than Public Prosecutor's.

579
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,450
There is a huge difference in the number of investigators
and their know-how.

580
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,050
That's why, there are times
when the PSB considerations work in prosecutions.

581
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,600
PSB considerations...

582
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,570
Especially, the explosion of the summit venue

583
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,320
is the same as spalshing mud on the face of the PSB Police.

584
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,920
It's easy to imagine the pressure to prosecute.

585
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,050
Then, Dad...

586
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,100
Yeah, I'm sure they'll prosecute him.

587
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,950
Oh, no...

588
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,670
This lawyer seems like she wants to prosecute him.

589
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,370
You're looking into the possibility that Uncle Kogoro's computer

590
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,920
was manipulated by someone, right?

591
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,820
Well, indeed.

592
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,450
We have been asked by Prosecutor Kusakabe
to conduct an additional investigation.

593
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,300
Please just tell me what you can.

594
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,100
Big brother Shinichi said that he just wanted any information

595
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,570
that he could get to help Uncle Kogoro.

596
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,700
What's wrong with Mr. Mouri?

597
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
Amuro-kun.

598
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,750
Did you hear?

599
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,960
What?

600
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,500
I was just worried about Mr. Mouri,

601
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,150
so I brought him some food from Poirot.

602
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,820
Oh... Mouri-kun is not here anymore.

603
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,770
In principle, if the custody is sent to the prosecution,
the person is transferred to the Detention Center.

604
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,370
You know that, don't you, Amuro-san?

605
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,770
Oh, is that so.

606
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,320
You are as knowledgeable as ever.

607
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,820
Oh, and...

608
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:28,200
you can't bring something like that into the Detention Center.

609
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,470
Understood.

610
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,370
What is he planning to do?

611
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,100
2291 has been planted successfully.

612
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,650
What? What did he tell Amuro-san?

613
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,300
Damn.

614
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,470
Hey, Detective-san!

615
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,300
Return the computer you took from uncle's house!

616
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,000
My favorite game is in there!

617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,050
- That's evidence. I can't give it back yet.
- Give it back!

618
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,170
Hey, Conan-kun. Stop it!

619
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,600
It's the software Professor made for me.

620
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,270
Conan-kun, I tried calling you so many times.

621
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,920
Huh? The battery's dead.

622
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,220
Can you charge it with that?

623
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,550
Yeah. Thank you.

624
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,400
My battery can keep longer than that usually.

625
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,220
So, why were you calling me?

626
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,020
We'll be getting the case files soon.

627
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,800
Ran wants Conan-kun to see it too.

628
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,870
Because Conan-kun often notices interesting things.

629
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,070
Additionally,

630
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,550
you will be able to tell Shinichi-kun in case something happens.

631
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,550
I'll definitely relay it to big brother Shinichi.

632
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,170
Thank you, Conan-kun.

633
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,150
Sorry to keep you waiting.

634
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,200
It's the evidence applied by the prosecution.

635
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,270
So that means...

636
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,620
Did they decide to prosecute Uncle Kogoro?

637
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,770
The prosecution contacted us to prosecute him soon.

638
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,320
Dad...

639
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,450
Don't worry. I will definitely get him out.

640
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,870
Over there.

641
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,620
Yes.

642
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,550
Affidavit, confession statement, on-site expert testimony,

643
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,500
and forensics photos at the site.

644
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,450
What a large amount of documents!

645
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
I've got to find something...

646
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,770
Shit. Isn't there anything?

647
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,800
(Forensics Photos List, Glass Shards 01, Glass Shards 02)

648
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,820
What's the matter?

649
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,600
No, I just thought that I had seen it somewhere.

650
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,550
If we look at this, we can see
how the explosion was conducted, can't we?

651
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,070
Police investigation materials are like

652
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,350
a detailed guidebook to crime, aren't they?

653
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,120
Guidebook...

654
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,520
Hello? This is Tachibana.

655
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,450
Court?

656
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,550
Yes. Pretrial arrangement procedure?

657
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,020
General Iwai, why did you inform the defense

658
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,970
without telling me that you are going to prosecute ?

659
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,500
Don't make me say it over and over.

660
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,120
This is the decision of the PSB Police.

661
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,800
So is it not just the decision to prosecute

662
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,500
but also the timing under the thumb of the PSB Police?

663
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,820
The court informed me that

664
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,720
the prosecution would like to hold a Pretrial arrangement procedure

665
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,300
with the defense tomorrow.

666
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,320
Why would they contact General Iwai?

667
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,650
I'm the prosecutor in charge.

668
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,370
Call me when you're done.

669
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,600
It's not here, that big ice cream pack.

670
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,920
Yeah.

671
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,000
I'll go ask the shop assistants.

672
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,700
Amuro-san, can you find flour and eggs, please?

673
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,970
Azusa-san, you would be a good wife.

674
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,770
Avoid frivolous words and actions.

675
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,670
You are very popular with our high-school-girl customers.

676
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,370
The other day, it was all over the internet

677
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,120
that I was courting you.

678
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,870
In this day and age,

679
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,770
we never know who would be listening in from where.

680
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,600
I suppose so.

681
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,320
Furuya-san,

682
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,720
why do you insist on making it look like an accident?

683
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,650
If it is treated as an accident,

684
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,620
we'll never get a single warrant.

685
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,850
The PSB should be able to conduct illegal searches without a warrant.

686
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,320
That's why, we have to leave some legal means.

687
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,500
Otherwise, we'll be strangling ourselves.

688
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,320
Take responsibility for any illegal work we do by ourselves.

689
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,700
That is the nature of the PSB.

690
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,870
But it should also be up to us, the PSB,

691
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,170
to decide whether to legally disclose the incident

692
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,020
or illegally cover it up.

693
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,870
Of course.

694
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,920
However,

695
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,250
it will depend on what will be able to best protect Japan.

696
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,600
Amuro-san!

697
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,220
(Tokyo District Court)

698
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,100
First of all,

699
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,000
please clarify the facts to be proved and

700
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,900
disclose the evidence from the prosecutor.

701
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,770
Yes.

702
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,200
I will now submit the list of evidence.

703
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,670
Ran, calm down.

704
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,450
But...

705
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,150
It's not yet a trial today, right?

706
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,700
Yes. It's the pretrial arrangement procedure.

707
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,870
We just need to narrow down the issues and the evidence,
and set a date.

708
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,170
I told you.

709
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,920
Yeah, but...

710
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,170
Ms. Kyoko!

711
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,470
General Iwai? This is Kusakabe.

712
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,800
We have just finished the pretrial arrangement procedure.

713
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,670
What evidence did Prosecutor Kusakabe disclose?

714
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,850
It was just like the evidence we got earlier.

715
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,520
Here's the list.

716
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,920
What about the trial date?

717
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,270
It's decided.

718
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,320
And that's on schedule as well.

719
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,970
Excuse me. Could you read these for a second?

720
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,320
I will go to the bathroom.

721
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,500
Ms. Kyoko! The bathroom is the other way! Ms. Kyoko!

722
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,560
- This is...
- What's the situation there?

723
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,420
I planted it on Detective Kazami yesterday. Is he near?

724
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,670
I see.

725
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:06,870
It's close.

726
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,120
Could he be in this court?

727
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,570
Where is he?

728
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,100
Is this Ms. Kyoko's ringtone?

729
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Oh, Ms. Kyoko?

730
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,270
I just wanted to check something.

731
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,020
Yes, I'll be right back.

732
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,450
Why can I hear Ms. Kyoko's voice from the wiretap on Detective Kazami?

733
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,720
Did she happen to be in the vicinity of Detective Kazami?

734
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,770
No. Since I heard the sound,

735
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,120
they both must have been close for a while.

736
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,800
It's not a coincidence.

737
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,270
As a result of an investigation by the PSB,

738
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,670
we found out that Nor was used

739
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,350
for unauthorized access to the explosion site.

740
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,670
Nor?

741
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,300
It is a browser software that

742
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,850
encrypts the IP and makes it impossible to trace

743
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,300
by going through multiple computers.

744
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,170
Can Nor's anonymity be lifted?

745
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,420
In principle, no.

746
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,150
But if there is a misconfiguration or bug in Nor's browser,

747
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,020
it might be possible to identify the user.

748
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,150
In other words,

749
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,320
if we create a vulnerability in the culprit's Nor browser,

750
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,350
there is a possibility of chasing.

751
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Currently, we, the PSB Department, are tracing the server

752
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,150
and trying to find a way of identifying the user.

753
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,450
Excuse me.

754
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,170
I have been summoned.

755
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,970
I will have to leave for a moment.

756
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,120
Okay.

757
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,400
Bugging an investigation meeting?

758
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,670
Why are you here?

759
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,170
When it comes to Mouri Kogoro,

760
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,470
you work so hard.

761
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,170
Or is it for big sister Ran?

762
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
It doesn't matter. Come out.

763
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,920
Why did you call me?

764
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,020
Furuya-san.

765
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,800
I don't know how you can work in the PSB with this.

766
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,120
S-Sorry.

767
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,270
Just who in the world...

768
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,150
Wait!

769
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,600
Did you plant the wiretap?

770
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,670
No. No way. He's just a kid.

771
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,350
Amuro-san

772
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,720
is a member of ZERO in the National Police Agency,
which directs the PSB Police nationwide.

773
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,050
Only a limited number of PSB members

774
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,500
can contact Amuro-san.

775
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,950
That was Kazami-san, wasn't it?

776
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,670
Just who are you?

777
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,820
Conan Edogawa. I'm a detective.

778
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,900
The Amuro you speak of is a murderer.

779
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,970
Last year, while interrogating,
he drove a suspect to suicide in the Detention Center.

780
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,700
Suicide?

781
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,820
Sorry. This shouldn't be told to a kid.

782
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,420
But for some reason, I'm able to talk to you about this.

783
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,370
You're a strange child.

784
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,700
Then, as soon as the PSB identifies the location using Nor's access,

785
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,170
Mouri Kogoro will be...

786
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,400
Excuse me, sir. Something terrible is happening in Tokyo right now.

787
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,150
Hot!

788
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,590
What's this?!

789
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,200
Mom, this is terrible!

790
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,940
What? What?

791
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,050
This is crazy!

792
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,720
Unbelievable! What's this?

793
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,820
How many times must I say the same thing?

794
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,900
The Tokyo metropolitan area is on high alert

795
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,450
due to the Tokyo Summit being held today.

796
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,200
There has been no official announcement
yet from the Metropolitan Police Department

797
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,020
about the mysterious phenomena occurring one after the other.

798
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,650
Not only in Japan, but also in the countries
participating in the summit,

799
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,720
voices of anxiety and criticism are reaching the Japanese government.

800
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,470
There are reports of computers and electric kettles going off,

801
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,650
and confusion is spreading.

802
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,070
Just what in the world is happening?

803
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,300
(Electrical Appliances Outburst in Tokyo)
We will repeat the news.

804
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,020
Today, in Tokyo, electrical appliances are...

805
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,150
- About the phenomena that have been occurring one after another.
- What does the culprit aim to do?

806
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,970
Electrical appliances?

807
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,420
Just set the pressure, temperature, and time from your phone.

808
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,570
You can cook soups and other dishes...

809
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,620
That's it!

810
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,350
The first of these attacks was the explosion at the summit venue!

811
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,870
What is the situation?

812
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,370
Communication Command Headquarters is also in a panic.

813
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,050
What the hell is going on?!

814
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,770
I'm sorry, Conan-kun. I don't have time to talk to you right now.

815
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,770
Inspector Megure, I'm sure this is all IoT terrorism.

816
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,270
IoT terrorism?

817
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,450
The culprit is indiscriminately crashing

818
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,420
any appliance that can access the internet.

819
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,000
So, if we cut the internet connection, we can stop this crash.

820
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,660
IoT terrorism, huh.

821
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,610
What a smart kid.

822
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,100
That pressure pot you found at the site must also be an IoT appliance.

823
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,020
(Kogoro Mouri    The International Convention Center Gas Valve)

824
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,600
The culprit used the internet to control the gas valve,

825
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,020
filled the site with gas

826
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,050
and using an IoT pressure pot as an ignition object

827
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,120
blew up the summit venue.

828
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,170
T-Then...

829
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,070
Uncle Kogoro could never do it!

830
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,650
Is that true?

831
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,450
That's what big brother Shinichi said. So, bye.

832
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,370
Inspector...

833
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,970
Conan-kun.

834
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,520
Shinichi is working hard for my dad, right?

835
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,300
Idiot, it's not just for your dad.

836
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,950
I see.

837
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,800
If that is true, then we could win the trial.

838
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,250
Yeah. Uncle, who has been taken into custody by the prosecutors

839
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,600
can't access to the internet right now.

840
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,000
No. IoT terrorism is possible even after being taken into custody,

841
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,500
if he set it up in advance.

842
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,820
If they track down the server

843
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:13,000
and find out where it was accessed from,
Mouri-san's suspicions will be conclusive.

844
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,450
Oh, no!

845
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,050
But operating a server is difficult, isn't it?

846
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,170
Do you think it'll be found out before the trial?

847
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,950
It shouldn't be so hard. Because the PSB is on it.

848
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,120
Wait.

849
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,970
How do you know that the PSB is on that investigation?

850
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,120
I'm sorry.

851
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,650
About that, little boy,

852
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:42,420
it's because the PSB does that kind of investigation usually.

853
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,720
The PSB Police

854
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,170
has a lot of cooperators.

855
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,020
Cooperators? Do you mean civilians
who assist a PSB detective in an investigation?

856
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,350
Yes.

857
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,650
In particular, many of the people involved in the servers,
who are subject to investigation

858
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,520
under the Wiretapping Law, are collaborators of the PSB Police.

859
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
If they can hit on such collaborators,

860
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,650
they should be able to get evidence of Mouri-san's illegal access.

861
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,250
Oh, of course, this is only if there was such evidence to being with.

862
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,420
Ah... That's enough.

863
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,500
Are you sure?

864
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,450
Yeah. Let's just call a repair person.

865
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,350
I knew it... What's this strange feeling?

866
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,900
There's still something about her...

867
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,520
In a series of incidents that are still causing chaos,

868
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,120
the Metropolitan Police Department
has announced a high possibility of IoT terrorism.

869
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,170
I didn't think it would be IoT terrorism.

870
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,970
I'm impressed.

871
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,000
You were able to identify such a criminal technique.

872
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,700
I'm not the one who identified it, but

873
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,170
thanks to that, we succeeded in making the case.

874
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,970
Therefore, we'll take responsibility for the illegal work we've done

875
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,200
and release the cooperator.

876
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:02,870
Before that,

877
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,620
tell me about the information that ZERO has collected.

878
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:07,550
Yeah.

879
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,420
Nazu?

880
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,900
I'll pass this information on to the Cyber Crime Division.

881
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,250
I will let the Criminal Investigation report it
at the investigation meeting.

882
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,120
Will you give this credit to the Criminal Investigation?

883
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,400
We, the PSB, should report it.

884
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,220
It's a reward.

885
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,750
The explosion terrorism was made into the case,
thanks to the Criminal Investigation.

886
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,120
And the board members behind the scenes know

887
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,950
that this information came from ZERO.

888
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,870
I am scared of you, Furuya-san.

889
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,970
Kazami,

890
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,400
I have two guys who are even scarier than me.

891
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,450
One of them is still just a kid, though.

892
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,320
I just imagined the same kid as you, Furuya-san.

893
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,850
From Mouri-san's computer,

894
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,600
we have received reports that traces of

895
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,920
unauthorized access have been found.

896
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,850
So it was used as a relay point after all.

897
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,370
So, what are the traces?

898
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,570
An untraceable phone

899
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,300
was used for the access using a public Wi-Fi,

900
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,470
and so, we could not trace it.

901
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,320
However, at that time

902
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,970
(Tokyo Detention Center)
Mouri-san was in the custody of the prosecution.

903
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,950
So it was impossible for him to be at the access point.

904
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,600
In addition, other than this unauthorized access to IoT terrorism,

905
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,770
the same criminal technique of Nor was used in the earlier case.

906
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,050
Is it the same culprit?

907
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,150
How is the investigation on identifying the server going on?

908
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,920
According to a report from the Cyber Crime Division,

909
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,020
we have found out that the system is in Nazu.

910
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,270
Sorry, I'm late.

911
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,500
Kuriyama-san!

912
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,420
I'm sorry to call you even though you were on vacation.

913
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,870
No problem. I'm your clerk.

914
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,120
I can't just sit around and play while you are in trouble.

915
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,820
That'd be a big help.

916
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,450
Let's see...

917
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,070
Here are the results of our investigation
into attorney Kyoko Tachibana.

918
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,970
Huh? Shinichi Kudo-kun asked me to do this.

919
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,650
Shinichi did?

920
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,850
Did big brother Shinichi ask you to do that?

921
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,250
But why Ms. Tachibana's investigation report?

922
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,720
Excuse me,

923
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,900
because it's from big brother Shinichi,
there must be some reason behind it.

924
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,700
Why don't we take a look anyway?

925
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:45,920
I found out that

926
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,100
last year Ms. Tachibana's clerk caused an incident.

927
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,150
I thought Ms. Tachibana was a freelance lawyer.

928
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,500
The office was closed last year.

929
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:01,520
A man named Fumikazu Haba, who was the clerk at the time,

930
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,250
broke into a game company

931
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,320
and was arrested for theft.

932
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,480
After Haba was sent to the prosecutors,

933
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,800
he committed suicide inside the Detention Center.

934
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,220
Eh? Suicide?

935
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,500
Suicide.

936
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,650
(Fumikazu Haba)

937
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,220
What is this about?

938
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,100
We found out that Kogoro Mouri's computer

939
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,070
was being manipulated by someone.

940
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:32,100
Therefore, it is unlikely that he is the culprit.

941
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,650
Okay, that is all.

942
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,520
What about his fingerprints on the ignition?

943
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,470
Oh, you know, burned-on fingerprints

944
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,220
are easy to transfer.

945
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,500
Is that the conclusion of the PSB Police?

946
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,650
Kogoro Mouri is not prosecuted.

947
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,800
Is the judgment of non-prosecution
also under the thumb of the PSB Police?

948
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,500
You're so persistent.

949
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,970
What? Prosecutor Iwai?

950
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:20,670
Yeah.

951
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,320
It was just a minor burn,
but she was sent to the hospital, just in case.

952
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,920
Could it be that it was another IoT terrorist attack?

953
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,170
When we checked her phone,

954
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,850
there was the access from Nor, similar to the cases till now.

955
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,820
Excuse me. Hello? This is Shiratori.

956
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:41,820
Hold on a second.

957
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,870
Mouri-san will not be prosecuted.

958
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,250
Mom!

959
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,070
Good for you, big sister Ran.

960
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,350
Thank you. I'll have to tell Shinichi and Sonoko.

961
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,670
By the way, what should we do with this?

962
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,320
It's the statement that the prosecutor investigated Fumikazu Haba...

963
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,820
What? This is Prosecutor Iwai, who got burned by her phone.

964
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,750
Last year she was the Chief Prosecutor.

965
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,220
Yeah, but she is the General Prosecutor.

966
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,820
Prosecutor Kusakabe and she were colleagues. Now she is his boss.

967
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,900
That's right.

968
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:27,170
Strangely, the theft case of Fumikazu Haba

969
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,820
led to Prosecutor Iwai's promotion.

970
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,050
By the way, what's this?

971
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:38,970
Why are you investigating me and my former clerks?

972
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,100
Um...

973
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,800
Sorry.

974
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,220
I just wanted to get to know you better.

975
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,720
I asked Kuriyama-san to do it for me.

976
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,420
You've investigated it well.

977
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,000
You must be an excellent clerk as well.

978
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,450
As well?

979
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,100
It's as if you're saying that Haba-san was the same.

980
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,250
He committed the theft.

981
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,170
He must be a bad clerk who
pushed Ms. Kyoko's office to bankruptcy, right?

982
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,450
That wasn't Fumikazu's fault.

983
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,200
It was because I was powerless.

984
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,750
You call him by his first name,

985
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:22,920
Fumikazu, even though he was working under you as a clerk.

986
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,700
Have you investigated that he killed himself in the Detention Center?

987
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,500
W-What?

988
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,120
The suicide was right after

989
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,100
he was interrogated by the PSB Police in the Detention Center.

990
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:47,620
Last year, while interrogating,
he drove a suspect to suicide in the Detention Center.

991
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,720
Why the PSB Police?

992
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,150
I have never heard of that.

993
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,970
There was such a strange combination of events

994
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,750
that led to Fumikazu's suicide.

995
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,300
Um...

996
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,850
Fumikazu Haba-san was dismissed as a judicial apprentice, right?

997
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,250
Did he aim to be a judge?

998
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,070
Yes. But...

999
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,250
at the closing ceremony
of the Legal Training and Research Institute, he...

1000
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,520
(Four years ago, The Legal Training and Research Institute)

1001
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,320
For those of you who will become judges or

1002
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,170
lawyers in the future, don't forget the encounters--

1003
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,220
..sident! President!

1004
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:26,650
I would like an explanation for my rejection!

1005
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,020
What are you doing?

1006
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,360
Regarding my rejection as a judge...!

1007
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,900
You can't deprive me of my mission as a judge! I won't forgive you!

1008
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,750
I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you!

1009
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:49,450
His actions were regarded
as an excessive self-satisfied sense of justice.

1010
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,020
He had no way to become a lawyer, let alone a judge,

1011
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,350
and his judicial career was over.

1012
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,600
Why did you make Haba-san your clerk?

1013
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,700
There are two sides to every person.

1014
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,500
You are looking at only one side.

1015
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,270
I've heard from your daughter outside.

1016
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,650
If Mouri-san is not going to be prosecuted,

1017
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,600
then my service is not required anymore, right?

1018
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,420
Eh? W-Well...

1019
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,000
Excuse me. I also have another investigation to attend to.

1020
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,700
Are you going to investigate the culprit's Nor?

1021
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,450
Yes. We have asked Nazu to cooperate with the investigation.

1022
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,620
Nazu? You mean the one in America?

1023
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,010
That's right.

1024
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,280
There was an unauthorized access incident using Nor in Nazu last year.

1025
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,200
Yeah, the one Ms. Kyoko defended.

1026
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:54,370
That is what led to Nazu making a system to track Nor users.

1027
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,920
We will ask them to analyze it immediately from tomorrow.

1028
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:02,120
Nazu is busy today on a mission to land the Hakucho.

1029
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,800
It's the unmanned probe, right?

1030
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:07,900
With such a day coinciding with the summit,

1031
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,620
the people at the Metropolitan Police Department is busy as bees.

1032
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,100
I see. The summit also starts today.

1033
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,900
At the time of the explosion, the PSB was in charge.

1034
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,550
To put it bluntly,

1035
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,420
the National Police Agency's PSB
is much stronger than Public Prosecutor's.

1036
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,120
That's why, there are times
when the PSB considerations work in prosecutions.

1037
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,550
The PSB Police has

1038
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,070
a lot of cooperators.

1039
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,970
Ms. Kyoko's ringtone?

1040
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,500
Why can it be heard from the wiretap on Detective Kazami?

1041
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,950
The Amuro you speak of is a murderer.

1042
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,050
After Haba was sent to the prosecutors,

1043
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,250
he committed suicide inside the Detention Center.

1044
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,950
I know about this case.

1045
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,850
It's the “Nazu unauthorized access case”.

1046
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,050
IoT terrorism.

1047
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:03,220
The culprit is indiscriminately crashing any appliance
that can access the internet.

1048
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,620
Police investigation materials are like

1049
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,670
a detailed guidebook to crime, aren't they?

1050
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,120
I got it. The things it matches...

1051
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,370
I just thought that I had seen it somewhere.

1052
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,370
Oh, no. No way.

1053
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,850
Midori-san!

1054
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,950
Please send the detailed documents
on the “Nazu unauthorized access case”

1055
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,420
to my phone immediately

1056
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,850
is what big brother Shinichi told me.

1057
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,320
Conan-kun.

1058
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,820
I'm going to the Metropolitan Police Department to pick up my dad!

1059
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:37,720
Geez...

1060
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,950
Why isn't Shinichi picking up the phone?

1061
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,400
You knew I was coming, right?

1062
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,720
That was when I first noticed something strange.

1063
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:17,750
Excuse me.

1064
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,000
Yes.

1065
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,370
When I asked the Professor to look into this

1066
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:29,570
a remote-control app was found.

1067
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,150
It's a type that doesn't show an icon.

1068
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,720
Is there any evidence that the PSB planted it?

1069
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,400
There was none, as expected.

1070
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,220
Now that you've found it,

1071
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,100
why didn't you just uninstall the app?

1072
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,400
Because I'm going to meet the culprit now.

1073
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,370
Don't tell me... have you figured out who the culprit of terrorism is?

1074
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:49,370
Yeah. And their motivation as well. Their motivation is...

1075
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,920
you guys, Amuro-san.

1076
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:58,350
The origin of the matter is the “Nazu unauthorized access case”.

1077
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:02,820
That's what happened last year. Is it Fumikazu Haba?

1078
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,950
Yeah.

1079
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:07,770
Haba-san committed suicide in the Detention Center last year, right?

1080
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,200
Yeah.

1081
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,850
It was today during last year.

1082
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,520
Today during last year?

1083
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,870
I see! What the hell?

1084
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,100
I'm sure the culprit's revenge isn't over yet!

1085
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,970
Is it IoT terrorism?

1086
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,070
Amuro-san!

1087
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,650
Go!

1088
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,520
(Special Program Welcome "Hakucho")
Finally returning from Mars to Earth

1089
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
is the unmanned probe "Hakucho".

1090
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,220
Good evening, everyone.

1091
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,100
This is the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
in Nagano prefecture.

1092
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,050
Just now...

1093
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:42,820
Is is already this late?

1094
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,900
I'll send you home.

1095
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,650
But Hakucho is coming back soon.

1096
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,210
Please let us see the TV broadcast.

1097
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,000
Yeah.

1098
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,200
Nope. Watch at your home.

1099
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,700
Oh no...! Haibara-san...

1100
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,550
Ah...What's wrong?

1101
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,470
About that, the kids wanted to watch the broadcast...

1102
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,350
Huh? How long before it enters the atmosphere?

1103
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,000
Uh... let me see...

1104
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,100
Kudo-kun?

1105
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:17,300
Less than one hour? We don't have time!

1106
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,820
Conan-kun. So the culprit is...

1107
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,750
Yeah, they're going to crash it by illegally accessing Nazu.

1108
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,320
But where on earth?

1109
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,020
Damn it. Don't tell me...

1110
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:31,520
it's an attack from the sky?

1111
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:42,020
He's here! Uncle!

1112
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:47,720
Dad! Welcome back!

1113
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,920
Sorry for worrying you, Ran.

1114
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,770
I'm really so glad!

1115
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,850
And also, Eri...

1116
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,570
I'm sorry for everything.

1117
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,520
What are you saying?

1118
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,400
I'm so glad, Ran!

1119
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,300
Sonoko, thank you.

1120
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,820
Oh, that's right!

1121
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,650
Let's send this emotional scene to your detective geek.

1122
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,500
- Then I'm in too.
- Sonoko...

1123
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,970
With this, you should be able to get in touch with him. Say Cheese!

1124
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:21,720
What happened?

1125
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,870
Please give me a spare torch!

1126
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:28,250
Inspector, it seems that the emergency power supply
has been destroyed.

1127
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,200
What?!

1128
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,170
What in the world is going on?

1129
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,700
Report from Nazu.

1130
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,950
Unauthorized access to the unmanned probe has been confirmed.

1131
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,350
What?

1132
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,120
It seems that the capsule cannot be separated.

1133
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,900
The main body of Hakucho will burn out in the atmosphere.

1134
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,750
But it turns out that the landing system
of the capsule is out of order.

1135
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,720
(Nazu Control Room)
Nazu seems to be in a panic.

1136
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,020
I will send the latest landing prediction data.

1137
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,470
139 degrees 45 minutes 8.405 seconds east longitude.

1138
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,200
The expected landing area according to Nazu is...

1139
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,900
This place...?

1140
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,850
What the hell... Conan-kun!

1141
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,900
As I thought, the culprit is aiming for...

1142
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:19,950
The Metropolitan Police Department!

1143
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,450
Is the capsule crashing into the Metropolitan Police Department?

1144
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,220
What is happening?

1145
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:28,520
If the capsule that is over 4 meters crash into here,

1146
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,750
it would be an unprecedented disaster!

1147
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,570
Arrange a large personnel transport vehicle as soon as possible.

1148
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:39,050
Within a 1 km radius around the Metropolitan Police Department
start immediate evacuation.

1149
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,200
Yes, sir!

1150
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,120
Hurry up.

1151
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,000
Hurry up!

1152
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,350
Where is the evacuation map?

1153
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:44,770
We don't have time!

1154
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,220
Dad...

1155
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,220
Don't worry. I'm with you.

1156
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,350
Eri, you to stay with me.

1157
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,400
Y-Yes.

1158
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,070
Good job!

1159
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,570
Once separated from the probe,

1160
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,670
the capsule will simply fall like a meteorite.

1161
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,170
In other words, we will only be able to control the trajectory

1162
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,970
for a short time before it enters the atmosphere.

1163
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,830
Within 1 km of the Metropolitan Police Department,

1164
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,320
(Minister of the Environment)
there are various ministries,

1165
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,770
many parks, and hotels.

1166
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:17,970
The number of evacuees is roughly calculated to be about 150,000.

1167
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,170
(Cabinet Office Official Residence Countermeasures Office)

1168
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,450
We have compiled a list of potential evacuation sites

1169
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,300
(Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)
and routes for that many people within a 1 km radius.

1170
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,350
(Deputy Director-General of the National Police Agency)
Prime Minister, Nazu reported that the memory cannot be modified.

1171
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,500
What?

1172
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,650
The signals sent from the ground station

1173
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:40,600
to the probe are encrypted with a specific code,

1174
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,100
and unless that code matches,

1175
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:45,720
the memory can't be rewritten.

1176
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,900
Then does that mean that the culprit changed the code?

1177
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,720
Yeah. When they illegally accessed Nazu

1178
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:53,850
and changed the probe's trajectory.

1179
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,320
We must find out the changed code.

1180
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,150
For that, I need the professor, who developed such an amazing thing,

1181
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,770
to be my collaborator.

1182
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,370
What are you going to do?

1183
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,250
Revive dead humans.

1184
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,370
I'm impressed

1185
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,020
To think that you could come up with such a plan...

1186
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,950
I wish we can get the code with this.

1187
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,250
I've succeeded in speeding it up further.

1188
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,550
Professor, the video is shaking.

1189
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,670
It won't work like this.

1190
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,850
It's the first time to fly it at night.

1191
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,300
A night drone! We want to do it too!

1192
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,570
It's so unfair that only the Professor gets to do it!

1193
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:45,800
You guys...

1194
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,300
Because we can't see Hakucho on TV!

1195
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,850
That's true. Then, can you do it?

1196
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,170
I'm worried about the Professor's control.

1197
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,950
Woo-hoo!! This will be so much fun!

1198
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,550
Did you have to say it like that?

1199
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,970
Leave this to those kids.

1200
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,670
Let's get ready.

1201
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,400
We are

1202
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,500
The Drone

1203
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,970
Flyers!

1204
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,550
Go!!

1205
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:23,820
From now on, about 30,000 people will be evacuated

1206
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,850
to the Edge of Ocean, at the reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay.

1207
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,920
Where is it again?

1208
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,050
Don't know.

1209
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,450
Excuse me. Is it where the summit was going to be held?

1210
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,050
Indeed. We will be evacuating to the Casino Tower.

1211
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,950
Casino Tower?

1212
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,100
Oh! It's that one.

1213
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,500
Oh right. I have to tell Shinichi.

1214
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,970
Nazu keeps sending the code,

1215
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,650
but it seems that it still can't access the probe.

1216
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,470
Damn it!

1217
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,300
We must get the code fast!

1218
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,900
That's the data you see on Nazu's ground station, right?

1219
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,400
You are the terrorist, aren't you?

1220
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,750
This is a surprise, Prosecutor Kusakabe.

1221
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,550
To think that it would be you...

1222
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,550
What are you guys talking about?

1223
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,300
I should have noticed earlier

1224
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,770
when I looked at the list of evidence you applied for.

1225
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,320
Only the culprit could have known that piece of glass

1226
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,400
was part of a real ignition.

1227
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,470
You applied for that as the evidence

1228
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:21,120
when the ignition was still thought to be due to a high-voltage cable.

1229
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,600
Nice timing!

1230
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:29,870
This is the trial material of the “Nazu unauthorized
access case” that occurred last year.

1231
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,770
You were in charge.

1232
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:37,050
I see. The way of the criminal technique was
unauthorized access using Nor.

1233
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,400
By using the method of the case you were in charge of,

1234
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,970
you performed cyber terrorism, right?

1235
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,850
But there was a miscalculation.

1236
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,420
Nazu had already made a system to track the culprit.

1237
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:55,550
Knowing that, you created a bug and accessed Nor

1238
01:12:55,870 --> 01:13:00,350
set your boss's phone on fire,
and made it look like an IoT terrorist attack.

1239
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:04,850
To let the police identify the dummy.

1240
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:09,050
That's why, the timing of IoT terrorism was strange.

1241
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,270
Don't touch my stuff as you wish.

1242
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:13,120
Wait!

1243
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,500
There are traces of using Nor on that phone!

1244
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,570
Seriously!

1245
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,050
As if I'd let you escape!

1246
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,220
Damn it, it didn't work!

1247
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:48,650
No problem!

1248
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,320
Shit!

1249
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:06,920
Prosecutor Kusakabe,

1250
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,670
is the motive for your terrorism really the PSB Police?

1251
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,970
If the summit venue is blown up and

1252
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,700
the American probe crashes on Tokyo,

1253
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:20,250
the prestige of the PSB Police will be completely destroyed.

1254
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:23,050
Why do you hate the PSB Police so much?

1255
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:25,850
As long as your power is strong,

1256
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:29,300
we, the PSB prosecutors, cannot fulfill justice!

1257
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,970
Are you saying that it's okay
if people are dying for the sake of justice?!

1258
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,770
I didn't mean to kill the civilians.

1259
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,670
That's why, I blew it up only when the PSB Police were there.

1260
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,300
That's why, I chose IoT terrorism,
which is less likely to cause fatalities,

1261
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:47,100
and chose that place for the capsule to crash.

1262
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,270
Was the power outage in the Metropolitan Police Department

1263
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:54,120
induced to evacuate the civilians inside?

1264
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:54,870
Yeah.

1265
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,170
I see.

1266
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,770
You also set up IoT terrorism on the way to get here

1267
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,720
to stop people from coming in.

1268
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:02,800
Nevertheless,

1269
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,020
there was enough possibility that someone would be sacrificed!

1270
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:10,820
Some sacrifice is unavoidable for justice!

1271
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,520
That's not justice!

1272
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:21,020
Even my... even my cooperator was sacrificed.

1273
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,550
Haba-san was...

1274
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,070
So he was your cooperator, wasn't he?

1275
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,570
How do you know that?

1276
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:31,350
It's your PIN code.

1277
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,550
I was curious because it was unusual.

1278
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,500
The only reason you didn't turn off your typing sound
was so you wouldn't forget him.

1279
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,650
Fumikazu Haba.

1280
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:45,700
Wrong!

1281
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,650
It was to keep the revenge on them in mind!

1282
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:53,950
All cooperators of public prosecutors are reported to ZERO

1283
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,520
and are managed by numbers.

1284
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,250
But the PSB detectives do not know each other's cooperators.

1285
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,700
Moreover, we did not know that a PSB prosecutor

1286
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:05,550
had a collaborator until last year.

1287
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:10,020
Is that why you easily cut off my cooperator at that time?!

1288
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,650
I see. So there was a flip side

1289
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,950
to the theft case that Haba-san caused last year.

1290
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,400
That is... what I had requested of Haba.

1291
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,420
For investigating the “Nazu unauthorized access case”,

1292
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:27,070
when Haba found out that the access data was

1293
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:28,870
in the game company where the suspect worked,

1294
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,150
he tried to steal it...

1295
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,420
(Assistant Police Officer Yuya Kazami)

1296
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:42,950
(Tokyo Detention Center)

1297
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,320
Those who cooperate with the PSB

1298
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:47,220
are forced to conduct illegal and dangerous investigations.

1299
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,020
That is why

1300
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:53,800
the relationship between the PSB
and the cooperator is stronger than that of their relatives.

1301
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,000
It is not a relationship that is connected only by money.

1302
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,900
It is like that of two bodies but one mind,
connected by a sense of duty.

1303
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,150
Why didn't you say that you are my cooperator in the interrogation?

1304
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,070
Because of my mistake,

1305
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,020
I cannot deprive you of the status of a PSB prosecutor.

1306
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,850
You could have thought more about yourself than to think about me!

1307
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,550
I know more than anyone about the pain
of being deprived of justice and one's status.

1308
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:24,620
Please, think about your life!

1309
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:30,570
The lives of the Japanese people are much more important than my own.

1310
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:36,170
This ambition that you always talked about is the same for me too.

1311
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,620
(Public Prosecutors Office)

1312
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:42,470
I told everything to the prosecutor-in-charge
of the theft case and him.

1313
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,170
Haba is my cooperator.

1314
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,250
He committed the theft because I ordered it.

1315
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,960
Even then, we will prosecute him.

1316
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,450
What?

1317
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,750
Don't tell me... is it because of the PSB Police again?

1318
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,420
Don't worry.

1319
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,170
I will handle the trial so that he doesn't mention

1320
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,170
your name in court.

1321
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,250
I am not talking about that!

1322
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:10,650
Later, when I was heading to the Metropolitan Police Department
to talk directly to the PSB Police,

1323
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,650
Yes.

1324
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,700
Haba committed suicide.

1325
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,920
We don't know why.

1326
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:28,050
He did it immediately after the PSB Police
interrogated him in the Detention Center.

1327
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,950
The one who drove Haba to suicide... No...

1328
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:55,870
the ones who killed him are the PSB Police!!

1329
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,300
So is that why you plotted to crash the probe
into the Metropolitan Police Department?

1330
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:05,470
Yes. Ever since I learned that the date of Hakucho
coming back coincides with that of Haba's passing.

1331
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,020
What about IoT terrorism?

1332
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,950
Although it was not in my plan,

1333
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,300
as a prosecutor

1334
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,650
I could not prosecute an innocent person.

1335
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:18,300
Did you commit IoT terrorism to
prove Kogoro Mouri was not the culprit?

1336
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,920
Yes. But the scale of the damage

1337
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,300
was beyond my expectation.

1338
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,520
Don't commit more sins.

1339
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:30,000
Tell me the code that you changed by unauthorized access.

1340
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,950
The PSB prosecutors are professionals who protect justice.

1341
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,950
Justice must not be lost as it happened in Haba's case.

1342
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:38,570
Tell us the code.

1343
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,850
Just arrest me.

1344
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,550
I will keep silent during interrogation.

1345
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,050
Prosecutor Kusakabe.

1346
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,120
Kusakabe-san.

1347
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,220
Impossible! Why is Haba there?

1348
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,200
It's a live video of the Metropolitan Police Department heliport.

1349
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:02,020
What does this mean?

1350
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,800
The PSB Police who interrogated him

1351
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,000
at the Detention Ceter pretended that he committed

1352
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,020
suicide and forced him to give up his life so far.

1353
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:16,250
It was to cover up the fact that a PSB prosecutor
was using a cooperator.

1354
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,700
And also

1355
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,870
to not let PSB prosecutors have cooperators ever again.

1356
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,400
That was also hidden from you.

1357
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:28,420
We overselves must take care of the illegal work we did.

1358
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,850
You don't have that power.

1359
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,920
The PSB Police decided so.

1360
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,370
Haba-san had such a strong sense of justice that he believed

1361
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,670
that he was the one who should be the judge.

1362
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,200
That's why,

1363
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:50,850
you made him your cooperator after
he was dismissed as a judicial apprentice and had nowhere else to go.

1364
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,820
That's right.

1365
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,850
Kusakabe-san saved me when I was at the rock bottom of my life.

1366
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,020
It was an association of only two years.

1367
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,720
Kusakabe-san told me, that thanks to me,

1368
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,870
he could fight as a PSB prosecutor.

1369
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,070
That's why, I can still fight like this.

1370
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:14,550
Kusakabe-san, please tell us the changed code.

1371
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:17,150
If it crashes into there,

1372
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:19,200
Haba can't remain uninjured.

1373
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,620
It's a dirty way!

1374
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,150
Is this the PSB Police's way of doing things?

1375
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:27,650
Soon, Hakucho will be entering the atmosphere.

1376
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,520
Have we still not received the code?

1377
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,050
At this rate,

1378
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,070
we will be unable to access the probe!

1379
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,620
Furuya-san, time is running out...!

1380
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:38,320
Hurry up! Tell us the code!

1381
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,470
Prosecutor Kusakabe, hurry!

1382
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,400
But...

1383
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,520
Kusakabe-san,

1384
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:01,100
is this your way of justice that I believed in?

1385
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:10,550
The code that I changed by unauthorized access to Nazu...

1386
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:35,250
What? Blackout?

1387
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:40,200
Yes, it's a short time of about five minutes
right after entering the atmosphere.

1388
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:43,050
During that time, plasma is generated,

1389
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,720
and so communication cannot be kept stable.

1390
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,770
So it will be difficult to know for sure
whether the trajectory has been corrected or not.

1391
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,550
Moreover, the parachute might not open.

1392
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,550
Really?

1393
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,350
Evacuate Haba...

1394
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,520
Evacuate Haba from there as soon as possible!

1395
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,650
Prosecutor Kusakabe!

1396
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,050
Did Shinichi-kun contact you?

1397
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,320
No, not yet. I've left a message on his answering machine though.

1398
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:14,420
Geez... Jus what is he doing anyway?

1399
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:17,250
Conan-kun's phone seems to be out of power too.

1400
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,900
That kid? I'm sure he is okay.

1401
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:24,820
Even so, it's really tall.

1402
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,800
Come on, let's hurry up and go. This way.

1403
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,450
Where is Haba?

1404
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,570
What does this mean?

1405
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,770
He is not here.

1406
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,000
But he was here when you called on the phone.

1407
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:49,400
What you were watching was a synthesized video.

1408
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,620
Using a video taken with a drone

1409
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,350
we synthesized it as if he was in the heliport
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

1410
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,570
Right now, he is in a safe place.

1411
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,720
I see...

1412
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,670
Amuro-san, if they can't correct the trajectory,

1413
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,900
the crash position will be...

1414
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,750
Yeah. That capsule, which is over four meters long,

1415
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,470
will come crashing here at a speed of over 10 km per second.

1416
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,300
Amuro-san, can you get the explosives immediately?

1417
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,800
Are you going to destroy the heat-resistant capsule?

1418
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,550
No, it will just be an explosion that
can change its trajectory to the Pacific Ocean.

1419
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,650
What an idea!

1420
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,020
Is there any other way?

1421
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,600
Kazami, please take action immediately.

1422
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,670
Yeah. It's an illegal work, PSB's strong area.

1423
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:58,500
It's the most powerful explosive device
ever seized by the PSB Forensics.

1424
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:00,150
Isn't it traceable?

1425
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,320
The disposal deadline is approaching,

1426
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,720
so as long as we rewrite the records, it won't be a problem.

1427
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:05,470
All right.

1428
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,000
Please.

1429
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,070
No problem.

1430
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:18,270
We'll send the expected trajectory data
of the capsule to your address.

1431
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,550
All right. Let's being!

1432
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,000
Yay!!

1433
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:29,100
Even if you told me to calculate where to explode...

1434
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Geez... He pushes me too hard!

1435
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,750
Mitsuhiko-kun, Ayumi-kun,

1436
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,450
Genta-kun, and Ai-kun.

1437
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,970
You guys are going to protect this country.

1438
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,400
The drone is wobbling.

1439
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,700
Isn't Professor's box heavy?

1440
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,720
Let's put it over there.

1441
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,150
Absolutely not!

1442
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:04,570
That box is my precious treasure!

1443
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:08,950
I narrowed the margin of error to a radius of about 10 m.

1444
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,670
I'll send you the image from the drone.

1445
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,700
Adjust the timing yourself.

1446
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,450
All right. Thanks.

1447
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:18,170
But is it really okay

1448
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,750
if we take pictures of the Hakucho's capsule from nearby.

1449
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:26,320
Don't worry. The police have given permission.

1450
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,920
It's the PSB Police, though.

1451
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:54,850
What? The parachute isn't opening?

1452
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,220
The heat shield seems to be locked.

1453
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,970
Prime Minister, order a shoot-down!

1454
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:02,370
Please wait!

1455
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:03,870
But...

1456
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:07,900
Intercepting it at this altitude could cause more damage.

1457
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,970
It has passed an altitude of 30,000 meters.

1458
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,020
Yes... Okay.

1459
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,320
Don't mess it up.

1460
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:26,500
Roger that.

1461
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:28,400
Amuro-san.

1462
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,050
Can you get the timing with this?

1463
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:32,250
Yeah.

1464
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,870
It'll get closer to the capsule.

1465
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,700
I'll leave it to you, guys.

1466
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,970
If it stays like this, it will hit the capsule.

1467
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,100
No problem.

1468
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:54,850
That drone is equipped with a system that avoids collision

1469
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:58,070
when it detects an approaching object.

1470
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,320
Guys, if you don't bring it closer,

1471
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:02,670
we won't be able to see the capsule flying.

1472
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,400
I want to see it!

1473
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,570
Mitsuhiko, come on!

1474
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,350
Got it!

1475
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:14,170
Kudo-kun, don't push yourself too hard.

1476
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:40,870
It's here!

1477
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,500
Go!!

1478
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,870
The parachute opened!

1479
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:19,950
（NO SIGNAL）

1480
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:20,650
What?

1481
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,020
There's nothing on the screen.

1482
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,800
Did it crash into the drone?

1483
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,020
It is a system that avoids collision automatically, right?

1484
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:33,500
Probably the battery is dead.

1485
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,900
I mean, it didn't have such a system originally.

1486
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,170
I seems like it still worked.

1487
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:42,370
What a surprise.

1488
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,700
Who are you guys?

1489
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:50,720
You could maybe call us cooperators of a small detective.

1490
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,350
Yeah... Okay.

1491
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,250
We succeeded.

1492
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,400
Good.

1493
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:02,400
Furuya-san, we will arrest him.

1494
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:03,550
Yeah.

1495
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,750
Wait!

1496
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:13,200
Kusakabe-san, we are still two bodies but one mind.

1497
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:15,950
Yeah.

1498
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,170
Come on. Let's go.

1499
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,700
Fumikazu!

1500
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,050
Kyoko.

1501
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,420
Fumikazu...

1502
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:26,620
I can't believe it...

1503
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,650
You are alive.

1504
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,650
You are a really scary man.

1505
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:35,800
I can't believe you were also a cooperator.

1506
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,370
And a PSB prosecutor's, on top of that!

1507
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,250
Ms. Kyoko,

1508
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,650
you are also a collaborator, right?

1509
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:50,620
That too of Detective Kazami.

1510
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,450
You've asked me before about why I hired Fumikazu.

1511
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:00,550
He was dismissed from his legal apprenticeship,

1512
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,100
and the Security Police marked him as a security risk.

1513
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,370
(4 years ago   Tachibana Law Office)
So I was ordered to hire him

1514
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,820
and report his actions.

1515
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:15,070
But while working with Fumikazu,

1516
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,000
for some reason, I became strongly attracted to him.

1517
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,420
I was the same.

1518
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,200
That's why,

1519
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,800
I'm really sorry for things to have become like this.

1520
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,950
It's ridiculous to learn that you and I were both cooperators.

1521
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,850
It all started with the “Nazu unauthorized access case”, right?

1522
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,800
Yeah.

1523
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,150
The PSB told me to convict the suspect,

1524
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:47,250
and I was proceeding with the investigation.

1525
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,270
At that time,

1526
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,320
he was caught at a game company where the suspect frequented.

1527
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:58,920
I didn't understand why he did that.

1528
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,920
To help him,

1529
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,400
I desperately asked the PSB Police.

1530
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,100
But he committed suicide.

1531
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:10,720
I've held a grudge against the PSB Police.

1532
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,970
I closed down my office,

1533
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,120
and as a cooperator, I was looking for an opportunity for revenge.

1534
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,100
At that time,

1535
01:32:18,570 --> 01:32:21,150
you were ordered to defend Uncle Kogoro

1536
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,220
to prove his innocence, right?

1537
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,420
Yeah.

1538
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:29,400
I didn't understand why the PSB Police wanted to acquit him.

1539
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,650
At that time, I thought that I'd make him guilty.

1540
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,920
You would drag unrelated people in this?

1541
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,720
I couldn't help it!

1542
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,550
But, unexpectedly,

1543
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,300
he is still alive under the protection of the PSB Police.

1544
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,720
If I knew about this, I wouldn't be doing this...

1545
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:56,450
Fumikazu is your cooperator right now, isn't it?

1546
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,420
What's his number?

1547
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,250
Number?

1548
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:07,700
The PSB calls us by numbers behind our backs, don't you?

1549
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,100
I'm 2291.

1550
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:15,050
So, what's his?

1551
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:17,570
Kyoko Tachibana,

1552
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:21,750
we are freeing you from being a cooperator of the PSB Police.

1553
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,600
I hope you understand, Kazami.

1554
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:27,750
Take responsibility for any illegal work we've done, by ourselves.

1555
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,470
That's the nature of PSB.

1556
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:33,400
Haba is here.

1557
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,650
You are free now.

1558
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,600
If you want to see him,

1559
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:39,020
we will not stop you.

1560
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:40,700
Don't be conceited!

1561
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,700
It was my decision to become your cooperator!

1562
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,500
It was also my decision to betray you!

1563
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:56,450
It was also my decision to love him!

1564
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:02,820
Don't think you were manipulating my life entirely!

1565
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:13,200
Goodbye.

1566
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:17,500
Kyoko...

1567
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,420
No matter how much she hates us,

1568
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,420
protect her till the end.

1569
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:27,720
That is...

1570
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:30,150
the nature of the PSB.

1571
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,000
Thanks to you,

1572
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:37,950
we could arrest a terrorist who was trying to undermine Japan.

1573
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,150
When did you think it was terrorism?

1574
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:42,350
As you reasoned.

1575
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:47,920
That day, during the inspection
of the International Convention Center,

1576
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:51,470
we found out that the gas valve could be accessed from the internet,

1577
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:56,350
and thought of the possibility that
it could be used for a terrorist attack,

1578
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,070
when I was instructing the PSB Forensics.

1579
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,950
However, from the situation at the site,

1580
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,370
it could have been dealt with as an accident.

1581
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:10,770
That is why, you made up a suspect.

1582
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,820
We wanted to move the suspect from the police to

1583
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:16,620
the public prosecutor as soon as possible.

1584
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,800
Because the public prosecutor is under our thumb.

1585
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:22,800
That's way you planted Ms. Kyoko as a lawyer

1586
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:27,150
and released Uncle Kogoro
when the possibility of an accident was eliminated.

1587
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,820
You are amazing!

1588
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,150
You solve all mysteries.

1589
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:36,800
No, there is one mystery that hasn't been solved yet. That is...

1590
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:37,770
Your phone,

1591
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,720
it's been lighting for a long time.

1592
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,840
(Missed Call   Ran Mouri)

1593
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,750
Shinichi?

1594
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,370
We're evacuating to the Casino Tower in the Edge of Ocean right now.

1595
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:52,050
Yes.

1596
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:53,750
Call me back when you hear this message.

1597
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:56,700
What? The capsule?

1598
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,650
Due to an unexplained explosion,

1599
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:05,150
if nothing is done, it will crash into the Tokyo Bay reclaimed land!

1600
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:08,800
One of the lands has the Edge of Ocean, where 30,000 people

1601
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,420
have been evacuated!

1602
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:12,550
We can't intercept it anymore.

1603
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,500
Please go slowly!

1604
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,270
We still have time!

1605
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:16,200
Don't push each other, please!

1606
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,670
Everyone, please calm down.

1607
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:22,250
We should be able to ride everyone as we did when we came here.

1608
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:24,000
Inspector.

1609
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,450
What?

1610
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,000
Because information is confusing,

1611
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:28,470
regular vehicles are evacuating here.

1612
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:29,750
What?

1613
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,400
The only two bridges are having heavy traffic.

1614
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,600
This doesn't look good. Everyone's panicking.

1615
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,520
Shinichi...

1616
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,200
Damn it, I can't contact Ran!

1617
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,570
What should we do? We don't have time.

1618
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:55,500
Amuro-san, this time, I'm requesting you to become my cooperator.

1619
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:09,800
There is a traffic jam ahead.

1620
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,550
Is evacuation guidance not going well?

1621
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:19,270
Is that the Casino Tower?

1622
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:20,740
Furuya-san!

1623
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:25,050
The parachute of the capsule
has come off and the capsule is accelerating!

1624
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,150
So?

1625
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,450
The predicted crash area has came out from Nazu.

1626
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,720
At this rate, it will crash into the Casino Tower in 5 minutes!

1627
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,900
Ran... Damn! What should I do? What should I do?!

1628
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,350
Amuro-san!

1629
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,570
Hold on tight!

1630
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,000
Amuro-san, what are you going to do?

1631
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,420
Here we go!

1632
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:37,650
I thought I'd die, but this is really something...

1633
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,450
So, what should we do?

1634
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:41,320
Hold on.

1635
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,220
Head to this under-construction building.

1636
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:50,850
All right.

1637
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,570
Guys, don't get separated.

1638
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,750
Yes.

1639
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,970
It's become a big deal.

1640
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,170
Can we make it in time?

1641
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:21,600
Considering the height of this building
and the distance to the Casino Tower,

1642
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,550
we can if we can accelerate from here in another minute.

1643
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:28,450
It's all or nothing!

1644
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:32,510
Please be in time!

1645
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:33,980
Ran!

1646
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:37,950
What?

1647
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,270
The power of love is great.

1648
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,120
Eh?

1649
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,950
I've always wanted to ask you,

1650
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,150
do you have a girlfriend, Amuro-san?

1651
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:09,150
My lover... is this country.

1652
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:16,320
Let's go, Amuro-san!

1653
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,900
Just 1 mm is enough. Can we shift it?

1654
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,900
I intend to do just that!

1655
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,230
’5...

1656
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:24,280

1657
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,240
’3...

1658
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:26,260
’2...

1659
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,320
’1...

1660
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:28,700
Zero!

1661
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,820
Not good! The height is not enough!

1662
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:38,970
It's fine!

1663
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:19,800
Come ooooon!

1664
01:42:21,950 --> 01:42:22,620
Ran!

1665
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:34,900
Dad!!

1666
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,570
Ran.

1667
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:38,150
We'll deal with the rest.

1668
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,170
You should leave here soon.

1669
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:42,250
The mystery hasn't been solved yet.

1670
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:45,900
Why did you involve Uncle Kogoro?

1671
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:51,650
I can't investigate publicly from my standpoint.

1672
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,170
If I got him involved in the case,

1673
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:56,970
you would inevitably become my cooperator.

1674
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,720
Then,

1675
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:03,220
I could borrow your real power, right?

1676
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,800
You overestimate me too much.

(Agasa)
Inspired by a police investigation document

1679
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:34,320
that looked like a guide to crime,

1680
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:37,600
and with an unusual motive, Makoto Kusakabe,
who is a former prosecutor,

1681
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,620
carried out a series of terrorist attacks.

1682
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,570
The Metropolitan Police Department is...

1683
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:45,500
The PSB has disappeared from his motivation.

1684
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:48,870
That is most probably the decision of the PSB Police.

1685
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,200
Inside the capsule of the collected Hakucho probe,

1686
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,420
which landed safely in Tokyo Bay,

1687
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:57,900
are samples obtained from Mars.

1688
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,500
It has been announced that

1689
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:02,300
there are high hopes for solving the mysteries of the universe.

1690
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:04,900
Amazing!

1691
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,600
But we wanted to see it with our drone.

1692
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,320
If only the Professor's box wasn't there.

1693
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:16,970
They don't seem to think even for a minute that

1694
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,320
they contributed to the collecting of the capsule.

1695
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:23,150
Yeah. And they saved the crisis in Japan.

1696
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:26,100
They're really amazing!

1697
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:31,250
All right. Let's explore Mars with Professor's drone.

1698
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:32,650
That's a good idea!

1699
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,750
Let's do it!

1700
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:36,270
Professor, please make a new one.

1701
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,550
Make it a bigger one!

1702
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,450
Really? Shall I do my best?

1703
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:46,400
I'm looking forward to Mars.

1704
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:50,170
But... that'd be impossible.

1705
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:04,220
Let us meet again.
