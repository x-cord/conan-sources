1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,399
Bite!

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,799
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,899
A violent exotic species,

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,299
an annoying new inhabitant in the lake,

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,099
and the unexpected connection of a man wanting to breed them.

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:11,999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,100
"Beika Central Park"

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,200
What's up?

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,300
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,900
Oh, it's you guys.

13
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,200
Are you investigating a case?

14
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,300
Yeah.

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
At the Fukurokouji residence over there.

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,800
Late last night...

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Robber!

18
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,500
So he got away just like that.

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,200
The amount stolen was three million yen.

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,400
The robber had gloves on, so we couldn't get any fingerprints.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
He also wore a mask, so we don't know what he looks like either.

22
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,200
The only clue we have is that he is tall and skinny.

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
We're trying to get clues as to where he may have fled

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,000
and are looking for witnesses.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
I guess you won't be needing the Youth Detective Squad's help, then.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Yeah, a burglary is a case that should be handled by the police.

27
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,200
-Yeah. -Let's hurry and go to Beika Central Park!

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
At Beika Central Park, they're...

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,400
They're working on that thing

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,900
that was reported to the city hall this morning.

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,300
Please stand back! It's dangerous!

32
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,000
Stand back from the lake a little more!

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where is it? Is it really here?

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't push, Genta!

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Even you're afraid of it, Conan.

36
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,500
There it is!

37
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Over here, over here!

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,500
There, there!

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
No doubt about it.

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,100
That's an alligator snapping turtle.

41
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,900
Alligator snapping turtle?

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,500
"Lakeside Mystery"

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,500
I wonder if someone kept it as a pet?

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,300
It's a turtle that didn't originally exist in Japan.

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,600
So I think the owner secretly disposed of it

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
because the turtle was hard to keep.

47
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
It is called the alligator snapping turtle

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
and it lives mainly in North America and Mexico.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,700
It has an aggressive character and strong jaws.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,700
It can easily bite off the finger of a human being.

51
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,400
No one should keep something so dangerous as pets.

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,900
In this world, to each is his own.

53
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,200
There are people who fill empty spaces in their hearts

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,300
by keeping things like them as pets.

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
What a lonely person.

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,200
I wonder if there are people who aren't lonely?

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I wonder if that's the reason why reptiles are popular now?

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Well, I don't really like reptiles.

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,600
But it's not that I don't understand how people that raise them feel.

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,300
Everyone is free to keep what they want.

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,400
But to dispose of the animal is too irresponsible.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,500
That's right.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,300
Yeah, letting an animal that doesn't originally exist in Japan go free,

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,500
could throw the original ecosystem off balance.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,900
So it is an unforgivable action.

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Isn't it good that there's more of these animals?

67
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,900
No, that's not the point.

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,000
But we can't just leave the alligator snapping turtle here!

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,300
Let's go and track down the person

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
who disposed of such an dangerous animal!

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
-Yeah. -That's right.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,700
It's the mission of the Youth Detective Squad!

73
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,400
But how?

74
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,600
Always fighting for justice, the Youth Detective Squad.

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Huh?

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Let's do this, then.

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,900
I'm sure we'll be able to track down the owner,

78
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,400
if we check the pet shops one after the other.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Since the alligator snapping turtle have a big appetite,

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
the owner must've frequently go to the pet shop

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
to buy feed such as little fish or crawfish.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,900
Did I hit the bull's eye?

83
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,200
I see. Let's do that.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
You're smart.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
What's the matter, Conan?

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,700
You're the one who got rid of the alligator snapping turtle, right?

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
I finally have a boyfriend.

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,600
But...

89
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,900
He didn't like reptiles, right?

90
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,200
Yes.

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,100
After that, things just got complicated.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,000
But it's good

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,900
that you found someone to fill the empty space in your heart, isn't it?

94
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,700
But no matter what the reason,

95
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,200
disposing of an animal is...

96
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Huh? Haibara?

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,100
I just remembered that there's something I have to do, so count me out.

98
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,600
Where is it?

99
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
-It got away! -No doubt about it.

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,100
He's my pet turtle, Kamejiro.

101
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Are you the owner of that alligator snapping turtle?

102
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,700
Excuse me.

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,400
My name is Nihonmatsu.

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,100
I live in an apartment on 3-chome.

105
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,500
Yesterday, when I took my eyes off him for a moment, he fled.

106
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,300
I had no idea he would come this far.

107
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,800
Please catch him as soon as possible

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
and return him back to me.

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Just what is that man talking about?

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,700
That turtle is mine.

111
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,100
A turtle with more than one owner.

112
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,200
Very interesting.

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Hey, hey.

114
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,500
Is that turtle really yours?

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000
I couldn't possibly made a mistake.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
After all, it's such a rare turtle.

117
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,800
But it's strange.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,700
That lady over there is saying that she left the turtle here yesterday.

119
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
Huh?

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,900
I didn't think the real owner would appear.

121
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,500
Why'd you say it was your turtle?

122
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Well, you see, the reason is...

123
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,300
I want to atone my wrongdoings.

124
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Atone your wrongdoings?

125
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,800
I bought a red-eared slider at a fair when I was a child.

126
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,700
But I gradually got tired of taking care of it everyday.

127
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I eventually disposed of it in a nearby swamp.

128
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
But I regretted what I did all these years.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,200
And when I heard that a alligator snapping turtle was found by this lake,

130
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
I was sure that someone left it.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,600
The turtle isn't to blame, so I felt sorry for it.

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,300
That's why I was thinking of taking the turtle home with me and keep it.

133
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,900
I want to make up for abandoning my red-eared slider away in the past.

134
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
Is that right?

135
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
Such a good person.

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,000
Please give your turtle to me, Ms. Kimata.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
I will take good care of it.

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Please consider it.

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,200
Of course. I'd like you to do just that.

140
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Please keep it for me.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you.

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Of course. Of course.

143
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
How lucky, Mr. Nihonmatsu.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,300
There couldn't have been a happier ending for the turtle, too.

145
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
It really found the best possible owner. Right, Conan?

146
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
Well, yeah...

147
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,700
-Maybe they... -Maybe they...

148
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I'm sorry, excuse me.

149
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,000
You got the turtle!

150
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
No, that's not it.

151
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,200
Look.

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,500
There are...

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Alligator snapping turtle?

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,300
There's one on this side, too!

155
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,600
There's another one on this side, too!

156
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,400
Which means there are...

157
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,300
Four in total?

158
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,200
What's with this lake?

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Mr. Nihonmatsu, which one is your turtle?

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Well...

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
It's okay.

162
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,900
Let me take all the alligator snapping turtles in this lake home with me.

163
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,000
All of them?

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
What?

165
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,500
Well, all the turtles have been abandoned.

166
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I feel sorry for them.

167
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
Mr. Nihonmatsu.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,900
You're really a kind person, aren't you?

169
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,100
There's no need to cry.

170
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
Huh? That finger.

171
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,100
What happened?

172
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Well, this really is nothing.

173
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
All right!

174
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,200
Caught the first one!

175
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,800
Be careful. That's how they are.

176
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,200
He bites at you suddenly like that.

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,900
How scary.

178
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,300
But the more you look at it, the cuter it looks.

179
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,000
I love turtles after all.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,700
That's probably because you used to keep a red-eared slider before.

181
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
Yeah, that's probably why.

182
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,800
That turtle was cute and beautiful, too.

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,500
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

184
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
This man...

185
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
What?

186
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
You mean, that man?

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
What about him that you can't believe, Conan?

188
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
Everything.

189
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,100
For example, the red-eared slider

190
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,800
has a vivid green shell only when it's young.

191
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
The shell gets darker as it grows.

192
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
It was beautiful, too.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
The shell would get greener and more vivid as it grows.

194
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
It's just not possible.

195
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,000
If he really kept a turtle, that's something he should know.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Which means that he lied?

197
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,000
He lied about throwing the turtle away in the swamp, too?

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,100
That's right.

199
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,200
The story about him wanting to make up to the turtle is a lie, too.

200
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,500
I may as well add

201
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,200
that he doesn't think turtles are cute at all.

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
On the other hand, it seems as if he has a grudge against turtles.

203
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
That's how they are.

204
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,200
He bites at you suddenly like that.

205
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,800
Everything's a lie.

206
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,300
Then why does he want to take all of the turtles with him?

207
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,800
Is he going to be taken to the castle under the sea for having saved them?

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Hey, hey.

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,900
I got it.

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,800
I know what Mr. Nihonmatsu is up to.

211
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,100
I'll unmask his real character.

212
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,200
Mitsuhiko!

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Genta, will you keep an eye on that man?

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,500
-Conan! -Conan!

215
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,100
What kind of person he is?

216
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
He doesn't seem like a bad person,

217
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,900
but debt collectors come to see him everyday and he hasn't pay his rent.

218
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,000
As far as I'm concerned, he's a troublesome tenant.

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,300
He seems to be having financial problems.

220
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
It's hard to think he has enough money to keep those turtles.

221
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,100
A lot of money will be needed.

222
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Maybe he don't intend to keep, but to sell them off and make money?

223
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,900
No, the normal range for the turtle is 4,000 yen to 8,000 yen each.

224
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,200
Even if he sell all four turtles, he wouldn't be able to pay rent.

225
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,100
It's not to sell them, then.

226
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,200
He must have a different reason for wanting to have them.

227
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,300
We've caught the second one!

228
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,800
But if you plan on keeping all four,

229
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,200
what about an aquarium for them?

230
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,700
That's right. I'll have to get one ready right away.

231
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,000
Please contact me after you have caught all four of them.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll come back again.

233
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,200
So far everything is going well.

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
But I thought there was going to be only one turtle.

235
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,100
Turns out that there's four of them.

236
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,800
He's sighing.

237
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,900
It seems like he only wanted one alligator snapping turtle of the four.

238
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,600
But he doesn't seem to know which turtle is the one he wants.

239
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,500
That's why he had no choice but to take all of the turtles.

240
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,100
He just wants one turtle out of the four?

241
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm sure that there's something special

242
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,900
about that one turtle that he wants.

243
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
I know.

244
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
It's one million yen including the interest and all, right?

245
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
I've already got the money.

246
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

247
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,800
One million?

248
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,500
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

249
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,300
I hope you know what's going to happen if you don't keep your word.

250
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,400
I wish they would catch the turtles quick.

251
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600
What did he mean by that just now?

252
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,100
I guess it means that he'll be able to pay his debts back

253
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,900
if he gets the alligator snapping turtle that he's after.

254
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,000
How does that turtle connect with one million yen?

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
I got it!

256
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Maybe there's some kind of map on the shell of the turtle?

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,100
Like the place that gold and diamonds are hidden?

258
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Hey, Genta.

259
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,700
Who, when and for what reason would someone draw a map like that?

260
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,800
Well, you see...

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Let me help you, granny.

262
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,900
Genta ran off just in the nick of time.

263
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,700
We've caught the third one!

264
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,800
Just one more to go.

265
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Alligator snapping turtle and one million yen...

266
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,400
What is it?

267
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,700
Maybe this is...

268
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Remember what Officer Takagi was saying this morning?

269
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
The robber last night had gloves and a mask on.

270
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,700
I'll go look for Officer Takagi!

271
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,600
-Ayumi! -It's not confirmed that these are the robber's, though.

272
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,800
But as far as the time is concerned, it matches.

273
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,400
Although it rained a bit last night, this isn't wet.

274
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,100
Which means that these were burnt after it stopped raining.

275
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,700
That's between late last night to early this morning.

276
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
I see.

277
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,400
That means, it's possible that these belong to the robber last night?

278
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,100
After stealing three million yen from a certain house,

279
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
he ran in here.

280
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,300
And he got rid of the things he used.

281
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,600
Maybe the two cases are connected in some way.

282
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,200
The two cases?

283
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,100
Last night's robbery

284
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,500
and Mr. Nihonmatsu wanting to get hold of the turtles in the lake.

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,700
-What? -What?

286
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,850
What?

287
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,550
Are you saying that the man called Nihonmatsu

288
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,650
is the one who robbed the house last night?

289
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,250
Yeah. You said that the robber was tall and skinny, right?

290
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
Well, I did.

291
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,350
He's tall and skinny, too.

292
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,150
Besides, he said...

293
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,250
I'll be able to give you back the money either today or tomorrow.

294
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,850
Furthermore, there's a bandage around his finger.

295
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,350
He probably wounded his finger

296
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,250
when he tried to get rid of the evidence here.

297
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,250
That's how they are.

298
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,750
He bites at you suddenly like that.

299
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,750
I think he was bitten by the alligator snapping turtle.

300
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,850
But there's one thing that I still can't figure out.

301
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,850
I get it.

302
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,750
You can't figure out why he wants to take the turtles home with him, right?

303
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,650
-I've figured it out! -What?

304
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:58,050
Listen. Last night, he stole the money and fled here.

305
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,450
He took off his mask

306
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,050
and gloves

307
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,350
because he wanted to burn the evidence here.

308
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,650
But just then...

309
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,850
The alligator snapping turtle that bit his finger saw his face.

310
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,250
But it turned out that there were four alligator snapping turtles here.

311
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,750
He couldn't tell which turtle saw him, so he...

312
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,450
Conan, if he's the robber,

313
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,850
he should already have gotten hold of the three million yen.

314
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,850
Yet, why is it that he still can't pay back his debts?

315
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,750
Yeah, that's the question.

316
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,850
This is the fourth and last one!

317
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,350
Hey, wait for me!

318
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,050
You want to find the guy from this morning who told us about the turtles?

319
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,650
He didn't say his name but he sounded young.

320
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,250
It's probably him.

321
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,750
He asked the City Hall to do it since he couldn't catch the turtle himself.

322
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,550
But why does he need the alligator snapping turtle so badly?

323
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,950
I've already got the money.

324
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,450
It's just that I can't get a hold of it yet.

325
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,650
So why can't he get a hold of the money?

326
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,450
Last night, one of these turtles bit that person's finger.

327
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,950
But that doesn't explain everything.

328
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,250
It's so big! Anything would fit into it.

329
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,150
Be careful, Shu. It's dangerous!

330
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,250
Come on, let's go home.

331
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,350
Could it be that...

332
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,350
But it's not impossible.

333
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,150
Hey, I think you should check these alligator snapping turtles right away.

334
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,450
What would we be looking for?

335
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,950
Just as I thought.

336
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,150
What? You won't let me have them?

337
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,850
No, that's not it.

338
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,550
It'll take a week for the papers to process.

339
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,950
That long?

340
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,050
I have to wait for a week?

341
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,050
What a bummer.

342
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,050
That's right.

343
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,550
He's started moving.

344
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,150
Let's see...

345
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm sure it was 304, 304.

346
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,250
Here it is.

347
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
What's wrong?

348
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,550
That's weird.

349
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,650
No use to keep trying.

350
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,550
You want to pay a one week rental fee, right?

351
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Because if you leave it inside for more than three days,

352
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,150
the management will deem that something is wrong and retrieve it.

353
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,950
No, well, that's...

354
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,650
Unfortunately, coin lockers are made

355
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,450
so that unless you insert the key, you can't insert money.

356
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,050
That's right.

357
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,650
I'm going to open that locker.

358
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,150
The police?

359
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,450
Mr. Nihonmatsu, can you explain why the money's here?

360
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,850
Darn it.

361
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,550
Since you were in debt and troubled,

362
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,650
you broke into the Fukurokouji residence last night

363
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,850
and succeeded in getting away with three million yen, right?

364
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,750
But putting the money in the locker was a mistake.

365
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,150
I thought I was lucky back then.

366
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,950
I am exhausted...

367
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,150
Are you okay, mister?

368
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,650
Let's find a place to rest before we continue.

369
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,050
No, I can't afford being questioned.

370
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,050
Are you all right?

371
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,950
Talk about lucky!

372
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,150
Oh, no. I've got to hide this, too.

373
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,650
Minami, Megumi...

374
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,850
But I was out of 100 yen coins.

375
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,550
You got rid of the evidence in the empty park

376
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,450
and you planned to come back here in the morning to retrieve the money.

377
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,850
So you thought everything worked out fine.

378
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,850
But just then, something unexpected happened.

379
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,650
No way!

380
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,450
Why did you do that?

381
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,850
Hey, spit it out.

382
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,750
Spit that key out!

383
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,550
Why you...

384
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,150
No.

385
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,850
So that's what happened.

386
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,850
The turtle swallowed his precious key.

387
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,050
I couldn't believe such a thing was possible,

388
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,550
but these are the results of the X-Ray.

389
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,550
Then he reported the turtle to the police

390
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,850
and decided to have them catch it for him.

391
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,250
He did that so he could get the key out of the turtle's stomach.

392
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,150
But why'd he have to do something so troublesome?

393
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,850
All he had to do was go to the management

394
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,150
and have them open the locker for him, right?

395
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,650
No way!

396
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,450
He could have them open it if he did so,

397
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,550
but they'd check to make sure the stuff in the locker belonged to him.

398
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,150
If they find three million yen in the bag,

399
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,950
they'd be able to link it to the robbery from last night.

400
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,250
I see.

401
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,750
That's why he had no choice but to get hold of the turtles.

402
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,650
-He's running away! -He's running away!

403
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,150
I won't let you get away!

404
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,650
Take that!

405
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,450
Gosh.

406
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,150
I tell you.

407
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,750
You shouldn't dispose something that dangerous in the lake of a park.

408
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,150
Absolutely.

409
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,950
But you have no right to criticize the person who did that.

410
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,850
You broke into a person's house last night and stole three million yen.

411
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,150
I'm arresting you as a suspect.

412
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,450
That's good, isn't it?

413
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,950
All four turtles have found someone to keep them.

414
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,350
Although they are dangerous creatures,

415
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,050
it'd be pretty cruel to abandon them.

416
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,950
Hey!

417
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,050
Big news!

418
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,250
This time, they're saying that a crane appeared up ahead!

419
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,150
And it's not just one crane!

420
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,150
-Let's go! -Hey, we'll be late!

421
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,350
After turtles, now it's cranes.

422
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,650
That's just great.

423
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,150
"Next Episode"

424
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,850
Thief Kid!

425
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,550
There are five members from the Riot Task Force below the window.

426
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,750
It's difficult to break in from here.

427
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,750
A blackout!

428
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,350
Look! The painting's gone!

429
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,450
Right. It disappeared as if it were an illusion.

430
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,950
I'll rip off your snobbish mask today for sure, Thief Kid!

431
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,050
Next Conan, "Thief Kid and the Four Masterpieces (Part 1)"

432
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,450
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,350
"An illustration of the warning letter"

434
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,650
That thieving Thief Kid makes a showy appearance in April,

435
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,350
the start of the new semester.

436
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,050
How devilishly thrilling.
