1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.640
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.240
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.140
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.840
Today, the case is solved. A most unexpected killer,

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.740
unexpected motive and unexpected trick.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.099
We took a summer trip and arrived at Hotel Arimori,

10
00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.099
located in the mountains of Nagano.

11
00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.799
We ran into business man Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto

12
00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.999
and his wife, actress Chizuru Bizen there.

13
00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.499
The following day, Ran, Mr. Arimori

14
00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.299
and Shinobu went to the highlands;

15
00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.899
While Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe

16
00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.399
went out fishing to the lake.

17
00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.299
Night falls, and since Chizuru had not come out of her room at all,

18
00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.899
we went to her room to check on her.

19
00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.099
Chizuru didn't commit suicide!

20
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.499
She was killed by someone!

21
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:43.099
"The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 2)"

22
00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.599
"8 pm, at the highlands"

23
00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.799
Mr. Arimori...

24
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.599
-Where are you? -Mr. Arimori!

25
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.099
Over here!

26
00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.199
I was absorbed in watching the stars,

27
00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.599
since they're so beautiful.

28
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.899
Come on, Mr. Arimori.

29
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.699
Hello? Oh, Minaho.

30
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.199
What?

31
00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.299
All right, okay, I'll head back right away.

32
00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.699
What's up?

33
00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.499
Chizuru passed away.

34
00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.699
What?

35
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.099
I'll just leave the van here. Let's hurry back to the hotel.

36
00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.199
Okay!

37
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.799
"8:20 pm, at the hotel"

38
00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.099
The victim is Chizuru Bizen, an actress, 30 years old.

39
00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.799
She was staying at this hotel together

40
00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.999
with her husband Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto.

41
00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.799
And what is the estimated time of death?

42
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.199
The estimated time of death is between 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.

43
00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.999
The cause of death seems to be

44
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.999
suffocation by strangulation of the neck.

45
00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.899
You said that when the corpse was found,

46
00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:51.599
the door was locked using the door guard?

47
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.899
Yes, and we had no choice but to break the door open.

48
00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.799
The window was also locked from the inside,

49
00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.899
so I'm sure it was suicide.

50
00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:06.199
But, isn't Chizuru Bizen a famous actress?

51
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.399
Did she have any reason for committing suicide?

52
00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.599
Well, to tell you the truth, there was some hassle last night.

53
00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.899
A hassle?

54
00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.199
She was laid off from the part in a movie

55
00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.099
that she was supposed to star in.

56
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.799
She seemed to be really shocked.

57
00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.699
I see.

58
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.699
Hey, you!

59
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.799
You can't go in there, sonny!

60
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.399
But...

61
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.599
That kid again!

62
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.899
You just keep still, understand?

63
00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.799
But there are strange scratches here.

64
00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.499
What? Scratches?

65
00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.299
That's the part that the metal part of the door guard used to be.

66
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:45.099
There are strange scratches on the metal on the floor part too.

67
00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.199
These scratches could've been made

68
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.199
when someone tried to create a locked room from the outside.

69
00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.499
What? What do you mean?

70
00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.299
In other words, after the killer locked the window,

71
00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.999
he probably used the screw driver

72
00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.999
to remove the door guard from the wall.

73
00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.599
Then he went out to the corridor from the door,

74
00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.699
which after he hooked the metal part of the door guard on,

75
00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.399
inserted his hand through the space between the door

76
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.999
and put the screw back on.

77
00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.099
But since trying to screw the screw back on

78
00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.499
from such a narrow space was too difficult,

79
00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.599
the killer inadvertently left scratches in the vicinity.

80
00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.799
The metal part probably fell off in one blow at the door

81
00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:23.199
because the screw wasn't screwed on tightly enough.

82
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.699
Officer, Chizuru moved this table from the window

83
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.299
and climbed on it, right?

84
00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:31.199
Yeah, that's right.

85
00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.099
Then...

86
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.699
Don't bother the officer!

87
00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.699
Are there foot prints on the soles of the legs too?

88
00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.999
What? Of course!

89
00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.799
Why don't you check your feet...

90
00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:45.499
Wait! Chizuru had no shoes...

91
00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.699
Barefoot!

92
00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.199
Were Chizuru's footprints on the table?

93
00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.399
No!

94
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.299
What? Which means that...

95
00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:59.799
Someone carried Chizuru up and hung her.

96
00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.799
Which means that this is homicide, not suicide.

97
00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:06.599
Last night, Chizuru was arguing with someone in the restaurant.

98
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.299
Gosh. If only I had confirmed who it was back then...

99
00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.899
I wonder if there is no other evidence.

100
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.399
What's this?

101
00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.899
There's some white and powdery.

102
00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:23.899
This room sure is hot.

103
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.599
The air conditioner!

104
00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.799
It wasn't running since we found the corpse.

105
00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:33.499
Did the killer turn it off?

106
00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.399
I would like to ask you a few questions

107
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.899
about the victim, Chizuru Bizen.

108
00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:46.699
First of all, Mr. Shiromoto.

109
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.299
Yes.

110
00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:50.299
We hear you were on bad terms

111
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.099
regarding a divorce that was pending.

112
00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.899
Well, the alimony she demanded was such a huge sum, so...

113
00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.299
I see.

114
00:06:58.299 --> 00:06:59.799
Next, Mr. Miyabe.

115
00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.699
I hear you wanted her to drop the star role

116
00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.899
she was originally supposed to play.

117
00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.099
I'm not the one who dropped her.

118
00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.399
I had no choice because that's what the sponsor wanted.

119
00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.099
I see.

120
00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.899
Now, I'd like to ask all of you.

121
00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.499
It is estimated that Chizuru died

122
00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.099
between the hours of 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.

123
00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.599
I would like to know what you were doing during that time.

124
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.399
Just what do you mean?

125
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.299
It's as if you're checking on our alibis.

126
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:27.599
Don't tell me that Chizuru was...

127
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.399
Judging from the circumstances at the scene,

128
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:32.399
it is highly probable that this is a homicide case.

129
00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.999
-What? -No way!

130
00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.799
I hear that both Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe

131
00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:39.499
went to the lake together to go fishing.

132
00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:41.799
Yes...

133
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:43.999
I left the hotel at 10 am in the morning

134
00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:46.399
and was at the lake right through until we returned at 7 pm.

135
00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.599
You too, Mr. Shiromoto?

136
00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.999
No, I forgot my lunch

137
00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.899
so I went back to the hotel once around 12:30 noon.

138
00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:55.899
I had lunch with Mr. Mouri

139
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.599
and left the hotel at 1:30 pm.

140
00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:01.599
Did you see Chizuru then?

141
00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:05.599
I went to check on her as soon as I got back to the hotel,

142
00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:07.299
but since she didn't answer the door when I knocked,

143
00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:10.099
so I returned to the lobby.

144
00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:12.699
Which means that Mr. Miyabe, you were all alone

145
00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.799
while Mr. Shiromoto was back here at the hotel?

146
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:17.799
Yes, of course.

147
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:20.799
I was eating lunch at the lakeside.

148
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:23.699
How about you two? Mr. Arimori and Shinobu?

149
00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:26.599
We went with Conan and Ran

150
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:28.399
to the highlands at the top of the mountain.

151
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:32.399
We left right after Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe left,

152
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:35.099
and arrived at the highlands around 11 am.

153
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.199
We were there all through

154
00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:40.299
and started down at around 6 pm.

155
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.999
We got back to the hotel around 7 pm.

156
00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:46.099
I hear only you, Mr. Arimori, remained at the highlands?

157
00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:49.799
The engine of my van wasn't functioning too well.

158
00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.099
When you went to pick him up, was Mr. Arimori there?

159
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.499
Of course.

160
00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:57.999
I was with her, so there's no doubt about it.

161
00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:00.299
How about you two, Minaho and Honami?

162
00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:03.599
We were cleaning the hotel in the morning.

163
00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:05.999
Since Mr. Shiromoto came back

164
00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.299
and started eating lunch with Mr. Mouri,

165
00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:09.799
we served them tea

166
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.799
and went to have lunch in the office.

167
00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:16.299
After seeing Mr. Shiromoto off at 1:30 pm,

168
00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:19.699
we watched TV till 4 pm.

169
00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:22.399
After that, we were in the kitchen

170
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:24.899
making preparations for dinner until everyone returned.

171
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.099
When you did the cleaning,

172
00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.699
what did you do about Chizuru's room?

173
00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:32.099
The manager had told us not to disturb her, so...

174
00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:34.499
We didn't go near her room.

175
00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:36.799
Were you at the hotel right through, Mr. Mouri?

176
00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:40.499
Yes, I was watching TV in the lobby right through.

177
00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:44.699
After Mr. Shiromoto went to check on her at around 12:30 noon,

178
00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:47.399
nobody used the stairs by the lobby.

179
00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.399
Which means,

180
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:52.199
the killer must've entered the hotel from the emergency exit.

181
00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:54.699
Please describe the emergency exit.

182
00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:57.899
There are emergency exits at the end of the corridor on every floor.

183
00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:59.399
The doors are auto-lockable,

184
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.299
but can be opened freely from the inside.

185
00:10:02.299 --> 00:10:03.299
In order to come in from outside,

186
00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:05.999
you need to use the master key to open the door.

187
00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:09.899
Which means the killer as a personnel of the hotel!

188
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:13.899
No, because I had the master key with me.

189
00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.699
They probably had made a spare key beforehand.

190
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:18.199
If so, the killers are...

191
00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.999
-those two! -Huh?

192
00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:22.699
We haven't done anything...

193
00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:27.599
Those two were watching TV with me from 1:30 pm to 4 pm.

194
00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:30.099
If so, then all three of you are in this together.

195
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:32.199
Don't be ridiculous!

196
00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:37.199
Either I, who couldn't get a hold of the master key, am not the killer.

197
00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:39.299
No. There is a way to come in

198
00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:41.799
through the emergency exit even without the master key.

199
00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:44.099
No. There is a way to come in

200
00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:46.499
through the emergency exit even without the master key.

201
00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:47.999
What?

202
00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:51.399
For instance, Mr. Shiromoto,

203
00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.599
when you went to check on Chizuru at 12:30 pm,

204
00:10:54.599 --> 00:10:57.599
the door can be opened from the inside.

205
00:10:57.599 --> 00:10:59.199
Then stick a pebble or something between the door

206
00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:01.399
so that it won't close completely.

207
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:05.199
After making it look like you returned to the lakeside,

208
00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.299
you actually entered the hotel from the emergency exit

209
00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.299
and killed Chizuru.

210
00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:11.599
No!

211
00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:13.699
He's pretty good.

212
00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:14.799
As for Miyabe,

213
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.399
if Mr. Shiromoto were his accomplice,

214
00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.699
carrying out the murder would've been possible.

215
00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:20.399
What a thing to say, officer!

216
00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:23.499
If you returned to the hotel hidden in Mr. Shiromoto's car

217
00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:27.499
and went into the hotel from the door that he had left opened...

218
00:11:27.499 --> 00:11:29.299
That is enough!

219
00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:32.699
You're treating us as if we were the killers.

220
00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:34.799
Well, I don't mean...

221
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.299
What about you people?

222
00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:38.899
Just what do you mean?

223
00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.399
There is a possibility

224
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.999
that you people have spares to the master keys.

225
00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:44.699
You could've secretly come down from the mountain.

226
00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:47.099
Please don't say such silly things!

227
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:48.799
In order to return to this hotel

228
00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:51.199
from the highlands and the lake,

229
00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:53.499
it is necessary to cross the bridge over the Tani River,

230
00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:55.399
that is under construction.

231
00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:58.099
I confirmed with the workers there a while ago,

232
00:11:58.099 --> 00:12:00.599
and was told that the only car that crossed that bridge

233
00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:03.499
in the afternoon was Mr. Shiromoto's car.

234
00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:04.599
In other words,

235
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.499
the people who were capable of committing the crime are...

236
00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:08.199
Mr. Shiromoto,

237
00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:09.799
Mr. Miyabe,

238
00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:12.599
Minaho and Honami,

239
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:13.799
and you, Mr. Mouri.

240
00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:16.599
Me too?

241
00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:18.999
It's exactly as Officer Mito says,

242
00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.499
but something's not right.

243
00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:23.699
For instance...

244
00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:25.199
The air conditioner that wasn't running.

245
00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:29.299
The white powder that was on Chizuru's skirt.

246
00:12:30.199 --> 00:12:32.099
What on earth was it?

247
00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:35.299
I see! Maybe...

248
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:43.799
This is similar to a runway.

249
00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:51.399
What's that?

250
00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:53.399
It looks like a mark that was made by rope rubbing against the wall.

251
00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.999
Officer.

252
00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.799
Mr. Mouri told me to ask...

253
00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:15.299
What?

254
00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:17.199
So, I'd like you all, Mr. Shiromoto,

255
00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:21.199
Mr. Miyabe, Minaho, Honami, and Mr. Mouri

256
00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:22.799
to come to the station with me for more detailed questioning.

257
00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.199
Just who do you think I am anyway?

258
00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:29.699
Sleep is overtaking me.

259
00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:33.499
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:13:33.499 --> 00:13:37.499
Please wait! It's the beginning of the Sleeping Kogoro!

261
00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:41.899
What? So this is the rumored...

262
00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:44.399
Please leave the rest up to me.

263
00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.799
You mean you know who the killer is?

264
00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:49.199
Yes. I know who the killer is,

265
00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:51.699
as well as the trick that was used.

266
00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:52.899
The trick?

267
00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.699
The killer has wings.

268
00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:59.899
Magic wings which makes what seems to be impossible...

269
00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:02.299
possible!

270
00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.599
Yes, the killer is...

271
00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:05.799
you!

272
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:13.188
Yes, the killer is you,

273
00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:14.988
Mr. Mitsuhiko Arimori!

274
00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:17.488
What?

275
00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:22.288
What are you talking about?

276
00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:24.088
I was with Ran and the others

277
00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:25.888
up in the highlands right through, you know?

278
00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:29.988
That's right! Mr. Arimori could never be the killer!

279
00:14:29.988 --> 00:14:31.888
That's why I just said

280
00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:34.988
that Mr. Arimori has magic wings.

281
00:14:34.988 --> 00:14:37.488
What do you mean by magic wings?

282
00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:45.388
What was that?

283
00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:48.288
That's the magic wings.

284
00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:52.988
This was in the store room on the roof.

285
00:14:54.688 --> 00:14:56.288
It's a hang-glider.

286
00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:57.288
What?

287
00:14:57.288 --> 00:15:01.388
And there were marks of the wall of the roof being rubbed

288
00:15:01.388 --> 00:15:04.988
against by a rope or something right above the victim's room.

289
00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:09.188
I see! Mr. Arimori used that hand-glider

290
00:15:09.188 --> 00:15:10.988
and flew from the highlands to the hotel,

291
00:15:10.988 --> 00:15:13.488
then landed on the roof.

292
00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:16.288
He went down to the veranda of Chizuru's room using a rope.

293
00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:17.788
After killing her,

294
00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:20.988
he flew back to the highlands with his hand glider.

295
00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.888
That's impossible.

296
00:15:24.888 --> 00:15:27.288
The only time I was away from everybody

297
00:15:27.288 --> 00:15:28.688
is when I went back to the car to get the lunches,

298
00:15:28.688 --> 00:15:29.988
which took me only 4 to 5 minutes.

299
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:31.688
It would take at least 15 minutes

300
00:15:31.688 --> 00:15:33.888
only to set the hand-glider up too.

301
00:15:33.888 --> 00:15:36.488
Besides, judging from the direction of the wind and the height,

302
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:38.188
I think it'd be impossible to go

303
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:40.188
from the hotel back to the highlands.

304
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:43.888
-Mr. Mouri. -It is indeed as you all say.

305
00:15:43.888 --> 00:15:47.288
But if only to strangle Chizuru,

306
00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:49.288
4 to 5 minutes would be enough,

307
00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:51.788
if she were near him!

308
00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:53.788
-What? -What are you talking about?

309
00:15:53.788 --> 00:15:55.388
Chizuru was back at the hotel.

310
00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:58.088
I get it! The van!

311
00:15:58.088 --> 00:15:59.788
Right.

312
00:15:59.788 --> 00:16:01.688
Before leaving, Mr. Arimori said

313
00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:03.088
he was going to check if the doors were locked

314
00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.388
and let Shinobu and the others go on ahead of him.

315
00:16:06.388 --> 00:16:08.688
He then went over to Chizuru's room,

316
00:16:08.688 --> 00:16:11.088
passed her out with a stun gun or something,

317
00:16:11.088 --> 00:16:14.088
loaded her into the car with the hand-glider

318
00:16:14.088 --> 00:16:15.888
and headed off for the highlands.

319
00:16:16.588 --> 00:16:19.088
Officer Mito. When you went to check the room,

320
00:16:19.088 --> 00:16:22.488
did you realize that the air conditioner wasn't running?

321
00:16:22.488 --> 00:16:25.088
Yes. What you're saying is that

322
00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:28.588
Chizuru was not in her room since before noon?

323
00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:30.288
Exactly.

324
00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:32.488
And at about 2 pm,

325
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:34.088
after telling everybody that he was going to get the lunches,

326
00:16:34.088 --> 00:16:37.388
he left them,

327
00:16:37.388 --> 00:16:41.188
hung Chizuru, who was passed out in the van,

328
00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:43.988
with a rope and killed her.

329
00:16:43.988 --> 00:16:46.688
He stayed back at the highlands alone

330
00:16:46.688 --> 00:16:49.188
saying that his van wasn't functioning right.

331
00:16:49.188 --> 00:16:51.988
He then assembled the hand-glider,

332
00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:53.888
carried Chizuru on his back

333
00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.088
and flew off the highlands.

334
00:16:57.288 --> 00:17:01.188
The roof is brightly lit so...

335
00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:04.388
I don't think he had any problem getting to his destination.

336
00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:06.588
After you landed on the roof,

337
00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:08.388
you went down using a rope,

338
00:17:08.388 --> 00:17:10.188
into the room from the window

339
00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:12.188
that you had left opened beforehand

340
00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:14.388
and hung the corpse.

341
00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:17.688
After rigging the door guard and closing the door,

342
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:20.088
you left the hotel from the emergency exit.

343
00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:22.188
Ridiculous!

344
00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:25.188
So, how did I get back to the highlands after that?

345
00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:28.188
Right! When Ran and I got to the highlands,

346
00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:30.488
Mr. Arimori was there!

347
00:17:30.488 --> 00:17:32.488
Maybe he used a motorbike or something?

348
00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:35.088
The workers at the bridge would see him, wouldn't they?

349
00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:37.288
If he were to have flown off from this hotel

350
00:17:37.288 --> 00:17:38.988
which is at a low position,

351
00:17:38.988 --> 00:17:40.088
it wouldn't been impossible for him

352
00:17:40.088 --> 00:17:41.488
to get back to the top of the mountain!

353
00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:45.388
That's why I've been telling you, Mr. Arimori used magic.

354
00:17:45.388 --> 00:17:47.888
Magic that would enable him to get back to the highlands

355
00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:49.288
without anyone noticing him.

356
00:17:49.288 --> 00:17:51.688
Not your incomprehensible remark again.

357
00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:54.688
The seed of magic is your car, Shinobu.

358
00:17:54.688 --> 00:17:55.688
What?

359
00:17:55.688 --> 00:17:58.988
Mr. Arimori who asked you to come

360
00:17:58.988 --> 00:18:01.488
to the highlands for him on his cell phone,

361
00:18:01.488 --> 00:18:04.788
hid in the trunk of your car.

362
00:18:04.788 --> 00:18:06.088
No way!

363
00:18:06.088 --> 00:18:08.788
Without realizing it, you were used

364
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:11.088
as a means of transportation for Mr. Arimori.

365
00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:13.688
When the car arrived in the highlands,

366
00:18:13.688 --> 00:18:17.188
Mr. Arimori waited for Shinobu and Ran to walk away from the car

367
00:18:17.188 --> 00:18:18.688
and snuck out of the trunk.

368
00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:20.688
Then he appeared before the two ladies

369
00:18:20.688 --> 00:18:23.188
as if he had always been there.

370
00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:25.888
Mr. Arimori.

371
00:18:25.888 --> 00:18:28.688
That's... that's no more than plain assumption!

372
00:18:28.688 --> 00:18:30.688
Do you have any proof?

373
00:18:32.188 --> 00:18:33.888
Yes.

374
00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:36.188
Yes, that's right.

375
00:18:36.188 --> 00:18:37.788
All right.

376
00:18:37.788 --> 00:18:40.488
Mr. Mouri, the inspection officers have informed us

377
00:18:40.488 --> 00:18:42.788
the powder that was on the victim's skirt

378
00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.688
was the scale of the Miyama White Butterfly.

379
00:18:45.988 --> 00:18:48.188
So, there it is.

380
00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:49.688
It has been verified that

381
00:18:49.688 --> 00:18:51.388
the scales of the Miyama White Butterfly

382
00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:54.088
that exits only in the vicinity of the top of the mountains,

383
00:18:54.088 --> 00:18:56.388
was found on the skirt of the victim,

384
00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:58.188
who had not set a foot out of her room.

385
00:18:58.188 --> 00:19:00.088
According to Ran,

386
00:19:00.088 --> 00:19:05.188
the butterfly stopped on Mr. Arimori's shoulder and died, right?

387
00:19:05.188 --> 00:19:08.088
The scales probably rubbed off on his shirt at that time.

388
00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:10.788
Unaware, the scale rubbed off on Chizuru's skirt

389
00:19:10.788 --> 00:19:13.188
when he carried her on his shoulder.

390
00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:16.288
Why did you kill her?

391
00:19:18.188 --> 00:19:21.188
To avenge my brother's death.

392
00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:22.388
What?

393
00:19:22.388 --> 00:19:23.488
Revenge?

394
00:19:23.488 --> 00:19:25.288
When my younger brother Teruhiko

395
00:19:25.288 --> 00:19:27.688
was going to a university in Tokyo,

396
00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:30.588
he met Chizuru who was just starting her career as an actress.

397
00:19:31.888 --> 00:19:36.588
Teruhiko instantly fell in love with beautiful Chizuru.

398
00:19:36.588 --> 00:19:39.488
To Chizuru, it may just have been a playful love affair.

399
00:19:39.488 --> 00:19:43.888
Rather, she was after his money to begin with.

400
00:19:43.888 --> 00:19:47.188
She needed a huge amount of cash to get herself started.

401
00:19:47.188 --> 00:19:48.988
Having acted in a drama,

402
00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:51.388
she eventually started becoming popular.

403
00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:53.288
That's when she started staying away from Teruhiko.

404
00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:59.788
In order to keep Chizuru from parting from him any further,

405
00:19:59.788 --> 00:20:02.688
he began spending more and more money on her.

406
00:20:02.688 --> 00:20:04.188
He even went as far as to use this hotel,

407
00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:05.788
that was the estate our father left us as collateral

408
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.588
for a mortgage without telling me.

409
00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:10.688
What? Which means that this hotel is...

410
00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:12.988
Someone else owns it now.

411
00:20:12.988 --> 00:20:16.588
I'm working here as manager thanks to the owner's kindness.

412
00:20:16.588 --> 00:20:18.988
And what is your brother doing now?

413
00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.188
Teruhiko who was crushed with grief,

414
00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:24.788
recklessly maneuvered the hand-glider and...

415
00:20:28.588 --> 00:20:32.788
My younger brother got too close to the sun named Chizuru,

416
00:20:32.788 --> 00:20:34.988
burned his wings and fell to his death.

417
00:20:34.988 --> 00:20:36.788
He is the wretched Icarus.

418
00:20:36.788 --> 00:20:39.788
You did it because of a grudge you had against her?

419
00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:44.188
I invited Chizuru out to the restaurant last night.

420
00:20:44.188 --> 00:20:48.288
I just wanted her to say one word of apology to my brother.

421
00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:49.588
However...

422
00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:53.788
I don't remember a thing. What's with this picture?

423
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:55.788
How should I know who he is?

424
00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:59.888
I am your ex-boyfriend, Teruhiko Arimori's older brother.

425
00:20:59.888 --> 00:21:00.888
What?

426
00:21:00.888 --> 00:21:03.688
My brother died in grief.

427
00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:06.688
What are you getting at?

428
00:21:06.688 --> 00:21:09.988
I went with him only because he was really persistent!

429
00:21:09.988 --> 00:21:12.388
He fell in love of his own choice

430
00:21:12.388 --> 00:21:14.088
and died of his own choice!

431
00:21:14.088 --> 00:21:16.588
It is not my intention to blame you for anything at this point.

432
00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:18.888
My only wish is that you visit my brother's grave

433
00:21:18.888 --> 00:21:21.088
and say a word of apology to him!

434
00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:22.788
Cut it out, won't you?

435
00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:25.688
What on earth did I do anyway? I have nothing to do with it!

436
00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:31.188
That is when...

437
00:21:31.188 --> 00:21:34.288
I decided to kill Chizuru.

438
00:21:34.288 --> 00:21:38.388
I wonder if your younger brother is happy about this?

439
00:21:38.388 --> 00:21:41.888
Butterflies are said to be the soul of the dead.

440
00:21:41.888 --> 00:21:43.488
To me, it looks as though

441
00:21:43.488 --> 00:21:48.988
your younger brother's soul tried to stop you

442
00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:52.988
and stopped to rest on your shoulder.

443
00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:27.388
Dad sure is late.

444
00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:30.688
I wonder where he's buying the stuff.

445
00:23:30.688 --> 00:23:32.388
Over there.

446
00:23:32.388 --> 00:23:36.188
Hey, girlie! Let's have tea together!

447
00:23:36.188 --> 00:23:39.388
Hey, there cutie-pie!

448
00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:45.688
Dad!

449
00:23:54.388 --> 00:23:57.388
This Icarus sure is helpless.

450
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:01.788
"Next Episode" -The officer who was run over by the truck

451
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:03.288
repeated that name over and over

452
00:24:03.288 --> 00:24:04.888
towards the person that fled from the scene.

453
00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:06.288
Because of this mysterious name,

454
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:08.188
this case was named "The Shushiro case".

455
00:24:09.188 --> 00:24:11.988
An all out investigation network that saw no precedent was set up.

456
00:24:11.988 --> 00:24:13.688
However, since the officer who was thought

457
00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:15.688
to have the key to the case passed away,

458
00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:17.488
the case remained stagnant

459
00:24:17.488 --> 00:24:19.888
and expired 3 years ago.

460
00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:24.688
Next Conan,

461
00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:28.509
"Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 1)"

462
00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:31.506
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:33.506
"Station name board"

464
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:34.906
The stage for the next episode is the Metropolitan Police Station.

465
00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:37.206
Hey, I wonder how Officer Takagi and Officer Sato is getting along?

466
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:38.306
Beats me.
