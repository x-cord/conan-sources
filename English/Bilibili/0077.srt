1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,770
A racing second hand,
a glittering shooting star!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,480
Conan's logic is good medicine for
hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,890
Today's stage is a giant mansion!
My rival Heiji also plays a big role!

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,220
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,350
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,140
His name?

7
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,779
"The Case of the Eminent Family's
Strange Deaths, Part 1."

8
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:44,299
What an elegant mansion!

9
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,759
I'd expect nothing less from
the head of the Nagato Group,

10
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,769
which stands equal with Sonoko's family!

11
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:53,259
Oh, you know Miss Sonoko?

12
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,189
She visited a few times
when she was a little girl.

13
00:01:57,589 --> 00:02:00,149
"Miss" doesn't quite fit her, though.

14
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,049
Why does someone that
important want to see you?!

15
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,549
He personally asked for
the great Mori Kogoro!

16
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:10,789
He wants me to solve a big case!

17
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,249
Or make sure his wife isn't cheating.

18
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,289
What was that?!

19
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,459
Are you all right?!

20
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,549
What are these holes around the pond?

21
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,629
We plan to plant new trees
here by the week's end...

22
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,839
Pardon my lateness,
but I am Take Kuranosuke,

23
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:33,599
the family's butler for
the last two generations.

24
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,019
Wow! The inside is amazing, too!

25
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,159
The master waits on the third floor.

26
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,319
There sure are lots of guards...

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,459
Naturally. It's a big case.

28
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:53,119
Oh? Haven't I seen him before?

29
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,499
Huh?! Find your first love?!

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,589
Me?! The great Mori Kogoro?!

31
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:04,469
Yes.

32
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:08,169
My old friend assured me you could...
Nagato Dosan (60) President of Nagato Group

33
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,429
...find her with lightning speed!

34
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:17,089
But you didn't need to bring
me here just to ask that...

35
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,899
Too bad it wasn't a big case, huh?!

36
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,339
Do you have any photos of this woman?

37
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,209
No. We met during grade school.

38
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,329
I don't even remember her face...

39
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,799
But lately, for some reason,
I'm reminded of how lovely she was...

40
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,799
My late wife may not be
happy to hear that, though...

41
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,129
I have no photographs,

42
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:49,089
but I do know her name
and her later whereabouts!

43
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:50,259
Tell them, Hyuga-kun.

44
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,269
Hyuga Miyuki (26) Mr. Nagato's Secretary
Certainly.

45
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,169
Hyuga Miyuki (26) Mr. Nagato's Secretary

46
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,089
Her name is Akagi Kotomi,
from Kanagawa Prefecture.
Hyuga Miyuki (26) Mr. Nagato's Secretary

47
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:56,379
Her name is Akagi Kotomi,
from Kanagawa Prefecture.

48
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,379
After graduation,
she married at age 29.

49
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,209
She and husband Yamato
Kohei had one child,

50
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,379
but all three suddenly
disappeared five years later.

51
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,449
You sure they didn't flee by night?

52
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,149
Unthinkable!

53
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:12,419
Who's this old friend who
recommended me, anyway?!

54
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,949
That would be me.

55
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,649
And you are?

56
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,909
He's the old friend I mentioned!

57
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,879
Osaka's Chief of Police,
Hattori Heizo-kun!

58
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,669
Osaka's Chief of Police?!

59
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,259
The one who's always on TV whenever
something happens in Osaka?!

60
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,339
I thought he looked familiar...

61
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,919
Wait! Does that mean...?

62
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,599
Heya, Kudo! How ya been?!

63
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,289
Hattori Heiji?!

64
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,309
Kudo?

65
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,689
What? They still don't know?

66
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,569
Of course not, you moron!

67
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,029
By "Kudo," do you mean...?

68
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:53,989
I said "Kuro"! As in
"thanks for your hard work"!

69
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,809
Oh, you have company, Father?

70
00:04:58,809 --> 00:04:59,089
Nagato Nobuko (39), Eldest Daughter
Nagato Yasue (32), Second Daughter
Oh, you have company, Father?

71
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,379
Nagato Nobuko (39), Eldest Daughter
Nagato Yasue (32), Second Daughter

72
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,919
Oh, it's not just guests.
Nagato Nobuko (39), Eldest Daughter
Nagato Yasue (32), Second Daughter

73
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,879
A vixen is here, as well.

74
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,959
I'm told you've been
staying here recently.

75
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,959
What scheme are you cooking up?

76
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,339
Come, now...

77
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,919
Now, now, Nobuko!
I am unable to move!

78
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,129
I need her to send notes to the office...

79
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,919
A fax machine could do that!

80
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,809
But it's not that simple...

81
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,709
Who are these gentlemen?

82
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,729
Detectives.

83
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,289
Detectives?!

84
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,209
Why are detectives here?

85
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:35,199
He called them here to ask
them to find his first--

86
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,179
Nobody asked you!

87
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:40,039
Hey, now...

88
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,459
You still have that filthy pen?

89
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,839
I don't care if it's your
dad's keepsake! It's creepy!

90
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,089
Better watch out, or she'll
steal your Mitsuaki-san, too!

91
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,139
Sister!

92
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,299
Such rudeness!

93
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,009
I apologize, Hyuga-kun.

94
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:07,549
She's simply upset that
she hasn't found a man yet...

95
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,439
Yes, I know.

96
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,989
I doubt she'll ever find one...

97
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,759
Well, I should return to the office.

98
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,799
Oh, Hyuga-kun. I'd like to
make the announcement tonight,

99
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,329
so if you do pity my son...

100
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,289
I don't pity him at all!
This is our fate!

101
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,759
A "bond of flames" has connected
us for a long time now...

102
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:34,219
"Bond of flames"?

103
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,929
You two were in the same kendo club?

104
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:47,399
Yes, Nagato-san used to
beat me down like a demon!

105
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,629
Incidentally, Heizo. About the matter...

106
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,199
Yes. I had the guards
double-check, but...

107
00:06:58,259 --> 00:06:59,289
Who're you?!

108
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:01,869
My son, Hideomi.

109
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,049
His face was burned

110
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,009
Nagato Hideomi (36) Eldest Son & Novelist
in an accident long ago.

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,039
Ever since, he's...
Nagato Hideomi (36) Eldest Son & Novelist

112
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,339
I think modern plastic
surgery could fix most of it,

113
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,509
but he's against the idea.

114
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,509
Yeah, it's a happy ending,
all thanks to the accident.

115
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,469
Right, Hideomi?

116
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:27,899
Hey! Hideomi! Wait!
What're you so mad for?

117
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,669
I wish you a happy birthday, Father!

118
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:37,319
Thank you!

119
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:44,119
I'd appreciate it if you'd give me
the title of president in return...

120
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,989
I'm just kidding!

121
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,789
I must be getting back to Osaka...

122
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,159
Oh? You're not going to
celebrate with us tonight?

123
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,759
There's also the matter at hand...

124
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,219
It's alright. I'll be leaving
him in my place.

125
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:06,199
He's still green,
but he's got good intuition.

126
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,689
I'm sure he'll be of
use to Detective Mori!

127
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,239
Use?

128
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,539
Happy birthday, Father!

129
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,489
Happy birthday, Sir!

130
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,489
I'd like to use this opportunity
to make an announcement.

131
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:31,459
My son Hideomi and Hyuga Miyuki-san
are engaged to be married!

132
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,609
Wow!

133
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:34,819
Is this true, Sir?

134
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:41,429
Yes. I've been having her stay here
so she would grow used to the house!

135
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,489
Oh, so that's why!

136
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,739
Oh? Where is Nobuko-ojousama going?

137
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,699
Don't mind her!

138
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:53,659
She's just the only single person left!

139
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:57,699
Say, I don't see Hideomi...

140
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,239
He's probably embarrassed.
I'll go get him.

141
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,649
Okay, Hattori! Out with it!

142
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,469
Out with what?

143
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,999
The real reason you brought us here!

144
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:20,919
It's not like that!
I just wanted to see ya!

145
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,429
Liar...

146
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,279
Just kidding! The truth is--

147
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:29,849
Hello?

148
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:33,059
This is Mitsuaki.
Could you put my father on?!

149
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:39,479
He's asleep at the moment.
We're just about to leave...

150
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,449
I can't find Hideomi anywhere!

151
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,109
Where the heck did he--

152
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,569
Mitsuaki-sama!

153
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,029
What's going on?! Where are you?!

154
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,609
Right below you!

155
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:55,739
Someone cut the
lights and attacked me with--

156
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,129
Hey! Are you all right?!

157
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,319
Mitsuaki-san!
What's going on?! Mitsuaki-san!

158
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,259
Hideomi-san!

159
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,769
We gotta stop him!

160
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:19,489
No... why would he...

161
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,609
Damn! It's locked from the inside!

162
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,319
I'll get the master key!

163
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,069
Quickly!

164
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:27,529
Yes!

165
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:30,109
I'll check around
outside with the guards!

166
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,999
Mitsuaki-san!
What's going on?! Mitsuaki-san!

167
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,709
Detective! Here's the key!

168
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:45,089
It's empty!

169
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,089
The outside!

170
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,989
Damn! He used a rope to escape!

171
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:52,059
But where's Mitsuaki-san?!

172
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,019
He's there. Down below.

173
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:08,481
So, he fell onto the fence...

174
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:13,611
Is it true that the killer is
Mr. Nagato's son, Hideomi-san?

175
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:15,071
No!

176
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:21,041
Hideomi-san didn't do it!
There must be some reason...

177
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,561
He's still a murderer,
whatever the reason!

178
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,841
Give my Mitsuaki-san back...

179
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:31,651
But Hideomi-san would never do this...

180
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,051
Besides, we don't know
he's the person we saw!

181
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,101
Eh?!

182
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,361
She's right.

183
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,511
We only saw someone
with bandages on their face.

184
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:41,831
Bandages?

185
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,981
Yes.

186
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,941
Hideomi-san had burn
scars all over his face...

187
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,651
We saw the killer
shortly after 10:00 pm,

188
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:53,281
when everyone happened
to be in the third-story bedroom.

189
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:54,901
"Everyone" being...?

190
00:11:54,901 --> 00:12:03,981
Me, Heiji, Ran, Conan, Take-san
the butler, and Yasue-san.

191
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:06,751
What did you do when they left?

192
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:09,211
I stayed in the room
with the president.

193
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:17,131
To think the killer prepared
that grappling hook to escape...

194
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:21,061
There's no question
that the killer used it.

195
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:25,521
It was still swaying when
we checked around outside.

196
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:28,021
And where's Hideomi-san?

197
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:31,111
He's nowhere to be seen...

198
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:34,991
We looked for him while
the police were on their way.

199
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,901
So, Hideomi-san is clearly the killer.

200
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:39,451
That can't be!

201
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:45,441
At any rate, we've found the
killer's weapon, hat, and bandages.

202
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:46,881
Analysis should prove--

203
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:48,421
Say!

204
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:54,341
What's this on his right hand?
It's like he was stabbed by something.

205
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:03,261
It's probably from the
knife or the fence he fell on!

206
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,641
Inspector!

207
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,521
What is it, Takagi-kun?!

208
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:13,691
The exterior security cameras show
nobody leaving after the murder!

209
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,651
So, the killer's...

210
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,561
...still in the mansion!

211
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:19,081
Oh, no!

212
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:19,781
Hey!
Oh, no!

213
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,201
The president!

214
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,861
What?! He's...

215
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,651
Damn! It's locked!

216
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,841
Hey! Anyone in there?!

217
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,251
What's all the ruckus?!

218
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,761
What's with you all?

219
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,521
What are you doing here?

220
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:44,181
I came to see what all
the noise was about.

221
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:47,481
Where were you before then?

222
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:51,731
I was irritated, so I
had a drink in my room.

223
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,901
Alone?

224
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:57,191
Yes. While complaining
to a friend on the phone.

225
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:00,811
It must be the alcohol,
but I can't recall who it was.

226
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:04,811
Anyway, is it true that
Hideomi killed Mitsuaki-san?

227
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,651
Yes, most likely...

228
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:10,211
Yeah, I figured he would eventually...

229
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:16,811
Those two would fight every
time they saw each other.

230
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:20,861
They seemed to be
friends since childhood,

231
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,841
but they were like cat
and dog after the incident...

232
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,301
Incident?

233
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:30,271
Yes. There was a big fire
at a nearby inn twenty years ago.

234
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:35,651
Hideomi and Mitsuaki-san,
high-schoolers at the time, passed by it.

235
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:41,811
Mitsuaki-san tried to stop him,
but Hideomi plunged into the flames

236
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:44,311
and rescued a little girl...

237
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:48,661
Hyuga Miyuki, to be precise!

238
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:52,581
Ah, hence the "bond of flames."

239
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,541
Hideomi's face was burned as a result.

240
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:59,691
After that, he quit school,
shut himself in his room,

241
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,361
and pretended to write novels.

242
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,691
No women got near him, of course.

243
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,861
She used that to make a pass at him,

244
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:11,811
get recommended as Father's secretary,

245
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,101
and even marry into the family!

246
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:16,311
That's enough, Nobuko.

247
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:20,521
Oh, you're awake?

248
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:24,441
Yes, ever since everyone
left the room in an uproar,

249
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,781
though things have been fuzzy...

250
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,241
Did anything strange
happen afterward?!

251
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:36,171
Nothing at all. Hyuga-kun stayed
with me until Ran-san arrived.

252
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:41,131
But this is no time to look
for your first love now...

253
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,091
No, it isn't. Please forget about that.

254
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:55,061
Tell me already!
Why'd you bring me here!

255
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,651
Ah, that?

256
00:15:56,651 --> 00:16:01,531
Actually, the president said he
heard strange sounds last night.

257
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:02,991
Strange sounds?

258
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:03,941
Yeah.

259
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:07,561
Someone sprinting through
the hall in the middle of the night,

260
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:11,611
and something hitting
something else, lots of times!

261
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,451
Could it have been...?

262
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,651
Yeah! Someone inside the house

263
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:19,961
was doing something
for tonight's murder!

264
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:25,441
Me and my old man figured it was
a burglar scoping the place out,

265
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,891
so we brought in security and called you.

266
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,651
We thought he'd show up again tonight,

267
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,351
but it was a life that was taken!

268
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,811
A premeditated murder...

269
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,521
But doesn't it seem strange?

270
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:44,441
That Mori Kogoro guy you
made famous was here.

271
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:48,951
The killer musta been really
confident with his plan.

272
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:52,911
Or he couldn't change his plan.

273
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:58,191
What bothers me are the killer's
items that were lying by the body.

274
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:04,551
There was no need to drop the hat
or bandages, never mind the weapon!

275
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:09,811
And the way the killer purposely
showed his face to us...

276
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,801
Almost as if to frame Hideomi-san...

277
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:18,731
The only one who coulda done that
is Nobuko-san, who left beforehand!

278
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:26,031
We then searched every nook
and cranny of the mansion,

279
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,741
but Hideomi-san was nowhere to be found.

280
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:34,701
We were all about to give
up two evenings later, when...

281
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,521
Can't find him anywhere, Inspector.

282
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,811
What?!

283
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,171
It's my fault Hideomi never married?!

284
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:46,191
So, are you saying
he held back for me?!

285
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:50,471
No, I just meant that he
thought highly of you...

286
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,931
Miyuki-san! Wait!

287
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:58,891
Please stop! That pond is deep!

288
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:03,861
But that pen is my father's
keepsake! Without it, I...

289
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,101
Drain the water, quickly!

290
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,401
Yes! Right away!

291
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,361
This is one filthy pond...

292
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:18,291
Madam kept carp in it,
but once she passed away...

293
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:35,471
Why?! Why did this have to happen?!

294
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,611
Brother! Hideo-oniisama!

295
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,481
What is his estimated time of death?

296
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,941
He's been dead for
approximately 1.5 to 2 days.

297
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:49,731
Mitsuaki-san was
pushed off the veranda

298
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:53,411
at 10:00 the night before last,
44 hours ago.

299
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:57,651
If Hideomi-san drowned himself
in this pond before we arrived,

300
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:02,121
everything would fit.

301
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:05,561
However, he didn't drown to death.

302
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,111
We can't be sure until the autopsy,

303
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:11,811
but he likely ingested poison
before entering the pond.

304
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:19,181
The body didn't float up because
of these rocks in his clothes.

305
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:24,481
So, Hideomi-san carried the rocks
into the pond and poisoned himself?!

306
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:28,151
He probably didn't want
anyone to see him dead.

307
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:32,441
Still, as hostile as Hideomi-san and
Mitsuaki-san were with each other,

308
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:34,611
murder is a bit much...

309
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:41,081
It's possible. Hideomi-sama and
Yasue-ojousama were very close,

310
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:48,791
so he was vehemently against
her marriage with Mitsuaki-sama.

311
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:53,311
So, he couldn't stomach the
idea of losing his dear little sister

312
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,361
to his bad friend...

313
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,721
Foolish child...

314
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,981
Inspector Megure! Here's the lab report!

315
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:00,861
Read it.

316
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:01,561
Right.

317
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:06,271
"The marks on the knife match
the wounds on Mitsuaki-san's arm,

318
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,021
and the blood on the
knife matches his, as well.

319
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:16,991
The hair follicles in the hat and
bandages belong to Hideomi-san."

320
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:20,271
That reminds me, there was
a meter-long grappling hook

321
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,451
in Mitsuaki-san's jacket pocket...

322
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,151
A grappling hook?!

323
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:27,291
Was the cut on his right
hand from the knife, too?

324
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,211
No, it was different...

325
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:33,211
What about the blood type
of the saliva on the knife?!

326
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,681
There wasn't any.
Seems it was wiped off...

327
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,431
Inspector! I found this
paper in his pocket!

328
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:47,191
"I'm not fit to marry you...

329
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:51,651
I choose death to atone
for the sin I committed."

330
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:56,111
This is his will! Miyuki-san!
It's addressed to you!

331
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,771
Is it Hideomi-san's handwriting?

332
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,941
Yes, it looks like it...

333
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:05,771
I'll get some of his
writings from his room...

334
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,581
Miyuki-san! Here's
the pen you dropped in...

335
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:13,741
Wait--

336
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,441
Let her be.

337
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,801
I'll give it to her later.

338
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:25,721
Hideomi-san...

339
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:30,191
This pen's really been burnt...

340
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:31,651
How odd...

341
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,731
Yeah. This case is totally weird.

342
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:37,111
Even more unnatural is that will.

343
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:41,191
It said, "The sin I committed."

344
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:45,081
Meaning he wrote it after the murder!

345
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,401
He didn't have time to write a will then!

346
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:53,041
Which means someone
forged it or forced him to write it.

347
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,651
Either way, there's little
doubt that someone drowned him

348
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:59,971
with the will after poisoning him.

349
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:03,441
But the only time
anyone got near the pond

350
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:06,471
was when we all went looking for him!

351
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:11,861
In other words, Hideomi-san had
been murdered before it happened!

352
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:47,331
Hey! Don't tell me
Hideomi-san was actually...

353
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,881
Yeah, right! His estimated
time of death was...

354
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:55,580
So, there was a way, after all!

355
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,666
Say, Hattori...

356
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:02,170
Have you ever killed someone?

357
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,676
What the...?!

358
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,731
On the next Conan:

359
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:09,732
On the next Conan:
The Case of the Eminent Family's
Strange Deaths, Part 2.

360
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:12,923
The Case of the Eminent Family's
Strange Deaths, Part 2.
