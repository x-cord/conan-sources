1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.540
The answerphone that bring about mystery after mystery.

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.540
A feeling of something not being right is wiped out all together!

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.567
Pops! Pops!

9
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:47.367
Shut up. Let me sleep in peace, will you?

10
00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:49.467
Pops!

11
00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.867
Come on, today's Sunday, isn't it?

12
00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.467
You've got a guest!

13
00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.167
Good morning.

14
00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:57.967
Huh?

15
00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:59.567
Officer Chiba?

16
00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.667
What's this?

17
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.567
What do you want this early on a Sunday morning?

18
00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:06.767
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:11.867
Well... so like I was saying, Inspector Megure...

20
00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:14.867
Conan? Why are you here?

21
00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:22.467
"Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme"

22
00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.267
The cause is death by suffocation.

23
00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:29.567
The estimated time of death is between 7pm to 9pm last night.

24
00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.767
There are no signs of any struggle here,

25
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.867
so the victim must've been killed somewhere else

26
00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:38.267
then brought here to North Beika Park and abandoned.

27
00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:39.667
Is something bothering you?

28
00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.967
Well, I'm not sure why I was summoned here.

29
00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:44.567
What're you talking about?

30
00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:46.167
Isn't he an acquaintance of yours?

31
00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:50.967
We found this in the victim's pocket. See!

32
00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.567
My name card. Why is it here?

33
00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:56.967
Likewise, from the driver's license the victim had on him,

34
00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:59.667
the victim is Yuichi Kusaka, 26 years old,

35
00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.867
a resident of Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture.

36
00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.867
Well? Mr. Mouri?

37
00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:07.167
But...

38
00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:09.567
I remember him!

39
00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.067
What? Conan?

40
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.867
Sticking your nose into the case again.

41
00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:16.967
Well, well, now, Mr. Mouri.

42
00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:18.567
Conan? Tell us.

43
00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:22.067
He's the one that came together

44
00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.067
with novelist Mr. Ryutaro Tsukigata before.

45
00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.667
Tsukigata?

46
00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.167
Tsukigata.

47
00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:37.967
Right, he's one of the two disciples that was there back then!

48
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:42.767
He's the famous samurai novelist

49
00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:45.567
that is good at writing about Ninja stuff?

50
00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:48.667
Yes, 6 months ago, he came to visit me

51
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.467
saying he wanted to challenge writing detective stories too,

52
00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:54.167
and suddenly came to interview me.

53
00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:58.867
So, at that time you also gave Mr. Kusaka your name card?

54
00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:02.467
He was indeed a salaried worker

55
00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:05.167
who was training to become a professional novelist,

56
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.067
and because he was just about to come to Tokyo,

57
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.967
he said he brought him along to experience interviewing.

58
00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.067
What about the other one?

59
00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:14.567
What? What do you mean?

60
00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.567
Mr. Saruhashi!

61
00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:19.067
Oh, Saruhashi.

62
00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:21.567
His name is Masaru Saruhashi,

63
00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:24.967
and he was saying that he lived in Beika-cho just like Mr. Tsukigata,

64
00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:26.967
so he went through training

65
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.467
by always helping to clear up the manuscripts.

66
00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.567
Okay. First, we'll go see Mr. Tsukigata!

67
00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.067
Yes, sir!

68
00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:35.367
Let's go, Mr. Mouri!

69
00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.767
Oh, yes, sir!

70
00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.967
What? You mean Mr. Kusaka?

71
00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:46.167
So, I think he was on his way here.

72
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.467
I see.

73
00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:51.267
He was supposed to come here yesterday

74
00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:54.567
with the new story he had finished writing.

75
00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:58.367
Did Mr. Kusaka have that manuscript?

76
00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:01.867
No, he didn't have anything on him.

77
00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:06.567
I got a call from Teito Station last night a little after 8pm,

78
00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:09.267
saying that he would come by at 9pm.

79
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.467
Since he didn't come, I was a bit concerned.

80
00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:16.667
Oh, you got a call from Teito Station at about 8pm?

81
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:18.067
Yes.

82
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:22.567
Inspector! The estimated time of death is between 7pm and 9pm.

83
00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:24.967
If he was at Teito Station until past 8pm,

84
00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:28.367
we can narrow down his tracks until the time he was killed.

85
00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:32.567
I got two calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

86
00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:34.567
One was at about noon.

87
00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.967
It was from his residence in Kofu.

88
00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:47.067
He asked me if he could come and have me look over his new novel.

89
00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:50.967
But I had to go out so...

90
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:53.867
I'd be back about 9 at night.

91
00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:57.567
9pm? All right, I'll be there around that time.

92
00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:02.667
And then I got the second call from Teito Station around 8pm.

93
00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:06.167
Since I was out, his message was in my answerphone.

94
00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.167
There is one message.

95
00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:16.167
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

96
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.267
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

97
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:21.167
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

98
00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:23.567
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

99
00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:28.467
Saturday, 8.10pm.

100
00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:30.767
May I listen to it one more time?

101
00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:32.167
Sure.

102
00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:35.767
There is one message.

103
00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:38.867
This is Kusaka. I've arrived at Teito Station.

104
00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:40.967
I'm going to head over to your place from now,

105
00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.867
so I think I can get there by 9pm as I promised.

106
00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:46.067
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!

107
00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:50.167
Saturday, 8.10pm.

108
00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:54.067
At 8.10pm, Mr. Kusaka left from Teito Station

109
00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:55.867
to go to Beika Station.

110
00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.067
There's no doubt about it.

111
00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:00.867
But, there's something

112
00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.767
about this phone call that bothers me.

113
00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:05.267
He left the Teito Station at 8.10pm.

114
00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:06.667
On this train!

115
00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:10.767
Which means it takes approximately 30 minutes to Beika Station so...

116
00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:13.867
He arrives at Beika Station at 8.40pm!

117
00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:19.267
The crime was committed between 8.40pm to 9pm,

118
00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.567
in the vicinity of Beika Station...

119
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.767
I guess this is more or less the picture!

120
00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.767
I've figured out who the killer is!

121
00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:34.367
The killer is the other disciple of Mr. Tsukigata!

122
00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:36.967
You mean Saruhashi?

123
00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:39.967
I hope you have your reasons for saying that.

124
00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:41.367
Of course.

125
00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:45.967
He said that he lives right on the other side of Beika Station,

126
00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:47.767
so he knows his way around here.

127
00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:51.667
And more than anything else, he has a motive!

128
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.067
I just remembered, 6 months ago,

129
00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:57.067
they had a brawl, didn't they?

130
00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:01.367
Are you telling me to quit being Sensei's disciple?

131
00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:06.267
Mr. Saruhashi, you studied under Sensei for many years now.

132
00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:08.867
-Haven't you studied all you have to already? -What?

133
00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:11.067
Come, come now.

134
00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:13.067
Mr. Kusaka, stop it already.

135
00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:16.767
I want to study under you too, Sensei.

136
00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:20.867
But since you can't watch two disciples...

137
00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.667
That's not true, Mr. Kusaka!

138
00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:27.667
You have a stable life of an employee of a company.

139
00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.567
No matter where you live, there's no difference

140
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.167
in the fact that you're my disciple.

141
00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:33.367
Whether we live near you or not,

142
00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.867
it makes a difference in the amount of things we get to learn.

143
00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:39.267
Mr. Saruhashi, please change places with me!

144
00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:41.967
That's for Sensei to decide!

145
00:08:41.967 --> 00:08:44.667
Worried of his position as a disciple

146
00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.767
is indeed a motive for killing, but...

147
00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:50.267
It's too childish of a motive, it's absurd.

148
00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.767
This is Takagi.

149
00:08:55.767 --> 00:08:57.267
Yes.

150
00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:59.767
I see, goodbye.

151
00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:03.167
It's from the forensic officer.

152
00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:07.067
Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints were not found on the lighter in question.

153
00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.867
What's this about a lighter?

154
00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:13.967
It was found on the ground by the corpse, the lighter.

155
00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:19.267
Excuse me.

156
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:23.167
This is the lighter I gave Mr. Saruhashi some time ago!

157
00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:24.867
What?

158
00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:29.367
Now we not only have a motive, but also have material evidence...

159
00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:32.467
No. Saruhashi couldn't have...

160
00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:38.067
Mr. Saruhashi, does this lighter look familiar to you?

161
00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:40.367
It's my lighter.

162
00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.567
Though I lost it some time ago.

163
00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:46.067
Lost it? When? Where?

164
00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:48.767
I don't know.

165
00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:51.467
Please try to remember!

166
00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:53.267
I really don't know.

167
00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:55.367
It was quite some time ago, though.

168
00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:02.567
The key to a coin locker?

169
00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:03.767
Right.

170
00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.367
It's a precious lighter that Sensei gave me as a gift.

171
00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:10.367
I'm sure that Kusaka stole it from me because he was jealous.

172
00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:11.967
Mr. Saruhashi!

173
00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:13.667
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:18.067
Mr. Saruhashi. Where were you last night?

175
00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:19.467
Oh, yes...

176
00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:22.767
I was at a coffee shop in front of the station about 8pm.

177
00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:26.767
I came back here once

178
00:10:26.767 --> 00:10:29.367
and from about 8.30pm, I went to a pub in front of the station.

179
00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:31.867
Are you sure it was from 8.30pm?

180
00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:34.867
Wasn't it a little later, like 9pm?

181
00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.567
Huh?

182
00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:39.367
Mr. Kusaka's estimated time of death

183
00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:42.967
is thought to be between 8.40pm to 9pm.

184
00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:43.967
What?

185
00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:51.767
Mr. Kusaka called Tsukigata Sensei at 8.10pm from Teito Station.

186
00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:58.467
So he arrived here at Beika Station after 8.40pm.

187
00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.367
I went into the pub at 8.30pm!

188
00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:04.867
I'm sure!

189
00:11:04.867 --> 00:11:06.667
Please check on it.

190
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.467
I'm not lying.

191
00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:19.167
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.267
Inspector!

193
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:23.567
As to the coffee shop,

194
00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:26.067
it seems he was there from sundown and left about 8.30pm!

195
00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:28.367
I got his alibi on this side too.

196
00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:32.067
He came at 8.30pm and was drinking until midnight.

197
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.967
Which means that Saruhashi has an alibi!

198
00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:38.567
What's going on?

199
00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.967
The story about the lighter is just a cop out.

200
00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:44.967
If Mr. Kusaka stole it, his fingerprints should be on it!

201
00:11:44.967 --> 00:11:47.167
I'm aware of that.

202
00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:49.967
He's got a motive and there is material evidence.

203
00:11:49.967 --> 00:11:52.467
But he has an alibi.

204
00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:57.067
Please wait.

205
00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.067
It's possible for him to commit the crime!

206
00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:01.967
He left the coffee shop at 8pm.

207
00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:04.267
He came to this pub at 8.30pm.

208
00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:07.867
There're 30 minutes of unaccounted time!

209
00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:11.667
-And? -And he lied about returning to his apartment.

210
00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:15.567
He killed Mr. Kusaka during the 30 minutes!

211
00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:18.067
The scene of the crime is not Beika-cho,

212
00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:20.867
but between Teito Station and Beika Station.

213
00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:23.067
If he uses the 30 minutes that is unaccounted for to the fullest,

214
00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:24.767
he can make it to a station in between.

215
00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:26.167
After committing the murder there,

216
00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:30.667
he can still make it back to Beika Station at 8.30pm.

217
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:34.367
The actual time the murder was committed was not 8.40pm,

218
00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:37.267
but rather, around 8.15pm...

219
00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:39.167
That's not possible, Officer Takagi.

220
00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:40.167
What?

221
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:44.167
Mr. Kusaka left Teito Station at 8.10pm.

222
00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:47.167
5 minutes later, at 8.15pm,

223
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.767
Mr. Kusaka is still way before

224
00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.567
reaching the middle point of both stations.

225
00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:54.667
During the 30 minutes time,

226
00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:55.967
it'd be impossible to commit murder,

227
00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:58.767
much less even make contact with him.

228
00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.067
Impossible.

229
00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.767
That is, unless you use some kind of Ninja technique

230
00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:07.267
that is described in Ryutaro Tsukigata's novel or something...

231
00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:10.567
Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

232
00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:17.667
What kind of Ninja trick did he use?

233
00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:32.689
What kind of trick...

234
00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:35.489
did Mr. Saruhashi use anyway?

235
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:41.989
It's Tsukigata Sensei's new book.

236
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:45.189
Mysterious Centipede Ninja.

237
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:48.189
The enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy.

238
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:50.489
Counter turn after counter turn.

239
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:53.089
Counter turn?

240
00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:54.389
Counter?

241
00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:59.189
I'm not lying.

242
00:13:59.189 --> 00:14:02.989
I got two phone calls from Mr. Kusaka yesterday.

243
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:06.489
This is Kusaka. I arrived in Teito Station just now.

244
00:14:07.989 --> 00:14:12.289
Saturday, 8.10pm.

245
00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:15.989
I see, I get it!

246
00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.689
"Beika Station, West Entrance, 2 Days Later" -If so...

247
00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:21.789
The coin locker

248
00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:24.789
can be used for a period of 3 consecutive days in a row.

249
00:14:24.789 --> 00:14:26.889
0101.

250
00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:28.189
Please be there!

251
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.789
It's there!

252
00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:38.189
So, he's the killer, after all!

253
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:43.989
There're no hints, no matter how much I read this.

254
00:14:46.689 --> 00:14:49.789
What brings you all here?

255
00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.789
What're you talking about?

256
00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:55.689
You're the one that told us to come here, Mr. Mouri!

257
00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:57.589
Me?

258
00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:04.089
I made no such phone call...

259
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:08.989
I did call you indeed.

260
00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:11.889
Of course, I did so to talk to you

261
00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.789
about the homicide case of Mr. Yuichi Kusaka.

262
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.589
Did you figure out the Ninja technique?

263
00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:24.789
Yes, one alibi trick was used in this murder case.

264
00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:26.989
It's a very simple trick,

265
00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:29.389
but it was very difficult to figure it out.

266
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:34.789
Why? Because the one who used the trick was not the killer!

267
00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:38.489
Not the killer? Then, who was it?

268
00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:40.889
When I heard the message on the answerphone,

269
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:43.989
something bothered me.

270
00:15:43.989 --> 00:15:45.889
That was because despite knowing that

271
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:50.089
Tsukigata Sensei was still not home a little after 8pm,

272
00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:52.789
Mr. Kusaka called twice.

273
00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:56.189
Why did he go out of his way to make such a phone call

274
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:58.689
when it really was no big deal?

275
00:15:58.689 --> 00:16:03.489
Saturday, 8.10pm.

276
00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:06.089
Yes, he did it only to make everybody believe

277
00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:08.889
he was at Teito Station at 8.10pm.

278
00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:10.489
To make everyone believe?

279
00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:12.989
Which mean, he was actually not there?

280
00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:15.289
Mr. Mouri, I found it!

281
00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:16.789
Officer Takagi.

282
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:19.989
I found it! The ticket you asked for.

283
00:16:19.989 --> 00:16:21.189
Ticket?

284
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.889
The ticket that was retrieved at Beika Station that day

285
00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:26.389
with Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints on it.

286
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.789
Officer Takagi, what time was it issued?

287
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:32.189
Oh, yes!

288
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:35.089
It was sold at Teito Station... at 7.30pm?

289
00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:36.889
What, 7.30pm?

290
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:39.489
It's not after 8.10pm?

291
00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:40.989
Just as I thought.

292
00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:42.789
He bought the ticket at 7.30pm.

293
00:16:42.789 --> 00:16:45.789
If he boarded the train right away,

294
00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:50.489
he would've reached Beika Station a little after 8pm.

295
00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:52.189
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

296
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:53.589
Officer Chiba?

297
00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:56.489
I asked Officer Chiba to do me a favor too.

298
00:16:56.489 --> 00:16:58.989
I had him go and get the contents in the coin locker,

299
00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:00.889
which pick up date was overdue.

300
00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:06.989
That's Mr. Kusaka's bag.

301
00:17:06.989 --> 00:17:09.589
This is the victim's belongings?

302
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.289
Is it?

303
00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:13.089
Yes.

304
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.489
Please put the contents of the bag on the table.

305
00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:18.189
Oh, yes!

306
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:24.689
Thank you.

307
00:17:24.689 --> 00:17:30.989
Inspector! Please rewind that tape recorder a little.

308
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.189
-Teito. Teito. -Mommy, hurry!

309
00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:41.189
It's dangerous to run, Kenichi!

310
00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:42.289
This is?

311
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:46.089
It's the same as the message that was in the answerphone!

312
00:17:46.089 --> 00:17:47.589
Yes,

313
00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:52.689
Mr. Kusaka who reached Beika Station, used that to make it

314
00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:56.789
seem as if he had reached Beika Station at 8.10pm

315
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:59.289
in order to create his alibi!

316
00:17:59.289 --> 00:18:01.589
The Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

317
00:18:01.589 --> 00:18:04.489
Once the secret is revealed, it is a very simple trick.

318
00:18:04.489 --> 00:18:06.989
The only thing is the one who used this Ninja trick

319
00:18:06.989 --> 00:18:11.289
was not the killer but the victim himself.

320
00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:15.489
What did Mr. Kusaka do something like that for?

321
00:18:15.489 --> 00:18:18.589
In order to kill Mr. Saruhashi!

322
00:18:23.689 --> 00:18:27.289
After the answerphone trick, Mr. Kusaka rushed over

323
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:29.389
to Mr. Saruhashi's apartment.

324
00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:31.689
I guess he told Mr. Saruhashi beforehand,

325
00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:34.789
that he had something important to talk about or something.

326
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:36.689
If Mr. Kusaka were to work out the way he planned,

327
00:18:36.689 --> 00:18:40.289
he was probably going to make an anonymous call to the police

328
00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:42.789
right after killing Mr. Saruhashi.

329
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:46.689
And the time of the crime would be precisely determined

330
00:18:46.689 --> 00:18:50.289
by the police who get there right after the call.

331
00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:55.089
According to his alibi scheme, from between 8.10pm to 8.40pm,

332
00:18:55.089 --> 00:18:57.589
Mr. Kusaka would be riding the train to Beika Station,

333
00:18:57.589 --> 00:19:00.589
so he would be erased from the list of suspects.

334
00:19:00.589 --> 00:19:06.389
All he had to do next was visit Tsukigata's house at 9pm as scheduled.

335
00:19:06.389 --> 00:19:09.589
However, it didn't work out as he planned!

336
00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:12.089
He was counterattacked by Mr. Saruhashi

337
00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:14.989
who he meant to kill.

338
00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:22.889
Dang it!

339
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:30.489
Mr. Saruhashi who counterattacked,

340
00:19:30.489 --> 00:19:33.289
carried Mr. Kusaka's corpse to the park and disposed of it there.

341
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:35.989
Then, just as you already found out from investigations,

342
00:19:35.989 --> 00:19:39.689
he went to the pub at about 8.30pm.

343
00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:44.589
I'm not lying.

344
00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:48.489
Exactly. You weren't lying.

345
00:19:48.489 --> 00:19:50.789
You realized that the police made a mistake

346
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:53.989
and all you did was decide to use this to your advantage.

347
00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:56.189
So, you're the one who killed Mr. Kusaka after all.

348
00:19:56.189 --> 00:19:57.589
I know nothing of that sort!

349
00:19:57.589 --> 00:20:00.089
He didn't come to my apartment!

350
00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:02.689
No, I'm sure he did.

351
00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:04.789
If he had intention to kill,

352
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:07.689
he wouldn't take the tape recorder that he used to create his alibi,

353
00:20:07.689 --> 00:20:09.789
nor his manuscript along with him.

354
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:15.489
So, I figured that he would leave it at the coin locker of Beika Station.

355
00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:19.289
If something is left in that locker for more than 3 days,

356
00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:22.089
the maintenance company opens it with a spare key.

357
00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:23.889
Since today was the 3rd day,

358
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:28.389
I asked Officer Chiba to go get the thing that was in the locker.

359
00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:31.489
Mr. Kusaka's bag, that's over there.

360
00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:35.189
But how did you figure out the number of the locker?

361
00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:37.689
That's the point.

362
00:20:37.689 --> 00:20:39.489
When we went over to Mr. Saruhashi's home,

363
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:43.689
Conan found the key to the locker in Mr. Saruhashi's room.

364
00:20:43.689 --> 00:20:49.189
0101. It's a number easy enough for a child to remember.

365
00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:51.889
You say that Mr. Kusaka didn't come,

366
00:20:51.889 --> 00:20:53.789
but how can a person who didn't come

367
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:56.889
drop the key in your room?

368
00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:58.789
My house...

369
00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:00.789
He did come to my house. But...

370
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:04.089
It's okay already, Mr. Saruhashi.

371
00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:05.989
Sensei...

372
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:13.789
I was afraid of him all this time.

373
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:16.689
Afraid that he would take you away from me.

374
00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:19.089
I'm happy how you feel about me.

375
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:22.289
But whether you succeed as a professional

376
00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:25.989
is how much effort you exert!

377
00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:33.089
I guess both Mr. Kusaka and you forgot what was most important.

378
00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:16.489
I thought this time for sure that our hands were tied.

379
00:23:16.489 --> 00:23:18.289
But, you never let us down, do you, Mr. Mouri?

380
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:21.489
You mean Inspector Shiratori's new unmarked police car?

381
00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:23.889
Oh, come on.

382
00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:26.789
Ninja technique of playing dumb?

383
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:28.689
You got me there.

384
00:23:28.689 --> 00:23:30.989
I can never beat you, Inspector.

385
00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:38.589
The Ninja technique you're really good at is, "all talk", Pops.

386
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:47.389
Then, somebody's just gotta stay at the hospital in his place,

387
00:23:47.389 --> 00:23:48.989
right, Conan?

388
00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:51.789
Okay.

389
00:23:54.589 --> 00:23:56.189
Oh, no.

390
00:24:07.689 --> 00:24:09.189
Next Conan,

391
00:24:09.189 --> 00:24:13.489
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 1)"

392
00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:16.657
Next Conan's Hint:

393
00:24:16.657 --> 00:24:18.457
"Honeybee mark"

394
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:20.657
The next episode is quite surprising!

395
00:24:20.657 --> 00:24:23.503
What a surprise. I spilled my tea.
