1
00:00:00,682 --> 00:00:03,482
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,682
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:07,482
Today's scene of the crime is a condominium.

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:09,582
City crows are happy on trash collection day.

5
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:10,982
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:13,082
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,482
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:59,795
"Investigation Case Of The Missing Murder Weapon"

9
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,995
Isn't there any interesting cases happening?

10
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:10,295
That past one about the stadium was great, wasn't it?

11
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:13,195
Yeah, wish something like that would happen again.

12
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:16,895
It'd be a disaster if a case like that happened all the time.

13
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,195
Hey, hey.

14
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:24,895
I always come to this beauty shop with Mother.

15
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,695
Midori Beauty Salon?

16
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:30,095
The manager's name is "Midori".

17
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,695
And, there's a beautician named, Mika,

18
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,895
who has really good sense.

19
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,195
The appointments are always filled.

20
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,295
Mika, wait a minute!

21
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,295
What is it?

22
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:42,395
What's this all about?

23
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,595
Like I said, I want to go to another shop.

24
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,995
I'll be quitting next week Monday.

25
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:50,895
You can't just do as you please.

26
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:52,395
"Midori Gotoh (39), Manager" -In the first place...

27
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:54,495
-Madam. -What is it?

28
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,795
The customer is waiting.

29
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,395
I'll be right there, so have her wait a little longer.

30
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,795
Yes.

31
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:05,195
Anyway, I won't let you do as you please.

32
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:13,295
Oh, Ayumi.

33
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,695
You're with friends today, aren't you?

34
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,195
Mika, are you quitting?

35
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,095
Another salon has invited me over to work for them.

36
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,695
It's a shock.

37
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:26,595
I wanted to have you cut my hair at least once.

38
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:29,295
Then, shall I do it for you?

39
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:32,495
Your mother always asked for me to do her hair,

40
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:33,995
so this'll be a special service for you.

41
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:35,995
Really?

42
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:40,195
But, my appointments are filled until Monday.

43
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,395
That's right. I'll be starting work late tomorrow,

44
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,195
we can do it at my home.

45
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:47,895
-At your home? -Can we go too?

46
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,195
Sure, all of you can come.

47
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,795
No, I'll pass on this one.

48
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:56,295
Conan, you're coming too, aren't you? Aren't you?

49
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,995
I got it.

50
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,395
"The next day, Saturday"

51
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:03,295
"The next day, Saturday" -I got up at 5am this morning.

52
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,095
I was so happy.

53
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:08,095
Wonder what sort of hairstyle Ayumi is gonna get.

54
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,095
I can't wait to see it.

55
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:12,795
How peaceful...

56
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:16,895
but why do you have to come along too?

57
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:19,495
Oh, what else could there be to observe you,

58
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,095
who's playing the complete role of a child?

59
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,095
Genta, are you all right?

60
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:30,795
Ouch...

61
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,895
Good grief, what're you doing?

62
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,595
Get a hold of yourself.

63
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,895
You see, even the crow is making a fool of you.

64
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,095
No way.

65
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,395
Let's see.

66
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,995
It's that condo.

67
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,795
What am I doing this early in the morning?

68
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,495
Hey, Conan!

69
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,795
What're you daydreaming for?

70
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,095
We're gonna leave you behind!

71
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,395
Oh, sorry...

72
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:07,895
"301, Mitsui"

73
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:09,995
Here it is. This is the room.

74
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:17,095
That's funny, wonder if she forgot her promise.

75
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,295
Maybe she's still sleeping?

76
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,795
That's possible.

77
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,595
She did say that she would be starting work late today.

78
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,395
Huh?

79
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:27,995
The door's not locked.

80
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,395
Careless, isn't it?

81
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,295
Excuse me,

82
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,895
is Mika here?

83
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:39,995
Wonder if she went out?

84
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:43,895
Hey, isn't that Mika sleeping over there?

85
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,495
Hey. Hey, Conan!

86
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,895
Conan...

87
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,695
Mika... what happened?

88
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:07,395
Murdered.

89
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,695
She's been choked by someone.

90
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,995
The victim is the resident of this room,

91
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,295
Miss Mika Mitsui, age 24.

92
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,095
A beautician who works for the Midori Beauty Salon

93
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,295
in the Beika Town arcade.

94
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,195
I see.

95
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,295
Are you finished?

96
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:29,695
Yes, please go ahead, Inspector.

97
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:32,795
Judging from the turbidity of the cornea,

98
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,195
it's been 10 to 13 hours from the time of death.

99
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,295
Cause of death is suffocation.

100
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:41,195
She was choked with something.

101
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,795
Inspector, what's the matter?

102
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:44,695
Look.

103
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,595
Choke-marks on her neck are only on the front.

104
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,795
It's true. I wonder why?

105
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,295
Conan.

106
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,995
You shouldn't be in here.

107
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,695
Rather than that, Inspector,

108
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,595
look, there's something blue

109
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,295
on the middle fingernail of her right hand.

110
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,895
Wonder what it is?

111
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,095
I can't say exactly until it's been analyzed,

112
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,795
but probably, it's a bit of plastic.

113
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,895
Plastic.

114
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,495
Midnight snack in the convenience store shopping bag.

115
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,395
A dress that was just picked up from the cleaners.

116
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:26,495
And, a one-piece dress on the floor

117
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,795
attached with a cleaning tag,

118
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,295
and the plastic bag that's been torn off and thrown away.

119
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,695
Looks like

120
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,695
Mika stopped by the cleaners and the convenient store

121
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,795
before coming home and was killed soon after that.

122
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:42,295
But something...

123
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,395
Something...

124
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:46,095
Something bothers you, doesn't it?

125
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:47,795
Yeah.

126
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,795
Me too, something...

127
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,095
Hey! The two of you!

128
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:55,095
Please, go outside!

129
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,995
This is no place for kids to be wandering around!

130
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,495
But, we're the first ones who found the victim.

131
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,695
I'll listen to the story later.

132
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,495
Please wait in the lobby on the first floor.

133
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:05,795
Yes.

134
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,995
Takagi, call the Midori Beauty Salon

135
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:12,295
and have someone identify the corpse.

136
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:13,795
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,895
Mika... a thing like this has happened to her.

138
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,895
It's shocking.

139
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:25,595
What is that piece of blue plastic?

140
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:28,295
Is it a part of something the murderer owns?

141
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,495
Or, the murder weapon?

142
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,095
If so, what could the weapon be...

143
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,995
It's Mrs. Midori.

144
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:43,895
She's been called by the police to identify the body.

145
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:46,795
Ah?

146
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:49,095
Where's she going?

147
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:54,695
Mrs. Midori!

148
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,295
Ayumi.

149
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:02,795
Mika's condo is over here.

150
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,095
Yes, you're right.

151
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,895
I'm completely shocked.

152
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:15,395
But, Ayumi, why are you here?

153
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:20,195
Mika invited us over today and...

154
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,195
Is that so?

155
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,895
You must've been shocked.

156
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,095
Hey, lady.

157
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,495
What is it?

158
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,995
What happened? That bandage.

159
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,395
Huh?

160
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:40,095
Just a little burn.

161
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,695
I'm really clumsy.

162
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,695
Mika. Why did this happen?

163
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:57,195
Wonder where Midori is going?

164
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,995
She was crying, wasn't she?

165
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,295
Lady, what's the matter?

166
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,795
What were you looking at?

167
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,095
Nothing.

168
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:21,095
I felt sick and thought I'd get some fresh air.

169
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,895
I'm fine now.

170
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,795
What is it? What was she looking at?

171
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,295
Kudo.

172
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,295
Haibara.

173
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:46,295
A minute ago, you said something bothered you, didn't you?

174
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,195
Did you find out something?

175
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:49,995
It's missing.

176
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:53,195
It should have just come back from the cleaners,

177
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,295
-but, that thing... -That thing?

178
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,195
That's right.

179
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:01,395
The piece of plastic that was stuck in the fingernail

180
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,495
is the murder weapon.

181
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,195
Maybe...

182
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,895
If that person is the murderer,

183
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,295
what she was looking at from here was...

184
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,695
Oh, no.

185
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,926
Hey! Wait a minute!

186
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,126
Huh?

187
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,026
What's wrong, kid? Why are you so shook up?

188
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:42,826
Take out all the trash you collected on this street.

189
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,326
There's something important in there, please.

190
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:46,826
Don't be impossible.

191
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,626
Hurry, hurry.

192
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,626
Hold on a minute.

193
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,026
That girl...

194
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,226
Inspector, people who take their trash out at night

195
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:57,426
are a problem, aren't they?

196
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,426
What?

197
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,626
If trash are out at night,

198
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:03,526
people walking pass have the tendency to litter, don't they?

199
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:06,126
Hey, what are you talking about?

200
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,626
If the collectors pick up the trash the next morning,

201
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,626
the proof will be gone.

202
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:14,326
Conan, the Inspector and I are busy now

203
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,426
and we can't be bothered with story about trash.

204
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,526
Wait a minute, Takagi.

205
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:18,926
Excuse me.

206
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,226
Yes.

207
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,526
Has the garbage from that condo been collected yet?

208
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,126
Yes, it has.

209
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:29,026
Because this area and this street are our last pickups.

210
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,626
Is that so?

211
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:35,126
I'm very sorry, but can you unload all the garbage

212
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,126
that you collected from the parking lot of that condo?

213
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,426
What?

214
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,626
Inspector, is something wrong?

215
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,826
Takagi, the murder weapon.

216
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,226
After the crime was committed,

217
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,826
the murderer might have thrown away the weapon in

218
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:48,126
with the trash that was put out on the street.

219
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:50,426
The victim lived alone in the condo.

220
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,126
Chances that the corpse would not be found

221
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:54,326
until the following morning would be great.

222
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:56,826
I see, which means that the trash would already

223
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,226
have been collected by the time the investigation started.

224
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:00,626
Right.

225
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh, but, if we don't know what the weapon is,

226
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:05,426
how can we find it?

227
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,526
That's it.

228
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:10,626
A while ago, I saw some hangers thrown out

229
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:13,026
and I thought it was real wasteful.

230
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:15,926
Hangers?

231
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,326
That's it.

232
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,026
Takagi, I got it.

233
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,626
The murder weapon is a blue plastic hanger.

234
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:24,726
Huh?

235
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,526
Remember, when you send things to the cleaners,

236
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:30,426
they come back on those disposable hangers.

237
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,826
Come to think of it, the dress on the floor,

238
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,126
it didn't have a hanger.

239
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,326
The murderer probably

240
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:40,326
reshaped the hanger on the dress into a ring,

241
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:42,826
dropped it over her head from behind,

242
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:45,626
pulled on it and strangled her.

243
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,426
Right,

244
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,926
that's why there were marks only on the front of the neck.

245
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:54,426
But, why a blue hanger...

246
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,926
Oh...

247
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,026
That's right.

248
00:13:57,026 --> 00:14:00,726
The blue plastic on the victim's fingernail.

249
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:04,826
That was a piece of the hanger roll.

250
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:08,826
The victim tried to escape the hanger that was choking her

251
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,626
and grabbed the hanger like this.

252
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,726
At that time, a piece of the hanger was scratched off

253
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,826
with the fingernail of the middle finger of the right hand.

254
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:17,526
Lady!

255
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:24,426
Lady, did you come to see the rubbish too?

256
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,426
It must really bother you.

257
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,626
You were looking at it from the rooftop a while ago too.

258
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,326
You even tried to come this way

259
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:35,526
when you first arrived at the condo too.

260
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:38,526
No, little boy, what're you talking about?

261
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:43,526
I just wondered why all of you were gathered here.

262
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:48,326
I'm sorry, this is a murder investigation,

263
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:49,826
please cooperate with us.

264
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,626
I understand.

265
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,526
If my intuitions are right,

266
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:01,726
there should be proof of the murderer left on the hanger.

267
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:06,226
Clear, unmovable proof.

268
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:15,226
There's this much.

269
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:18,926
Well, it's all compressed and loaded into collection vehicles.

270
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,726
All right, please divide up and start.

271
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,926
Wonder if they'll really find it.

272
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:44,526
They'll find it. The Inspector seems to have confidence.

273
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,026
Inspector, it wasn't there.

274
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:09,326
We've looked through all of it but...

275
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:12,126
That can't be! Check it better...

276
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,426
Conan.

277
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:16,226
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,126
Why... why wasn't it found?

279
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,926
Inspector, what do you want to do?

280
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:26,726
Anyway, let's help out and clear away the place.

281
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,826
And, politely thank the collectors.

282
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,626
I understand.

283
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:42,526
Ms. Gotoh.

284
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:43,626
Pardon my rudeness, but...

285
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:46,426
Where were you and what were you doing

286
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,826
between 8pm and 11pm last night?

287
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:54,526
Why are you asking me that?

288
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:57,426
Oh, just for the records.

289
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:01,226
Are you saying that I killed Mika?

290
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:05,226
You've got to be joking. Why me?

291
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:09,426
But, you were arguing with Mika yesterday.

292
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,826
Mika said she wanted to change shops

293
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:14,026
and you said you wouldn't let her do as she pleased.

294
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:19,926
I definitely said that, but...

295
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:22,226
Ms. Gotoh, will you please come down to headquarters

296
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,026
and give us the details?

297
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,626
I refuse. I took time off from work to come here.

298
00:17:28,626 --> 00:17:30,526
If you demand that I go,

299
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,726
show me proof that I'm the criminal.

300
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,326
Excuse me.

301
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:39,726
Inspector.

302
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,526
Judging from her reaction, there's no doubt that

303
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:47,026
she threw away the hanger in this garbage.

304
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,426
Then...

305
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:51,426
It's my intuition, but...

306
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:55,126
There's probably no mistake that she's the murderer.

307
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,826
It's just as Inspector Megure says.

308
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,026
Judging from her actions, there's no doubt about it.

309
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:04,926
But, why didn't the hanger come out...

310
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,026
Why...

311
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:11,426
I can't believe Ms. Midori is the murderer.

312
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:15,726
But, Inspector Megure said that there's no doubt about it.

313
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:19,326
Then, I wonder why the hanger wasn't found.

314
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:22,426
Maybe someone picked it up.

315
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,926
You know, sometimes people pick up things that

316
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:27,126
they think are still usable.

317
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:31,226
Yeah, I've picked up a Kamen Yaiba doll before too.

318
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,226
Genta, that's dirty.

319
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:36,226
That's not something to boast about.

320
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,126
Isn't that right, Conan?

321
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:40,926
What's the matter?

322
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:46,226
It's a net to keep the crows out of the trash.

323
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,226
Conan, is something wrong with it?

324
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:54,226
Maybe, it was a crow that went off with the hanger.

325
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,226
Do crows eat hangers?

326
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,626
They use it to build nests.

327
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:02,526
Possible. I saw on television that crows in the city

328
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:05,726
use things like hangers and wire to build their nests.

329
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,826
Then, if we find the nest...

330
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:12,826
Okay. The Youth Detective Squad'll start a crow's nest search!

331
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:38,126
There's a crow's nest?

332
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:41,226
Yes, it's making its nest right now.

333
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,426
Which tree is it?

334
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:46,226
No, it's not in a tree, it's over there.

335
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,826
It's on that light pole.

336
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,826
It's there. A crow's nest.

337
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:05,326
We found it. The blue hanger.

338
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:06,926
Ms. Gotoh.

339
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:09,826
This is the murder weapon, the hanger.

340
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:14,626
The piece of plastic from the victim's fingernail

341
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:17,226
and the scratched portion from this hanger

342
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:18,926
made a perfect match.

343
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,226
Furthermore, there's a little bit of blood

344
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,426
on the tip of this wire.

345
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:26,826
But, it's been confirmed that

346
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,726
it's not the same type blood as the victim.

347
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,326
We think that it got on the hanger

348
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,826
when the murderer was strangling the victim

349
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:37,526
and cut his hand.

350
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:41,326
Ms. Gotoh, can you take off the bandage

351
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:43,626
on the back of your right hand?

352
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,926
That girl...

353
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,526
she threw the hanger at me.

354
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:08,226
I went to ask her not to quit the shop.

355
00:21:09,526 --> 00:21:14,226
Please, if it's about your salary, I'll reconsider it.

356
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:15,926
Let go of me.

357
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:21,126
I'm going to do as I please.

358
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,126
Please go home.

359
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,726
I couldn't forgive her.

360
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,826
Forgetting the gratitude

361
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:33,126
and throwing that hanger at me.

362
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,826
Is that your reason?

363
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:41,126
Did you take a person's life for a worthless reason like that?

364
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:26,026
I'm glad the case is solved but...

365
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,326
I still can't believe it.

366
00:23:28,326 --> 00:23:31,326
They both were so kind to me.

367
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,426
People have different sides to them.

368
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,626
Hey...

369
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:41,426
That crow doesn't it look like he's glaring at us?

370
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:45,526
Maybe, they're mad at us for taking the hanger from the nest?

371
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,426
Which means...

372
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:02,526
We won't be able to come to this park for a while.

373
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:10,526
Conan was here until a minute ago, wasn't he?

374
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,326
Yes...

375
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,626
This is?

376
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,026
Something's happened.

377
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,726
He's either being held captive or,

378
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:27,826
maybe he's already been killed?

379
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:29,526
Next Conan,

380
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:33,347
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 1)"

381
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:36,628
Next Conan Hint:

382
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:38,128
"A chess piece"

383
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,728
The Youth Detective Squad moves into action again.

384
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,128
Starting next week: "Detective Genta"!
