1
00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:02.624
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:04.424
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:05.924
An uninhabited island and the bottom of the sea,

4
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.124
Conan and Heiji's theories explode.

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:01.711
A television program pitting the best detectives from the East and West

9
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:04.411
brings us along with Heiji Hattori here to Okinawa.

10
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.811
We accompany the filming crew to an uninhabited island

11
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.611
where an unidentified body and a mysterious message is found.

12
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:17.411
Then a female member of the film crew, Yoshie Taira,

13
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:21.111
is murdered and a mysterious message is found near her body

14
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:22.811
then the boat we came on

15
00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:25.811
and the captain disappeared.

16
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:34.611
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 2)"

17
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.511
What? An anchor

18
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.711
on the bottom of the sea where Miss Taira was diving?

19
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.011
Are you sure about that?

20
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:44.211
Yeah.

21
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:46.511
The chain was cut and it was rusty

22
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:48.411
but it was a ship's anchor.

23
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:50.811
Maybe it was from that man's ship,

24
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.711
the man who was found dead here a year ago.

25
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.911
Yes, I bet you're right!

26
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.611
He probably got to this island on it

27
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.611
and he decided to wait out the storm in here

28
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.911
but the chain broke and the boat drifted away.

29
00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:03.011
No!

30
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:07.611
There was a lot of mollusks and sea weed on the anchor,

31
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:10.911
it must've been down there for at least four or five years.

32
00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.711
Four or five years.

33
00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:15.311
It's been about that long, right?

34
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.911
Several incidents happened at the mayor's house around that time.

35
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.611
-Yeah. -What do you mean incidents?

36
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.311
"Noburou Ikema (24), Crew" -The first time was five years ago.

37
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.511
The mayor's only daughter,

38
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:29.911
Miss Miyako, was kidnapped.

39
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:34.311
A year later, a gang of robbers broke into the mayor's home,

40
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:37.011
they took a gold screen which was a family heirloom.

41
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.111
According to the mayor and his butler who took the call from the robbers,

42
00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:46.211
the kidnappers and the robbers were the same group.

43
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:49.611
So, what happened to them?

44
00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:54.511
The mayor refused to pay the ranso and the money for the screen

45
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:57.711
so they were never caught, and both Miss Miyako

46
00:03:57.711 --> 00:03:59.911
and the screen were never seen again, or so I've heard.

47
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:03.111
It was a terrible blow to the mayor

48
00:04:03.111 --> 00:04:06.911
his daughter was kidnapped short! After his wife passed away

49
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.811
and one of his maids was killed by the robbers.

50
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:13.111
The butler was so scared, he quit.

51
00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:16.211
People started to bad mouth the mayor

52
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.311
saying he was a heartless money monger

53
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.511
and on top of that, the corpse of a man who starved to death

54
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:23.911
was found on this island the mayor owns,

55
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.111
along with that mysterious message.

56
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:30.011
And now this...

57
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:35.211
I'm beginning to think the "guso's messenger" really exists.

58
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:40.411
Hey listen. The words carved on the pillar

59
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:44.411
didn't they say "The princess lies in A not B",

60
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.511
am I right?

61
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:46.811
You're right.

62
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.711
Don't you think that the princess might mean the mayor's daughter?

63
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.811
Are you saying she's been killed

64
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:57.911
and is buried somewhere on this island?

65
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:58.911
That's right.

66
00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:01.411
She came back as a messenger from the other world

67
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:03.511
and killed Miss Taira.

68
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:10.211
If you're afraid of ghosts, you can use that knife.

69
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:16.311
There's an old legend that women kept a dagger in their mouth

70
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.411
so that that their souls wouldn't be sucked out through their mouth.

71
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.611
And it could be used for self protection.

72
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:30.411
This is very interesting.

73
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:34.411
Take a look at this tea cup!

74
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:37.911
It looks like somebody used it as an ashtray.

75
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:40.811
There are more than one kind of cigarettes

76
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:45.211
and the water on the bottom isn't completely dry yet.

77
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.711
Which means that just before we got to this island,

78
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:53.411
there was another group of people here.

79
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:57.911
That's right, and there wasn't just one or two of them

80
00:05:57.911 --> 00:05:59.811
they killed a woman

81
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:03.311
and now they're hiding somewhere on this island.

82
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:05.811
I'm talking about the messengers of death.

83
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:07.711
Come on, you're kidding, right?

84
00:06:07.711 --> 00:06:09.711
Are you saying there's a group of killers

85
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.611
on this island?

86
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.711
I'm just saying that it's possible.

87
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.911
They could be watching us from somewhere...

88
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:23.811
waiting to steal our souls.

89
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.311
I don't believe it.

90
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.011
Then they might already be inside this house.

91
00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:30.211
That's not possible!

92
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:32.911
We all checked to make sure nobody was inside, right?

93
00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:37.011
But there're a lot of broken windows in this place.

94
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:41.611
It'd have been easy to sneak in while we were busy talking.

95
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.911
Then I think we should split up into groups

96
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:46.611
and search the place one more time.

97
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.411
I agree, it won't help to stay here and panic.

98
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.011
Then Mr. Kume, you and Mr. Ikema and Mr. Daito check the second floor.

99
00:06:56.011 --> 00:06:57.611
Okay.

100
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:00.711
Mr. Taketomi and we will check the first floor.

101
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.411
Yes, alright.

102
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:05.811
I mean, you'd be at a disadvantage if you got attacked

103
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:07.711
since you'd be the only male with two girls to protect.

104
00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:09.911
Huh? You've got to be kidding!

105
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.311
You're the one that they'll be protecting.

106
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.611
No kidding. Really?

107
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:20.111
-Karate? -Yes.

108
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:22.711
I took first place in the city competition

109
00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:24.811
I hold a second rank in aikido.

110
00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:27.211
Impressive, I feel very safe...

111
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:28.711
Yes. Thank you.

112
00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:32.211
If we come across any bad guys, you can ave them to us!

113
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.211
We made the right decision making him join us.

114
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.611
Yeah, he looked the weakest.

115
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.111
Okay, Heiji.

116
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:49.111
This is the last room.

117
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:52.111
Don't keep us in suspense, open it up!

118
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:55.611
Aybe it wasn't a good idea after all...

119
00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:01.911
Is anybody in here?

120
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:03.711
Hey...

121
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:05.411
No body...

122
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:07.211
seems to be inside.

123
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:08.911
I think you're right.

124
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:12.411
This room's not like the others, it's really big.

125
00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:16.711
I think the mayor's wife used this room,

126
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:20.211
see, there's a picture of them together.

127
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:25.111
It's really corroded...

128
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:29.111
Now, look what you did, Heiji.

129
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.211
There's two pictures in here.

130
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:40.511
What is this? There's a picture taken with a young girl.

131
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:44.211
Do you think the mayor was having an affair with her?

132
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.311
No, you're wrong.

133
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:50.711
That's Miss Miyako, the mayor's only daughter.

134
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:53.711
She looked just like her mother, they were both

135
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.911
fair skinned and good natured, everyone liked her

136
00:08:57.911 --> 00:09:00.811
when she was kidnapped five years ago

137
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.811
while still attending junior college and then never found.

138
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.211
Everyone was shocked.

139
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:10.211
Didn't you say you work for a television station in Kyushu?

140
00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:12.711
How do you know so much then?

141
00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:19.211
Yoshiko Matsumoto the maid that worked for the mayor is my cousin.

142
00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.711
She used to talk about them all the time.

143
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:26.511
That maid, is she the one...

144
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:28.911
Who was killed during the robbery.

145
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:34.111
Yes, one of the robbers killed her during the robbery four years ago.

146
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:37.311
Speaking of family, Ikema told me

147
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:40.011
his mother and the mayor's wife were sisters

148
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:43.111
so that makes him and Miyako cousins.

149
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:46.611
This castle in the back ground of the picture,

150
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:49.111
I've never seen it before, which castle is it?

151
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:52.711
Oh, that's not a castle, that's the mayor's house.

152
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:54.911
It's a huge mansion.

153
00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:58.011
According to my cousin, when the house was first built,

154
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:02.511
Miss Miyako was still little and she was so happy.

155
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:05.311
She said she felt like a princess in a castle.

156
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:06.711
A princess...

157
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.711
In a castle.

158
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:12.811
That settles it, the princess carved on that pillar really is...

159
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:14.511
Miss Miyako?

160
00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:17.411
Speaking of strange messages, there's some here, too.

161
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:18.611
What?

162
00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:22.711
I think they were written by Miyako.

163
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:24.211
What?

164
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:26.211
See, there's three.

165
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:32.811
You're right, it looks it was written with crayons.

166
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:35.911
The top one says "Chiyoni",

167
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:39.311
20 centimeters below that it says "Kachan",

168
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.711
and on the very bottom, it says "me".

169
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:46.611
Judging by all the lines near the word "me",

170
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:51.011
I'd say she was comparing heights with someone when she was little.

171
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:55.011
That's a relief, you had me scared there for awhile.

172
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.811
I know "Kachan" means mother,

173
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:01.111
but for a well bred young lady, she certainly uses common language.

174
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:04.311
No. I don't think she meant mother...

175
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:05.311
What?

176
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:06.511
Take a look!

177
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.711
They're very faint but you can still make out some words

178
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:10.911
on this door written with the same crayon.

179
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:13.311
It says "Mama's Room".

180
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:14.711
You're right!

181
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:16.511
Then who'd she mean?

182
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:20.511
Who are these people, "Kachan" and "Chiyoni"?

183
00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:21.511
Beats me.

184
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:24.811
Maybe they were her friends from school.

185
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.111
I don't think so!

186
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:28.511
She was still very young when she wrote this,

187
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:31.111
her friends wouldn't be that tall!

188
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:32.911
Yes, I see your point...

189
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.211
Those words are written on this door too!

190
00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:41.711
The room over there's Chiyoni's room and this is Kachan's room.

191
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:46.511
And that's not all, there're strange drawing by the words, too.

192
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.211
Kachan's drawing is a bird.

193
00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:51.911
Chiyoni's drawing looks like an eel.

194
00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:56.711
You know, looking at a little girl's drawings in this dark is kind of...

195
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.211
Creepy.

196
00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:00.511
Well,

197
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:04.311
seeing as how these two have rooms here on this uninhabited island,

198
00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:09.411
they must've come here with her often.

199
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:13.111
When the rescue boat comes to take us back to the main island,

200
00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:18.311
I guess we'll just have to go ask the mayor personally about these two.

201
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.111
They may be involved in this murder.

202
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.311
What was that sound?

203
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:28.211
I think it was Kume...

204
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.111
It came from upstairs, what happened?

205
00:12:31.111 --> 00:12:33.011
It couldn't be the killers.

206
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:34.111
Darn.

207
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:48.161
Hey, what's the matter?

208
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:49.661
Did you find the killer?

209
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.961
No, it's not that.

210
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:56.661
That guy let out a scream and he fell back inla panic

211
00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:59.161
he saw what was behind the curtain,

212
00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:01.061
this painting.

213
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:06.661
Look, isn't the model in that painting Miyako?

214
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.561
You're right, it looks just like the girl in the photo.

215
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:13.661
It was probably done by her mother,

216
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:17.761
Yoshiko told me she was quite an artist.

217
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:18.861
Yoshiko?

218
00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:21.261
Yes, she's my cousin

219
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:24.261
and she worked as a maid in the mayor's household.

220
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:25.461
I see.

221
00:13:25.461 --> 00:13:31.161
That means that there's four people here who are connected to the mayor.

222
00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:32.361
Did you say four?

223
00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:36.361
Yes, my mother was the mayor's wife's sister,

224
00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:39.061
the director's cousin was the maid,

225
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:43.561
Kume was Miyako's classmate in elementary, junior high and high school.

226
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:48.761
And Mr. Daito over there was a childhood friend of the mayor's wife.

227
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.661
Childhood friends?

228
00:13:50.661 --> 00:13:54.561
Yes, when I went to visit Mrs. Kaneshiro's grave last year with my mother,

229
00:13:54.561 --> 00:13:56.661
he was there, too.

230
00:13:56.661 --> 00:14:00.061
My mother asked and he told her they were childhood friends.

231
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.861
But my mother said she didn't remember him,

232
00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:06.361
so he could've been lying.

233
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:08.661
I don't blame her.

234
00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:12.461
Their ages were far apart, that's why she didn't remember.

235
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:15.761
If your mother and Mrs. Kaneshiro were sisters,

236
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:19.061
then you must've come to this island before, too.

237
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.161
No. I never came to this island, in fact,

238
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:24.261
I rarely went to the mayor's house to visit.

239
00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:27.761
The reason was, he was a very wealthy man and we felt uncomfortable.

240
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.361
I only saw Miyako a few times when she was very young.

241
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:33.861
I wonder why Mr. Kume panicked like that

242
00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:36.261
when he saw her painting though?

243
00:14:36.261 --> 00:14:37.661
Beats me.

244
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:41.661
Maybe he thought he was seeing her ghost?

245
00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:44.761
There's been gossip that she was killed.

246
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:47.061
Well, anyway

247
00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:51.161
it doesn't look like anybody suspicious is hiding out in this house,

248
00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:52.961
so let's all just stay together in one room

249
00:14:52.961 --> 00:14:55.461
and wait for the rescue boat.

250
00:15:10.361 --> 00:15:13.361
Don't you think it's taking a little too long?

251
00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:14.461
Yeah.

252
00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.661
But you know old Kogoro.

253
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:20.961
You can bet he's found himself a girl and they've gone out drinking.

254
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.961
The old good for nothing.

255
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:28.461
What was that?

256
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.461
Maybe it's...

257
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.861
Yes, I knew it! It's the rescue boat!

258
00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:39.561
We're saved!

259
00:15:40.561 --> 00:15:42.261
Hey, there!

260
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.061
Here, we're over here!

261
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:45.361
Hey!

262
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.261
Something's wrong with that boat.

263
00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:49.561
Yeah, there're no lights on

264
00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:51.361
and it's not docked right.

265
00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:00.561
"I'm the 'guso's messenger'."

266
00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:10.061
What a horrible way to die.

267
00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:14.561
The killer used something like a hard pipe and hit him so many times,

268
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:17.261
even after he died.

269
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.961
How awful.

270
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.161
Then the killer tied his body to the side of the boat

271
00:16:23.161 --> 00:16:24.961
and wrote those words

272
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:27.861
"I Death's messenger".

273
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:32.161
Whoever did this really hated him.

274
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:34.761
Who would do such a thing?

275
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:36.261
So there is somebody else here.

276
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:39.461
Somebody besides us is here on the island or in the ocean.

277
00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:42.961
Somebody who enjoys killing is hiding out somewhere!

278
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:44.761
You're right.

279
00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:47.061
When the boat rammed into the landing,

280
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:50.361
we were all inside the house.

281
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:55.661
Whoever piloted this boat is still around here, I'm sure of that.

282
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:59.761
Yes, that would be the so called "Death's messenger".

283
00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:02.661
No, that's not necessarily true.

284
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:04.361
Conan.

285
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:06.361
I just looked around inside,

286
00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:07.661
there's a teeny tiny thing

287
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.561
that looks like a television by the steering wheel.

288
00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:13.461
I checked the screen and it looks Iike this boat

289
00:17:13.461 --> 00:17:16.961
just went from this landing to the ocean and then came back again!

290
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:20.061
Oh, I see, it was on auto pilot!

291
00:17:20.061 --> 00:17:22.461
That way, no one has to be steering.

292
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:27.361
But kid, there're currents in the ocean,

293
00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:29.361
you wouldn't be able to control

294
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.261
how the boat crashed into the landing by auto pilot.

295
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:36.061
That's where you're wrong, it doesn't have to be exactly right.

296
00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:38.861
The flow of the current would affect the boat

297
00:17:38.861 --> 00:17:42.261
by about 50 to 100 meters.

298
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.861
To have the boat come to this side of the island,

299
00:17:43.861 --> 00:17:47.061
all you'd have to do is set the auto pilot to move along the shoreline,

300
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:51.861
then the boat would move along the reef and crash into the landing.

301
00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:58.061
Look at that. You can see the side of the bottom's scraped.

302
00:17:58.061 --> 00:18:01.961
That proves the boat moved along the reef scraping it.

303
00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:04.061
By using the auto pilot,

304
00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:07.961
anyone would've been able to commit the crime.

305
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:11.161
No matter what time the boat was set to leave this landing.

306
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:13.861
So you see, any one of us could have done it.

307
00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:17.161
Are you trying to tell us that...

308
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:21.161
That the killer is one of us?

309
00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:22.161
That's right.

310
00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:25.761
When the four of us left the boat to look for Miss Taira,

311
00:18:25.761 --> 00:18:29.961
you said you all left the boat right after us, didn't you?

312
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.161
Well, it would've been possible

313
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:36.761
for the man who left last to commit the crime.

314
00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:38.361
So who was it?

315
00:18:38.361 --> 00:18:39.561
Not me!

316
00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:41.161
It wasn't me either.

317
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.361
I was the last one to get off the boat.

318
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:47.161
Then that means you did it...

319
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:53.061
But any one of you could've come back after I'd gone, right?

320
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:56.761
And another thing you shouldn't forget, young detective.

321
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.961
When that woman Miss Taira was killed...

322
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:02.961
That's right, I remember what you said!

323
00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:07.161
About the words in the sand where her body was found,

324
00:19:09.161 --> 00:19:11.361
you said it'd be impossible for us to do it,

325
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:13.961
since we were on the opposite side of the island.

326
00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:15.961
Yeah, you definitely said that

327
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:19.361
since the words were written where the last wave of the high tide receded,

328
00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:21.661
they must've been written shortly before we found her

329
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.861
when the tide was low, otherwise, they would've been washed away.

330
00:19:24.861 --> 00:19:28.561
Besides, the words on both scenes were the exact same,

331
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:32.761
so they were written by the same person, right?

332
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:36.461
Then the killer couldn't possibly be one of us.

333
00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:39.161
If there was more than one killer,

334
00:19:39.161 --> 00:19:43.261
they might have talked it over and decided to do it the same way.

335
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:46.861
It may have been part of their plan

336
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:51.861
to make us suspect each other of the crime.

337
00:19:54.161 --> 00:19:56.861
Well the boat's back now anyway.

338
00:19:56.861 --> 00:20:00.361
That's right. Don't you think it'd be better if we discussed this

339
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:01.461
after we get back to the main island?

340
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:04.961
Thing is, while we were taking the captain down,

341
00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:07.161
I looked around the boat and saw that the fuel tank's pretty much empty.

342
00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:09.961
And that's not all.

343
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:14.061
The radio's been broken and all our things are gone,

344
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:19.061
which means the killer wants to keep us on this island

345
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:22.761
and is planning to do something.

346
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:24.761
What do you mean...

347
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:26.261
You mean another murder?

348
00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:27.461
Yes.

349
00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:30.261
If you don't want to get killed, we better all go back to the house

350
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:33.261
and wait for the rescue boat to arrive, that's the only thing we can do.

351
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:40.961
Good grief, how long do we have to wait for that rescue boat?

352
00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:42.261
Who knows.

353
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:46.261
Alright Heiji.

354
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:48.061
We'll see you back there later.

355
00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.061
-Alright. -Be careful!

356
00:20:50.061 --> 00:20:51.461
Don't worry.

357
00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:56.061
Listen, Kudo, something about this isn't right.

358
00:20:56.061 --> 00:20:57.861
I know.

359
00:20:57.861 --> 00:21:00.461
With the first victim Miss Taira,

360
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.061
the killer took the time to fold her arms neatly over her chest

361
00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:04.561
and close her eyes.

362
00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:08.261
But the second victim, the captain, was beaten to death.

363
00:21:09.061 --> 00:21:12.761
Their killers might've been different but still,

364
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:15.061
the methods are drastically different.

365
00:21:15.061 --> 00:21:17.061
Another thing bothers me,

366
00:21:17.061 --> 00:21:20.761
the way Miss Taira and the captain behaved before they were killed.

367
00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:23.861
Yeah, she deliberately chose to dive

368
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:26.861
where the current was fast, knowing how dangerous it was.

369
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:32.461
And the captain circled around the island until the very last minute.

370
00:21:32.461 --> 00:21:35.461
And there was seabed exploratory equipment on board too,

371
00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:39.361
he must've been searching for something.

372
00:21:39.361 --> 00:21:43.261
And it was probably attached to that anchor I found.

373
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:46.361
But what was it?

374
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:48.961
But besides that, Kudo.

375
00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:50.661
Remember the words written on the back of the chairs

376
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:51.961
in the room we were all in?

377
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:55.161
Yes, the ones written by a child in crayon.

378
00:21:55.161 --> 00:21:57.961
The one I was sitting on, had "Me" written on it,

379
00:21:57.961 --> 00:22:01.061
and Ran's had "Mama".

380
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.161
But on the back of the one I was sitting on was...

381
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:05.761
"Mr. Kaneshiro".

382
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:09.461
The little girl wrote it, didn't she?

383
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:12.961
Then Mr. Kaneshiro would be her father then, wouldn't he?

384
00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:15.161
I wonder why she didn't write Papa?

385
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:18.861
And those were the only chairs with names on them.

386
00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:21.661
Another thing bothers me, there weren't any chairs

387
00:22:21.661 --> 00:22:25.961
for Kachan and Chiyoni who she compared heights with.

388
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:27.061
I know.

389
00:22:27.061 --> 00:22:31.161
It seems strange that they'd have their own rooms but no chairs.

390
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:33.461
Kachan and Chiyoni.

391
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:36.461
What's that mean?

392
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.761
"Next Episode" -Here it is, found it.

393
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:09.761
Crackers and cookies!

394
00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:13.161
What was that sound?

395
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.461
I don't know.

396
00:24:14.461 --> 00:24:16.961
It sounded like water dripping.

397
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.761
Oh, no. It's coming this way.

398
00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:26.161
You don't think it's...

399
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:29.661
The death's messenger?

400
00:24:30.161 --> 00:24:31.661
Next Conan,

401
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:35.849
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 3)"

402
00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:38.788
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:40.888
"Castle"

404
00:24:40.888 --> 00:24:42.488
The next episode will conclude this case.

405
00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:44.388
-You are the killer. -You are the killer.
