1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.440
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.540
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.140
We'll get to see the Yaiba movie that we had been looking forward to.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.140
A surprising incident occurs just before watching it.

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:54.768
"Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 1)"

9
00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:16.168
2958cc, 220 horse power,

10
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.768
V-6 cylinder, 24 bulb,

11
00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:21.268
equipped with DOHC engine...

12
00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:41.568
Hey. Couldn't you find any other rental car, or what?

13
00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:46.568
What's wrong with this? This car is just the car for me!

14
00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:50.468
I think you're speeding too much.

15
00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:51.868
Don't worry.

16
00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:53.268
They don't have any "speed traps" here,

17
00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.368
and I'm being very careful, too.

18
00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:58.168
Hey, idiot!

19
00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.968
What you gotta be careful of is not the police, but the speedometer!

20
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:08.168
Could I ask you something?

21
00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:09.868
What is it?

22
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.468
Where are we headed?

23
00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:14.868
It's about time you tell us.

24
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:16.768
Please!

25
00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:21.768
To a place that you'd all love to go.

26
00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:25.168
How mean!

27
00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:27.568
Mrs. Edogawa.

28
00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:29.368
I told you that she's not my mother,

29
00:03:29.368 --> 00:03:31.668
but a middle aged relative of mine.

30
00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:40.168
She's my aunt.

31
00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:53.468
Hello?

32
00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.168
What's wrong with calling her middle aged, when that's what she is?

33
00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.268
Yes.

34
00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:58.868
Mr. Karata.

35
00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:02.368
What?

36
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.968
You're having trouble with the timing

37
00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:07.268
and the time for "Zero" may be delayed?

38
00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:08.868
Okay, okay.

39
00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:12.168
We're on our way there, so I'll see you.

40
00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.868
What is this "Zero" about?

41
00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:23.668
The number of a robot or something?

42
00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:26.668
Come on, please tell us.

43
00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:27.968
It's a secret.

44
00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:32.468
-What? Stingy! -What's the big deal!

45
00:04:32.468 --> 00:04:35.168
We're probably just going to see the prerelease

46
00:04:35.168 --> 00:04:37.568
of "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II" or something like that, right?

47
00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.168
What?

48
00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:42.168
-Is that true? -That's amazing!

49
00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:44.268
I want to see it! I really want to see it!

50
00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:46.268
Here goes, Joker!

51
00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:52.368
Kamen Yaiba!

52
00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.968
How did you figure out

53
00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:06.868
that we were going to the see the prerelease of Kamen Yaiba?

54
00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:11.568
Because timing means adjusting the color of the images

55
00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:15.768
and "zero" means a film that has just been made.

56
00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:21.468
Both words are a jargon of the movie and drama industry.

57
00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:24.368
And, if it were to be a movie that everyone would enjoy,

58
00:05:24.368 --> 00:05:27.568
then it must be "Kamen Yaiba the Movie II".

59
00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:32.668
Since we get to see "zero",

60
00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:35.268
it probably means the release date is coming soon,

61
00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.568
so they're going to use "zero" for the prerelease, right?

62
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:40.368
Right!

63
00:05:40.368 --> 00:05:42.268
Just as expected of you!

64
00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:46.068
Hey, the signal's changed to green some time ago.

65
00:05:46.068 --> 00:05:48.068
What? No joke!

66
00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:51.768
Oh, no! It's changed to yellow!

67
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.568
I'm sorry. How absentminded of me.

68
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.368
Hey! Would you give it a rest?

69
00:06:10.368 --> 00:06:12.368
You got children in the car, you know!

70
00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:14.468
Okay, okay.

71
00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:21.968
Wow!

72
00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:23.868
It's like we're riding a jet coaster.

73
00:06:26.668 --> 00:06:27.968
Ouch!

74
00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:31.468
Hey!

75
00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:37.568
Conan, your mother is sure a lot of fun.

76
00:06:38.568 --> 00:06:41.268
I keep telling you that she wasn't.

77
00:06:47.168 --> 00:06:49.968
So, this is the Tohto Processing Station.

78
00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:52.368
It has a very long history.

79
00:06:52.368 --> 00:06:57.168
It has walked the path along with the movies of Japan.

80
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:59.168
Come on, let's go.

81
00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:02.368
Behave yourselves, okay?

82
00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:03.968
Okay...

83
00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:14.068
Hey there, Yukiko. Long time no see!

84
00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:17.168
You're as beautiful as ever.

85
00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:19.068
Yes, of course.

86
00:07:19.068 --> 00:07:21.468
You haven't changed a bit yourself, Mr. Karata.

87
00:07:21.468 --> 00:07:23.168
That's right.

88
00:07:23.168 --> 00:07:25.268
He's Mr. Karata, the one who's going show us

89
00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:27.668
the newly made Kamen Yaiba movie.

90
00:07:27.668 --> 00:07:29.568
Nice to meet you...

91
00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:31.868
He's the timing man,

92
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.868
and he finishes all my movies with nice colors.

93
00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:38.868
"Takayoshi Karata (46), Timing Man" -Right?

94
00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:41.168
Huh? Which means...

95
00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:43.968
Did you used to be an actress?

96
00:07:43.968 --> 00:07:45.868
Yes.

97
00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:52.268
Maybe I was adored by your mother and father.

98
00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:56.168
-No joke! -Really?

99
00:07:58.168 --> 00:08:00.668
I see.

100
00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.868
Your power of deduction was handed down from your father.

101
00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:06.868
Liking to stand out, your confidence the acting talent

102
00:08:06.868 --> 00:08:09.168
that you display when using the voice changer...

103
00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:15.368
Moreover, your dangerous character of acting on impulse when angered.

104
00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:17.768
You inherited from your mother.

105
00:08:19.068 --> 00:08:21.468
Well, sorry.

106
00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.268
And? When will you be able to show the "zero" preview?

107
00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:27.268
Well, I think it's going to take a while yet.

108
00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:30.968
I think we can manage to get it done around 7 pm though.

109
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.668
I'm sorry, but could you wait around till then?

110
00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:35.468
You can take a tour around this place if you like.

111
00:08:35.468 --> 00:08:36.768
Okay.

112
00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:42.068
Mr. Hojima and Mr. Negami.

113
00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:45.668
Would you do me a favor and show Yukiko and the children

114
00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:47.768
inside the processing station?

115
00:08:47.768 --> 00:08:49.068
"Yoshihiko Negami (42)" -Sure.

116
00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:51.168
"Akira Hojima (28)" -Okay.

117
00:08:52.268 --> 00:08:54.268
This is the preview room

118
00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.268
where you'll all be watching the Kamen Yaiba movie later.

119
00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:01.268
It's like a theater!

120
00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:03.168
I want to see it quick.

121
00:09:06.468 --> 00:09:08.468
This is the dark room.

122
00:09:08.468 --> 00:09:11.268
This is the room where you check for scratches and spots

123
00:09:11.268 --> 00:09:14.068
before putting the film through the developing machine.

124
00:09:15.768 --> 00:09:19.668
And this is the developing machine for the 35 mm films.

125
00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:22.868
Well? Isn't it interesting with all the machines around?

126
00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:26.368
-Yes! -It's like a laboratory!

127
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.468
What's this sound?

128
00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:35.268
It's a warning telling us not to open the double door

129
00:09:35.268 --> 00:09:39.068
because someone's going into the dark room.

130
00:09:39.068 --> 00:09:42.368
While the film is being checked,

131
00:09:42.368 --> 00:09:45.468
even a slight amount of light with over expose the film and damage it.

132
00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:48.768
After the film is checked,

133
00:09:48.768 --> 00:09:51.668
Mr. Negami here is the develop man who makes the negatives

134
00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:54.168
by putting the films through the developing machine.

135
00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:57.868
Then, I make his negatives into positive prints.

136
00:09:57.868 --> 00:09:59.568
I see.

137
00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:03.268
Then, after the films are edited and dubbed with sounds,

138
00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.768
the timing man, Mr. Karata that you met a while ago

139
00:10:05.768 --> 00:10:08.768
adjusts the color and does the finishing touches.

140
00:10:10.868 --> 00:10:14.068
How come only you don't have "man" at the end of the job you do?

141
00:10:15.668 --> 00:10:19.168
Come to think of it, we don't say "print man".

142
00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:20.768
Right.

143
00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:24.168
Could it be that you're weak?

144
00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:27.768
Weak...

145
00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:30.468
I'm not a transforming hero or anything like that, you know.

146
00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:31.868
-I'm pretty sure that's it. -Oh...

147
00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:33.968
-Come on, Genta! -It's almost 6:40 pm.

148
00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:36.668
Shall we go into the preview room then?

149
00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:38.268
I guess so.

150
00:10:38.268 --> 00:10:42.668
It's going to take a while to see that preview.

151
00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:46.268
But Mr. Karata told us a while ago that it would be ready about 7:00.

152
00:10:46.268 --> 00:10:47.968
"Norihiro Furumura (39), Salesman" -According to Karata,

153
00:10:47.968 --> 00:10:51.068
he says it'll take till about 11 pm.

154
00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:55.268
It's going to run that late.

155
00:10:55.268 --> 00:10:57.668
Well, I guess it doesn't concern me because I goofed

156
00:10:57.668 --> 00:10:59.968
and I'm out of work.

157
00:11:01.468 --> 00:11:02.868
You sure look sleepy.

158
00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:04.468
Did you play mahjong again?

159
00:11:04.468 --> 00:11:05.968
Sort of.

160
00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:08.268
But this is bad.

161
00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:09.468
What seems to be the matter?

162
00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:13.468
I won't be able to make my flight back if it's going to be 11 pm.

163
00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:18.968
I can't make the children stay here till that late, besides.

164
00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:23.168
Then, shall I watch the children in my room?

165
00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:24.768
Huh?

166
00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:27.468
My condo is right close by.

167
00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:28.768
They can sleep there until it's time for the preview,

168
00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:32.368
then I'll take them home by car after they finish watching.

169
00:11:32.368 --> 00:11:36.068
Okay. Could I ask you to do so?

170
00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:39.768
Are you going to make the children sleep in that sloppy room?

171
00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:41.268
How rude.

172
00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:44.368
It may be sloppy, but it's not filthy.

173
00:11:44.368 --> 00:11:47.468
Well, it's only if the children want to, though.

174
00:11:47.468 --> 00:11:50.168
Let's stay over and watch it, okay, Conan?

175
00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:53.168
Bedsides, tomorrow is Sunday.

176
00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:56.668
We can boast about it to the other kids in school, too.

177
00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:58.468
Okay, Conan?

178
00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:03.968
Okay, then call your folks and tell them that you're going to be late.

179
00:12:03.968 --> 00:12:04.968
Okay...

180
00:12:04.968 --> 00:12:07.568
-We did it! -All right!

181
00:12:10.568 --> 00:12:13.368
Okay then, let's get work over with

182
00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:16.368
and take a snooze too then.

183
00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:19.568
Right. We'd better get ourselves ready

184
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:21.368
for the usual film completion celebration all night mahjong game man.

185
00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:23.768
What's an all-night mahjong game man?

186
00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:25.768
Does it have something to do with the developing man?

187
00:12:27.568 --> 00:12:29.568
It means we're going to play mahjong all night.

188
00:12:29.568 --> 00:12:31.568
Shin.

189
00:12:31.568 --> 00:12:33.368
What?

190
00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:36.168
What's with you? You sure are popular with girls, aren't you?

191
00:12:36.168 --> 00:12:37.468
What?

192
00:12:37.468 --> 00:12:39.768
Oh, Ayumi.

193
00:12:39.768 --> 00:12:42.368
And the other girl, too.

194
00:12:42.368 --> 00:12:44.568
Ms. Haibara.

195
00:12:44.568 --> 00:12:46.268
What?

196
00:12:46.268 --> 00:12:50.468
She stared at you at least 10 times today.

197
00:12:52.168 --> 00:12:54.868
I guess she was watching the growth process of the guinea pig

198
00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:58.468
who drank the drug she made.

199
00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:01.968
How silly! Girls look at boys

200
00:13:01.968 --> 00:13:04.368
either because there's something on his face

201
00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:07.668
or because she's in love with the boy.

202
00:13:07.668 --> 00:13:10.068
Ai?

203
00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:11.768
No way.

204
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:15.668
I hope you got rid of that car

205
00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:18.368
that was tailing us on our way here.

206
00:13:18.368 --> 00:13:21.668
So you noticed them too, Shin?

207
00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.568
Of course.

208
00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:25.968
You were stopped all the while the traffic signal

209
00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:27.868
changed from green to yellow,

210
00:13:27.868 --> 00:13:32.168
but the car behind us didn't even toot a horn.

211
00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:36.368
In other words, they didn't want us to notice them.

212
00:13:36.368 --> 00:13:40.068
That is, they were tailing us.

213
00:13:40.068 --> 00:13:44.568
They were tailing us for quite some time.

214
00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:48.268
Right, I thought so too.

215
00:13:48.268 --> 00:13:51.668
So I was planning to take off as soon as the light turned red.

216
00:13:51.668 --> 00:13:53.268
I wonder who they are?

217
00:13:53.268 --> 00:13:55.168
That's true.

218
00:13:55.168 --> 00:14:02.568
If that car was after me or Ai...

219
00:14:02.568 --> 00:14:05.168
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

220
00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:09.168
Those guys that shrunk my body.

221
00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:12.468
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

222
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.590
That's true.

223
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:30.790
If that car was after me or Ai...

224
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.590
it's highly likely that it's those guys.

225
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.190
Those guys that shrunk my body.

226
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.490
The probability is high that they are the men in black.

227
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.090
No. There is another possibility.

228
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.690
The person who is riding that car is...

229
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.090
A great fan of mine!

230
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.890
What?

231
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.790
That person probably wanted to know where I live and get my autograph!

232
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.790
Oh, my poor thing!

233
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.990
I sure hope so.

234
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.290
You'd better protect them nice and good

235
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.090
because you're all they've got.

236
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.090
Yeah.

237
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.890
I know.

238
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.690
See you then, everybody!

239
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.190
Enjoy watching the preview and go home safely.

240
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.390
Okay! Thank you...

241
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.490
Oh, that's right!

242
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.790
Come here.

243
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.490
What is it?

244
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.990
The girl that was staring at you...

245
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.390
Make sure you escort her all the way, and see that she gets home safely.

246
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.290
I know.

247
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.490
So annoying.

248
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.290
You're going to be late for your flight.

249
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.690
Oh, right. See you then, Shin!

250
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.190
I'll see you all some time again!

251
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.890
This is...

252
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.790
It's way messier than I imagined it to be.

253
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.190
Don't you know how to clean up?

254
00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.790
Okay then, let's clean up before we take a nap.

255
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.190
Wait!

256
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.690
No, no, don't touch!

257
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.290
Huh? Why not?

258
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.190
I'm going to loose track of where everything is.

259
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.690
Is that so?

260
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.090
Is that really true?

261
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.690
It's tiring.

262
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.690
Okay, we'll sleep on the sofa,

263
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.890
so you kids sleep in this room.

264
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.990
If you sleep sideways on this bed,

265
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.590
I guess you can all sleep here.

266
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.690
This room is messy, too.

267
00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.490
You can say that again.

268
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.090
I've been busy recently, so...

269
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.690
Good work all day today!

270
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.990
I'm going to give my best shot...

271
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.290
-playing all night mahjong tonight. -What is he doing?

272
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.390
I'll report the result later.

273
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.290
Recently, he's been hooked on making video diaries.

274
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.390
I'm going back to the station because I've still got work left to do.

275
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.490
What shall I do?

276
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.690
What shall I do? I'm so excited, I can't sleep!

277
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.790
Hey, Mitsuhiko. Are you asleep?

278
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.890
No, not yet.

279
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.890
The subtitle was "Counterattack of the Lord of Potatoes", right?

280
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.990
No. The subtitle that was shown in the preview was...

281
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.190
The subtitle was...

282
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.490
It was... subtitle...

283
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.390
Gosh! "The Requiem of the Potato Queen"!

284
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.290
Don't forget!

285
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.890
They're fast asleep.

286
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.090
It can't be helped.

287
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.890
They're children, unlike us.

288
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.090
Hey, Ai.

289
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.890
Can I...

290
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.490
Can I ask you something?

291
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.890
Is there anything on my face?

292
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.690
What?

293
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.990
What was that?

294
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.990
Hey, Mr. Furumura!

295
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.690
What's the matter? Mr. Furumura!

296
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.790
Mr. Furumura...

297
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.590
Conan. What was it?

298
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.990
Is it time?

299
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.890
Mr. Furumura!

300
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.990
How was it done in the dark?

301
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.190
"Next Episode" -I think it's almost impossible

302
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.590
to run away in such a short time from this dark, messy room

303
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.590
without making a sound.

304
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.890
We didn't hear the murderer at all.

305
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.690
A soundless murder...

306
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.990
I see. That's why he was flustered and did what he did.

307
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.190
No doubt about it, he's the killer.

308
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.690
Next Conan, "Secret of the Tohto Processing Station (Part 2)"

309
00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:26.058
Next Conan's Hint:

310
00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:27.858
"Fluorescent paint"

311
00:24:27.858 --> 00:24:30.058
There are many odd people working as movie staff, don't you think?

312
00:24:30.058 --> 00:24:32.058
Like, Mr. Suwa, Mr. Yoshioka and Haibara.

313
00:24:32.058 --> 00:24:32.804
Who are they?
