1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.840
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.640
An unsolved case of a large house.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840
A spicy deduction does the work.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.567
Ran, Pops and I are invited by Sonoko

9
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:46.867
and head for her villa in Karuizawa.

10
00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.767
On our way, our things together with the car

11
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.467
sink into the river when the water level rises.

12
00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:53.767
We end up spending the night at a house in the remote mountains

13
00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.467
that we found by chance while walking.

14
00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.367
However, that night,

15
00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:00.867
in his room at the second floor,

16
00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:04.167
the owner of that house, Mr. Iwao Akashi,

17
00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.667
were found dead!

18
00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:15.967
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 2)"

19
00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.467
This is Yamamura from the Gunma Prefectural Police Station.

20
00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.967
Excuse me. I'd like to ask you a question.

21
00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:29.467
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -Yes.

22
00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.667
What can I do for you?

23
00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.567
There are traces of something having been wrapped

24
00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:36.867
around your father's wrists.

25
00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:40.367
Do you have any idea what it could be?

26
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.767
Hey. Is that true?

27
00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:46.667
Yes, sir! It looks as if he had been tied up by someone!

28
00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:53.167
I think those are traces of rubber bands.

29
00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:54.967
Father had a habit of bunching everything and anything up

30
00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.267
with rubber bands,

31
00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:00.567
and always had rubber bands around both his wrists.

32
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.467
Oh, just as I thought.

33
00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:03.967
Just as you thought?

34
00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.367
Yes.

35
00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.467
We found a lot of rubber bands under his pillow,

36
00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.467
so I thought maybe.

37
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:16.167
Is there anything else that you recall?

38
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.567
Like having seen someone suspicious around your house,

39
00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:22.067
or having heard strange sounds or voices?

40
00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.067
Come to think of it.

41
00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.667
What do you mean "come to think of it"?

42
00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:26.867
It's nothing.

43
00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:30.567
But when I went in front of that room the first time,

44
00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:33.867
I heard the man was crying.

45
00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.267
What?

46
00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.967
You heard him crying?

47
00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.867
That was probably after deciding to commit suicide.

48
00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:44.267
Didn't you see anything else in that room?

49
00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:47.167
Conan!

50
00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:49.467
You shouldn't be talking!

51
00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.667
Yeah. There was a handkerchief on the floor.

52
00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.667
I think he probably wiped his mouth

53
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.667
with it while eating curry,

54
00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.767
because there was a little curry on it.

55
00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:01.467
Don't tell me that...

56
00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.167
If my deduction is correct.

57
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:08.567
Mr. Iwao didn't go to the dentist.

58
00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:12.167
The reason why he was bleeding from his mouth

59
00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:13.467
was probably because...

60
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.367
Hey, sonny, what's up?

61
00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:18.667
Oh! Hey!

62
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.767
Don't touch!

63
00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:21.767
This is...

64
00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:23.367
Hey!

65
00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.167
I see. So, it's just as I thought.

66
00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.067
Geez.

67
00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.567
If he had his tooth pulled out two or three days ago,

68
00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:34.867
his gums should have healed a little and a little closed.

69
00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.667
But his gums are still opened

70
00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:38.467
with no signs of closing up.

71
00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:42.467
Neither are there signs of blood have dried up or anything!

72
00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:46.167
In other words, this is proof that he just got his tooth pulled out.

73
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:50.067
Moreover, the other teeth around it are also shaky.

74
00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.367
This means that whatever he was clenching with all his might

75
00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:54.367
between his teeth was pulled out with great force.

76
00:04:55.567 --> 00:04:58.167
I get the picture of this trick!

77
00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.367
But, why?

78
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.167
If this trick is what I think it is,

79
00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:05.867
it should be somewhere in this room.

80
00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:08.067
How come it's nowhere in sight.

81
00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:10.567
Hey, what do we do?

82
00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:14.667
This half-eaten curry over rice?

83
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:17.867
Oh, yeah. Well, there wasn't any poison in it

84
00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:19.967
so shall we have them put it away?

85
00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:21.467
Oh, that.

86
00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:23.967
What is it?

87
00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:27.167
Don't tell me you want to eat it?

88
00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:31.667
Hey, stop it!

89
00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.967
You gotta be kidding? Hey, kid?

90
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:36.967
Found it!

91
00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.767
This is it!

92
00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:40.967
No doubt about it.

93
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:43.867
Hey, isn't that a tooth?

94
00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:45.167
What?

95
00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:46.667
What're you talking about?

96
00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.467
What? A human's tooth?

97
00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:50.867
Looks like it.

98
00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:52.767
No doubt about it.

99
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.967
The one who killed Mr. Iwao

100
00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:57.367
created his own alibi through his trick,

101
00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:59.867
and that person is Mr. Hiroto Akashi!

102
00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.467
Okay then, now that I know.

103
00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:05.967
I've got to get everyone to come here

104
00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.867
and start the usual Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

105
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:11.767
Excuse me.

106
00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:13.267
What shall we do with this tooth?

107
00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:14.567
-Excuse me. -I know, right?

108
00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:17.767
-Please listen... -I guess we better report this to Officer Yamamura.

109
00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:18.967
Right.

110
00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:23.967
This is bad!

111
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.567
I lost my voice!

112
00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:29.667
Darn it! What do I do now?

113
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.067
After I figured out the case and all.

114
00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:35.667
I can't use the voice changer

115
00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:39.867
to reveal the truth of the case to anyone in this situation.

116
00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:41.367
I would write

117
00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:45.167
but with this sprained wrist, I can't.

118
00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:48.667
Only if they'd solve it themselves somehow.

119
00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.667
My only hope is that the detectives will catch on.

120
00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:53.067
So what I think is...

121
00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:56.567
But, with the members here.

122
00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.967
Hey, Conan!

123
00:06:57.967 --> 00:06:59.267
Just where were you?

124
00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:06.467
No way! You mean you lost your voice?

125
00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:09.267
See. You were told not to talk

126
00:07:09.267 --> 00:07:11.967
because you'd lose your voice, weren't you?

127
00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:17.267
This case is plain to see!

128
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:22.267
Around 7:30 pm when Mr. Iwao Akashi passed away in his bedroom,

129
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:26.067
Ran, Conan, Sonoko and Mr. Hiroto, who were in this house,

130
00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.467
were all in the living room so we all have an alibi.

131
00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:30.667
I was taking a bath,

132
00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.467
but have no motive

133
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:35.667
and had no way of getting the rope ready either.

134
00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:41.567
Moreover an hour before we discovered the corpse,

135
00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.667
the light of the bedroom was on,

136
00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:46.267
but when we discovered the body, it was turned off.

137
00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:49.067
No matter how you look at it this is suicide!

138
00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:51.467
Mr. Iwao turned off the light of the room

139
00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:55.067
and then committed suicide!

140
00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:57.467
So, I'd advise you to stop investigating right now

141
00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:58.967
and go on back to the station!

142
00:07:58.967 --> 00:08:00.867
I guess so.

143
00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:02.567
No, wrong.

144
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.467
This is homicide.

145
00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.667
He used a trick to make it look like suicide

146
00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:09.067
and killed the victim.

147
00:08:09.067 --> 00:08:10.767
The killer is Mr. Iwao's adopted son,

148
00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:13.067
Mr. Hiroto.

149
00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:14.867
But, what can I do?

150
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:17.567
Without a voice,

151
00:08:17.567 --> 00:08:20.867
how should I accuse him?

152
00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:36.589
Okay, although this is going to be a bit bothersome.

153
00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:42.389
What?

154
00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:47.689
What?

155
00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:50.089
Hey, Conan, just what're you doing?

156
00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:52.489
Isn't he gesturing?

157
00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:55.989
Rice crackers.

158
00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:02.589
You want to eat 14 pieces of rice crackers?

159
00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:04.889
No...

160
00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:08.089
Crack. One. Four?

161
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.589
Close...

162
00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:12.489
Okay, could it be...

163
00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:14.789
crack code one?

164
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:15.989
Almost.

165
00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:18.489
Oh, I got it!

166
00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:21.389
Crack this code for once and for all. Right?

167
00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:27.189
But, what is there to crack?

168
00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:31.789
That curry?

169
00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:33.089
Is something wrong with the curry?

170
00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:35.789
It was spicy but good.

171
00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:36.889
Right.

172
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:39.889
No...

173
00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:42.489
That's not it? Then, what is it?

174
00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:43.989
Me.

175
00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:45.389
Sonoko.

176
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:47.389
Mr. Hiroto.

177
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:50.189
What? The old man upstairs?

178
00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.489
A circle?

179
00:09:52.489 --> 00:09:54.489
One?

180
00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.089
What? I'm... three?

181
00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:59.289
Are you talking about my age?

182
00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:01.789
I'm a little over 33 already.

183
00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.689
Ran was born when I was...

184
00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.689
Are you talking about the amount of curry we all ate?

185
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.989
Mr. Hiroto, his father, Sonoko and I had one serving each,

186
00:10:09.989 --> 00:10:12.789
but dad ate 3 servings!

187
00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:14.489
Right...

188
00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.989
So, what's wrong with that?

189
00:10:16.989 --> 00:10:19.089
It sure is strange!

190
00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:21.089
Because you and your group just happened

191
00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:24.489
to come by this house tonight, right?

192
00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:26.689
Moreover, Mr. Hiroto usually lives here only with his father.

193
00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:28.789
There are just the two of you here, is that right?

194
00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:30.489
Yes.

195
00:10:30.489 --> 00:10:34.389
Then, curry enough for seven people is a bit too much

196
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:36.189
for just two people living together, don't you think?

197
00:10:36.189 --> 00:10:38.489
It would surprise the Indians in India too!

198
00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:40.489
Now that you mentioned it.

199
00:10:40.489 --> 00:10:42.189
Don't tell me that you...

200
00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:45.389
You must like curry?

201
00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:50.089
I actually love curry too.

202
00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:51.789
Well...

203
00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:55.489
I made quite a lot because I usually invite the students

204
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:58.789
that I've become friends over.

205
00:10:58.789 --> 00:11:02.389
They really seem to like the curry I make.

206
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:03.889
I would think so.

207
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:05.889
Too bad there was nobody at the tennis court today

208
00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:09.089
because it rained.

209
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.389
Tooth.

210
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:20.389
Curry.

211
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:21.389
No good.

212
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.989
For the tooth. Curry. No good?

213
00:11:23.989 --> 00:11:25.089
Bull's eye!

214
00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:27.289
Oh, could it mean...

215
00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:28.589
That after a tooth is pulled out,

216
00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.989
eating something too spicy is not good?

217
00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:34.489
Remember when you had your decayed tooth pulled out,

218
00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:37.089
the dentist told you so, right?

219
00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:38.389
Yeah.

220
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:41.289
But, then it's strange.

221
00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:43.489
You knew that your father had his tooth pulled out

222
00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:47.589
two or three days ago, didn't you, Mr. Hiroto?

223
00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:48.989
Yes.

224
00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:52.889
But, I had no idea that he had his tooth pulled out.

225
00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:56.289
Officer Yamamura, could I speak to you for a moment.

226
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:02.689
Is that true?

227
00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:05.189
Is something the matter?

228
00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:10.989
Well, the coroner is here checking on the corpse

229
00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:12.189
and he says that Mr. Iwao's tooth

230
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:13.889
seems to have been pulled out

231
00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:16.789
just a while ago, not two or three days ago.

232
00:12:16.789 --> 00:12:17.989
And the tooth that was pulled out

233
00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:20.189
seems to have been found in the bedroom.

234
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:24.289
It seems to have been found in the half-eaten curry dish.

235
00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:28.689
There must've been very tough meat in the curry,

236
00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:30.089
because the teeth near the tooth that had come off

237
00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:32.089
all seemed to be shaky too.

238
00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:35.889
I don't think such tough meat was in it.

239
00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:43.289
He.

240
00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:44.789
Bit.

241
00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:46.389
Something.

242
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:48.289
You mean that old man?

243
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:50.289
I'm sure he was.

244
00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:52.189
He was eating curry, you know.

245
00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.389
You want me to sit?

246
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:59.589
Bring the tied part of the necktie around behind

247
00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:02.189
then bring the end of the necktie to the front

248
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:03.789
and bite?

249
00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:05.589
I got it!

250
00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:07.189
That old man

251
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:10.189
was suspended in air while biting on the rope!

252
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.189
Bingo!

253
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:14.089
If so, he would eventually get tired

254
00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:16.289
and stop biting on the rope,

255
00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:18.489
then he'd be strangled!

256
00:13:18.489 --> 00:13:20.689
His tooth probably flew into the curry dish at that time

257
00:13:20.689 --> 00:13:22.789
because of the impact!

258
00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:26.589
Since his mouth is blocked with the rope,

259
00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:28.689
he probably couldn't yell out either!

260
00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:31.289
You mean that voice that I heard back then was

261
00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:34.489
not him crying, but him groaning.

262
00:13:34.489 --> 00:13:38.289
But there were no traces of the rope by his mouth.

263
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:40.389
That's probably because...

264
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.989
The handkerchief!

265
00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.089
Remember, the handkerchief with the curry on it

266
00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:49.289
was near the corpse, wasn't it?

267
00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:52.889
He was made to bite the handkerchief together with the rope!

268
00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:54.289
If so,

269
00:13:54.289 --> 00:13:57.889
then traces of the rope wouldn't be left around his mouth.

270
00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:02.589
But, his hands weren't tied when he was found.

271
00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:04.489
If he grabs the rope with both hands,

272
00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:07.589
he can free his mouth so he could've shouted,

273
00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:10.389
"Somebody help!"

274
00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:13.789
Besides,

275
00:14:13.789 --> 00:14:17.089
the bedroom light that was on an hour and a half ago,

276
00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:20.289
was turned off when the corpse was found, wasn't it?

277
00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:21.389
All during that time,

278
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:23.089
nobody went to that room,

279
00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:25.389
so how could the light have been turned off?

280
00:14:26.589 --> 00:14:27.789
Hey.

281
00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:32.389
Conan?

282
00:14:37.489 --> 00:14:40.389
Hey! Don't play around with it!

283
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:41.689
I see.

284
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:44.389
Both his wrists were tied with the electric cable in a bow tie

285
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:46.089
and the edge of the cable

286
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:49.989
was connected to the electric cable!

287
00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.089
Then when he becomes exhausted

288
00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:54.389
the rope will pull away from his mouth,

289
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:57.289
his body will slide down choking his neck, and at the same time

290
00:14:57.289 --> 00:15:00.289
the electric cable will be pulled and the light will go out.

291
00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:03.289
The cable that is tied to his wrists will untie

292
00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:08.689
and the body will be in the exact position as we found it!

293
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:11.589
Which means that the narrow lines that were found

294
00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:12.789
on Mr. Iwao Akashi's wrists

295
00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:15.289
were marks that were left from his wrists being tied!

296
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:19.089
But these light fixtures have three levels

297
00:15:19.089 --> 00:15:22.589
and unless you pull the cable three times like Conan just did

298
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.389
it won't get dark, right?

299
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:28.489
Pulling just once would only turn off the light on the outer part,

300
00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:33.089
and pulling the cable twice will leave the miniature light on.

301
00:15:33.089 --> 00:15:35.189
If the brightness is adjusted to the second level

302
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:36.689
and the miniature light is loosened,

303
00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:39.789
then pulling on the cable just once will turn the lights off!

304
00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:41.289
I see.

305
00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:43.589
But, is it possible to untie it?

306
00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:50.189
See, this part that is tied to make the cable longer.

307
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:52.489
In order to tie the hands of someone who is struggling,

308
00:15:52.489 --> 00:15:53.989
it would be impossible to do so

309
00:15:53.989 --> 00:15:55.489
while the electric cable is connected to the light fixture!

310
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:59.289
Then, this knot would have to be untied once.

311
00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:02.989
But, this looks to be a complicated knot.

312
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:07.789
This is called the fishing knot!

313
00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:09.389
What's that?

314
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:11.789
The way a fishing line is tied!

315
00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:16.189
A slippery line has to be tied like this or it'll get untied!

316
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:18.689
I see! That's why Mr. Hiroto's wife

317
00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:20.689
went to buy this book on fishing!

318
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:23.589
She wanted to learn how to tie the electric cable firmly in place.

319
00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:27.789
But, why was the cable in the bedroom is different then?

320
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:33.589
The cable in the bedroom was tied into a regular knot!

321
00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:35.089
I see.

322
00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:39.089
That's why the electric cable in the bedroom was shorter.

323
00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:41.689
He was unable to untie the knot,

324
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:44.889
so he had to cut it using scissors.

325
00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:47.989
And the cable was tied into a regular knot

326
00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:50.689
because the killer didn't know

327
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:53.689
how to tie it fishing line style!

328
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:54.789
Isn't that right...

329
00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:56.789
Mr. Hiroto Akashi?

330
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:04.589
The trick you used goes like this.

331
00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:10.089
You took the curry to Mr. Iwao's bedroom upstairs.

332
00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.589
While he was eating the curry, you probably covered his mouth

333
00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.089
with the handkerchief from behind,

334
00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:20.089
and tied him up with the electric cable that you've cut.

335
00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.589
After putting the loop of the rope around his neck,

336
00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.289
you made him bite the rope with the handkerchief,

337
00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:28.089
and left him suspended.

338
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.789
Of course, you threatened him saying

339
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:32.889
that if he lets go of the rope from his mouth,

340
00:17:32.889 --> 00:17:34.689
he would choke to death!

341
00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:38.889
Finally you tied both of his hands with the electric cable

342
00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:44.489
and make somebody go to the bedroom

343
00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:45.789
to pick up his curry dish.

344
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:47.289
You warn that person saying,

345
00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:49.589
"If the light is on, he's still eating"

346
00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:51.489
"so don't go into the room."

347
00:17:51.489 --> 00:17:54.489
You first ask the person to go get the plate around 10 minutes

348
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:57.089
after you came down because he most likely

349
00:17:57.089 --> 00:17:58.689
still holding the rope in his mouth.

350
00:17:58.689 --> 00:18:02.489
Then you ask that person to go again after a while.

351
00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:05.789
The person will go in and find the dead body after the light is off.

352
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:08.789
Since you were with us right through in the living room,

353
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:12.089
you most definitely have an alibi!

354
00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:15.689
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiroto was at the tennis court in the rain

355
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:19.289
just to invite someone to witness his alibi?

356
00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:20.389
Yeah.

357
00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:24.289
He deliberately made curry for a lot of people.

358
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:26.189
No way.

359
00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.689
Which means if we didn't come here,

360
00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:30.389
this wouldn't have happened.

361
00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:31.489
No.

362
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:32.789
Even if you all didn't come here today,

363
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:36.589
I was going to kill him tonight.

364
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:42.189
It's true that today is the anniversary of my wife's death.

365
00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:48.589
My wife was found lying on the ground

366
00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:51.389
in this forest drenched in rain.

367
00:18:51.389 --> 00:18:53.389
Lying on the ground?

368
00:18:53.389 --> 00:18:54.389
Yes.

369
00:18:54.389 --> 00:18:59.389
It was when I went out to work at a court in Tokyo on a rainy day.

370
00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:02.589
My father suddenly woke my wife, who was asleep with a cold,

371
00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:04.689
and made her go shopping.

372
00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:08.289
He told her that he wanted to eat mushroom rice.

373
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:09.789
She should've refused, but she didn't.

374
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:13.389
She walked with unsteady steps over to a supermarket about 3km away

375
00:19:13.389 --> 00:19:18.389
and on the way back, just as expected, fell to the ground and...

376
00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:21.589
But that's no reason for you to kill him.

377
00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:24.189
No. I decided to kill him

378
00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:26.789
the day after my wife's funeral.

379
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:29.189
Unaware that I was behind him,

380
00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:32.989
father was mumbling the following words towards the altar of my mother.

381
00:19:32.989 --> 00:19:37.289
Dear. She finally broke down.

382
00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:41.189
Next time I wish he'd get himself a healthier wife.

383
00:19:41.189 --> 00:19:44.489
A toy that is more durable like Hiroto.

384
00:19:47.389 --> 00:19:48.989
It can't be...

385
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.789
You mentioned that you were adopted.

386
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:56.589
Yes, until I heard him say that, I believed him.

387
00:19:56.589 --> 00:20:00.089
I believed him being selfish

388
00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:03.989
was because he already considered me as his son

389
00:20:03.989 --> 00:20:07.989
Yes. We, My father, wife and I, built a house in the forest

390
00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:10.789
and began living here because of my father's selfishness

391
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:13.189
saying that he wanted to live apart

392
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:15.089
from the rest of the world.

393
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:18.589
Of course the same goes for the electric cable.

394
00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:22.389
He suddenly lengthened the electric cable of his room

395
00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:25.489
and ordered all the electric cable in the other rooms to be the same way.

396
00:20:25.489 --> 00:20:29.589
What? So, the electric cable in that room...

397
00:20:29.589 --> 00:20:30.689
Yes.

398
00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.789
Father tied the cable in his room himself.

399
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:36.989
Talk about not knowing how to tie knots.

400
00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:41.089
If that was a knot that my wife had tied,

401
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:42.489
I...

402
00:20:42.489 --> 00:20:46.189
I couldn't have cut it

403
00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:47.389
and maybe would've had second thoughts

404
00:20:47.389 --> 00:20:50.189
about carrying out this murder.

405
00:22:25.689 --> 00:22:28.589
It sure was an uncomfortable case.

406
00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:30.989
Well, after all, a person passed away so...

407
00:22:30.989 --> 00:22:32.889
The combination of Sleeping Kogoro

408
00:22:32.889 --> 00:22:35.089
and deduction queen Sonoko,

409
00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:38.389
sure can close a case in a jiffy!

410
00:22:38.389 --> 00:22:41.589
I forgot to videotape the deduction show,

411
00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:43.389
because you started it without going to sleep!

412
00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:45.789
It's not my problem!

413
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:49.089
I got twice as tired this time.

414
00:22:49.089 --> 00:22:51.589
What's the matter, Ran?

415
00:22:51.589 --> 00:22:54.889
It seems that I received a call last night,

416
00:22:54.889 --> 00:22:57.789
but the number has no caller I.D.

417
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.089
If you're talking about the call that came in

418
00:22:59.089 --> 00:23:00.389
when you were using the restroom,

419
00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:01.989
he took it.

420
00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:02.989
What?

421
00:23:02.989 --> 00:23:05.289
It was a wrong number call.

422
00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:07.589
Shinichi?

423
00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:10.089
Wasn't that call from Shinichi?

424
00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:12.789
That look on your face, it must've been!

425
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:14.189
What?

426
00:23:14.189 --> 00:23:15.989
What did he say?

427
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:17.589
Geez.

428
00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:21.689
I'm sorry to have worried you.

429
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:25.889
No more X-sized cups for bras?

430
00:23:25.889 --> 00:23:27.889
X-sized cups means the difference in size

431
00:23:27.889 --> 00:23:30.689
with the under-bust is about 70cm.

432
00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:32.789
Were your breasts that big?

433
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:34.189
Of course not!

434
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:35.889
I'm not a cow, you know.

435
00:23:38.389 --> 00:23:40.589
I guess I'll mail her later.

436
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:45.389
"Next Episode" -10 million yen?

437
00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:47.389
Something about there is someone

438
00:23:47.389 --> 00:23:50.389
who is after the life of her husband

439
00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:51.689
and she says if we can nail that person,

440
00:23:51.689 --> 00:23:54.289
she'll pay us 10 million yen!

441
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:56.689
This case would be closed in no time

442
00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:59.089
if we use our heads just a little bit!

443
00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:02.789
Mom?

444
00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:07.789
Hey, both of you!

445
00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:09.889
Next Conan,

446
00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:13.489
"Two Princesses of a Kind (Part 1)"

447
00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:16.257
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:18.457
"Shinichi's Mother and Ran's Mother"

449
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.757
The hint of the next episode somehow makes me nervous.

450
00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:21.857
Dad, what is the legend that surrounds them?

451
00:24:21.857 --> 00:24:23.057
Goodbye.
