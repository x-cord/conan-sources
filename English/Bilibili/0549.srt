1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:05,566
"Oh, sushi! Oh, sushi! How happy we are!"

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:09,766
"This is the prize for us winning the game we played with Doc"

3
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:13,866
"At the sushi shop"

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:18,266
"We'll get to eat sea bream, flatfish, squid and tuna"

5
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,266
Well, squid, sea bream, flatfish, whatever!

6
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,966
Because the shop we're headed for now has a wide variety of sushi

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,566
and is known for being cheap and delicious too!

8
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,366
A wide variety.

9
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,466
Cheap and delicious.

10
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:34,166
It's a sushi shop dream come true!

11
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:37,166
Doc.

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,466
Don't tell me that the sushi at the shop

13
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,566
comes on a rotating conveyer?

14
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,166
Her head sure rotates quite quickly.

15
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,966
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

16
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:49,366
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

17
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,966
The atmosphere changes

18
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,266
in a Rotating sushi shop that everyone likes.

19
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,866
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,866
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,166
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

22
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:49,004
"Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 1)"

23
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,904
"Senpuken"

24
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:55,604
So, it's a shop where the sushi rotates after all.

25
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,604
You promised to take us to a high class sushi shop

26
00:02:57,604 --> 00:03:01,004
because we won the game, right?

27
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:03,104
That's not nice, Doc!

28
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:05,104
I even only had two servings of rice for breakfast

29
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:08,204
because I wanted to keep myself hungry, you know!

30
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,604
That's more than enough.

31
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,304
Well, maybe you should've thought more of

32
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:16,604
how much everyone was anticipating the sushi.

33
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:19,204
Think of the contents of my wallet too, will you?

34
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,004
Well, it's not something to get so disappointed over

35
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,604
because it's delicious, you see.

36
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:29,104
Have you guys ever eaten sushi that comes rotating, or what?

37
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,404
-No. -Me neither.

38
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:32,904
Dad told me that since I'm an Edoite,

39
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:35,904
I should eat sushi at good shops!

40
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,904
Well, I guess that's true.

41
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:41,504
If this is your first time, I'm sure you'd be surprised!

42
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,204
Awesome!

43
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:49,404
-The sushi is rotating! -Really!

44
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:52,604
Is it okay to pick up any plate you want?

45
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:54,504
Yes, go ahead!

46
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,504
But once you pick up a plate,

47
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,604
don't ever return it to where it was.

48
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,204
That's bad manners

49
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:02,404
because they add the total of how much was eaten

50
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:05,404
by counting the different kinds of plates and number of plates there are.

51
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:09,504
But, what if the sushi that you want to eat doesn't come around?

52
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:12,504
Then all you need to do is place an order for it.

53
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,604
Just tell Doc what you want

54
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:16,004
and he'll get it to you using the touch panel.

55
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,504
You can order things like miso soup and steamed eggs, too.

56
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:21,204
What kind of sushi would you like to order?

57
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,204
Okay, I want 10 eels then.

58
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:26,604
I'd like mackerel or horse mackerel to start with.

59
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:28,704
I want to eat salmon roe.

60
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:31,704
Hey, hey. One at a time, okay?

61
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,404
So this is it!

62
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:37,204
The eels look delicious.

63
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,004
-Dig in. -No, no!

64
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:41,404
That's some other customer's plate!

65
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:44,904
In this shop, it seems that when the plate that you ordered

66
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:48,004
passes in front of you, it beeps.

67
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,204
Here it comes! My eels.

68
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:56,104
Dig in!

69
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,504
It's delicious!

70
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,904
Here it comes!

71
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,504
Salmon roe.

72
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,504
Delicious!

73
00:05:08,504 --> 00:05:10,304
It sure is good!

74
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,204
What fun! It's good!

75
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,804
There couldn't have been a better place than this.

76
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:16,804
Right.

77
00:05:16,804 --> 00:05:19,904
It doesn't meet up to the standard of a first class sushi shop,

78
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:23,804
but for them, it's better for them to have fun while eating.

79
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:26,104
My eels are coming one after the other.

80
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:28,604
I already took your plate for you, Conan.

81
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,004
See.

82
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,004
All salmon roe.

83
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,704
I love salmon roe.

84
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:36,604
Eat to your heart's content too, Conan.

85
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,804
But I can't that many rows of it.

86
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:41,004
-Yummy! -What a dull play on words.

87
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:46,904
Boy, did I eat.

88
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,704
-It was pretty good, wasn't it? -Yep.

89
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:51,804
Look, there's pudding too!

90
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:54,004
No joke?

91
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:55,404
Oh, no!

92
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:58,504
-God, watch out, will you? -Sorry.

93
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:00,104
Huh?

94
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:04,404
There's a strange pattern on the back of the plate.

95
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:07,004
That's the mark used to automatically get rid of the plates!

96
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:09,004
The pattern is read by the sensor

97
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:12,704
and gets rid of all the sushi that's been going around for some time!

98
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,704
It's difficult to tell when the sushi was made just by looking at it,

99
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,504
and of course it's difficult to remember when it was made either!

100
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,704
Hey, brats.

101
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:23,304
I hope you didn't drop the plates on purpose

102
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:26,904
to confuse how much you're supposed to really pay.

103
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:29,304
Of course I wouldn't do something like that.

104
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:32,104
I'm sorry. Since this is the first time

105
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,704
that these children have ever come to a sushi shop...

106
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,504
Their first time?

107
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:40,704
Which means that they're usually eating delicious sushi all the time?

108
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:44,304
They belong to class way above you, they say.

109
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,404
Right, flatfish boy?

110
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,504
What?

111
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:51,804
It's the fish that your wife used to like, boy.

112
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:53,204
Flatfish.

113
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,504
Aren't you going to pick it up? Flatfish.

114
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,704
I see, I see. This is sea bass.

115
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,804
Please stop it, sir!

116
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:06,104
You're going to be bothering the other customers,

117
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,504
so please refrain from making a racket.

118
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:11,404
Shut up! I don't want a man like you

119
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:13,604
who can't do any better than to cling onto sushi

120
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,004
and be a manager of this shop telling me anything.

121
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,504
That has nothing to do with what I'm saying.

122
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,104
I'll see to it that I run you out of business.

123
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:23,004
I may not look it, but I'm a pretty well-known food writer, you know.

124
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:25,304
It would only take a week

125
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:28,204
to drive your shop to close down, you know?

126
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:31,604
For example, like the shop of that woman

127
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:34,504
who's eating sneakily at the edge over there.

128
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,404
What's up, you guys?

129
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:40,004
Stop looking, hey!

130
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,804
Okay, I won't charge you for today,

131
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,504
so will you please leave?

132
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,104
Free?

133
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,604
Okay, I guess I'll eat to my heart's content and leave then.

134
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,004
Sir...

135
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:55,104
What a nasty man.

136
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,704
I don't feel happy anymore.

137
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:00,004
-Let's go home! -I guess so.

138
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:06,604
It'll be 8,700 yen.

139
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,304
They sure ate a lot.

140
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:11,504
Boy, give me a break.

141
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:15,004
Thank you so very much.

142
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,104
Please bring us here again, Doc.

143
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:19,504
When there aren't any nasty customers, though.

144
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:21,204
Yeah.

145
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,104
Sir?

146
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:32,404
Are you all right, sir?

147
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,404
-What the... -Oh no! Food poisoning?

148
00:08:34,404 --> 00:08:37,904
-Hey, don't eat it! Put it back. -Okay.

149
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:40,104
-Let's change shops. -Yeah.

150
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,504
Don't move!

151
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:44,804
If you even move a bit from where you are now,

152
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,004
I'm going to tell the police officers who come here about it.

153
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,904
Police... sonny?

154
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,104
His mouth smells like almond.

155
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:57,704
This man was poisoned by cyanide.

156
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,104
What? Poison...

157
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:04,404
Moreover, since there are 2 or 3 rice grains on his finger...

158
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:08,604
It's highly likely that poison was mixed into the sushi!

159
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:10,404
Under this special circumstance,

160
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:13,204
there would have been many chances to do it!

161
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,604
At any rate, Doc!

162
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,404
-Hurry and call the police and ambulance! -Okay!

163
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:20,904
Will you please stop the conveyer belt right away, manager?

164
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:21,904
Okay!

165
00:09:22,304 --> 00:09:24,604
Stand back!

166
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,704
You again?

167
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:28,204
Conan.

168
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:30,604
Yep, sort of.

169
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,704
I thought that the one who the bad luck holder

170
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,804
that calls incidents was Mr. Mouri,

171
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:36,504
but it could be you.

172
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,804
No, that's...

173
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,904
He's not a bad luck holder!

174
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,204
We're members of the Youth Detective Squad!

175
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,404
We can't help it if cases just happen to happen!

176
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:47,804
Cases just happen to need us!

177
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,004
What's with your haughty attitude?

178
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:53,404
And? Was the poison inside the sushi after all?

179
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:57,404
No. We can't say for sure yet

180
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:01,004
unless we examine the inside of the stomach of the victim.

181
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,304
According to the report of the forensic officer,

182
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,704
the poison seems to have been on the last plate

183
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,704
that the victim took on this part of the plate.

184
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:09,804
So, it's very likely...

185
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:13,104
I see. The culprit pretended to take the plate

186
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,004
and touched it with his/her hand that had poison on it.

187
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,604
Then, if the culprit without taking the plate and pass it to him,

188
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:20,104
he or she could've given the poisoned plate to the victim.

189
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:23,004
Yes, so it seems that when the victim took that plate,

190
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,104
his finger was poisoned,

191
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:29,004
and picked up the sushi and ate it.

192
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:33,004
So, are you sure that nobody moved since this happened?

193
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:36,004
Yes! No one in the kitchen moved either, right?

194
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:39,004
Yeah. Because I made sure no one did after you told me to do so.

195
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,904
Okay, let's do a body check then!

196
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,104
If you're sure of what you just said,

197
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:44,304
I'm sure the culprit still has the container with the poison inside,

198
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:48,104
or the poison soaked handkerchief on him or her.

199
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,404
Take the customers who were sitting in the lane

200
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,104
where the victim was sitting

201
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:53,104
as well as the employees in charge of the lane

202
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:55,204
-to another room and inspect them! -Yes, sir!

203
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,104
Yes. Especially the three

204
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,304
who seem to have been on bad terms with the victim.

205
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,704
They should be checked as thoroughly as possible.

206
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,404
Nothing?

207
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,004
Are you saying you couldn't find a container with poison in it

208
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,804
or a poison soaked handkerchief either?

209
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,404
No. No one nor anywhere.

210
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:18,704
No way.

211
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,804
There was no chance for anyone to have disposed the poison.

212
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:24,304
Then, why doesn't anyone have the poison?

213
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:26,504
Besides, is there a way

214
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:30,204
in which the poisoned plate can be given only to the victim?

215
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,404
How could the culprit make sure that no one would take the plate part way,

216
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:35,804
and set it up so that only the victim would pick it up?

217
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,659
Food writer?

218
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:56,359
Was Mr. Agatsuma, the victim a food writer?

219
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:01,059
Yes, he was a writer notorious for his harsh comments.

220
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,759
The shops that he says are delicious,

221
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,959
are really reputed as being delicious.

222
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,559
And he seems to have been taken very well by the readers.

223
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,159
On the other hand, the customers of the stores that he criticizes

224
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,659
decrease drastically,

225
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:15,459
and some cases the stores actually seem to have gone bankrupt.

226
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,959
That could be the motive for the murder.

227
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,959
But the point is

228
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,759
how did the killer make him take the plate smeared with poison?

229
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,359
Right.

230
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,959
By using this rotating sushi system,

231
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,959
it's possible to automatically bring the poisoned plate

232
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,459
in front of Mr. Agatsuma.

233
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,159
But that doesn't mean he would pick it up 100%.

234
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,859
Well, there seems to have been many customers

235
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,159
seated in the lane where the victim was eating.

236
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,159
So, including the people who were in the kitchen,

237
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,859
we've got to check everyone thoroughly.

238
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,959
Well, I think there were only three people

239
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,759
who could've smeared poison on the plate.

240
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,759
-Three people? -Yes.

241
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,359
It seems that a little before, Mr. Agatsuma took the poisoned plate

242
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,859
and ate the sushi with his fingers,

243
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,159
he had an argument with the shop manager.

244
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,459
That man shouted in a really loud voice and was making a racket!

245
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,559
It was really scary!

246
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,659
He was also taking his anger out on the other customers.

247
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,059
It seems that the customers sitting opposite him

248
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,559
were all getting ready to leave because of what happened,

249
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,059
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

250
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:19,859
The people sitting opposite him said

251
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:21,059
they didn't pick up any plates

252
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,859
from about 5 minutes before Mr. Agatsuma collapsed.

253
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,459
I see.

254
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,659
Several plates would go around in 5 minutes.

255
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:31,459
Which means that poison couldn't have been smeared on to a plate

256
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,759
that Mr. Agatsuma wouldn't pick up on the first round.

257
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,459
In other words, the suspicious people

258
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,759
would be those who are in the kitchen and cannot be seen from here.

259
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,359
Rather, there were practically no plates left to pick up

260
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,359
because Mr. Agatsuma made a racket.

261
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:45,659
However, the employees are saying that

262
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,559
they didn't place any newly made sushi on the lane in question.

263
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,259
In other words, the ones who could've

264
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,059
smeared poison on the plate after the racket are

265
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,959
the man who sat to the left of the man who was killed

266
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,059
and the woman who was seated at the edge

267
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:05,459
on the right hand side of the man

268
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,459
with 6 people between them and the store manager

269
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,059
who was the first to run up to the man who collapsed.

270
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,359
That's right, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

271
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,759
Yeah.

272
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,559
But, why would the store manager who ran over be included too?

273
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,959
Well...

274
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,259
I did mention that the store manager had an argument with Mr. Agatsuma

275
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,459
before he collapsed, that's why.

276
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:28,459
They were arguing near Mr. Agatsuma's seat,

277
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,759
and it seems that they confronted each other at quite a close range,

278
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,059
-so I included him just in case. -Besides, the three...

279
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:36,859
seem to somehow have some connection with the man who was killed!

280
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,959
You got into a fight with Mr. Agatsuma before at this shop?

281
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,159
Yes. I was boasting to my wife

282
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,959
that the flatfish here is cheap but delicious.

283
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,959
Then, he suddenly butt in from the side.

284
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,759
"That's not flatfish, it's sea bass, stupid."

285
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,659
Was it sea bass?

286
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,759
After taking a good taste at it again, yes, it was.

287
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,259
I see.

288
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,059
He embarrassed you in front of your wife.

289
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,659
That's not all!

290
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:21,159
I don't know how he found it,

291
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,859
but he wrote his comment

292
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,359
in my gourmet walk around blog bulletin board.

293
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,059
He wrote, "This guy's got the tongue of a poor boy!

294
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,459
This blog is a bunch of baloney!"

295
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,959
But it's not that I held a grudge against him because of it.

296
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,759
But your seat was right next to Mr. Agatusma's.

297
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,559
You would've had many chances to poison his dish.

298
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,659
Next to him yes, but I was to his left.

299
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:47,659
The sushi was going round from the right to the left.

300
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:50,359
So, I couldn't have smeared poison on the plate that he picked up!

301
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,359
Does it go from right to left?

302
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:57,359
Yes, it spins clockwise.

303
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,859
Although it stopped now after this boy told me to do so.

304
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,359
So, it means that

305
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,659
even if poison were to be smeared onto Mr. Agatsuma's plate,

306
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,559
the plate would have had to spin once around

307
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,459
before passing in front of him.

308
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:12,159
Yes. And besides, that plate would be one

309
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,359
that Mr. Agatsuma let spin once around

310
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,759
so it is highly likely that he wouldn't pick it up

311
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,359
even if it came around again.

312
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:22,259
But it would be a different story for the woman sitting to his right.

313
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,659
Hey, hold it.

314
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,859
Even if I were to smear poison on the plate,

315
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,959
there's no guarantee that the good-for-nothing would pick the plate up!

316
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,459
Good-for-nothing?

317
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,759
You seem to be involved with Mr. Agatsuma in some way, too.

318
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,159
Yes! I sure do!

319
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,259
The Japanese cuisine shop that I ran went bankrupt

320
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,559
thanks to the article he wrote!

321
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,859
Went bankrupt?

322
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,159
Because of Mr. Agatsuma's article?

323
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,259
Yes.

324
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:51,659
That man used to frequent my shop in the past,

325
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,459
but he wrote, "The taste of the shop suddenly went down,

326
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,759
and take-out sushi that comes in plastic containers taste better."

327
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,059
Is... Is that so?

328
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,659
I couldn't help it!

329
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:04,459
Our sushi cook quit because of old age

330
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,159
and the sushi cook said to be good, who supposed to take his place

331
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,459
suddenly refused to take the position!

332
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,759
Don't tell me that the sushi cook is you, manager?

333
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,359
Yes. My boss of the shop that I worked for previously

334
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,459
was acquainted with her

335
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,059
and he'd asked me to work for her, too.

336
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,659
But just when I was about to go, I hurt my arm

337
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,759
and I refused because I wasn't able to make sushi like I used to.

338
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,059
How did you hurt your arm?

339
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,959
I tried to stop some customers from fighting

340
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:40,159
and hurt my arm muscle.

341
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,059
And one of the customers was

342
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,359
that Mr. Agatsuma, you see.

343
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,659
Well, that's why I gave up being a cook

344
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:56,059
but I couldn't forget the aroma of vinegar rice,

345
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,159
so I decided to work as manager here.

346
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,059
But I wouldn't do such a thing as smear poison on the plate.

347
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,359
But you were right near him

348
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,359
when Mr. Agatsuma collapsed too, weren't you?

349
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,259
That's true,

350
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,759
but I didn't touch the plates that were rotating

351
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,859
and as the woman was saying

352
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,359
even if I were to be able to somehow smear poison on the plate,

353
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,659
how would I make him pick it up?

354
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,159
Well...

355
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,259
Maybe it was his favorite dish?

356
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,659
He picked it up because it was a dish that he liked very much!

357
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,259
-If it were Genta, it would be eels! -Yeah!

358
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,759
If it comes around, I wouldn't let it go pass me.

359
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,159
What kind of dish did Mr. Agatsuma like?

360
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,959
He didn't have anything he like in particular.

361
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:42,859
Well, I guess even if he did have a favorite, it would be irrelevant.

362
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:46,559
That is, even if it were to be the victim's favorite,

363
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,059
whether he would pick up his favourite or not

364
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,259
would depend on how he feels at that time.

365
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:54,659
There's no way of knowing 100% what sushi he would pick up.

366
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:58,059
Of course anyone could've picked up the poisoned plate.

367
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:00,259
It would be a different story, though,

368
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,159
if this were indiscriminate murder.

369
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,559
True.

370
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,259
But I wonder? Is there a way

371
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,159
to make only Mr. Agatsuma pick up the poisoned plate?

372
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,859
That's right, he could order it!

373
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,359
If he placed the order for the sushi,

374
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,559
he would pick it up for sure!

375
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,859
-Place an order? -Yes.

376
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,959
If you place an order using this touch panel,

377
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:26,259
the sushi comes in a bowl with the sign "ordered" on it,

378
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,859
and when it comes in front of you, there is beeping sound.

379
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,059
I see!

380
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,759
So, Ms. Takemura who was seated to the right of the victim

381
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,759
could've done it!

382
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,659
No way.

383
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,759
Even if an ordered plate were to come around,

384
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,659
I couldn't have smeared poison on it!

385
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:46,159
Because beyond him, there was a man who was wearing a cap,

386
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:48,459
I had no way of knowing which one of them had placed the order!

387
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:53,159
Besides, I can't even see the touch panel from my seat,

388
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,659
so I wasn't able to tell what he ordered.

389
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,559
The only one who could see it

390
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,459
was Mr. Aizono who was sitting next to him.

391
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,859
Hey, hold it, will you?

392
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,459
I mentioned it a while ago too,

393
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,959
but I was sitting to the left of Mr. Agatsuma,

394
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,459
and the sushi was rotating from right to left!

395
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,859
Even if I were to be able to see

396
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,059
what Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel,

397
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,259
the plate would be picked up by him before it reaches me!

398
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,659
True.

399
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:27,159
Besides, I'm not the only one who can see the touch panel.

400
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,559
The manager can too!

401
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,159
Because after arguing with Mr. Agatsuma

402
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:33,159
and up to the time Mr. Agatsuma collapsed,

403
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:35,259
he was standing behind him!

404
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,859
-Is that true? -Yes.

405
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:41,759
Since Mr. Agatsuma was making such a racket,

406
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,959
I told him, "You don't have to pay, so please leave."

407
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,759
Then he said, "If it's free, I'll eat and leave."

408
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,759
So, I stood behind him

409
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,159
to watch that he wouldn't make further trouble.

410
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,759
Well, but as far as I saw,

411
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,659
he didn't seem to have been ordering anything.

412
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,859
We can tell for sure if I check the computer though.

413
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:05,159
-Check it. -Yes, sir.

414
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:10,059
Officer.

415
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,259
Haven't you forgotten?

416
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,859
You did a body check on us a while ago,

417
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,359
but no container with poison inside,

418
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,859
nor any handkerchief soaked with poison was found!

419
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,759
Despite of this, I question why you keep on suspecting us.

420
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,059
I'm sure that the killer

421
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,059
was among the customers that already left the shop.

422
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,259
Maybe that's why the container with poison inside wasn't found.

423
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,759
Which means unless we capture that killer,

424
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,059
we'll never find out how just Mr. Agatsuma was targeted.

425
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:44,459
No. I'm pretty sure that the killer is among the three here.

426
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:49,459
First, Mr. Osamu Aizono who was seated left of Mr. Agatsuma.

427
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:50,759
Mr. Aizono would be able to tell

428
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,259
what kind of sushi Mr. Agatsuma ordered using the touch panel

429
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,359
but since the sushi goes round from right to left,

430
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,959
Mr. Agatsuma would pick up the plate

431
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,859
before the poison is smeared onto the plate.

432
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,559
If it were Ms. Sakiko Takemura

433
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,059
who was seated to the right of Mr. Agatsuma, with us in between...

434
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,859
She would've been able to smear poison on the plate

435
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,359
before he picked it up,

436
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,559
but she couldn't see the touch panel from where she was seated.

437
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,659
Mr. Danji Namiki who was standing behind Mr. Agatsuma

438
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,059
could also have watched the touch panel.

439
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,759
But Mr. Namiki didn't move from behind Mr. Agatsuma,

440
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,359
so he couldn't touch the sushi plates.

441
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,859
Who on earth is the killer?

442
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:37,159
And how did the killer

443
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,559
target only Mr. Agatsuma with the poisoned plate?

444
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,559
"Next Episode" -I think the man

445
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,459
who died was left-handed!

446
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:14,259
If poison were to be smeared on to the left side of the plate,

447
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,359
it would possible to make only him touch the poison.

448
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,659
There's something by the tea cup.

449
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,759
Oh, that sushi...

450
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,959
I wonder if it's okay to eat it?

451
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,659
I see.

452
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:28,959
So, it's a trick that could've been carried out

453
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,859
only because sushi was used!

454
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,683
Next Conan, "Rotating Sushi Mystery (Part 2)"

455
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:53,462
Next Conan's Hint:

456
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:55,762
"The method of eating sushi"

457
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,062
First, order eels.

458
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,062
Next, order a bowl of eels over rice.

459
00:24:58,062 --> 00:25:00,462
The next episode will be aired from 17:30!
