1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,940
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,040
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
A nice spot for the trolley and fishing.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,740
Pierce through an unthinkable case and disclose the truth.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,068
Invited by Sonoko,

9
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:55,368
we all come to a bass fishing contest held at Lake Okutani.

10
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,268
There, we meet the candidates for championship

11
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,268
Ms. Saori Ayukawa

12
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:00,768
and Mr. Takuya Masubuchi

13
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:05,868
as well as freelance writer, Mr. Toshihiko Funaki.

14
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:07,668
The competition for the first day ends.

15
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:10,268
It's a bit of a concern that

16
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:13,368
that night, Mr. Funaki and Mr. Masubuchi get into an argument,

17
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,368
and sure enough, the following day,

18
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,968
very near the place we were fishing,

19
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:22,868
Mr. Funaki is found dead from a strong impact to his head.

20
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:28,568
I wonder if that place is cursed.

21
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,068
Cursed?

22
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,568
Mr. Mizui, what do you mean?

23
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:36,768
The thing is somebody died there 6 months ago too.

24
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,668
Who is the person that died?

25
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:40,568
A person called Mr. Kanie,

26
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:44,068
who was also good friends with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

27
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,968
A person died there a half a year ago.

28
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:49,068
This is no coincidence.

29
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:53,368
The murderer is probably one of the two!

30
00:02:57,268 --> 00:03:03,168
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 2)"

31
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,168
Okay, let's start with you, Mr. Masubuchi.

32
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:12,268
Please tell me where you were between 10:00 to 10:30.

33
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,968
Between 10:00 to 10:30...

34
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,268
I was under the steel bridge at that time.

35
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:20,468
The steel bridge? On which side of the steel bridge?

36
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,868
On the side where the road is!

37
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,868
What, the side where the road is?

38
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,668
Yes, that's right!

39
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,768
The steel bridge is where Mr. Funaki was killed!

40
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:33,368
He was found in a grassy area about 100m upstream.

41
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:34,768
It seems so.

42
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:38,068
I was surprised at the great number of police there.

43
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,868
I think that he would've had to walk behind you

44
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,968
to get to that grassy area.

45
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:48,168
Didn't you notice Mr. Funaki walk behind you?

46
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:51,868
No, I didn't because I was absorbed in fishing.

47
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,268
Is there anyone who can testify that

48
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,168
you didn't move from under the steel bridge?

49
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:57,268
No.

50
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,568
No alibi, eh?

51
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:02,668
Mr. Masubuchi was near there?

52
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,468
May I...

53
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:04,468
What is it?

54
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,468
May I go now?

55
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:11,268
Oh, yeah. I may ask you some questions again later.

56
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,368
Sonoko.

57
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,968
Nobody heard any scream.

58
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,068
The rock where he hit his head can't be found.

59
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:27,268
Conan, are you going to quit fishing already?

60
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,968
I don't feel up to it anymore.

61
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,368
But, if you guys want to, go ahead.

62
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:36,368
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

63
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,568
Inspector, we checked the alibis of everyone,

64
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:42,468
from those who brought their own boats to those who rented boats,

65
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:45,968
but nobody seems to have gone near the place the corpse was found!

66
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:47,768
So, the boat wasn't used.

67
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:51,268
Which means it's somebody that was alone

68
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:54,668
on the left shore of the lake.

69
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,068
Inspector,

70
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,768
I went to the inn that the victim stayed over at last night,

71
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,168
and I was bothered by something that one of the guests said.

72
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,968
Bothered?

73
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:09,268
Yes, he says that the victim and Masubuchi

74
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,368
were arguing in the bath room.

75
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,468
I see!

76
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:13,968
Okay!

77
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:24,068
Well, you seemed to have some sort of conflict with Mr. Funaki.

78
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,268
Hey, kids, it's not for you to listen!

79
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,568
We're fishing.

80
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:31,068
Yes, we figured if the candidate for champion Mr. Masubuchi

81
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:32,268
picked this place to fish,

82
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,868
we may be able to get a large catch here too.

83
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,968
Yeah, something as big as a whale.

84
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,568
If we fish something that large, we won't be able to take it home

85
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,868
You guys...

86
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,368
If we get to fish something like that,

87
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:45,368
we'll be able to boast about it in school.

88
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:46,968
We can boast about it!

89
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:50,468
All talk, you kids, I tell you.

90
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,968
So, how about it, Mr. Masubuchi?

91
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:57,168
Silence could work against you,

92
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:01,868
because a lot of people have seen you and Mr. Funaki arguing.

93
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,268
Mr. Funaki...

94
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,868
Mr. Funaki?

95
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,568
Mr. Funaki said something ridiculous,

96
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,968
that's why I couldn't help shouting at him.

97
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,468
Something ridiculous?

98
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,468
Well...

99
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:14,968
What is it?

100
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:18,368
He insisted that I liked Ms. Ayukawa

101
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:22,968
and that he'd play go-between for us.

102
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,768
That's why I sort of blew my top!

103
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:27,068
Oh, is that all?

104
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,268
Yes, Mr. Funaki said that

105
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:33,468
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from him.

106
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:38,068
Ms. Ayukawa would never refuse any offer from Mr. Funaki?

107
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:39,268
Come to think of it, even last night,

108
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:42,168
she followed Mr. Funaki despite looking very unwilling.

109
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:50,168
A person also died here 6 months ago.

110
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,168
Conan, what are we going to do in a place like this?

111
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,268
The police already came here and searched,

112
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:58,868
so I'm sure we won't find anything here either.

113
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,768
Let's go back.

114
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,468
Mitsuhiko's right.

115
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,568
The murder weapon wasn't here.

116
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:07,768
Moreover, we didn't even hear Mr. Funaki scream.

117
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,968
Trolley train?

118
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,168
The smell of kerosene.

119
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,868
The stain on the vest.

120
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,068
I get it!

121
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,168
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Let's trace these tracks!

122
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,568
What?

123
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:42,868
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

124
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:47,968
The place where Mr. Funaki was killed is somewhere along the tracks!

125
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,268
Let's go!

126
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,268
How far are we going to go? There's nothing.

127
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,068
We're going to reach Okutani Station soon.

128
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,868
I'm sure we'll find something.

129
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,068
I'm starving.

130
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,868
Isn't that Mr. Funaki's?

131
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,868
The actual murder site is here! But how?

132
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,668
Excuse me,

133
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:28,868
did anybody come on this bridge between 10:00 to 10:30?

134
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:30,068
No.

135
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,068
What about a camera man?

136
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,468
Yeah, at about 9:50, he came from the direction of the dam,

137
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:38,968
and went down the steps that you all just came up.

138
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,568
Did anyone cross this bridge after that?

139
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,268
Not one person until the police cars came

140
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,068
and this place got boisterous.

141
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,268
Oh.

142
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:48,368
Early in the morning,

143
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:51,768
Ms. Ayukawa came and went down the steps, though.

144
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,268
Ms. Ayukawa did?

145
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,068
Yes, at about 7:30, I think it was.

146
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,668
She came back after about 10 minutes though.

147
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:07,668
So, Ms. Ayukawa did come after all.

148
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,268
But how?

149
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:15,368
Conan, I just remembered, we gotta return the boat.

150
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,168
Genta, you said that

151
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:20,268
you saw Ms. Ayukawa go up opposite Kutanisuji,

152
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,368
but which side of the lake was she on?

153
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:23,168
Let's see.

154
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:28,468
She was on the left when viewed from the lake,

155
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,768
so maybe this side?

156
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,068
After climbing back up from this side,

157
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,468
in order to throw a stone at Mr. Funaki

158
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:37,468
from right under the bridge that is opposite the bridge,

159
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,468
she would have to cross this bridge once.

160
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:44,168
But the guard says nobody crossed.

161
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,068
But, if he was killed here,

162
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,168
why was his body found where it was?

163
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,668
How was it carried there?

164
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:56,068
He fell into the lake and naturally drifted to the shore there,

165
00:09:56,068 --> 00:10:00,568
where he came to and climbed up. He then passed away.

166
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,868
No, Mr. Funaki's body was not wet,

167
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,068
and he wasn't using a boat.

168
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:10,968
It's unnatural that his body was where it was after all.

169
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:13,268
But, I'm certain that he was killed here!

170
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:14,768
Conan.

171
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,368
We're going to be charge extension fee

172
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:18,968
if we don't return the boat.

173
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,068
What method was used?

174
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:24,868
-Conan, the boat. -Yeah, I know.

175
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,068
Are we going to ride it to the boat house?

176
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,568
-I guess so. -All right.

177
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,768
Genta, shall we throw this away?

178
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:38,768
What's that?

179
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,968
We picked it up.

180
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:42,068
Where?

181
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:45,368
Around the place where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

182
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,968
Oh! That handkerchief!

183
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:49,368
What's up?

184
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:52,468
-That handkerchief is Ms. Ayukawa's. -What?

185
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,568
I see.

186
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,368
I got it!

187
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:05,331
The winner for the contest

188
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,731
is Mr. Takuya Masubuchi with a total of 30500 grams!

189
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,631
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki will present

190
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,131
the championship trophy on behalf of the chairman.

191
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:19,431
Please give her a big hand everyone.

192
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:20,631
Any comments?

193
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:23,531
I was lucky to have been able to fish at a good spot.

194
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:26,231
I'll prepare for the next tournament and do my best again.

195
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:29,531
If you're the killer, I promise I'll find evidence to nail you.

196
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,231
The winner of 2nd place

197
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:36,831
is Ms. Saori Ayukawa with a total of 22680 grams.

198
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,531
Anything to say?

199
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,731
I was hoping for two consecutive wins

200
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:45,031
but unfortunately I've lost to Mr. Masubuchi.

201
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:49,931
I would like to take that big cup home with me next year.

202
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:54,031
Let's give the two winners a big hand once again!

203
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,631
We would like to conclude

204
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,431
the 17th Suzuki Cup Lake Okutani Tournament.

205
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,731
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all so very much.

206
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,831
She's doing the same thing as the Sleeping Kogoro!

207
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,931
-What? -Please wait, Ms. Ayukawa.

208
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:19,431
I still have something I'd like you to tell everyone.

209
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,331
I'd like you to tell us why you killed Mr. Funaki.

210
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:27,131
What? You mean Ms. Ayukawa...

211
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:30,231
I'd like to know why you did what you did at this tournament

212
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,831
where I'm serving on behalf of the chairman.

213
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:36,331
Come on, please tell us!

214
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,131
Just what do you think you're saying?

215
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:42,831
She was in Kutanisuji on the opposite side of the lake back then.

216
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:44,831
That's not the point.

217
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:49,231
Because Mr. Funaki was not killed where he was found.

218
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,331
What? That can't be!

219
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,131
Conan, please show her the stuff.

220
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,331
Okay!

221
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:00,831
We found this camera beside the rail tracks of Kutanisuji.

222
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:02,931
This is Mr. Funaki's camera.

223
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,631
He took pictures for us yesterday so I remember!

224
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,131
What?

225
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,231
The camera of the victim was found in Kutanisuji.

226
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,631
But, why was it in a place like that?

227
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:14,831
We found it under Kutani Bridge!

228
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:17,031
And these are the pictures that were printed from the film

229
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:19,031
that was in the camera!

230
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,831
-Hey! -Oh, yes, sir.

231
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,931
There's a picture of a trolley there, right?

232
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,131
The place that picture was taken from.

233
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,631
The place where the leg of Kutani Bridge touches the shore,

234
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,831
a very small flat area.

235
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,031
I asked a railroad buff and found that

236
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,431
the place is famous for getting the best shots of the trolley.

237
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:52,831
Ms. Ayukawa, I hear that you were invited by Mr. Funaki

238
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,731
to have a drink with him last night.

239
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,731
At that time, you gave him information of that place

240
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:00,931
where he could take pictures of the trolley

241
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,031
for a railroad buff magazine.

242
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:08,931
But Mr. Funaki was found 3km away, opposite the steel bridge.

243
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,931
I just said that's not the point.

244
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:14,631
Inspector Yokomizo,

245
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:17,731
didn't you notice the black stain that was on the vest

246
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,931
that Mr. Funaki was wearing?

247
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:25,731
Now that you mentioned it, the forensic officers reported so.

248
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,131
The substance seems to have been oil and soot.

249
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,131
Yes, it's the exhaust of the diesel steam engine

250
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,131
that pulls the trolley along.

251
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,031
Exhaust?

252
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,831
Mr. Funaki moved from under Kutani Bridge to the place he was found

253
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,731
on the roof of the trolley.

254
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,731
Carried on the roof?

255
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,031
You threw a rock at Mr. Funaki

256
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,031
who was waiting for a chance to take a picture of the trolley.

257
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,831
The rock hit him on the head

258
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:57,631
and he fell on top the roof of the trolley from the impact of being hit.

259
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,831
Then carried on the roof of the trolley,

260
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,631
he crosses the bridge, until the sharp curve

261
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:03,931
where he is flung off the roof

262
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:06,831
and his body thrown to the place where it was found.

263
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,431
Such a coincidence exists?

264
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,931
It's no coincidence.

265
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:15,731
There is a train that leaves Lake Okutani Station at 10:50.

266
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,631
Ms. Ayukawa calculated it so that

267
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:21,931
Mr. Funaki would fall on the roof of that train and killed him.

268
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,931
Then, she knew ahead of time

269
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:27,631
that the body would drop where it did too?

270
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:28,931
It's most likely.

271
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:32,131
No way. No matter how much he was off his guard,

272
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,531
that Funaki would never let Saori kill him that easily.

273
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:38,331
If she dropped something,

274
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,631
be it a rock or something from on top the bridge,

275
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,731
the guard at the station at the foot of the bridge

276
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,931
would've seen it.

277
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,631
I confirmed with the security guard,

278
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:53,031
and he said that no one crossed the bridge between 10:00 to 10:30.

279
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:55,831
If so, Saori couldn't have committed the crime.

280
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,431
It would look to be so for everybody.

281
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:04,331
But, this is a carefully planned murder committed by Saori.

282
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,031
It can't be.

283
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,331
Because she told me that

284
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,531
she was in Kutanisuji, but opposite the tracks.

285
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,331
That's right, isn't it, Saori?

286
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,331
Yes.

287
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,331
But at around 7:30 in the morning,

288
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:18,831
the security guard told me that he saw

289
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,431
Ms. Ayukawa go down the steps at the foot of that bridge.

290
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,031
Her going there at that time

291
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,031
has nothing to do with the murder, does it?

292
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,631
Conan.

293
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,031
Yes!

294
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,831
What's this? It's just a plain wooden board.

295
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:38,231
That is a board that Genta and Mitsuhiko

296
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,831
who were on the boat picked up.

297
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,031
They found it where Kutanisuji merges with the main stream.

298
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,531
Ms. Ayukawa used that board.

299
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:48,631
How?

300
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,831
Ms. Ayukawa who went there at 7:30

301
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,531
placed that board

302
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:56,031
right above the place that Mr. Funaki would be standing.

303
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,931
Half of it was suspended in air and balanced very precisely

304
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,131
so it wouldn't fall over.

305
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,831
She then placed a rock on the board.

306
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,231
At 10:07,

307
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:11,431
Ms. Ayukawa appears at the pedestal opposite the bridge

308
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,131
and threw a rock towards Mr. Funaki

309
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,631
who was taking pictures of the trolley.

310
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,231
That's just your imagination.

311
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,731
Do you have evidence to prove that it's a fact?

312
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,531
Mr. Masubuchi, didn't you think it strange that

313
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:51,331
Ms. Ayukawa was going to Kutanisuji?

314
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:55,131
I hear that Kutanisuji is not a good fishing spot.

315
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:59,531
Why did Ms. Aukawa who was aiming for championship go there?

316
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,631
Besides, the handkerchief that is attached to the tip of that line

317
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,331
is Ms. Ayukawa's.

318
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:07,931
You can find handkerchiefs like that anywhere.

319
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,031
Please check that handkerchief.

320
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:12,931
You should get luminol reaction from it.

321
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:14,831
There are no blood stains on it!

322
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:19,431
Ms. Ayukawa, when Ayumi hurt herself yesterday,

323
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,831
you used that handkerchief, didn't you?

324
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,431
A slight amount of Ayumi's blood should've rubbed off

325
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:27,031
on the handkerchief back then.

326
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,531
Of course there is no blood stain anywhere on it now.

327
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,531
But, Ms. Ayukawa,

328
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:34,731
do you know that once a handkerchief is stained with blood,

329
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,631
no matter how clean you wash it,

330
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,431
there will be luminol reaction.

331
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,131
How long has it been

332
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:45,031
since you washed Ayumi's wound for her with it?

333
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,731
Ms. Ayukawa! Why did you kill Mr. Funaki?

334
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,831
He's been blackmailing me since 6 months ago.

335
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:57,631
Saori.

336
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,731
6 months ago, a man called Mr. Kanie

337
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:06,031
was found dead in the same place that Mr. Funaki was found.

338
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:08,131
Mr. Funaki was probably blackmailing you

339
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:11,231
because of something to do with that incident, wasn't he?

340
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,131
I had no intention of killing Mr. Kanie.

341
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,831
Which means you killed that guy called Kanie?

342
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:21,731
We were walking along Kutanisuji.

343
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:25,531
I have no intention of getting married for a while yet.

344
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,231
So, you like Masubuchi after all, don't you?

345
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:33,131
How about it? Please tell me straight!

346
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,131
Saori.

347
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,831
Mr. Funaki saw what happened.

348
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,431
And he blackmailed you.

349
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:50,331
Is that it?

350
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,531
I'll keep it quiet to the police, but for doing that...

351
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,131
I'm in a pinch right now,

352
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,931
could you lend me about 200 thousand yen?

353
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:10,731
This new model camera cost me close to 1 million yen so...

354
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,431
You know what I mean.

355
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:20,931
I paid him three times up to now, a total of 7 million yen.

356
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,331
Then about a half month ago.

357
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:28,531
I hear you signed a contract as a Pacific Sports Advisor!

358
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,931
How much was the contract fee?

359
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,031
It's none of your business.

360
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,531
Oh, well. Please give me 10 million yen.

361
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:41,231
You know what will happen if you refuse, don't you?

362
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:46,531
Since he told me then, that he wanted to take a picture of the trolley,

363
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,831
I figured if I showed him where it is,

364
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,531
so he would surely take pictures under that bridge.

365
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,231
As long as the timing is right,

366
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,431
the corpse would fall on the roof of the trolley

367
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:58,731
and carried to the same place where Mr. Kanie's body was found.

368
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:00,831
That's what you thought, is that right?

369
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:02,731
I figured if things went on as is,

370
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:04,431
I would be blackmailed all my life by that guy.

371
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,431
Then everything ahead of me went black.

372
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:12,731
I'm really sorry that I spoiled your important tournament.

373
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,831
More than for me,

374
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:17,731
I think this contest was more important for you, right?

375
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:27,131
I'm sorry, Father.

376
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:33,131
Ms. Ayukawa, I'd like to hear about everything in more detail

377
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,431
so please come with us to the station.

378
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:36,631
Yes, sir.

379
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,431
Saori.

380
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,631
I'll wait for you no matter how long it takes.

381
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:46,931
Saori.

382
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:18,031
Didn't you think it was fantastic?

383
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,731
Sonoko's deduction.

384
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,331
You can say that again!

385
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:25,131
Really, when did you check all those things out?

386
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:27,431
Well, you see. I've got my ways.

387
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,731
It's a cinch for me.

388
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:32,631
I wonder if I did something so fantastic.

389
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:35,631
What do you mean you got your ways?

390
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:38,731
By the way, how'd you guys do?

391
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:40,331
Did you at least catch one fish?

392
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,831
Well, you see...

393
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:47,731
Catching big fish is more difficult then solving a case!

394
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:50,831
Next time I come, I swear I'll catch a big one.

395
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,231
Aren't you Kazuki Kinukawa the popular child actor

396
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:57,031
who acts in dramas and movies?

397
00:23:57,031 --> 00:24:00,131
Wow, you look cuter in person!

398
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,431
What's with this brat?

399
00:24:02,431 --> 00:24:04,731
It could be that Kazuki's mother

400
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,731
is working here under a different name.

401
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,631
This is?

402
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:12,231
A mole on the woman's breast?

403
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,731
Next Conan,

404
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:22,831
"The Little Client (Part 1)"

405
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,058
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:27,558
"Mole"

407
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:28,958
The stage for the next episode will be Atami.

408
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,058
-Hot spring. -Sweet cake.

409
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:32,804
-Eel over rice. -No, that's not it.
