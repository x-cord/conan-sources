1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,240
At the Mouri Detective Agency,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,140
a man who showed up after following the three ladies,

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,440
intimidated everyone with his gun and bombs,

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
and besieged the entire place.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,040
Pops and Ran who were at the scene,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,940
as well as Sera, who we met during the haunted hotel case,

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,240
all became hostages.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,940
The man's name was Isao Sawaguri.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,740
He's the elder brother of Miku Sawaguri,

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,840
a mystery writer who killed herself at a hot spring inn a month ago.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,440
Sawaguri who refused to believe that his sister committed suicide,

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,440
ordered the great detective Sleeping Kogoro

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,340
to shed some light on the truth.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,640
The three ladies he brought here

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,440
were all amateur mystery writers and friends with Miku.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,340
An unmarried woman who is helping her family's stone-dealer's store,

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Ms. Tamami Mitsui.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,140
Ms. Shinobu Yuchi, the once-divorced,

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,140
who now works at the neighborhood bakery.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,440
And a homemaker and the wife of a seal cutter craftsman,

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,440
Ms. Sumika Nihei.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,740
Sawaguri suspected that one of them murdered his sister

23
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,640
and made it appear to be a suicide.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,240
The three stayed at the same hotel with Miku

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,340
and visited her room in succession

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,740
to have her autograph their books

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,240
just before she died.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,540
Although Miku had been posting what had transpired via SNS,

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,240
she had nicknamed the three Elephant, Fox, and Rat,

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,440
leaving us wondering about who was who and the order of their visits.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,340
The last to have visited Miku's room

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,940
and thought to be responsible

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,640
for disguising her murder as a suicide was the Rat, but who was it?

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,740
But then, Sawaguri announced that once the culprit is revealed,

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,040
he would kill her and commit suicide.

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,540
How am I supposed to rescue Ran

37
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,940
and the others without any fatalities?

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
If all cases were men,

39
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,540
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,240
Adrenaline races at the Detective Agency

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,140
where Ran takes action in a surprising manner.

42
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,379
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Sniping)"

46
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,979
Darn.

47
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,879
Trying to play smart with me, little witch.

48
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
You've got quite the nerve.

49
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,479
You do know what's going to happen, right?

50
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,079
Hold it. It wasn't her, the one who did it was...

51
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,079
It was me.

52
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,979
I was the one who made her do it.

53
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,779
Shinichi Kudo did.

54
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,379
Shinichi Kudo?

55
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,679
Shinichi?

56
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:35,979
Conan's using someone else's voice again.

57
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,279
Yeah.

58
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,079
All right. It's getting pretty late.

59
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,979
Time to get to bed, you guys.

60
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:44,979
-But, we... -Hey, just, hurry.

61
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,479
I thought it'd be best if I could also hear the details of the case,

62
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,579
so that I'd be able to answer your demand.

63
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,379
Unless, you have any objections against my involvement?

64
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,479
No, with a famous high school detective getting involved,

65
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,979
I'm all the more assured.

66
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,079
Then please tell Detective Mouri to take camera phone pictures

67
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,279
of all the case related materials you brought,

68
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,179
and send them to Dr. Agasa's computer.

69
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,779
You should also send along

70
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,479
pictures of the three books Miku autographed.

71
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,679
Also, it'd help if you could put me on a speaker phone.

72
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,879
Yes.

73
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,679
Hey, hustle up and take them.

74
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,579
I know.

75
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,579
Shinichi.

76
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,679
Why is he on Conan's phone?

77
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,079
Judging from the monitor here,

78
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,679
the page appears distorted only on Nihie's autographed copy.

79
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,079
Does it actually look that way?

80
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,879
Yes, only the autographed page is wrinkled

81
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,979
as if it were wet once and then dried.

82
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,179
Don't tell me...

83
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,379
It was you!

84
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,879
It wasn't me.

85
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,179
Plus, if it had gotten wet then,

86
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:01,179
wouldn't the entire book have become wrinkled?

87
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,079
Suppose so.

88
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,079
Next about Yuchi's autographed book,

89
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,679
it looks like a brand-new copy

90
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:11,079
without any finger marks or creases.

91
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,779
Is it really the first edition?

92
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,979
Yes, it does say here that it was from the first printing.

93
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,479
It's because I made sure to keep it safe,

94
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,079
given that it's a precious signed copy.

95
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,079
And as for Mitsui, it's a bit torn, isn't it?

96
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,579
It is. I see the tear mark.

97
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,879
That's because after Miku had finished autographing my book,

98
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,879
she was being mean and wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

99
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,579
Being mean?

100
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,579
That day, I had an upset my stomach

101
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,179
and even though I really had to unload,

102
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:49,979
Miku wouldn't let me use the toilet in her room.

103
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,379
She refused, telling me it was because she was going to use it soon.

104
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,379
But I knew she was just trying to bully me.

105
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,879
Since she also lied about having taken a bath in her room

106
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,679
even though she'd just come back from the large baths.

107
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,879
How'd you know she lied?

108
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,479
Because when I was leaving Miku's room,

109
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,379
I accidently put her slippers on,

110
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,579
and they were soaking wet and warm.

111
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:16,979
When I went to her room,

112
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,679
I lined up her slippers as well

113
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,879
but they were neither wet nor warm at all.

114
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,779
Are you sure you didn't put your own slippers on?

115
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,779
Since it looks like you have greasy skin.

116
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,179
How rude. I have dry skin.

117
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,679
What a noisy bunch of old women.

118
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,879
Cheeping and chirping like a bunch of lilt birds.

119
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,779
Well, I admit I've also been called annoying by my sister,

120
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:45,879
so she gave me the weird nickname of Bush warbler.

121
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,079
Bush warbler?

122
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,779
Bush warbler, Elephant, Fox, and Rat...

123
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,879
I see, I've got it.

124
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Miku's nickname scheme.

125
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,079
It seems this'll come to an end even without having to trouble Kudo.

126
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:16,979
If that's the case, no doubt the culprit is that person.

127
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,279
Looks like you've got that face

128
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,179
you always get when you've figured it out,

129
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,879
but what now?

130
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,379
Even if you've come up with the right culprit,

131
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,479
there'll still be two corpses

132
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,279
hitting the floor in that detective agency.

133
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,679
Hey, what do you mean?

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,379
What you just said about how this might come to an end

135
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,079
without having to trouble Shinichi?

136
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,979
The reason I propped your cell phone open

137
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,379
with the strap mascot and preserved the connection,

138
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,879
was so that Conan could learn about the case

139
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,979
and investigate it for us.

140
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:51,279
The incident happened last month on the 4th,

141
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,179
the same day your neighborhood association

142
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,079
went on their hot spring trip, right?

143
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,979
What's more, the inn they stayed at was, Furitsukaya,

144
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,079
where that bomber man's sister,

145
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,279
novelist Miku Sawaguri, supposedly committed suicide.

146
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,579
Is that so?

147
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,179
Yes. There was a fax with information

148
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,779
about the neighborhood association's hot spring outing

149
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,179
on your papa's desk.

150
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,379
The fact it was left out

151
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,979
means that your papa didn't go on that outing.

152
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,579
Since there were details such as a map to the inn,

153
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,879
and meeting places on the fax,

154
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,979
he would've brought it with him if he had gone,

155
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:30,379
and wouldn't have put it back on his desk upon his return, right?

156
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,979
That's why I left the phone connected,

157
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,379
hoping that Conan would get the story

158
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,379
from those who went to the hot spring trip.

159
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,479
But for some reason,

160
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,479
Shinichi Kudo answered Conan's phone.

161
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:45,279
Well, I don't know what sort of connection Conan has

162
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,279
with that famous high school detective,

163
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,879
but that bomber guy is convinced

164
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,779
that his sister didn't commit suicide,

165
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,779
and that someone among the three killed her,

166
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,479
he plans to commit murder-suicide with the culprit

167
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,879
once he finds out who she is.

168
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,679
So at this point, I have no choice

169
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,279
but to have him negotiate with the bomber man and talk him down

170
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,979
or so I had thought,

171
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:10,779
but now that's not necessary anymore.

172
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,279
How come?

173
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,179
You see that light outside the window?

174
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,979
That's probably proof

175
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:24,579
that the police have arrived at the building across the street.

176
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,679
Sniping Support Unit in position.

177
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,579
We've got eyes-on.

178
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,079
And the Takedown Unit?

179
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,079
In position at the agency entrance.

180
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,079
Ready to break through on your order.

181
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,079
Copy that.

182
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,479
Attention, all units.

183
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,979
Suspect is acting alone,

184
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,679
however we have info that he is armed with a handgun

185
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,179
and has a large number of bombs in possession.

186
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,879
Until I give the order standby

187
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,979
but be ready to move on a moment's notice.

188
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,279
So the police are here?

189
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
First to come was the Special Investigative Team

190
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,079
made up of the Criminal Investigative Department First Division,

191
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,979
abbreviated as SIT.

192
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,979
When hostage-taking incidents occur,

193
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,579
they roll out with heavy equipment,

194
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,179
and if the culprit doesn't respond to persuasion.

195
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,779
They're forcing their way in and taking decisive action.

196
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,479
So even now, they should be on the other side of that door,

197
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:25,079
on the watch for an opportunity to charge in.

198
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,279
What?

199
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,579
The fact that they're on the roof with the intent to snipe

200
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,379
means the Special Assault Team, SAT has also come to back them up.

201
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,379
Did Shinichi call for them?

202
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,079
Well, even if he didn't, they'd still come.

203
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,079
Since in order to evacuate the customers from the shop downstairs,

204
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,779
he'd have to explain the situation to the police.

205
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,879
But, judging from how the police have yet to start talking him down,

206
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,379
it appears they have extreme confidence

207
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,979
in your boyfriend.

208
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,979
He likely requested the police not to make moves

209
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:02,779
and guaranteed to talk the bomber man down himself, I'd wager.

210
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,079
After all, we're dealing with a crazy man

211
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
who has bombs strapped to himself

212
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,679
and his finger hovering over the switch.

213
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,379
If they make the wrong move and barge in

214
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,479
or snipe in a place that isn't a vital point,

215
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,179
it'd enrage him

216
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,679
and he'd press the switch

217
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,479
and we'd be blown to smithereens.

218
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,179
In order for that not to happen,

219
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,879
he'd either need to be persuaded,

220
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,379
or taken down with one shot.

221
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,979
Hey, what's the hold up?

222
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,879
Haven't you figured it out yet, Shinichi Kudo?

223
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,579
I know we already sent them to your computer.

224
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,579
My little sister's posting on SNS just before she was killed.

225
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,079
These postings told of

226
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,179
how my sister let each of these three people into her room,

227
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,479
and how she autographed first-edition copies of her debut work for them.

228
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,979
And the postings were...

229
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:50,279
The first one to come pester me for an autograph was Elephant.

230
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,579
Even though my hair had yet to dry from the bath,

231
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,879
that pesky Elephant.

232
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,679
Next to come was Fox.

233
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,979
Trying to stir up an argument again, freaking annoying.

234
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,679
I've signed my autograph, so why can't you just leave?

235
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,379
The last one was Rat, who can't take a hint.

236
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,779
I'll make short work of the autograph

237
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,779
and shoo her away as soon as possible.

238
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,279
Darn, she's still here.

239
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,779
Oh snaps, I'm getting sleepy.

240
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:15,379
What should I do?

241
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,579
And her posting ends here.

242
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,679
In short...

243
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,779
It was one of these three people,

244
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,379
the ones who were the last to come,

245
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,479
that killed my sister and made it look to be a suicide,

246
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,379
that freaking Rat.

247
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,479
Hey, you guys.

248
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,679
Didn't I tell you to go to bed already?

249
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,579
But, we're so worried that we can't sleep.

250
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,479
And there was something we forgot to mention.

251
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,779
When we went to ask people about the case,

252
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,779
most of the neighborhood association members said...

253
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,379
that about two or three days ago,

254
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,479
a brown-haired man in camouflage

255
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:55,179
had come around asking the same things we did.

256
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,279
That man had shown them a book

257
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,079
and some photographs while asking

258
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,779
whether they had seen any of the three women

259
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,179
loitering around the inn

260
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,879
with his sister's debut book in hand.

261
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,479
I see.

262
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:13,479
So he'd already gone around asking for information.

263
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:17,379
It seems you've also done your own research,

264
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:18,779
How far have you gotten?

265
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:19,779
Well...

266
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,379
I did sniff out a whole lot about these three.

267
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,379
Sumika Nihei is high-strung

268
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,879
and even went as far as to line up

269
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,879
all the slippers of guests she didn't know.

270
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,479
And didn't get along with my sister

271
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,179
who was sloppy in comparison.

272
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,279
And since Shinobu Yuchi had been in the hot spring all the time.

273
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,779
Perhaps she was in fact washing the blood that splattered on her

274
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,479
after cutting my sister's wrist?

275
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,879
And Tamami Mitsui was seen rushing out of my sister's room

276
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,979
with her book in hand

277
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:53,879
by a guest from a room, three doors down.

278
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,279
So, hurry up and tell me.

279
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,679
Which one was it?

280
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,679
The murderer who my sister nicknamed Rat.

281
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,779
How is it?

282
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,379
Can you make the shot?

283
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:05,679
Negative.

284
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,979
The Detective Agency sign on the window glass

285
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,079
and Detective Mouri behind it are blocking the target.

286
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,979
Shinichi.

287
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,379
Perhaps you're thinking,

288
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,679
"Shinichi, why haven't you solved it yet?"

289
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:22,979
It's all right.

290
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,579
I'm sure he's already figured everything out.

291
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,779
That the Rat who killed Miku Sawaguri...

292
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,779
was her, namely Tamai Mitsui.

293
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:36,379
There's only one reason why he's not saying it,

294
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:38,879
once the bomber man knows who the culprit is,

295
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,679
he'll commit murder-suicide with her.

296
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,079
Looks like we'll have to use an alternative method

297
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,579
in order to prevent having two victims.

298
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,779
Although, it'll only turn two into one.

299
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,179
Hey.

300
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,179
That cell phone's been connected for quite a long time,

301
00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,779
how's the battery doing?

302
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,079
Shouldn't we connect it to the AC adapter?

303
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,879
Right, you're right.

304
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,879
If I recall, it's in the drawer of Mr. Kogoro's desk, right?

305
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,379
Did I put it in there?

306
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,779
Hey, take it out now and connect it.

307
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,579
Are you sure?

308
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,179
You don't want to do it yourself?

309
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,579
If Kogoro has a weapon

310
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,979
or something hidden in that drawer,

311
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,679
he could counterattack, you know?

312
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,879
This guy...

313
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,579
Don't tell me...

314
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,079
Out of the way.

315
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,779
I'll find it.

316
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,379
The suspect has moved towards us.

317
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,279
He's in sight.

318
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,279
It's possible to snipe now.

319
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,679
What?

320
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,879
Do we shoot?

321
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,879
Shoot.

322
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,079
Shoot.

323
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:24,246
What the heck are you doing?

324
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,946
Do you want to die?

325
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,546
It's chilly tonight,

326
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,846
so I think it's best to close the curtains.

327
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:33,546
Also, the AC adapter is inside the cabinet,

328
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,346
I'll get it.

329
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,746
The curtains are closed.

330
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:40,046
Sniping the target is no longer possible.

331
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,246
You...

332
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,946
What were you thinking?

333
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,846
I'd hate to see someone die in front of me is all.

334
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,346
What do you mean you'd hate?

335
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,646
Plus...

336
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:51,846
Shinichi would never allow anyone to die.

337
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:52,846
Never.

338
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,346
Now, Shinichi Kudo.

339
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,846
I've sent everything you need for your deduction.

340
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,146
Who the heck killed my little sister?

341
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,846
If you still don't know, then I've got no choice.

342
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:08,046
Hate to do it, but I'll blow this agency to smithereens.

343
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,946
Although all I really want to do

344
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:12,546
is to ice that freaking Rat who killed my sister.

345
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:13,946
It's all right.

346
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,746
Please calm down.

347
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,046
Because I know the identity of the Rat.

348
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,146
Really?

349
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:22,146
Yes.

350
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,746
Don't... don't tell me,

351
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:26,046
he's going to name the culprit?

352
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,146
Shinichi?

353
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,346
I'll start with Elephant,

354
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:33,446
who was the first to visit Miku's room for an autograph.

355
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,246
If her hair hadn't dried from the bath,

356
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,146
her body should've been hot and humid too.

357
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,146
If she were to autograph in such a state,

358
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:44,246
the heat and dampness would wrinkle the paper, right?

359
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:46,846
So that means,

360
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:48,646
the Elephant who came first has got to be

361
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:51,146
the one who has the book with the autographed page wrinkled,

362
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,546
that is, Ms. Nihei.

363
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,446
Nihei has a methodical personality

364
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,146
to the extent of being too high-strung.

365
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,646
Unless something like that happened,

366
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:02,446
I bet she'd never treat the book roughly nor crumple it.

367
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,446
And when Ms. Nihei went to the room,

368
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,446
she said she lined up Miku's slippers too, right?

369
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:14,446
The fact that those slippers were neither wet nor warm...

370
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,246
means that Miku didn't go to the large baths,

371
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:20,246
but without a doubt took a bath in her room.

372
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:24,846
Since taking a bath in her room would not require her to wear slippers.

373
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:30,146
Why, then, were the slippers accidentally worn by Mitsui

374
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:32,546
as she was leaving Miku's room soaking wet

375
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,946
causing Mitsui to mistakenly think

376
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:38,446
that Miku had come back from the large bath?

377
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:42,946
The deal with the slippers was that Yuchi came there

378
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:46,846
shortly after taking a bath.

379
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:50,046
And inadvertently wore Miku's slippers on her way out,

380
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,046
Yuchi's remaining warm and dampened slippers were then worn by Mitsui.

381
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,446
In short, Elephant was Nihei,

382
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:58,146
next to show up was Fox, or Yuchi,

383
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:04,146
and leaving Mitsui to be Rat, the last one to come along.

384
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:06,846
I see, so it was you?

385
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,846
The freaking Rat who killed my sister?

386
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,746
What the...

387
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:13,746
You're only basing that decision off some slippers.

388
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,646
It wasn't just the slippers.

389
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,046
The nicknames Miku gave you all

390
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,746
were in fact based on colors.

391
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,046
Color?

392
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,246
In Japanese,

393
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:26,146
there are colors bearing the names of animals, right?

394
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:28,446
Like camel-color or Japanese ruddy duck-color.

395
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:29,746
Are you sure?

396
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,046
If you keep talking,

397
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,246
we'll really end up with two dead people here, you know?

398
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:35,546
Moreover...

399
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:38,746
Right in front of her, who believes in you.

400
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,146
The fox-color, or golden brown,

401
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,546
would be the color of the bread Yuchi bakes at her workplace.

402
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,246
Elephant means ivory-color,

403
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,746
the color of the seals Nihei's husband carves.

404
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:52,946
Incidentally, Miku's brother Isao's nickname

405
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:57,346
Bush warbler would resemble olive-green.

406
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:59,546
Taken from the name of the survival games

407
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:03,546
team Isao serves as the leader of, the Green Cap.

408
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:07,146
And Rat of course means the grayish rat-color,

409
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:10,746
the color of the stones Mitsui's family stonemasonry business deals with.

410
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:15,346
In other words, the Rat that was the last to show up to Miku's room...

411
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,046
Ms. Mitsui,

412
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,646
it can't be none other than you.

413
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:42,146
Just as expected of the high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

414
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,546
Well done.

415
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:46,046
The dirty Rat, who freaking killed my sister, Miku

416
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:51,146
and made it look like a suicide, Tamami Mitsui...

417
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:54,646
He's made it clear that you were the one.

418
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,146
No, no...

419
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,846
I would never kill Miku.

420
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:00,546
Don't play dumb with me.

421
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:05,446
The famous high school detective is saying you're the culprit.

422
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,846
But... but it really wasn't me...

423
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:14,146
Any excuses you have I'll hear you out on the other side.

424
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:17,346
My sister's waiting in the other world.

425
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:22,046
Well, don't forget, you two karate kittens.

426
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:25,446
About the fact that I've got bombs strapped to my body.

427
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,246
And that as long as I can kill this witch,

428
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:31,546
I don't mind dying.

429
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:34,146
Darn.

430
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:38,146
Shinichi Kudo. What the heck are you going to do?

431
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:40,646
Shinichi, please.

432
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:43,446
Stop Sawaguri.

433
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,246
Shinichi.

434
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,546
I haven't said one word

435
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:13,246
about Mitsui having killed your sister, you know?

436
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:15,146
Then who was it?

437
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,046
Who was the culprit that killed my sister?

438
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:20,946
About your sister's debut work... have you happened to read it?

439
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,446
The title is...

440
00:24:22,446 --> 00:24:24,246
"The Death's Funeral Procession".

441
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,546
Death who killed Miku Sawaguri

442
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:28,546
and made it look like a suicide...

443
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,646
It's you.

444
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,746
Next Conan,

445
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:36,846
"The Case of the Besieged Detective Agency (Release)"

446
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,156
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:41,956
"Toilet".

448
00:24:41,956 --> 00:24:43,856
-Shall I take the stage from here? -No, that's okay.

449
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,356
-What'd you say? -Let Shinichi handle this.

450
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,556
Not you too.
