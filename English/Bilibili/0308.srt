1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,740
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,940
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,040
The unnatural death of the last days of the victim.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,540
A surprising message if found.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,667
Pops takes on the job of searching for the whereabouts

9
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:46,167
of a game system engineer, whose whereabouts became unknown.

10
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,167
But while listening to their story,

11
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,567
I found out that Mr. Itakura

12
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:55,467
had once had contact with the Black Organization.

13
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:00,167
We somehow located the hotel where Mr. Itakura was hiding,

14
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,367
and went there,

15
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,567
but it turned out that he was already dead.

16
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,867
I see.

17
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,567
So Mr. Itakura was probably made to sit in the chair,

18
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,367
tied up with his hands on his chest,

19
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:21,367
and was unable to take his medicine unless somebody helped him drink it.

20
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,667
Then, don't tell me that this is...

21
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:27,667
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

22
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,367
A homicide.

23
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,767
Oh, no.

24
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:43,467
"The Remains of Voiceless Testimony (Part 2)"

25
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,967
"Katsumichi Sugai (39)" -Wait a second.

26
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,067
Why do we have to be suspected?

27
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,767
"Jouhei Naito (47)" -We the ones who asked Kogoro Mouri

28
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,667
to look for Mr. Itakura, you know.

29
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,767
"Ryusuke Soma (44)" -What stupid killer would come back

30
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:01,067
to the scene of a crime and bring a detective along?

31
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,867
I guess so.

32
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,767
If you insist on suspecting us, why don't you show evidence?

33
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,367
Evidence that we came here.

34
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:12,367
Okay, the time's now.

35
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:17,267
If so, why don't you look at the diary in the bag?

36
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,967
That's his bag, isn't it?

37
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,567
Maybe we can find out

38
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,567
who came to visit him before we got here.

39
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:29,667
A "diary" is indeed written on it.

40
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:34,367
Officer Takagi, how do you look at this?

41
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,467
It can easily be viewed with the laptop computer on the desk.

42
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:41,667
But if I were the killer,

43
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,067
I would've gotten rid of something like that a long time ago.

44
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,667
This is it.

45
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:56,167
Mr. Itakura seems to have been keeping a diary every day since 5 years ago.

46
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:01,367
Which means it's in there, I'm sure.

47
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:05,367
The day two years ago when Tequila came to see him should be there.

48
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:09,867
Here it is. This is his most recent diary.

49
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,167
Three days ago.

50
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,867
"The hotel employee said something strange today.

51
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:22,167
Maybe one of the three found out what room I'm in?

52
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:27,067
Oh, well. All I've got to do is change hotels then."

53
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,367
You three are suspicious after all.

54
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,267
Isn't there a continuation to that diary?

55
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,067
No, there's none.

56
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,667
Then, I'll go put it back where it was.

57
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,667
Oh, okay.

58
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,667
All right.

59
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,667
No.

60
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,267
We'll pass it on to the forensic officers just to be on the safe side.

61
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,267
I agree.

62
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:56,267
Shoots. If the police take it with them,

63
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,267
I won't ever get to see it again.

64
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:01,367
I've got to find the killer among the three as soon a possible

65
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,267
and prove that the diary has nothing to do with the murder.

66
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:11,167
Cool head. I'm sure that something's been overlooked.

67
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,567
That is, the clue to who the killer is.

68
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,967
Excuse me, inspector.

69
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:20,467
-What is it? -About the right ankle of the corpse...

70
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,167
Traces of his socks are left as seen by congested blood on his left leg,

71
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,567
while his right leg...

72
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,067
Take a look at this, no traces are left on his right leg.

73
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,867
On the other hand, on his right ankle,

74
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,367
there are traces of what look to be scratch marks

75
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,167
that seem to have been made by the toenail of his left foot.

76
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,167
Which means that Mr. Itakura

77
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:42,167
tried to take the socks off from his right leg.

78
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,767
But why?

79
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,767
He was tied up in a place like this,

80
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,767
but why did he...

81
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,867
take off his socks?

82
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:04,067
I see, he did so to leave this behind.

83
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,967
No doubt about it. That person's the killer.

84
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,067
Moreover, if I use this to my advantage,

85
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,467
I can even get a hold of the diary, too.

86
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:21,367
All right. Please take care of the autopsy, coroner.

87
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,867
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:27,667
Officer Takagi, give the diary of the victim to the forensic officer.

89
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,767
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,267
The point in question

91
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,867
is the one who orders Mr. Itakura to make the game software

92
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,467
and found Mr. Itakura's corpse.

93
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,267
The three of you who all employees of the same game company.

94
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,867
We're not from the same company.

95
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,567
We're all from different companies.

96
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,467
I am Sugai who asked him to make an Igo software.

97
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:50,567
I'm Naito who asked him to make a chess software.

98
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:54,367
I'm Soma. I ordered a shogi software.

99
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,667
Please, let us go already.

100
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,967
We just happened to be brought here to this room

101
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,767
by Mr. Mouri who located where Mr. Itakura was.

102
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:10,367
Inspector, what about me?

103
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:16,667
Well, we know now that Mr. Itakura had been killed by someone,

104
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:20,667
but we don't have all the evidence to specify the killer.

105
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,067
I would like the Mouri group and all of you

106
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,467
to come over to the station at a later date.

107
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,767
Oh, great.

108
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,067
I was concerned about whether the drama

109
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,367
that I've been recording was being recorded right.

110
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,967
So, I guess I'll do as you say for now and...

111
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,267
No, I can't afford to leave just like that.

112
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:45,167
Oh, no. I mean, well...

113
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,067
Who was that?

114
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,867
I'm saying that we can't let the suspects leave this place.

115
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,267
Because the killer

116
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,367
is rejoicing with both arms open...

117
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:04,467
in front of our very eyes, thinking,

118
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:09,067
"How lucky that Inspector Megure is a klutz".

119
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,767
What?

120
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,067
Hey, Dad!

121
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,767
How rude!

122
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,167
Shape up, Pops.

123
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,967
Saying all you did, Mouri.

124
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,667
I hope you know

125
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,567
who killed Mr. Itakura!

126
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:30,767
Yes. Mr. Itakura himself told me.

127
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:39,767
Hey, don't tell me that you heard the voice of the corpse?

128
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,067
No way.

129
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,467
His ankle.

130
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,467
Inspector, you saw it too, didn't you?

131
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:50,667
Only Mr. Itakura's right ankle had no traces of socks being worn.

132
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:55,367
That's because the killer who came back to this room

133
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,067
after Mr. Itakura died,

134
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:00,667
thought that just one foot wearing a sock

135
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:04,467
would look unnatural and put in back on him.

136
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:10,967
Now, why did Mr. Itakura have to be barefooted?

137
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,667
Why?

138
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,167
It's because unless he is barefooted,

139
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,567
he couldn't grab a certain thing or order of something.

140
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,967
Grab something? Grab what?

141
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,267
Could it be...

142
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,267
Yes.

143
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:33,867
Mr. Itakura used the time he had before his heart medicine wore out

144
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:37,667
and wrote the following with his right foot.

145
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,667
A dying message

146
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,167
that indicates who the killer is.

147
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:53,147
This is his dying message?

148
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:55,647
What on earth is written?

149
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:59,547
It looks nothing more than an incomplete game of Igo.

150
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,047
Inspector, please help me,

151
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:05,747
so that I can explain it simply and clearly.

152
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:09,147
Officer Takagi. Please give the disc with the diary inside

153
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:14,647
and the unopened disc that was in Mr. Itakura's bag to the inspector.

154
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,747
All right.

155
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,347
After that,

156
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:22,747
please sit at the desk where the laptop computer is, inspector.

157
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:32,947
But what does this have to do with the dying message?

158
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,847
I'll explain later.

159
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,247
Will you please boot up the computer first of all?

160
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:41,347
Boot up?

161
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:49,847
Boot up.

162
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:57,747
Boot up?

163
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:00,947
Boot...

164
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,947
up.

165
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:07,947
Inspector, to boot means to start the computer.

166
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:13,347
I'm just joking, I'm joking.

167
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:18,147
Next, move the data of the diary onto the desktop,

168
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,247
and put that into the empty disc.

169
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,247
Open it, move it and put it in?

170
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,747
Oh, so all you have to do is copy the data

171
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:29,747
of the diary into the empty disc.

172
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,047
Like so.

173
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:36,847
"Copying from Disk to Desktop"

174
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,047
"Complete"

175
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,047
Hey, Mouri.

176
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,547
Don't tell me that you're doing this

177
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,847
to make fun of me not being digital minded.

178
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:47,547
And then finally, please turn the computer off.

179
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:50,347
I can do that.

180
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,047
Why?

181
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,447
What's the matter?

182
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,747
Oh, that's...

183
00:11:56,747 --> 00:12:00,147
Don't help him, Officer Takagi.

184
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:04,547
These electronic goods, I tell you...

185
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:09,447
You do this, and they all switch off!

186
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:15,247
You shouldn't pull the plug out abruptly like that!

187
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,647
Doing so may destroy the data within the computer

188
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:20,147
or cause damage.

189
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:23,947
But it didn't switch off even if I pushed the switch.

190
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,247
For safety reasons,

191
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,347
it's made so that you have to push the button for a while

192
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,047
before the computer switches off.

193
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,747
That's right.

194
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,247
That is a prohibited strategy

195
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,747
that computer users should not do.

196
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:41,147
And words like "boot" and "open"

197
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:43,147
are terms that are incomprehensible

198
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:46,247
unless the person uses the computer on a daily basis.

199
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:50,747
You've already figured out what's written on that Igo board, haven't you?

200
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,147
Do you understand?

201
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,447
No.

202
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,647
Isn't there something strange about this Igo stone?

203
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,747
What's strange about it?

204
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:09,147
Because when playing Igo,

205
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,947
if you surround your opponent's stone, you've got to take it,

206
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:16,147
and to leave a stone surrounded is a prohibited strategy.

207
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,847
Prohibited strategy?

208
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:21,347
There is some meaning to this Igo stone after all.

209
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,547
But, what could it be?

210
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:30,747
Okay, while everyone is distracted with their attention on the Igo stone,

211
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:33,047
I'll take out the disc with the copy of the diary.

212
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,047
What are you doing, Conan?

213
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,247
Ran.

214
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,747
Hey, didn't you hide something just now?

215
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:42,747
I didn't hide anything.

216
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,747
What are you doing then?

217
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:48,547
I thought they sort of looked like Igo stones.

218
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:52,747
The strange patterns on the seals that are pasted onto the keyboard.

219
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,047
Patterns? Isn't this Braille?

220
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,547
Come to think of it,

221
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:04,347
Mr. Itakura's vision, just like mine was getting pretty bad,

222
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:07,247
so he told me he was learning Braille.

223
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,247
Braille?

224
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:10,647
I get it!

225
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:11,847
So this is what Mr. Mouri was referring to when he said,

226
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,547
"Words that only people who know can understand".

227
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,947
Could this be Braille?

228
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:20,247
What do you think?

229
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:25,047
No. No form of Braille looks like this.

230
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:29,547
Oh, but if you ignore the white stones, it's readable.

231
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:30,847
And?

232
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,447
Well, it said,

233
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,247
"The killer is...

234
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,947
Soma".

235
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,047
"The evidence is

236
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:45,947
the watch."

237
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,247
Mr. Soma.

238
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,347
No way. Are you the killer?

239
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,647
Hey, how come it turns out like that?

240
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:57,147
Maybe somebody's trying to frame me or something.

241
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,947
No, you're the killer.

242
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:02,647
The reason is that you don't know about Igo nor Braille.

243
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,347
Therefore, the killer is the one

244
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:06,147
who still has conclusive evidence on him,

245
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,847
that's you, Mr. Soma...

246
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,847
Wait a minute, Mouri.

247
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,747
Don't talk so fast,

248
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:15,247
and please explain things in order as you usually do.

249
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,347
The reason why he's the killer and the evidence that shows he is.

250
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:22,347
Don't rush things. Cool head.

251
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:25,647
The copy of the diary is already in my hands.

252
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:30,047
Cool head, cool head.

253
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:37,347
Right, when Mr. Itakura left this dying message,

254
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:40,047
this is probably what he thought.

255
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:45,247
That the killer would return to this room for sure after he died

256
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:49,747
in order to undo the masking tape that is wrapped up in.

257
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,847
That's why he used this code

258
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:55,547
that Mr. Soma wouldn't be able to read or even suspect.

259
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,547
And besides, if his corpse is found,

260
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:02,047
you three would be questioned by the police

261
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,747
and it is certain that you will be shown the picture of this Igo Board.

262
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:11,947
He figured that Mr. Naito whose vision is bad enough

263
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,347
to have to trace the Braille in the elevator,

264
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:16,247
would read the Braille code

265
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:19,647
and that Mr. Sugai who asked him to make the Igo software

266
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,847
would think the prohibited strategy strange,

267
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,147
and that he would realize that this is some kind of code.

268
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,347
I see.

269
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:30,147
What about the watch which is the evidence?

270
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:34,047
The watch that Mr. Soma still has on him.

271
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:38,347
Mr. Itakura disappeared

272
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:41,847
and confined himself to this room a week ago.

273
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:44,447
Mr. Itakura is really finicky when it comes to watches

274
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,847
and has bad vision.

275
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,647
When you first came into this room,

276
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:53,247
I'm sure Mr. Itakura naturally took it and looked at it.

277
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,547
The wristwatch that is your pride and joy.

278
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,147
I see.

279
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:01,047
If his fingerprints are on the wristwatch

280
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:02,447
that would be evidence.

281
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:03,847
Yes.

282
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,747
Mr. Itakura who has turned corpse

283
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:08,147
and meets his killer again after a week,

284
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:10,647
could not have touched Mr. Soma's watch

285
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:13,747
that was bought 5 days ago.

286
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,847
Mr. Soma,

287
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,247
could we have the forensic officers check your wristwatch then?

288
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,447
Yes, go on and check it.

289
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:30,447
I'm sure that his prints will be found all over the place.

290
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:34,747
I put a sleeping drug into his wine

291
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:37,647
while he was absorbed in this wristwatch,

292
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:41,547
put him to sleep and wrapped him tightly with masking tape.

293
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:47,747
20 years ago, when he was a no-name game creator

294
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:51,747
and I was a green-horn that just entered the game company,

295
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:55,747
we were shogi pals who used to go to play shogi together.

296
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:59,247
We used to talk a lot while drinking together.

297
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,347
And we talked of making a shogi software

298
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:06,947
that would outdo the masters of shogi when we became big shots.

299
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:10,647
But three days ago, when I finally found where he was,

300
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:14,947
he said to me as I walked into his room,

301
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:19,547
"How many times do you think we should allow a person to call wait?"

302
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:24,047
What a laugh, don't you think?

303
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,647
I collected cash from the master play games

304
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,947
and kept sending it to him for 20 years.

305
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:31,447
And all I had to go on were his words, "The time is ripe".

306
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,747
I went into a great amount of debt investing in him, too.

307
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,647
And yet, he has the nerve to say, "Wait"

308
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:39,347
to a real master of shogi software

309
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:42,747
that was supposed to have been completed.

310
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,947
I told him I was going to get some wine to energize him

311
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,747
and left the room.

312
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:51,147
I bought some sleeping drug and masking tape along with the wine.

313
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:58,347
I didn't refuse your offer to make Kogoro Mouri search for him

314
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:02,647
because I wanted to avoid being suspected even slightly later.

315
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:05,947
After all, I used to talk stink about Itakura at the company a lot

316
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,747
because he wouldn't get to making the shogi software

317
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:12,947
but became famous as a computer graphics designer.

318
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:18,747
But 20 years was much too long a wait for both of us.

319
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,547
Being apart changes people...

320
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:24,547
Their hearts, their dreams. Everything.

321
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,747
If I can call "wait" to life,

322
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,447
I'd like to go back to 20 years ago.

323
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:39,047
To the time when we both held the same dream.

324
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:15,247
See you, Ran.

325
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:18,747
I still have some things to talk over with this groggy father of yours here

326
00:21:18,747 --> 00:21:20,647
so if you're going home, hail a cab or something and...

327
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,847
No, because it only takes about 30 minutes to walk home from here.

328
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,547
Bye, inspector!

329
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:49,747
I have it. It's right here.

330
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:56,247
In my pocket, the clue to those men in the Black Organization.

331
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:00,147
Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's house

332
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,847
and check this disk thoroughly.

333
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,547
Conan?

334
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:09,047
I wonder if people change.

335
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:14,847
If they're apart, will their feelings change?

336
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:22,147
It's kind of tough

337
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:24,347
to just keep on waiting.

338
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:29,047
You don't have to worry about Shinichi.

339
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,147
I think he's just the way you picture him to be, Ran.

340
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:35,747
So, I don't think you have to worry about him at all.

341
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:41,847
It would be nice if you were Shinichi, Conan.

342
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,047
How stupid of me, what on earth am I talking about?

343
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,447
Ran, that's not it.

344
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:56,847
I...

345
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,347
Actually, I am...

346
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,747
No. I can't tell her.

347
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:06,247
Not until I disclose their identity.

348
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:09,647
Until I crush them.

349
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:12,947
I can't tell anybody about me.

350
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,047
You're...

351
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:47,947
"Next Episode" -This disc with Mr. Itakura's diary in it...

352
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:50,447
I'm going to check it thoroughly

353
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,647
and figure out

354
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,647
