1
00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.102
My name's Conan Edogawa.

2
00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:04.902
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:05.332 --> 00:00:06.792
Although smaller,
my intelligence remains the same!

4
00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.662
I solve cases not even adults can!

5
00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:13.252
Sorry for the wait!
Today's Conan is a one-hour special!

6
00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:15.422
The Piano Sonata "Moonlight" Murders.

7
00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:53.086
The Piano Sonata "Moonlight" Murders.

8
00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:07.546
Why does the famous detective Kogoro
Mori have to go to a stupid island

9
00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:12.966
when he could be spending his
time at a flower viewing party?!

10
00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:17.116
It's all because of that letter
I got a week ago!

11
00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.666
On the night of the next full moon,

12
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.626
shadows will once again begin to
disappear from Tsukikage Island.

13
00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:24.416
Investigate. Keiji Aso.

14
00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:27.956
Mori Detective Agency.

15
00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:30.416
Two days until the next full moon.

16
00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.666
I've transferred half a million
to your bank account.

17
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:34.666
You had best come.

18
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.546
Hold on! Who the heck are you?!

19
00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:41.606
Keiji Aso from Tsukikage Island.

20
00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:44.546
Hey, wait! Hello?!

21
00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:47.716
He didn't even bother for me
to accept him as a client or not!

22
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.376
What's to complain about?

23
00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:52.166
At least we get to relax
on a small island near Izu!

24
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.886
Right, Conan-kun?

25
00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:57.856
Tsukikage Island

26
00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.956
Keiji Aso...

27
00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:03.756
I don't see anyone
by that name in here...

28
00:03:03.756 --> 00:03:06.336
Look harder, could you?!

29
00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:08.526
I have a letter from him
right here, after all...

30
00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.956
But he's not in the list of residents,

31
00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:15.126
and I just moved to this island,
so I don't know that much about--

32
00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:16.536
Is something the matter?

33
00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:21.876
Chief, it seems that these people
have been hired by a resident here...

34
00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:23.006
Hired?

35
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.376
That's right.
By someone named Keiji Aso...

36
00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:30.356
What? Did you say Keiji Aso?!

37
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:42.036
That's not possible!
He's been dead for over 10 years!

38
00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:53.206
He was a famous pianist who was born
and raised on this island.

39
00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:56.316
It was the night of a full moon,
12 years ago...

40
00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.416
It was his first time home
in a long time,

41
00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:03.206
so he held a concert in
the town's community center.

42
00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:06.996
But afterwards, he suddenly shut his family
and himself inside their home

43
00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:07.936
and lit the place on fire!

44
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.756
He allegedly stabbed his wife
and daughter to death

45
00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:16.096
and then continued to play
the piano as the fire raged on,

46
00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.306
almost as if he was
possessed by something.

47
00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:24.506
Beethoven's piano sonata...
"Moonlight."

48
00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:31.126
A letter from a dead man...

49
00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.126
What a nasty prank.

50
00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:34.796
That's not necessarily the case.

51
00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:40.096
Your fee was paid, plus the letter
was postmarked from this island.

52
00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:45.916
I bet someone on the island wants
you to look into Keiji Aso's affairs!

53
00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:51.666
The mayor here used to
be a good friend of his,

54
00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.756
maybe he can tell us something!

55
00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:54.916
Yeah...

56
00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:58.386
They said the mayor's over
at the community center, right?

57
00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:02.296
Now then, Kenta-kun. Make sure
to keep warm when you sleep.

58
00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:04.006
Okay, I will! Bye!

59
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:04.916
Bye!

60
00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:07.516
Excuse me!

61
00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:09.876
Where is the community center?

62
00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:14.796
You turn that corner
and then keep going straight.

63
00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:17.456
Wait, are you folks from Tokyo?!

64
00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.116
That's right. We got
off the ship just now.

65
00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:22.756
I live in Tokyo too!

66
00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:25.836
But this island is so much nicer,
wouldn't you agree?

67
00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:29.166
The air's fresh, and it's nice and quiet!

68
00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:33.256
Protect the island's fishing industry!
Vote for Masato Shimizu!

69
00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.166
Well, maybe not too quiet.

70
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:37.506
The mayoral election
is coming up, you see.

71
00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:39.466
The mayoral election, huh?

72
00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:43.546
The candidates are Shimizu-san,
who represents the fishermen,

73
00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:47.456
current mayor Kuroiwa-san,
whose popularity is dwindling as of late,

74
00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:50.396
and Kawashima-san,
the wealthiest man on the island.

75
00:05:51.126 --> 00:05:53.366
My patients have been telling me
that Kawashima-san will probably--

76
00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:57.936
That's alright, Nurse. We're not really
that interested in the election...

77
00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:01.006
That's Doctor Narumi Asai.

78
00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:02.656
I have an actual license, you know!

79
00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:05.336
Oh, you're a doctor...

80
00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:07.506
If you folks are headed
to the community center,

81
00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.716
you can meet the three of them there!

82
00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:13.796
Tonight they're holding a 3rd-year
memorial for Kameyama-san,

83
00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.216
our previous mayor.

84
00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:17.626
Your previous mayor?

85
00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:19.186
A 3rd-year memorial?

86
00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:21.176
Don't let the mayor
continue his reign of terror!

87
00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:24.706
Don't let the mayor
continue his reign of terror!

88
00:06:24.706 --> 00:06:26.396
Give me a break.

89
00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:31.096
How dare they do this on the night
of the previous mayor's memorial?!

90
00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:34.506
They're really getting on my nerves!

91
00:06:34.506 --> 00:06:38.576
Hirata! What're you doing?!
Shut them up already!

92
00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.446
Yes, ma'am!

93
00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.796
Don't let the mayor continue
his reign of terror!

94
00:06:44.796 --> 00:06:46.506
Hey, everything okay?

95
00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.546
Is what okay, Shuichi?

96
00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:52.536
They're saying this election ain't
looking so good for your old man.

97
00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:57.876
Indeed. It would seem the citizens
favor me the most.

98
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:02.256
That's only because
you know how to use money.

99
00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:04.386
Which I learned from you, of course.

100
00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:07.606
There's a man here
who wants to see the mayor!

101
00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:09.506
Who is it, at a time like this?!

102
00:07:09.506 --> 00:07:12.336
A detective from Tokyo...

103
00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:14.726
What? A detective?!

104
00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:20.006
Come on, how long are
they going to make me wait?!

105
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.696
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?

106
00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:25.616
A piano...

107
00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:29.456
Stop that, Conan-kun!

108
00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:33.376
Huh? What a huge room!

109
00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:37.026
So the rear of the community center
is on the water's edge...

110
00:07:37.876 --> 00:07:40.336
This piano sure is dirty...

111
00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.636
You'd think they could at least
clean it once in a while...

112
00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:45.886
No, don't touch that!

113
00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:52.976
That's the cursed piano that
Aso-san played the day he died!

114
00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:56.186
Cursed? Give me a break...

115
00:07:56.186 --> 00:07:58.456
Aso-san wasn't the only one!

116
00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:01.416
The same thing happened
to the last mayor!

117
00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:02.796
You mean Isamu Kameyama-san,

118
00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:05.226
the person they're holding
the memorial for today?

119
00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:09.296
Yes. It happened 2 years ago.

120
00:08:10.956 --> 00:08:13.236
It was the night of a full moon.

121
00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:17.706
I was passing by the community center,
which should have been empty,

122
00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:20.446
when I heard the sounds of
a piano coming from inside.

123
00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:25.456
When I called out to see who
was there, the music stopped.

124
00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:30.626
Inside, I found Kameyama-san!

125
00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:32.626
He had died of a heart attack.

126
00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.546
And the music he had been
playing before he died

127
00:08:35.546 --> 00:08:40.836
was the same piece Aso-san had
performed in the fire: "Moonlight."

128
00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:47.476
After that, this piano came to
be known as the Cursed Piano.

129
00:08:50.376 --> 00:08:51.296
Conan-kun!

130
00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:54.326
Seems normal enough to me.

131
00:08:55.666 --> 00:08:59.076
Anyway, please wait by the front door
until the memorial is over!

132
00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:02.666
Oh, you're still here?

133
00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:05.206
Narumi-san! Are you
going to the memorial?

134
00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:10.956
Yes. Kameyama-san was the first person
I autopsied when I came here.

135
00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:12.676
I thought I would burn
some incense in his honor.

136
00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:16.866
Oh, this is Shimizu-san.
I happened to meet him on the way.

137
00:09:16.866 --> 00:09:20.606
Hello, my name's Shimizu.
lt's nice to meet you!

138
00:09:28.086 --> 00:09:29.546
Hey, Kawashima.

139
00:09:29.546 --> 00:09:33.956
You hired a detective to dig up
some dirt on me, didn't you?!

140
00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:34.616
Don't be stupid.

141
00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:37.216
Running away?!

142
00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:39.666
Bathroom.

143
00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:45.876
It's strange.

144
00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:49.046
That piano should have remained
unused for years now,

145
00:09:49.046 --> 00:09:51.256
but it produced a perfect sound.

146
00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:54.086
Someone must be tuning it secretly.

147
00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:55.776
For some purpose...

148
00:09:56.206 --> 00:10:00.746
And what exactly was
that letter trying to say?

149
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:10.826
This song!

150
00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:14.756
...Moonlight! Oh no!

151
00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:15.406
Conan-kun!

152
00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:19.876
Hey! Little boy!

153
00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:25.776
It's Kawashima-san!

154
00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:27.336
Too late!

155
00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:32.596
He's dead.

156
00:10:33.006 --> 00:10:34.276
What?!

157
00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:37.546
Ran. Contact the local police station!

158
00:10:37.546 --> 00:10:38.546
Right!

159
00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:41.796
Dr. Narumi. Please inspect the body.

160
00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:42.286
Right.

161
00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:44.876
Now I see!

162
00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:48.166
That letter warned that another
person on Tsukikage Island

163
00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:51.196
would die on the night of a full moon!

164
00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:56.466
It's the curse!
It's the curse of the piano!

165
00:10:57.626 --> 00:11:02.786
There's no curse. It's this tape recorder
that's playing the music.

166
00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:09.716
This was a murder designed to resemble
the previous two incidents!

167
00:11:10.126 --> 00:11:11.676
Murder?!

168
00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:14.256
Hey now, don't be getting
ahead of yourself.

169
00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:16.386
Who the hell are you, anyway?!

170
00:11:17.296 --> 00:11:21.626
I'm a famous detective from Tokyo--
Kogoro Mori!

171
00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:23.796
Oh, the astronaut?

172
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:27.336
No, he's the one in
all those mystery novels.

173
00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:29.006
That's Akechi.

174
00:11:29.006 --> 00:11:30.736
Then who's this?

175
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.406
Seawater.

176
00:11:37.626 --> 00:11:40.876
Approximate time of death
was 30 minutes to an hour ago.

177
00:11:40.876 --> 00:11:42.826
He probably died of suffocation.

178
00:11:43.296 --> 00:11:46.756
My guess is that Kawashima-san drowned.

179
00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:48.296
Drowned by someone?

180
00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:51.836
I can't say any more
without performing an autopsy.

181
00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.226
I think Dr. Narumi is right.

182
00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:56.836
See, there's a suit jacket
on the beach outside.

183
00:11:56.836 --> 00:11:59.426
I bet it belongs to Kawashima-san.

184
00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:04.046
There's a trail of water here that
goes from the door to the piano

185
00:12:04.046 --> 00:12:07.126
and there's mud and sand
on Kawashima-san's back.

186
00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:11.376
And judging from the fact that the door
and windows were all locked,

187
00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:15.656
and that the first few minutes
of the cassette tape are blank...

188
00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:18.476
When did he become so...?

189
00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:22.756
The killer probably took Kawashima-san
to the ocean during the memorial,

190
00:12:22.756 --> 00:12:24.166
drowned him,

191
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.046
dragged the body into this room,

192
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:27.166
locked the door,

193
00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:30.056
turned the tape recorder on,
and then exited into the hallway.

194
00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:31.586
Right?

195
00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:34.706
Y-Yeah, sounds about right to me!

196
00:12:36.916 --> 00:12:39.736
Assuming the door
to this room was locked,

197
00:12:40.546 --> 00:12:43.206
there's a high possibility the killer
returned to the memorial afterwards,

198
00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.446
since we were at the
front door the whole time!

199
00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:48.456
Hold on just a second!

200
00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:50.966
Are you saying the killer's
still among us?!

201
00:13:04.946 --> 00:13:07.936
Yes, the killer is in this very room.

202
00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:12.276
Did anyone here see Kawashima-san
leave his seat?

203
00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:16.736
I saw him. He said he was
going to the restroom.

204
00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:20.566
Did anybody see anyone else
leave their seat?

205
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.696
As if we could remember
every little thing that happened.

206
00:13:23.696 --> 00:13:28.326
In that case, did anyone have
any grudges with Kawashima-san?

207
00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:30.026
It's not exactly a grudge,

208
00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:34.446
but the person most happy about
his death would be Shimizu-kun,

209
00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:37.066
his opponent in the mayoral election!

210
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:41.056
What?! The same goes for you,
Mayor Kuroiwa!

211
00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.066
Yes, without Kawashima-san,

212
00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:45.656
Daddy's victory would
practically be guaranteed!

213
00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:47.316
As long as a certain someone

214
00:13:47.316 --> 00:13:50.856
wasn't plotting to steal
Kawashima-san's votes, of course.

215
00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:51.696
What?!

216
00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.646
Now, now, there!

217
00:13:52.946 --> 00:13:54.856
Calm down now...

218
00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:59.196
But why did the killer
put the body in this room?

219
00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:04.026
Because the killer wanted to place
the blame on the cursed piano.

220
00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:06.536
Say, just how long has
this piano been here?

221
00:14:06.536 --> 00:14:11.956
It's been here ever since
Aso-san donated it 15 years ago.

222
00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:15.026
Aso-san, eh?

223
00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:18.566
Yes. His name is even
on the keyboard lid.

224
00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:21.666
What's this?

225
00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.026
It's sheet music.

226
00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:29.846
That's strange. This wasn't here
when we checked this afternoon.

227
00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:38.066
Who was that?

228
00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.486
Nishimoto-san.

229
00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:41.986
He did rather well
for himself back in the day.

230
00:14:41.986 --> 00:14:45.906
I hear he spent lots of money
on alcohol, women, and gambling...

231
00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:49.026
But after the mayor died 2 years ago,

232
00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:52.916
he stopped going out, almost as if
he were afraid of something.

233
00:14:52.916 --> 00:14:53.856
I see.

234
00:14:53.856 --> 00:14:57.096
Wasn't he a childhood
friend of yours, Mayor?

235
00:14:58.026 --> 00:15:00.806
Yes, I suppose you could say that...

236
00:15:02.486 --> 00:15:03.566
Here's a policeman!

237
00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:04.776
You're late, Ran!

238
00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:08.816
But I had to look for him,
he wasn't at the police station!

239
00:15:09.236 --> 00:15:11.526
Who called for me now?

240
00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:14.436
This gentleman here.
His name is Kogoro Mori.

241
00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:16.406
Oh, the famous--

242
00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.066
That's right!

243
00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:18.356
Astronaut!

244
00:15:18.356 --> 00:15:20.386
No...

245
00:15:20.776 --> 00:15:23.276
At any rate, it's getting late.

246
00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:26.476
We can put off collecting information
until tomorrow morning.

247
00:15:26.476 --> 00:15:30.696
This was no murder.
It was Aso-san's curse.

248
00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.076
How horrifying...

249
00:15:33.026 --> 00:15:37.606
They should just burn
that creepy old piano!

250
00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:42.146
Yeah. Maybe we'd be better off
without that thing.

251
00:15:43.316 --> 00:15:44.476
Shuichi?

252
00:15:46.416 --> 00:15:49.656
Your deductions sure
surprised me, Conan-kun!

253
00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:52.156
He loves playing detective!

254
00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:55.826
Everyone was talking about
how amazing his persuasiveness was!

255
00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:58.236
I was just pretending
to be like Detective Kogoro!

256
00:15:58.236 --> 00:16:00.926
I always get to see him at work!

257
00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:06.026
He's just a baby chick
compared to me, though!

258
00:16:06.026 --> 00:16:08.656
Well, we'll head back to the hotel now.

259
00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:12.946
I'll see you later then. Please solve
this case as quickly as possible.

260
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:15.996
I'd rather not have to
examine any more bodies.

261
00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:20.066
Don't you worry! This'll be a
piece of cake with me at the helm!

262
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:25.486
Whatever. Not even I really know
what's going on yet...

263
00:16:27.606 --> 00:16:28.856
Wait a second!

264
00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:32.196
That letter said, "begin to disappear"...

265
00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:36.056
Meaning this isn't over yet!

266
00:16:36.056 --> 00:16:39.776
What? This murder spree
has yet to continue?

267
00:16:39.776 --> 00:16:42.706
This letter gives warning about that?

268
00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:46.406
"Shadows disappearing"
means "being enveloped by light."

269
00:16:46.406 --> 00:16:50.696
Light stands for the song played at
all the murder scenes--Moonlight!

270
00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:52.236
Now I see!

271
00:16:52.236 --> 00:16:55.666
The song Mr. Aso played
in the fire 12 years ago...

272
00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:59.726
And the song the mayor played
before he died 2 years ago...

273
00:17:00.236 --> 00:17:02.906
It was Beethoven's
piano sonata, Moonlight.

274
00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:07.066
And all three incidents have
taken place beside the piano.

275
00:17:07.406 --> 00:17:09.106
You two go back to the hotel!

276
00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:09.836
Wait!

277
00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:15.016
Ran! Let's go to the
community center too!

278
00:17:18.446 --> 00:17:21.026
You're crazy if you ask me.

279
00:17:21.026 --> 00:17:23.236
Spending a night
with a corpse like this...

280
00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.556
And with a kid, too!

281
00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:28.446
I thought I told you to go back!

282
00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:30.356
But Conan-kun...

283
00:17:30.356 --> 00:17:33.756
Tell me, who moved the body
without permission?

284
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.446
Me.

285
00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:39.746
I felt bad for the poor guy,
being stuck in that position...

286
00:17:40.106 --> 00:17:41.776
You really shouldn't have,

287
00:17:41.776 --> 00:17:43.566
we're not through investigating
the crime scene yet...

288
00:17:43.566 --> 00:17:45.586
Huh? The sheet music's gone.

289
00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:46.806
What?!

290
00:17:47.236 --> 00:17:50.886
Oh, I took that so it
wouldn't get lost. See?

291
00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.356
Stupid old geezer...

292
00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:53.656
Huh?

293
00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:55.606
This sheet music is for Moonlight!

294
00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:55.976
What?!

295
00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:57.356
Moonlight?!

296
00:18:05.446 --> 00:18:07.196
What're you doing? You suck!

297
00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:10.956
No, this fourth bar is weird...

298
00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.696
Fourth bar?

299
00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:14.246
Maybe this sheet music is actually...

300
00:18:15.196 --> 00:18:17.156
...Kawashima-san's dying message...

301
00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:20.606
If so, then the killer
might come back for it!

302
00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:22.236
Pardon me...

303
00:18:22.606 --> 00:18:26.026
When I asked for you at the hotel,
they said you were all here...

304
00:18:26.026 --> 00:18:27.606
Dr. Narumi...

305
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.476
I brought some dinner.

306
00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.156
Come to think of it...

307
00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:33.926
...we could use some food...

308
00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:40.656
So you're not originally from
this island then, Dr. Narumi?

309
00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:43.896
No. I return to Tokyo
on the weekends.

310
00:18:43.896 --> 00:18:46.066
It's almost like I work
as a part-time doctor here!

311
00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:48.986
I've always wanted to work
on a small island like this,

312
00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:53.106
surrounded by nature...

313
00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:55.076
I've been working here for 2 years now!

314
00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:57.026
Dr. Narumi.

315
00:18:57.026 --> 00:19:03.186
Did Mayor Kameyama really die
of a heart attack two years ago?

316
00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:06.886
Yes. He had always had heart troubles...

317
00:19:06.886 --> 00:19:09.946
But his face looked rather convulsive,

318
00:19:09.946 --> 00:19:12.886
almost as if he saw
something horrifying...

319
00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:16.356
Did you notice anything
strange at the time?

320
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:19.356
Hmm, now that you mention it...

321
00:19:19.356 --> 00:19:20.096
What?

322
00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.526
I think one of the windows was open.

323
00:19:22.526 --> 00:19:24.436
A window?

324
00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:29.876
I believe we chalked that up to
someone forgetting to close it, but...

325
00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:31.566
Which window was it?

326
00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:32.726
If I remember right...

327
00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:37.746
...it was this window.

328
00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:38.496
Who's there?!

329
00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:41.406
Stop!

330
00:19:41.406 --> 00:19:42.776
You're not getting away!

331
00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:50.236
Damn it! We lost him!

332
00:19:50.236 --> 00:19:54.836
I was right! He did come back
to get this sheet music!

333
00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:58.106
Okay! We're going to stay up all night
and keep watch over this place!

334
00:19:58.106 --> 00:19:58.906
Agreed?!

335
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.016
Agreed!
Agreed!

336
00:20:01.526 --> 00:20:02.906
Hey. Mori-kun.

337
00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.266
Mori-kun!

338
00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:07.736
It's afternoon.

339
00:20:07.736 --> 00:20:10.216
Inspector Megure-dono...
What are you doing here?

340
00:20:10.696 --> 00:20:13.236
This island's technically part of Tokyo.

341
00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:15.316
Oh, yeah. Where did I put it?

342
00:20:15.856 --> 00:20:18.886
If you're looking for the sheet music,
Conan-kun gave it to me.

343
00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:21.576
He also gave me the
gist of the situation here.

344
00:20:21.576 --> 00:20:25.106
All three of them were still awake
by the time I arrived.

345
00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:28.066
You and that old man
were the only ones asleep.

346
00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:31.606
They're interrogating people
over at the town hall.

347
00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.446
Come give them a hand.

348
00:20:33.446 --> 00:20:34.306
Sure...

349
00:20:44.526 --> 00:20:48.356
We really shouldn't have slept there...

350
00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:51.356
Dad! Well? Did you
figure out who did it?

351
00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:55.986
Yeah, right. There were
38 people at the memorial.

352
00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:57.776
It won't be that easy.

353
00:20:58.236 --> 00:21:01.656
Sorry, but when will it be my turn?

354
00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:05.196
You seem exhausted,
so you're scheduled to be last.

355
00:21:05.196 --> 00:21:07.976
In that case, I think I'll go
wash my face in the ladies' room.

356
00:21:09.406 --> 00:21:12.306
How many more interviewees are there?

357
00:21:12.656 --> 00:21:15.526
Including Dr. Narumi, there's six--

358
00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:19.736
the mayor's daughter, Reiko Kuroiwa,

359
00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:22.356
her fiancé, Shuichi Murasawa,

360
00:21:22.356 --> 00:21:24.196
mayoral candidate, Masato Shimizu,

361
00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:25.886
the mayor's secretary, Kazuaki Hirata,

362
00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:29.986
and Ken Nishimoto, who we're
interviewing right now,

363
00:21:29.986 --> 00:21:31.826
but he's really wasting our time.

364
00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:34.656
He won't say a word,
no matter what we ask him.

365
00:21:34.656 --> 00:21:37.316
My instincts say he did it!

366
00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:39.776
Idiot! There's no curse on the piano!

367
00:21:40.446 --> 00:21:43.986
As long as that thing's around,
these murders will keep happening!

368
00:21:43.986 --> 00:21:45.496
But, Mayor...

369
00:21:45.496 --> 00:21:48.196
Dispose of it immediately!
You hear me, Hirata?!

370
00:21:48.196 --> 00:21:49.176
Y-Yes, sir!

371
00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:50.916
Give me a break!

372
00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:56.376
I've had enough of this!

373
00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:59.896
I have no motive
for killing Kawashima-san!

374
00:21:59.896 --> 00:22:01.106
Ugh!

375
00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:03.236
Wow, listen to Reiko-san go.

376
00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:05.226
She's been shouting
for 10 minutes straight.

377
00:22:05.226 --> 00:22:06.696
That's strange.

378
00:22:06.696 --> 00:22:11.856
They're through questioning him,
so why isn't Nishimoto-san leaving?

379
00:22:11.856 --> 00:22:12.606
Huh?

380
00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:16.196
I need to go to the bathroom.

381
00:22:24.816 --> 00:22:27.706
Huh? Did Nishimoto-san
come in here just now?

382
00:22:28.026 --> 00:22:29.166
No.

383
00:22:29.566 --> 00:22:31.326
Crap! He took the stairs!

384
00:22:36.356 --> 00:22:37.456
This music...

385
00:22:39.356 --> 00:22:41.796
It's the second movement of Moonlight...

386
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.906
Where's it coming from?!

387
00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:46.856
The broadcast room!

388
00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.326
Nishimoto-san!

389
00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:55.906
Too late!

390
00:22:57.736 --> 00:22:59.416
No, don't go inside!

391
00:23:01.566 --> 00:23:03.906
Get the examiners and
autopsy team here at once!

392
00:23:03.906 --> 00:23:04.606
Inspector.

393
00:23:04.606 --> 00:23:08.256
The autopsy team left for Tokyo
this evening to work on Kawashima-san.

394
00:23:08.256 --> 00:23:09.606
What?!

395
00:23:09.606 --> 00:23:11.446
Damn it! Now, of all times!

396
00:23:11.446 --> 00:23:12.466
Um...

397
00:23:13.236 --> 00:23:14.526
I can do it...

398
00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.056
Dr. Narumi...

399
00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:19.506
But now this narrows down the suspects
to a handful of people!

400
00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:21.906
So the killer is still--

401
00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:25.386
All the exits to this building
are guarded by police.

402
00:23:25.386 --> 00:23:26.856
Damn it!

403
00:23:26.856 --> 00:23:30.516
Who is it? Who's the killer?!

404
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.860
It appears only a few minutes
have passed since the victim's death.

405
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.560
Yes, the first 5 minutes and 30 seconds
of this tape seem to be blank.

406
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.990
Inspector Megure!

407
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.950
There was something strange
beneath the body!

408
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:54.770
What?!
What?!

409
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.650
Sheet music?

410
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.340
Is this another dying message
from the victim?

411
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.080
No.

412
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.580
If he had the time and strength
to write all this with his own blood,

413
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.020
he would've called for help instead.

414
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.250
The killer probably left
each of these behind to--

415
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.400
You stay out of this!

416
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.150
Oh no! That's important evidence!

417
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.090
It's okay!

418
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.240
You're in the way! Get out of here!

419
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:32.490
Seeing as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata
was played after each murder,

420
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:41.480
it would seem the same person killed
Kawashima-san and Kuroiwa-san.

421
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.540
And judging from the
amount of blank tape,

422
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.160
Kuroiwa-san must have been killed

423
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.990
around 6:30, only minutes
before he was found.

424
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.950
In other words, the killer
must have been one of you,

425
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.900
since you were the only ones
in the community center at the time!

426
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.290
Excluding Mori-kun and the others,

427
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.540
that leaves us with Ken Nishimoto-san,
who was the first to find him,

428
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.500
Dr. Narumi Asai, who was kind enough
to inspect the body for us just now,

429
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.470
Kazuaki Hirata-san,
secretary to the late Mayor Kuroiwa,

430
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.660
Mayor Kuroiwa's daughter,
Reiko Kuroiwa-san

431
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.940
and her fiancé, Shuichi Murasawa-san.

432
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.920
And then Masato Shimizu-san,
candidate in the mayoral election.

433
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.540
Hold on! Why am I a suspect?!

434
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.660
You've been questioning me since 6:20!

435
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.830
You're right,
you couldn't have done it...

436
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.620
Then you can exclude Dr. Narumi too!

437
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.410
She's been with us since 6:00.

438
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.700
Right, Conan-kun?

439
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.520
Yeah!

440
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.730
So that leaves the four men
as the only suspects...

441
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.540
Excuse me, but I've been
on this floor since 6:00 or so...

442
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.450
Do you have anyone
to substantiate this?

443
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.410
You can all vouch for me, right?

444
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.890
Sorry, but I went to
the restroom around 6:30.

445
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.350
Tell me, Nishimoto-san...

446
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.620
You were the first person
to find Kuroiwa-san...

447
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.330
What exactly were you doing there?

448
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.950
Kuroiwa said he wanted to see me.

449
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.240
Are you sure you didn't ask
to see him so you could kill him?!

450
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.540
No!

451
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.140
It was Shimizu!

452
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.990
With Kawashima and my father
taken out of the election,

453
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.580
he'd automatically wind up
in the mayor's seat!

454
00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.390
Oh? What are you looking at, Conan-kun?

455
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.150
Don't be stupid!
Oh? What are you looking at, Conan-kun?

456
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.580
The sheet music the killer
left at the murder scene.

457
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.720
My guess is that it's a
coded message from the murderer.

458
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.190
I wonder if there's anything special
about these sharps and flats...

459
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:39.790
Those are the black keys
on the keyboard. You know?

460
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.790
Keyboard?

461
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.990
Arrest this homicidal maniac
before he kills anyone else--

462
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.570
Better watch out. You're next.

463
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.160
Conan-kun?

464
00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.940
This code's easy if
you know how to read it.

465
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:57.290
It's based on the notes that
correspond with specific piano keys

466
00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.400
if you arrange the letters of the
alphabet across a piano keyboard.

467
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.230
Using this, the music found where
Kawashima-san was killed says,

468
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:13.370
"Better watch out. You're next."

469
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.210
See?

470
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.070
You're amazing, Conan-kun!

471
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.910
What does the other sheet music say?!

472
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.540
Let's see...

473
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.840
"Extinguished is the anger
of the hellfire."

474
00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.310
The anger of the hellfire?!
Could it be...

475
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.990
...that pianist who killed himself
in a fire 12 years ago?!

476
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.490
It's him! Keiji Aso's alive!

477
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.730
No he isn't.

478
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.580
The bones found in the ashes
matched his dental records--

479
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.170
he's most certainly dead.

480
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.990
Everything was completely scorched.

481
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.140
All that was left was some
sheet music in a fireproof safe.

482
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.610
Sheet music?!

483
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.660
Where? Where is this sheet music?!

484
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.870
In the community center storeroom.

485
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.650
But the key to the storeroom's
back at the station--

486
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.720
Then go get it!

487
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.220
Alright!

488
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.990
Wait, Officer! I'm coming too!

489
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.050
Conan-kun!

490
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:20.600
Say, did Aso-san really
set his own house on fire?

491
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.700
Yes, there were four eyewitnesses.

492
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.620
Our previous mayor, Kameyama-san,

493
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.900
Mayor Kuroiwa, Nishimoto-san,
and Kawashima-san.

494
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.650
Were those four connected in any way?

495
00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.120
They were all classmates,
including Aso-san.

496
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.790
Then what about that Murasawa guy?

497
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:45.040
He showed up on the island 3 years ago.

498
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.830
He and the mayor's daughter Reiko-san
were engaged not too long ago.

499
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.660
The mayor opposed it, though.

500
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.590
What about Hirata,
the mayor's secretary?

501
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.330
He's suspicious if you ask me.

502
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.370
I'm not quite sure what the deal was,

503
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.660
but he was always sneaking
around with Kawashima-san

504
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.270
at the community center.

505
00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.480
What about Shimizu?

506
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.440
He has a strong sense of justice and
he's very popular with the fishermen!

507
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.410
Are you out of questions, Akechi-kun?

508
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.100
Eh?

509
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.230
Huh? That's odd!

510
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.200
I could swear it was
around here somewhere...

511
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.130
Come on. You've been
looking for over an hour now.

512
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.600
Here we go! Here's the key!

513
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.950
Officer!

514
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.580
Ran...?

515
00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.790
You took too long!

516
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.640
Everyone grew tired of waiting
so they went home!

517
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.080
All the suspects left?!

518
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.580
Yeah.

519
00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:48.660
The killer's last message said that
the hellfire's anger was extinguished,

520
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.020
so they figured there
would be no more murders.

521
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.540
Idiots!

522
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.790
Only the 1st and 2nd movements
of Moonlight have been played

523
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.790
at each of the murder scenes so far!

524
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.970
Moonlight has one movement left!

525
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.450
I'm going to check out
the community center!

526
00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.570
Wait! Conan-kun!

527
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.830
Talk about curious, Conan-kun...

528
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.330
Hurry!

529
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.310
Just hold on, will you?

530
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.490
Did you just hear a strange sound
come from the piano room?

531
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.430
No...

532
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.680
Conan-kun!

533
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.100
Stop!

534
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.490
Murasawa-san!

535
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.400
Ran!

536
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.300
The storeroom!

537
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.010
Nishimoto-san!

538
00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.290
Officer! Go call Inspector Megure!

539
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.980
I'm on it!

540
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.920
Was the 3rd movement played?

541
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.370
There's 30 minutes per side on this tape,

542
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.880
which means Nishimoto-san died
within the last 30 minutes!

543
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.370
Look, Conan-kun!

544
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.810
There's some more sheet music
at Nishimoto-san's feet!

545
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.870
What does it say this time?

546
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.810
"Will."

547
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.950
It's his will?!

548
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.850
Then does that mean...

549
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.990
It was a suicide?

550
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.700
According to the will,

551
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.200
he regretted killing Mr. Kawashima
and Mr. Kuroiwa...

552
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.380
Nishimoto killed the two of them?!

553
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:30.240
He apparently didn't want an old mistake
they made to be made known.

554
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.540
"They" refers to Mr. Kameyama,
who died 2 years ago,

555
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.490
Mr. Kawashima and Mr. Kuroiwa,
who were just killed,

556
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.490
Mr. Nishimoto, who hanged himself,

557
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.400
and Mr. Aso, who killed himself
12 years ago.

558
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.470
The pianist too?

559
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.740
My guess is that they did something,
using this code.

560
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.200
I see. Nishimoto-san was afraid
their old secret would get out

561
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.910
so he broke into the storeroom
to destroy the sheet music.

562
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.240
But unable to find the music and
driven into a psychological corner,

563
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.160
he committed suicide.

564
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.720
I don't think it was a suicide.

565
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.320
It's impossible to hang yourself
without something to support you, right?

566
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.910
Are you sure you didn't put it away?

567
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.530
Of course not.

568
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.960
And I doubt there's anyone who would
go and write their own will in code.

569
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.910
Are you saying the murderer
is somewhere else?

570
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.740
I saw some suspicious people.

571
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.300
What?!

572
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.410
Two people in the piano room.

573
00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.280
One broke a window and escaped.

574
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.620
The other was that Murasawa guy.

575
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.990
Someone beat him up.

576
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.770
Dr. Narumi's treating him
in the piano room right now.

577
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.830
Ow!

578
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.160
Why didn't you say that sooner?!

579
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.530
Dad!

580
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.490
You still haven't found
Mr. Aso's sheet music?!

581
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.490
It was 12 years ago. There's no way
for me to remember where we put it.

582
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.040
Is he still unconscious?

583
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.070
Yes. I think he may have
suffered a concussion.

584
00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.080
Say, Kuroiwa-san.

585
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.010
What was Murasawa-san
doing here this late anyway?

586
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:03.840
How should I know?!

587
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.050
This is a...

588
00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.180
Keep your hands off Shuichi's stuff!

589
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.870
What is that?

590
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.230
Don't ask me! But it
was important to Shuichi!

591
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.870
That's a tuning hammer,
used to tune pianos.

592
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.410
So he was the one who...

593
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.370
Okay! Bring all the suspects
to the town hall at once!

594
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.070
Yes, sir!

595
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.950
What are you doing, Conan-kun?

596
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.010
Let's go to the town hall.

597
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.910
The suspicious person
who ran out of this room

598
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.990
was looking for something
under the piano.

599
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.920
Here we are!

600
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.520
Wow, a hidden panel! Cool!

601
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.960
Drugs!

602
00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.310
Tsukikage Island Town Hall

603
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.990
Judging from the methods
employed in all three murders,

604
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.780
they are all clearly
the work of the same person!

605
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.740
Dr. Narumi and Reiko Kuroiwa-san
have confirmed alibis

606
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.490
and are no longer suspects.

607
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.410
But there are no alibis
for the secretary Hirata-san,

608
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.150
the mayoral candidate Shimizu-san,

609
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.740
nor for Murasawa-san, who is
currently resting at the clinic...

610
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.090
The killer is one of these three!

611
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:25.200
Dr. Narumi. Is Murasawa-san
still unconscious?

612
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.240
Yes. Reiko-san is looking after him,
but he has yet to regain consciousness.

613
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:33.740
There's something nagging at me,
but what could it be?!

614
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:39.400
Ever since I saw the code of blood
left at the scene of the crime...

615
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:40.700
Inspector.

616
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.620
The photos taken from where
Mr. Kuroiwa was murdered are ready!

617
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.190
Good. Place them on that desk.

618
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.890
Yes, sir!

619
00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:55.540
What's that light by Kuroiwa-san's neck?

620
00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.230
It's off in the picture
where he's been moved.

621
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.430
Um, may I buy some juice?
I'm thirsty...

622
00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.900
I suppose that'd be alright.

623
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.740
He's injured?

624
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.140
Say, Mister.

625
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.610
There's some white powder
on your sleeves.

626
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.580
What?!

627
00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.020
Money from all over the world!

628
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.410
I'm fond of foreign countries.

629
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.490
Huh?

630
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.490
What's wrong, Officer?

631
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.500
I finally found the sheet music
Aso-san left behind!

632
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.940
Let me see that!

633
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:47.980
"To my son, Seiji."

634
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.540
Son?

635
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.550
Oh, come to think of it,
Aso-san had a son too...

636
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:59.990
He fell seriously ill when he was little
and had to be hospitalized...

637
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.430
I believe Seiji was his name...

638
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.080
Seiji?!

639
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.610
It couldn't be!

640
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.160
Hey, wait! Where do you
think you're going?!

641
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.650
Ah, now I see!

642
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.120
The reason the killer dragged
Kawashima-san into the piano room

643
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.490
after drowning him!

644
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.920
The meaning of the music
played at the murder scenes!

645
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.660
And the mystery behind
the code written in blood!

646
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:39.500
There's no doubt about it!
That's the one who did it!
