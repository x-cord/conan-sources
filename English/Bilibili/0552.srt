1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:01,682
"Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest"

2
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:04,082
This is a special program

3
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,182
that was aired on Nichiuri TV

4
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:10,582
to choose the nationwide number 1 Mr. Kojima.

5
00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,982
The cash to be awarded is 10,000,000 yen.

6
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:14,682
Moreover, the hanging scroll

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,282
that will be awarded along with the cash,

8
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:20,782
is one of the wild boar, deer and butterfly trio

9
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:23,282
called the "Bush clover and the wild boar".

10
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,182
Genta's father will be entering

11
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:28,682
the Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest.

12
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:31,582
There are 3 categories of tests, which are push up exercise,

13
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:34,782
a singing contest and kanji dictation.

14
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:38,582
The standard set for judging seemed to be quite difficult.

15
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,182
Overcoming these difficult tests,

16
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:43,282
only three contestants made it through.

17
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,882
And to our surprise,

18
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,982
Genta's father was among the finalists.

19
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,982
However, right before the start of the finals,

20
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:53,282
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -the host of this contest,

21
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:56,482
"Gonsaku Kojima (71)" -Gonsaku Kojima, chairman of the Kojima Group

22
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:00,482
is pushed down the stairs by someone and killed.

23
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:02,482
The only people using the stairs

24
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:06,082
were the three Kojimas who made it to the finals.

25
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:10,682
Right. Genta's father is also one of the suspects.

26
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:15,282
But which of the three is Genta's father?

27
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:19,082
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

28
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:21,382
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

29
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,582
The mystery of the case, as well as Genta's father.

30
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:25,382
Both become clear and the case is solved.

31
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:26,982
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:28,782
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:30,982
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:20,645
"The Culprit is Genta's Father (Part 2)"

35
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,245
"Contestant A's Waiting Room" -I was just

36
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,645
waiting in the waiting room

37
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,545
when I heard someone knocking on the door of a room.

38
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,545
A little afterwards I heard the loud voice and sound,

39
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,145
so I went out to look.

40
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,745
"Bunta Kojima (33)" -Then, I found that old man

41
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:38,545
lying on the ground, that's all.

42
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,545
Did you come right out of the room

43
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:43,145
after you heard the loud voice and sound?

44
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,545
No, I waited a while.

45
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:50,145
Because I thought that this may be some kind of a test.

46
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:54,445
And? Was "hapyakuichi" really written on the paper?

47
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,145
Yeah, that's what was written.

48
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:59,845
By the way, how many push ups

49
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:02,945
were you able to finish in 3 minutes?

50
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,645
About a 100.

51
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,645
Oh, I see.

52
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,945
"Contestant B's Waiting Room" -Which means

53
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,945
you also heard the knock on the door of a room

54
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:19,345
and since you heard a loud voice and sound after that,

55
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,745
you left the room and rushed over to the site, is that right?

56
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,945
Yes.

57
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:27,045
"Genji Kojima (32)" -I felt a kind of uneasiness,

58
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,545
so I opened the door

59
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:32,345
and found that the two others were just about to leave their room.

60
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:36,345
And? On the paper, like you just said.

61
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,445
Yes, "shakuhachi" was written on it.

62
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,045
"Hapyakuichi" (801) and "shakuhachi" (Bamboo Fluter).

63
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,345
Only the "hachi" (eight) is correct.

64
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:46,745
By the way, what kind of song did you sing today?

65
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,445
I sang "Kurodabushi".

66
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,045
Would you like me to sing it to you?

67
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,745
No, not really.

68
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:53,045
Please by all means do!

69
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,645
Huh?

70
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:58,245
"Contestant C's Waiting Room" -Yeah, the same as the other two.

71
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:01,545
I heard a loud voice and sound, so I ran over.

72
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:04,045
"Gankichi Kojima (34)" -Then, I saw that old man

73
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,245
lying on the floor below the stairs alone.

74
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:10,545
And, on the paper that you saw,

75
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,945
the word "ippin" (first class) was written?

76
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,445
Yeah. "Ippin" meaning the best.

77
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:20,945
By the way, can you write the word rose in kanji?

78
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,145
Huh?

79
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:24,745
Rose?

80
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:27,245
I could never write a kanji like that.

81
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:30,345
Hey, what's going on from a while ago?

82
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,945
Well, you see...

83
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:36,145
What? Conan asked you to ask them?

84
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:40,145
Yes, sir. He said that if we ask the three questions like these,

85
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:42,245
we may be able to figure out

86
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:45,345
what the real intention of this contest is.

87
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,845
Officer Takagi, how was it?

88
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:51,145
They did a little over 100 push-ups,

89
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,445
sang more or less the same as Inspector Megure

90
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,545
and couldn't write the kanji character for "rose".

91
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:58,645
Don't you think I sing better?

92
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:02,745
He didn't have the lyrics for the song right, either.

93
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:03,745
I guess so.

94
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,345
Were the lyrics incorrect?

95
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:16,045
Yeah, he was supposed to sing "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

96
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,145
But, he sang

97
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:23,345
"Shinomoto ichi no kono yari wo".

98
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:25,545
While listening to them sing,

99
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:28,245
I also recorded the interrogation of the three.

100
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:29,245
Would you like to listen to it?

101
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,645
Yep.

102
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:34,245
But, what can we figure out with this?

103
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,645
We know that the purpose of this contest

104
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,945
was not to choose the best person.

105
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:40,245
Right?

106
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,945
Yeah.

107
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,545
Just what do you mean?

108
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:46,545
I thought we were supposed to choose the number one person

109
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:49,345
of all the Mr. Kojimas nationwide,

110
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:51,245
but when we took the results of the push ups

111
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,745
to the judge's room where the chairman was.

112
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:58,445
Yeah, the contestants have already been chosen.

113
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,045
It'll be these 58 people.

114
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,545
That's what he said.

115
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:05,345
Before even looking at the records?

116
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,445
Yes.

117
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:08,645
It was the same even when we took the scores

118
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,845
of the kanji dictation test to him.

119
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:13,445
Although he seemed to be checking the VTR

120
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:17,045
in which the contestants all ran off over to their answer sheets.

121
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,645
Then, what about the singing contest?

122
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,745
He seemed to be listening carefully

123
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,445
to the recorded voices of each and every contestant.

124
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,845
Was the chairman choosing the contestants all by himself?

125
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:31,745
Yes. It seems that he planned to do everything by himself.

126
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,845
The chairman even got ready the number sheets and shoes

127
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,845
which were to be handed out to the contestants himself.

128
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:42,345
But, what did he base his choice on anyway?

129
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,845
Inspector Megure!

130
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,445
A gun was found inside the chairman's bag that was left

131
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,845
-in the judge's room. -What?

132
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,045
And together with it, this paper was found.

133
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,945
-Paper? -Yes.

134
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,945
It is very sloppily written.

135
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,545
"We will surely come to get a hold

136
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,845
of the really great best item in the world."

137
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,145
"Bandits Hyakkiyako."

138
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:04,845
Hyakkiyako?

139
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:07,145
Is it mean the group of killer robbers?

140
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,545
The thing is...

141
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,745
The chairman wrote in his blog

142
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:14,545
that he had lost the deer and butterfly hanging scrolls

143
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,845
of the set of three he had,

144
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,445
but the fact is the band of robbers

145
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,245
stole it from him about six months ago.

146
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,745
The hanging scroll of the wild boar of "Hagi"

147
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:26,545
happen to be out for repair and was spared being stolen.

148
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,345
Was anyone killed back then?

149
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:30,545
No.

150
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:33,445
The chairman, his wife and the employees

151
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,045
were all drugged to sleep.

152
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,245
But the chairman's pet dog, Gonta,

153
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,945
was slashed in the throat

154
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:44,145
with a knife by the head of that group.

155
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:47,745
And it seems that the chairman who was still slightly conscious

156
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:52,245
heard what the head had mumbled while leaving,

157
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:56,445
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

158
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,945
"After all, we could be distant relatives."

159
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:03,145
Did you report this case to the police?

160
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:08,045
No, the chairman firmly told me not to speak of it.

161
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:11,045
Hey, Officer Takagi.

162
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:15,345
Could it be that the three suspects...

163
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,345
Now that you mentioned it,

164
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:22,245
all three of them were like that.

165
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,545
I see.

166
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,645
I finally got it.

167
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,945
But...

168
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:32,445
no matter if the chairman told you to keep things quiet,

169
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:36,545
not telling the police about the break-in

170
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:39,645
and the hanging scrolls being stolen is unthinkable.

171
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,545
I'm very sorry.

172
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:46,045
But, he said that he would avenge Gonta's death,

173
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,745
so to not say a word to anyone.

174
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:50,645
Then, don't tell me that this Nationwide Mr. Kojima Contest

175
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:53,145
that the chairman planned was...

176
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:57,445
That's right, he wasn't trying to look for the number one Mr. Kojima.

177
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:00,245
But rather to look for the culprit who took Gonta's life

178
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:02,645
and to avenge his death.

179
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,045
And he was going to kill the culprit with the gun

180
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,845
that was hidden in the judge's room.

181
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,745
Because there are many kanji characters for the name Kojima

182
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,345
is usually written as "island".

183
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,145
But just like in the title of this event,

184
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,445
the "island" surname of the people in this contest

185
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,045
is kanji character with the word "bird"

186
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,045
with the radical "mountain" to the left, right?

187
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,445
Is he right?

188
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:20,745
Yes, sir.

189
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,045
The surnames of the three finalists

190
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:27,645
are all written that way.

191
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:29,845
Come to think of it, Chairman Kojima's surname

192
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,645
was also written in the same kanji character.

193
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,045
So, does that mean that the chairman

194
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:36,445
knew the name of the head of the band of robbers?

195
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,545
He didn't know it.

196
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,945
He figured it out

197
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:42,845
from what the head of the group of robbers said,

198
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:46,545
"I'll spare your life because we have the same surname."

199
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:51,145
"After all, we may be distant relatives".

200
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:53,145
I see. So if he were to be a relative,

201
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,745
his name had to be written with the same kanji character Kojima.

202
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,345
Which means that

203
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,545
it's likely that he narrowed the contestants down to those whose names

204
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:01,045
were written with the same kanji character

205
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,945
when looking through the papers that came in.

206
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,845
I think so.

207
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,945
We, the staff were also thinking it's strange

208
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:09,145
that all the contestants had surnames written

209
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,045
in the same kanji character.

210
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,245
However,

211
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,745
I can see up to that point,

212
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,145
but how did he narrow it down after that?

213
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:21,345
Uh, the shoes that everyone was wearing when doing push ups

214
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,345
were prepared by the chairman, right?

215
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,845
Yeah. That's right.

216
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:29,145
Then, you checked what size who wore, right?

217
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:32,745
Yeah. Because the chairman told us to do so.

218
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:37,445
You said that Gonta was found dead in the yard, right?

219
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,545
Yeah.

220
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:41,545
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

221
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,045
If it was in the yard,

222
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,145
wouldn't it most naturally still be there?

223
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,845
The culprit's footprints.

224
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:50,145
I see! Shoes traces!

225
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,945
The chairman chose the contestants

226
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:57,345
according to the size of shoes they picked.

227
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,545
Then, the singing was to hear the voice?

228
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:03,745
Yes. If the chairman had heard the head robber's voice,

229
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:05,445
there's no doubt about it.

230
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:09,045
The voices of the remaining finalists sounded similar too.

231
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,045
If so, the kanji dictation was for him

232
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,845
to check out the handwriting of the culprit.

233
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,945
He wanted to find the man

234
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:16,845
whose handwriting was similar to the writing

235
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:19,145
that was written on the letter left behind by the robbers.

236
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:21,245
I don't think so!

237
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:24,045
Because the head of a group of robbers

238
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,545
would never go out of his way to write a letter

239
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,445
that he would leave behind.

240
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,545
I'm sure that letter was deliberately

241
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,645
written in handwriting unlike the usual,

242
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,145
or it's the handwriting of another person

243
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,445
who was made to write the letter.

244
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:39,745
Then, what was the dictation match for?

245
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,345
To decide whether the man is right or left handed.

246
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,845
If he slashed the dog's neck with a knife,

247
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,245
you can tell if the culprit is left handed or right

248
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,545
by looking at the wound, right?

249
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:51,445
Officer Takagi, the three suspects all used the same hand, right?

250
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:56,045
Yeah. The hand that Mr. Bunta Kojima was smoking with

251
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,245
and the hand that Mr. Genji Kojima was drinking tea with

252
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,845
as well as the hand that Mr. Dankichi Kojima used the towel

253
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:04,145
to wipe his perspiration were all their left hands.

254
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,745
I see.

255
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,045
That's why he was able to choose the contestants

256
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:10,045
just by watching the VTR of them running over

257
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:12,745
to the answer sheets.

258
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,945
I guess not with the voice,

259
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:16,645
but as far as it goes for the shoes size or what hand they dominantly use,

260
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:19,745
he could've just had the men write it in when filling out the entry forms.

261
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,145
He probably thought if he did that,

262
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:24,445
the culprit would find out that he was looking for him.

263
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,945
I see.

264
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:29,045
But kid, you sure have great deduction ability.

265
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:32,045
I got mail secretly a while ago

266
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,945
from an older detective who told me.

267
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:38,845
So, it was Kudo, after all.

268
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:42,045
If so, the point is the paper the chairman

269
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:45,045
showed to the three contestants he picked out.

270
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,345
Yes.

271
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:49,245
He figured out who the culprit was after showing the man the paper

272
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,745
and went to see him.

273
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,245
I think he fell off the stairs

274
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,545
fighting for the paper.

275
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,345
All three suspects had different answers

276
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,645
for the word they saw.

277
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:05,345
Moreover, we body checked all of them

278
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,145
and investigated the waiting room too,

279
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:10,245
but the paper in question wasn't found.

280
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:15,145
Shinichi told me he knew where the paper is.

281
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:21,445
Of course, he also knew what was written on the paper.

282
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,345
Conan's really late.

283
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:26,945
Maybe Genta's father

284
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:30,445
is involved in some case after all.

285
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,845
Well, let's let Conan handle this.

286
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,145
True.

287
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:38,145
So, Genta cut that look off your face

288
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,645
and wait for him to come back.

289
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:41,645
That's right.

290
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:45,245
Your Dad would never do anything bad, Genta!

291
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:48,545
I'm not really all that worried.

292
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:53,445
The only thing is I don't want them to get into a fight.

293
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:54,845
Fight?

294
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:56,045
Yeah.

295
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,245
My Dad's got a bad temper,

296
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,745
but is a push-over,

297
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,645
and he hates injustice.

298
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,745
He's got a bad temper?

299
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,445
He's a push-over?

300
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,345
He hates injustice?

301
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:12,445
He's indeed what you call a 100% "Edoite".

302
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,745
I guess I'll go check after all!

303
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:18,245
-Genta! -Excuse me.

304
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:28,426
"Evaluation Room" -What the hell's going on?

305
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,726
Gathering us in a place like this.

306
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:33,526
We finished interrogation a while ago, didn't we?

307
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,126
Don't tell us you figured out who the culprit is?

308
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,726
Oh, well...

309
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,226
I want to confirm with you once again

310
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,526
what was written on the paper.

311
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:45,826
It's "Hapyakuichi". I wrote "801".

312
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,526
It was "Shakuhachi" (Bamboo fluter).

313
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,426
It was "Ippin" (First class).

314
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,626
Huh?

315
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,526
What're you guys talking about?

316
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:54,826
A number was written on it, wasn't there?

317
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:56,726
Yes, I thought it was a number too.

318
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:58,626
Don't be silly!

319
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,226
There couldn't be a simpler kanji!

320
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,526
Maybe they were all shown different papers after all.

321
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:08,226
-Yeah. -I'm pretty sure

322
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,326
that this was what was written on the paper.

323
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:13,026
Right, it was that character!

324
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:16,226
See? It's "hapyakuichi"!

325
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,426
But if you turn it upside down,

326
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,626
it can be read, "shakuhachi", can't it?

327
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,626
Then, when you said "shakuhachi",

328
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:27,126
you actually meant "hyakuhachi"?

329
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,126
Huh?

330
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,826
Yes, that's why I said "shakuhachi".

331
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,826
What the hell are you talking about?

332
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,026
Let me see it!

333
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,826
If you turn the word "ip" up this way,

334
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:40,626
it's read "ippin" meaning the best!

335
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,026
It's true that it could be read that way.

336
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:46,126
But it's difficult to read "pin" as the kanji "thing".

337
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:48,426
Well, it can't be helped!

338
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,326
Because that character "pin"

339
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:54,126
is written in one stroke, a habit of the writer.

340
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,126
It's hard to tell if it's part of the sentence,

341
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:58,026
unless you look really carefully and are used to seeing it.

342
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,526
It's really difficult to read it "pin" meaning thing.

343
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:04,326
Isn't that right, the head of the robber group?

344
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,926
Come to think of it, the kanji character "pin" in the letter

345
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,426
that was left behind by the group of robbers saying

346
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,326
they were stealing the greatest thing

347
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,826
looked similar to the "pin" here!

348
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:14,626
Of course they look similar.

349
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,226
I had Officer Chiba

350
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,326
copy the word "ip" and "pin"

351
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,826
and just pasted them together.

352
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,426
In other words,

353
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:24,626
the chairman copied these same characters on the Japanese paper

354
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,026
and showed them to you.

355
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,026
He was looking for a person who would read this not as a number,

356
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:31,126
but rather as the kanji character "pin".

357
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:34,626
And, you flew right into the trap he set up.

358
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,826
Don't be ridiculous.

359
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:39,326
If you so insist,

360
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,926
show us the Japanese paper!

361
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,426
Do you know, sir?

362
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,326
That Japanese paper is special

363
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,826
and is made with the fallen leaves of a type of mulberry tree

364
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:49,526
called a paper mulberry

365
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,626
and is highly toxic.

366
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,526
So, if you mistakenly lick it.

367
00:17:59,226 --> 00:18:01,426
Don't tell me that you...

368
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:03,926
Ambulance.

369
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:05,926
Please hurry and get me an ambulance!

370
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:08,626
I ate that Japanese paper!

371
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,526
Then, you admit it?

372
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:12,926
That you got into a fight with the chairman over that paper,

373
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,526
he fell down the stairs

374
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,726
where you left him to die and you fled.

375
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:20,026
Yeah, I admit it.

376
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:23,126
I admit it, so hurry and call an ambulance!

377
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,126
While you're at it,

378
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:28,126
will you also admit that you're the head of the band of robbers?

379
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:32,126
Right, it's me! I'm the head of "Hyakkiyako"!

380
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:35,526
As soon as he walked into my waiting room,

381
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,926
that old man while grinning said...

382
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,326
Long time no see,

383
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:46,026
the head of the band of robbers who killed my pet dog.

384
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,526
I thought that you'd come back

385
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:51,026
to get the hanging scroll of the wild boar

386
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:53,426
that you failed to steal back then.

387
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,726
But don't you worry.

388
00:18:55,726 --> 00:19:00,426
I may just forgive you depending how you decide to act.

389
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,826
If you want to flee, I won't stop you.

390
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:06,126
I'll simply report you to the police.

391
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:10,726
I've got your face right inside my TV camera,

392
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:14,326
so I've got this paper that'll serve as evidence too.

393
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:17,226
Since... since he said that I thought I'd be in trouble,

394
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:20,226
so I tried to snatch the paper away from him

395
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,426
then the old man fell down the stairs.

396
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:26,126
Therefore, you left the chairman there to die and fled.

397
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,426
Then, you swallowed the paper to hide the evidence.

398
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,626
Yeah! So, hurry and call an ambulance, will you?

399
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,026
Or, I'll die!

400
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,326
You'll be fine.

401
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,126
Mulberry leaves are frequently used to make Japanese paper,

402
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:41,326
and they're not that poisonous.

403
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,526
What... what are you saying?

404
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:46,026
But, unlike you, sir,

405
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,626
the mulberry is black on the outside, but white on the inside.

406
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:52,326
I think this taught a black on the inside person a good lesson.

407
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,326
We'll listen to the rest of story at the station.

408
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,226
Oh, no. I was just joking.

409
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,326
I was just playing along with that brat's joke

410
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:00,726
and was talking gibberish...

411
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,026
Just what do you think?

412
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:10,126
Enough of your lies!

413
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,026
What you just spitted out,

414
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:15,026
I was listening with these two ears of mine!

415
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,426
Cut out your blabbering!

416
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,926
Like I just said, I was only joking.

417
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:24,326
Oh, you still insist on playing dumb?

418
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:25,426
You third rate human!

419
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,026
Third rate human.

420
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,826
I run a liquor store, you know!

421
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:32,026
I'm used to taking on drunkards!

422
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,926
Or better yet,

423
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:36,526
you want me to stick my arm all the way down your throat

424
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,526
and pull that Japanese paper out of your throat

425
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:41,626
together with what you ate for lunch today?

426
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:45,526
Oh, no. I confess.

427
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,726
Dad?

428
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:51,526
Dad, what's up?

429
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:52,926
Genta.

430
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:57,026
Don't tell me that Genta's dad is the culprit?

431
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,826
Dad.

432
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,826
Just what're you doing in a place like this?

433
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,626
Oh, Genta!

434
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:28,026
What's with those glasses?

435
00:22:28,026 --> 00:22:30,626
Oh, this is...

436
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:34,226
What? Mom told you to wear it?

437
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:36,726
You mean to enter this contest?

438
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:40,226
Yeah! She nagged me saying

439
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,626
that I look smarter with then on so to wear them!

440
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:46,426
But, it looks like your granny's glasses

441
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:47,926
and the lens are so strong

442
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:51,126
that I can't keep my eyes open.

443
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:54,126
Talk about tough. She also told me a whole lot of other stuff like

444
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:58,626
to watch my language or not fight and all.

445
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:01,726
But, why did you read that character "shakuhachi"?

446
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:04,326
Yes, yes. Officer Takagi told us

447
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:07,326
that you read "shakuhachi" instead of "hyakuhachi".

448
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,926
It's because he's an "edoite".

449
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:15,226
Although they think they're pronouncing something "he" or "hya",

450
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:19,826
most "edoites" can't help but pronounce the words "she" or "sha".

451
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:22,226
Well, it's something like a dialect.

452
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:25,526
Sir, did you remember that you sang "Shinomoto ichi"

453
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:28,326
at the part that goes "Hinomoto ichi no kono yari wo"

454
00:23:28,326 --> 00:23:30,626
in the song Kurodabushi?

455
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,026
Huh? Is that how it sounded?

456
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:34,426
I see.

457
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:37,926
That's how you figured out he was Genta's father.

458
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:39,826
Yeah, because the other two

459
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:42,226
pronounced the words "hikaeshitsu" (waiting room) and "hitori" (alone)

460
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:44,526
the way they were supposed to be pronounced.

461
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:48,026
But, dad, if we went a little later than we did,

462
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,126
you would've gotten into a fight again, right?

463
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:53,826
Well, never mind the details.

464
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:57,726
Like they say, fire and fighting are like spice to edoites.

465
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:04,326
I mean talk about totally out of date.

466
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:10,426
"Next Episode" -I see. You arrested Togashi before.

467
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:13,826
But, that person isn't left handed.

468
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,726
He'll be sent to the prosecutor as scheduled at 4 pm.

469
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:20,626
What? He throw the murder weapon at the window?

470
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,026
Only a night has passed yet,

471
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:25,026
so if you search for an eye-witness...

472
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:26,226
That's it!

473
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,426
He'll be committed to trial at 4 pm.

474
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,126
That's the time limit.

475
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:35,183
Next Conan, "The Interrogation Room"

476
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,012
Next Conan's Hint:

477
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,212
"Left handed"

478
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:56,212
How about you, Officer Takagi?

479
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,412
I'm a top-notch officer, so you see.

480
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,512
I think I heard something, but I must've heard wrong.

481
00:24:58,512 --> 00:24:59,708
Oops.
