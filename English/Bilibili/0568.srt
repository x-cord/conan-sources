1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,540
Let's call it a day!

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,740
This case was closed faster than expected, wasn't it?

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,740
Yeah, thanks to Officer Takagi staking out stubbornly, I guess.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,840
I would prefer you using the adjective persistent.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,640
-Here. -Hot!

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,240
-Reward! -Thanks.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,640
Here.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Officer Shiratori, good work, too.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,340
Huh? You don't like canned coffee?

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,940
It's not that.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,440
-Here you go. -Thank you.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,840
Okay, then the three of us we go out to dinner?

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,340
Sounds great!

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm sorry,

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,040
but count me out.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,240
Why?

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,740
It's my day off tomorrow,

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,840
so I've got a lot of things to do.

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,140
I see.

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,340
Come to think of it,

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,440
I found a delicious noodle shop!

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,940
Great work, police sergeant!

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,840
The pan fried minced pork and vegetable dumpling is really delicious!

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,540
I look forward to it.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,440
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,540
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,040
What is Inspector Shiratori's memory of first love

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,640
that involves Cherry Blossoms?

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:14,862
"Inspector Shiratori's Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 1)".

33
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,662
"White Cliff"

34
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:25,562
Well, all I was planning to do was

35
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,062
to go watch a movie alone, though.

36
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,962
Inspector Shiratori?

37
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,862
What a coincidence to run into you here!

38
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:45,862
But, how unexpected.

39
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:48,062
You like this too, don't you, Inspector Shiratori?

40
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,162
Huh? Like, what?

41
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:52,562
What else, but Gomera!

42
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:53,862
Gomera?

43
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:56,562
No, I'm watching "White Cliff"...

44
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,262
But, the ticket that came out is...

45
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,262
Huh?

46
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:03,362
"Great Monster Battle"

47
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,962
I guess I chose the category in the wrong row

48
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,062
when I reserved it on the Internet.

49
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,362
Let's go get something at the stand

50
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,462
before going to our seats!

51
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:13,562
-Yeah! -Let's go!

52
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,862
Well, it's my day off that I don't get that often.

53
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:19,462
I guess it's not that bad going back to feeling like a child, is it?

54
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,162
-His face seems to be saying that. -Huh?

55
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,962
I'll bet it's just something shocking

56
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:27,262
that involves Officer Sato again, but...

57
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,462
I think it's best to forget about it, no?

58
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:34,262
Because after all, Officer Sato and Officer Takagi were sort of...

59
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:37,162
You know, what in the hospital room...

60
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:41,562
I won't give up that easily.

61
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:45,562
After all, she's the person who changed my life, my destiny.

62
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,362
Your destiny?

63
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:48,462
Right.

64
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:51,462
It was back when I was in elementary school

65
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:54,862
when I was choosing a reference book at a book store.

66
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,562
Hold it!

67
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,762
I saw you do it!

68
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:06,262
I saw you put the comics under your clothes!

69
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:10,062
-You brat... -Hey.

70
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,562
Let her be. Let's go.

71
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,462
I guess so.

72
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,762
Hold it!

73
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,162
Thief!

74
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:19,462
Shut up!

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,262
You darn brat!

76
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:25,062
I saw what you did too.

77
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:28,262
I saw you both stealing.

78
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,962
What're you talking about?

79
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,162
Code of law 235.

80
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,762
Those who take the property of others

81
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:38,162
shall be accused of stealing

82
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:40,862
and be sentenced to less than 10 years in prison.

83
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,062
Sentenced?

84
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:44,362
Hey.

85
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:49,262
Excuse me. Is anything the matter?

86
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:50,462
No.

87
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:54,562
We were just having a brawl over a book with that brat.

88
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,862
Because this comic is pretty popular.

89
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,962
Sir.

90
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,762
Is anything wrong?

91
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:08,862
Not really.

92
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:10,562
It's nothing.

93
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,962
Are you looking for someone?

94
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,162
No.

95
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,662
If you wanted a reference book,

96
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,262
you should've told me

97
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,062
so that I could've bought it for you.

98
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:34,562
No. I need to see it for myself

99
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:38,362
and train myself to choose the best book I can find on my own

100
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:41,262
in order to become an efficient lawyer.

101
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:43,062
Absolutely.

102
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:52,262
Here, this is for you for helping me out.

103
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,762
I bought coke at that fast food shop over there

104
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,462
and made it using the wrapper of the straw as fast as I could,

105
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,662
so it's not all that nice, but...

106
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:01,362
Cherry blossoms.

107
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,962
Yep, that's right.

108
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:04,662
It's a symbol of courage!

109
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:09,862
I don't think that's what Cherry blossoms stood for.

110
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,762
But the cherry blossom mark

111
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,962
is what all police officers have on them!

112
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,662
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

113
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,662
a flower of justice!

114
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:30,262
I see.

115
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,562
That's why you became a police officer.

116
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:33,962
Yeah.

117
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:37,762
That's why when I saw her again at the First Investigation Division,

118
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:41,062
I was convinced that I was destined to marry her.

119
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,262
That is, until Officer Takagi appeared.

120
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:48,162
But, was that girl really Officer Sato?

121
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:52,062
Yeah, her facial features are unmistakably.

122
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,862
But, I wonder if that tomboy Officer Sato

123
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:57,362
would do something like that.

124
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,862
That's the only thing that's bothering me.

125
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,262
Hey!

126
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,462
It's almost time, so let's go inside!

127
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:07,262
Conan and Ai, if you're going to buy drinks, please hurry!

128
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:09,262
I bought popcorn for all of us already!

129
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,362
Thank you for waiting.

130
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:16,362
-Here you go. -Thanks.

131
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,162
Well, you should go confirm it with Officer Sato.

132
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:24,262
You could be super surprised at how wrong you may be.

133
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,462
Next person, please.

134
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:27,762
What would you like to order?

135
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,262
Well...

136
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:30,562
I guess...

137
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,162
I'll have a coke.

138
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,162
Thank you for waiting.

139
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:41,762
How wrong I may be?

140
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:44,862
Hey, will you give me the wrapper of your straw?

141
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:46,362
Okay.

142
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:49,262
What're you going to do?

143
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,562
It's a secret.

144
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,662
Here! These are our seats!

145
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:03,762
Wow! It's right in front of the screen!

146
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:04,762
We've need to be grateful to Doc

147
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:08,462
who got us the tickets through the internet.

148
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:11,462
It was forecast that this movie would be crowded.

149
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,862
It would've been nice if Doc could've come too.

150
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,562
It can't be helped because he had urgent business to attend to.

151
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,862
Over here.

152
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,662
My seat is right in front of the children's seats.

153
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,462
I...I'm sorry!

154
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,862
I was looking for my seat, so I...

155
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:37,262
-Was it coke? -Yes.

156
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:40,362
I'll go get you a new drink right away!

157
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,962
So much for good memories, I guess.

158
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:55,062
I'm sorry about it.

159
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,362
Here you go!

160
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:03,662
Flowers...

161
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,662
"Nami Kasakura (27)" -It's just a habit of mine since I was a child.

162
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:10,462
I just can't help making it when I get hold of straw wrappers.

163
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:13,062
It's just a token of my apology,

164
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,862
but if you don't like it, please take it off.

165
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,262
No.

166
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,062
It's the lady we saw a while ago!

167
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,062
We're over here!

168
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:25,262
Those children let me know

169
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,962
that I had forgotten my wallet

170
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:29,462
on the ticket vending machine a while ago.

171
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,062
I see.

172
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:35,062
But, I didn't think that I would be sitting next to you.

173
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,562
Yeah.

174
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:38,862
I feel that it is some work of fate, don't you?

175
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,362
Fate?

176
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:45,062
I guess I exaggerated a bit here.

177
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,862
No. I was a bit surprised, though.

178
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,262
Huh? Those two...

179
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:52,162
They look good together.

180
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,862
This popcorn is good too!

181
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,862
A new love.

182
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:57,962
Right?

183
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,162
"Gomera"

184
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:07,862
"Great Monster Battle"

185
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:20,062
Gomera. Gomera.

186
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,662
Please, Gomera.

187
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:25,862
Please let out all the power you have left in you for us.

188
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:29,262
This movie really keeps going at it despite saying this is the last series.

189
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:32,462
Yeah, the one previous to this was "Farewell Gomera"

190
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,762
and the one before that was "Gomera Forever".

191
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,562
Well, if the children all like it,

192
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,262
that's all that counts, right?

193
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,862
Cell phone?

194
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,862
Oh, no.

195
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,662
Gomera's internal organs...

196
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:59,362
This CG is pretty good, really.

197
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,562
Hey, Ai. That's CG...

198
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:14,262
Gomera final really was something, wasn't it?

199
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,762
Yes. I was really touched!

200
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,562
Are you all right?

201
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:22,662
Yes. I just lack a little sleep.

202
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,062
It can't be helped!

203
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,162
Because police officers usually don't get to sleep much

204
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,562
when they're working.

205
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,562
Are you an officer?

206
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:34,862
Yes, although today is my day off.

207
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,162
Is anything wrong?

208
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:42,762
Well, I was planning to go talk to the police about something.

209
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,362
Will you hear me out?

210
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:51,662
So, it's about a stalker?

211
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:55,762
Yes, I happen to sense something like that since the other day.

212
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:59,762
Didn't you tell your friends or acquaintances about this?

213
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,262
I did tell my boyfriend about it.

214
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:05,962
And he's staying in my room at my condo right now.

215
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,962
Your boyfriend, you say?

216
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,962
Too bad.

217
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,962
Hey, can you scoot over that side a bit there?

218
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,262
Can't do.

219
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,962
Genta, you're taking up too much space.

220
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,562
This car's too small.

221
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,062
You guys.

222
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:23,862
If you don't quiet down a bit, I'm going to let you down.

223
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,762
I see.

224
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,462
Someone is following you,

225
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:30,562
or rummaging through your trash

226
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,362
or crank calling you.

227
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:36,362
Well, it could all just be my imagination too.

228
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:39,962
I'm back.

229
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,062
I met this police officer today and I...

230
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,226
At the movie theater...

231
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,126
Then, Inspector Shiratori,

232
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,926
you're saying that you coincidentally happened to

233
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,626
sit next to Ms. Sasakura in the theater.

234
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:17,626
Yes.

235
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:20,126
When she found out that I was from the police,

236
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,526
she told me that she was being troubled by a stalker.

237
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:27,526
So, I came to her room in this condo

238
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:31,826
and found the body of this man that had been murdered.

239
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:35,526
The name of the victim is Mr. Yoshiro Kamei, age 30.

240
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,526
He works for a stock exchange company nearby.

241
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:45,326
And, he's the man you've been going with, is that right?

242
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:46,726
Yes.

243
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:50,026
I also told him that I was being troubled by a stalker,

244
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:53,426
and had him come here from about two or three days ago.

245
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,626
According to the coroner's report,

246
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:59,026
the estimated time of death is around 14:00 today.

247
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,526
He was beaten to death.

248
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,026
He seems to have been struck with a hard rod like object.

249
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:07,826
Was the door locked when you came back?

250
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,726
It was opened,

251
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:13,826
but the spare key that he usual has attached to his hips is gone,

252
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,326
so maybe...

253
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:16,926
It could be that the culprit made away

254
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:21,326
after locking the door with the spare key then.

255
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,626
In order to delay the discovery of the victim as much as possible.

256
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:31,326
If that stalker had abnormal feelings of love for you,

257
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:38,326
it's no wonder if he had bitter feelings against your boyfriend

258
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,826
who was sleeping over at your place.

259
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:43,226
No... no way.

260
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:44,926
Or...

261
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:48,126
you made it look that way after you killed him.

262
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,726
Please wait a minute, Inspector Megure.

263
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:57,926
If it was about 14:00, she was at the theatre

264
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:01,826
sitting next to me and watching the movie.

265
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,026
She couldn't have done it.

266
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:07,926
But, it only takes about five minutes from here to the theater.

267
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,526
She could've slipped out of the theater

268
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:11,126
saying she was going to the restroom,

269
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:15,226
take the cab, commit the murder then come back with the cab again.

270
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:19,626
Well, if you can testify that she was beside you all the while,

271
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,826
then there would be no problem.

272
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:25,826
No, I can't because I dozed off part way.

273
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,526
Inspector Megure.

274
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:32,126
It seems that the victim did make a call to someone at around 14:00,

275
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,626
the time the murder was committed.

276
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,026
What?

277
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,726
That could be me.

278
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:41,626
I got a call while I was watching the movie,

279
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,826
so I rushed to hang up.

280
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,726
I forgot to turn off my cell phone before the movie started, you see.

281
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:49,626
Do you remember this?

282
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:55,026
No. I seem to have been sleeping just then.

283
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,726
I saw!

284
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,226
Just what do you mean?

285
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,326
While I was watching the movie, light suddenly flashed.

286
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:05,126
I saw the hat of that lady!

287
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,626
I think that the light leaked

288
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,926
when I opened the cell phone to switch it off.

289
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:15,226
If that call was from her boyfriend who was killed,

290
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:17,526
it would serve as a perfect alibi, wouldn't it?

291
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:20,726
That... that's true, but...

292
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:23,326
How come you're all here?

293
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:28,026
Because that lady said that she'd treat us to something to eat.

294
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:29,226
Something to eat?

295
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:32,026
Yes, as a reward for us telling her

296
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:35,126
that she had forgotten her wallet

297
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:38,426
on the ticket vending machine.

298
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,526
But, we were even more surprised

299
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,426
after her cell phone flashed light, right?

300
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,026
Yeah, I was really scared!

301
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:49,126
Huh? What happened?

302
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:52,326
That's probably the scene when Gomera was beat up

303
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:54,726
and its internal organs were in view.

304
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:58,526
That scene was really grotesque, so...

305
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:00,626
You... you mean the monster Gomera?

306
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:01,926
Yes.

307
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:04,026
That's the kind of movie you were watching?

308
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:07,026
I like special effects. Is there anything wrong with that?

309
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:10,126
Well, that scene was grotesque too, but...

310
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,526
What was really surprising was...

311
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,626
The scene after that when...

312
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,326
The scene when Gomera bit the other monster's neck,

313
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,126
shattered it!

314
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:23,026
The amount of blood that splattered was unreal.

315
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:26,826
Were you watching the same movie too, Inspector Shiratori?

316
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,826
Yes, well...

317
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:31,726
And? There's no mistake that

318
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,526
you were watching the movie from 13:00 to 15:00?

319
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:37,026
Yes. To put it accurately,

320
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,326
from 13:05...

321
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:45,626
This is... If I remember correctly,

322
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,826
this is what was attached to the cup of coke

323
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,926
that Ms. Sasakura bought for Inspector Shiratori.

324
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:54,726
It started from 13:05 to 14:50

325
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,626
for an hour and 45 minutes.

326
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,326
Well, just to be sure,

327
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,926
let's have Officer Takagi go confirm at the theater

328
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:09,626
whether she really didn't go outside while the movie was being shown.

329
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,126
Because there is a little something that is bothering me too.

330
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,326
Then, Officer Takagi, I'm counting on you.

331
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,126
Yes, sir!

332
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,426
And...

333
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:21,726
in the meantime, we would like to check inside the room.

334
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:25,026
-Is it all right? -Yes.

335
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:27,526
If you were being followed by a stalker,

336
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:29,926
there's a chance of a wiretap being set up somewhere in the room

337
00:19:29,926 --> 00:19:32,726
as well as a hidden camera, isn't there?

338
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,826
Right.

339
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:36,726
I'm counting on you then.

340
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,226
Conan.

341
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,626
You don't have to help investigate.

342
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,926
Will you stay still in the corner of the room?

343
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:04,426
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:08,926
Inspector Shiratori, did you find anything?

345
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:11,526
No, not really.

346
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,926
Did you see anything in this room that you don't know about?

347
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,326
Not really.

348
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:26,626
Hey, Ayumi.

349
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,826
What're you doing from a while ago?

350
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,226
Flowers!

351
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:31,426
-Flowers? -Flowers?

352
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:32,726
Right!

353
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,926
First, you tear the proliferated part of the wrapper of the straw carefully

354
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,926
into a narrow strip.

355
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:47,226
Then you fold it one on top of the other,

356
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:48,926
like this.

357
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:51,826
Then you put the folded paper together

358
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:54,226
and tear it in this shape.

359
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:55,926
-If you tear it? -If you tear it?

360
00:20:55,926 --> 00:21:01,926
Here you go! A strip of flowers!

361
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:05,026
-Fantastic! -Very pretty!

362
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,926
What're they doing at the murder site?

363
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:10,026
And?

364
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:15,326
So what? Is the culprit Ms. Sasakura after all?

365
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:19,326
You were shooting her that kind of look just a while ago, weren't you?

366
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:20,626
Yeah.

367
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:23,726
She said she was a fan of special effects,

368
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,926
but I was thinking that she didn't have any monster figurines

369
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:29,426
or books on the subject.

370
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:31,426
That's not all, is it?

371
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,226
The reason why you're suspecting her.

372
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,926
Besides, we're her witnesses.

373
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,726
The seats of the theater.

374
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:39,826
Seats?

375
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:41,626
Didn't you think it was strange?

376
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,226
Seats, if I remember correctly...

377
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:47,726
All five of us were in the middle front row seats.

378
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,926
The seats of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

379
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:53,526
were right in front of ours with the corridor in between, right?

380
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:55,726
What's strange about that?

381
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:59,326
We went to see the Sunday afternoon show.

382
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:03,226
It was naturally packed with parents and children,

383
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,926
but for some reason the seats on both sides of Inspector Shiratori and Nami

384
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:07,526
were empty.

385
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,526
Maybe it was just a coincidence?

386
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:11,126
Besides,

387
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:14,126
it also bothers me that we are witnesses who are proving her alibi

388
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,526
when we just happened to run into her today.

389
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,126
But, you saw her too, didn't you?

390
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:23,126
That she was in the theater at the time the murder was committed.

391
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,126
Yeah, I saw her.

392
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,426
Hat, that is.

393
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:30,126
Hey, don't tell me that...

394
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:32,326
Well, I'm pretty sure it'll be okay.

395
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:36,026
Probably, Inspector Shiratori seems to have realized that too,

396
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:39,926
and sent Officer Takagi over to the theater.

397
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,926
With the proof hidden in his pocket.

398
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,626
"Next Episode" -Personal emotions are to be left out when investigating,

399
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:14,126
right, Inspector Shiratori?

400
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,826
I've figured out

401
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:19,826
the reason why Inspector Shiratori hesitated.

402
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,226
It's a symbol of strength, kindness, coolness,

403
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:26,226
a flower of justice!

404
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:31,626
Are you talking about this flower?

405
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,026
Next Conan,

406
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:36,850
"Officer Shiratori Cherry Blossom Memory (Part 2)".

407
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:54,437
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,137
"Hat".

409
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:57,637
In the next episode, Inspector Shiratori and that person

410
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:00,137
will make close contact! Talk about unexpected...
