1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,570
-Camping... -Camping...

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,670
-We're going camping. -We're going camping.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,770
Amazing!

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,270
She's climbing that wall.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,870
The river's on this side.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,370
They're kayaking downstream.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,070
How beautiful.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,070
Wait.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,170
They're valuable alpine plants

10
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,470
so don't pick them.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,570
-Okay. -Hurry, let's go.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,870
You're going to take a panorama photo of the town

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,470
and use it for your science project, right?

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,570
Let's go.

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,570
-Okay! -Okay.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,170
"Mount Kumomaru, Cottage Entrance" -Enough!

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
What?

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,870
-Aren't they the people we just saw? -What are you guys always like that?

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,670
You come late and tell us to prepare the meal.

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,170
"Takemi Yamakura (26)" -Shut up, what's the problem?

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,370
Eiko's said that she'll do it.

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,970
"Eiko Ikeguchi (23)" -Yes, I said so.

23
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,470
That's not the point.

24
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,170
Takemi, you're always that way.

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,670
"Taro Hayashida (28)" -Calm down, Ashizuka.

26
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,570
"Tokunori Ashizuka (33)" -No, let me say this.

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,770
She's always selfish thinking only about herself and causing trouble.

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,170
True.

29
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,470
That's why Motoki died too.

30
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,870
Wrong.

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,370
That was an accident.

32
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,170
I wonder about that.

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,570
I'll bet you think that what happened three years ago

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,070
was my fault too, right?

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,770
An accident? Three years ago?

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,970
Wait, Takemi!

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,770
I did what wasn't called for.

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,170
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,370
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

41
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,870
It was supposed to be a refreshing mountain climbing trip

42
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,170
but misfortune strikes an arguing group.

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,770
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,170
His name is Detective Conan!

46
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:48,928
"The Dark Mountain Route"

47
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:57,928
It looks like she's going to be sleeping under the cliff tonight.

48
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,628
They look like they don't get along.

49
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,428
I'm sure they've got they're reasons.

50
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:07,728
I'm sorry, all of you.

51
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,128
I'm sorry you had to see that.

52
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:13,128
What kind of accident happened three years ago?

53
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,328
What?

54
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:21,228
We all belonged to the same club.

55
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,728
But three years ago, one of our members got into an accident.

56
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,628
She, Takemi, went off on her own

57
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:35,628
and Motoki went after her and fell off the cliff.

58
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:38,228
Motoki was my childhood friend

59
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:41,028
and we used to climb mountains together.

60
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,828
We were planning to do so for as long as we could.

61
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,828
But, just because of Takemi!

62
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,028
Darn it.

63
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:53,128
So that's why we gather here to commemorate his death.

64
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:57,528
What?

65
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,928
What's this sound?

66
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,128
Maybe it's...

67
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:03,828
"Helium" -It's a meteorological balloon.

68
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:04,828
Yeah.

69
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:09,528
I'm flying this to the stratosphere to attain weather data.

70
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:12,828
Mr. Hayashida, you're a meteorological station staff, aren't you?

71
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,128
Right.

72
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:18,028
I'm going to be flying balloons every day for ten days.

73
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,928
I've got all of them here too.

74
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,328
Something smells strange.

75
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:27,728
Yeah. I put kerosene on to strengthen it.

76
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,828
All done!

77
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,628
Amazing!

78
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,328
If we use this to fly through the air,

79
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:36,528
I guess we can reach the peak right away, What?

80
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:38,528
That's impossible.

81
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:43,428
One balloon can only carry a weight of five to six kg.

82
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,428
There!

83
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,328
Genta can really toss and turn.

84
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,028
She's not here.

85
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:09,428
I'll try call her.

86
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,528
Let her be, that woman.

87
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,628
But...

88
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,728
I'm sorry. Did we wake you?

89
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:16,928
Nope.

90
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:20,928
Did Mr. Motoki die at this time?

91
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,928
Hello, Takemi?

92
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:25,428
Don't wake me up,

93
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,728
I was sleeping.

94
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,228
I know!

95
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,628
I'll offer my prayers like I should too!

96
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:40,528
Where's Mr. Hayashida?

97
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,628
He said he was going to a nearby mountain to get data.

98
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,128
What's wrong, Ayumi?

99
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,728
I had a nightmare.

100
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:52,728
-What? -What?

101
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,628
I see. Poor thing.

102
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:59,228
I'll cast a spell that will help you go back to sleep.

103
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,328
After we finish eating breakfast,

104
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,228
we're heading off right away.

105
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:11,928
Off to the peak!

106
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:17,628
What's up, Genta?

107
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,528
That...

108
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,128
Takemi is lying on the ground!

109
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:28,328
Conan!

110
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:29,728
5:05 am.

111
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,328
"Campsite Entrance"

112
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,128
Over there!

113
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,728
5:45 am.

114
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,828
Takemi!

115
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,028
She's dead.

116
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,828
No, it can't be.

117
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,728
Look at this.

118
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,228
This is a mountain compass.

119
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,328
Yeah.

120
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,128
Takemi?

121
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,228
What happened?

122
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,228
Could that be a drone?

123
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,528
Yeah. Since we're investigating in the mountains,

124
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:21,428
we've decided to use this.

125
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:23,128
MPD is awesome!

126
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,528
Are you three

127
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:29,728
acquainted to the late Ms. Takemi Yamakura?

128
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,828
-Yes. -We found a backpack

129
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:36,428
in the woods about three km from here.

130
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:40,428
Will you please confirm if it belongs to Ms. Yamakura?

131
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:43,328
Backpack in the woods?

132
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,328
No mistake about it. It's Takemi's.

133
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,828
I see.

134
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,628
There was a knife,

135
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:52,428
that is thought to be a murder weapon and an empty wallet inside.

136
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:54,928
The perp disposed of it, right?

137
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,328
Then the perp after killing Takemi below,

138
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,028
fled out of the mountains.

139
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,428
No, the thing is...

140
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,228
The mountain security guards

141
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,928
were at the mountain hut by the entrance

142
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,828
at the foot of the mountain from 4 am,

143
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,628
but they said they saw no one who looked to be the perp

144
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:13,028
leave the mountains.

145
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:15,228
Just what does that mean?

146
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:18,428
It could be that someone left the backpack in the woods

147
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:21,728
to make it look as if someone from the outside committed the crime.

148
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,228
In other words, you're saying that one of us did it.

149
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,128
Wait. It's impossible.

150
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,128
What makes you say that?

151
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,828
Takemi was alive till 3 am.

152
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,428
You were there too, weren't you?

153
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:36,428
Yep.

154
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:40,328
It's the time that Ms. Eiko made a call on the phone, right?

155
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:41,628
Right.

156
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,028
We found the body about 5 am.

157
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,128
In other words,

158
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,128
the crime was committed within a span of two hours.

159
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,128
But no matter how fast you are,

160
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:53,228
in order to get to the crime scene using the mountain trail,

161
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,028
it'll at least take 40 to 50 minutes.

162
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,928
It took us about that long when we went there earlier.

163
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,928
Then if the perp killed Ms. Takemi

164
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:07,328
and left the backpack in the woods three km away,

165
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,128
it would take her an additional 30 to 40 minutes.

166
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,428
Since the mountain trail heading back is uphill,

167
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,828
maybe it took more than 60 minutes.

168
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,728
That would amount to a total of more than 120 minutes.

169
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,728
Doing so within two hours is impossible.

170
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:22,028
Besides that, Mr. Ashizuka and the others

171
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,428
were sleeping with us in the mountain hut.

172
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,128
Ms. Eiko was sleeping with me too!

173
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,728
See. Eiko and I couldn't have done it.

174
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:32,228
But, as for you, Hayashida.

175
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:35,328
I was in the mountains on the other side doing my observation.

176
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,928
I see.

177
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:42,728
Will you tell us a little about the late Ms. Yamakura then?

178
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,828
I wonder if they really didn't do it?

179
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,628
Ms. Eiko, didn't.

180
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:51,328
I'm sure.

181
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:55,528
But, we saw those four people fighting, didn't we?

182
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,928
Okay, shall we start investigations, then?

183
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,028
What?

184
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:01,028
-Yes! -Yes!

185
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,828
If someone among them is the perp,

186
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,328
it would mean that the perp left the mountain hut,

187
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:06,928
went to the scene of the crime and the woods,

188
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:11,128
then returned within a span of two hours.

189
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,328
However, this is actually impossible.

190
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,228
If so, what if the perp climbed?

191
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,628
-Climbed? -Climbed?

192
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,928
Yes, if you were to climb straight up and down that cliff

193
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,428
without taking the mountain trail,

194
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:23,728
it could be done in two hours.

195
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:26,928
Ms. Eiko was climbing, but...

196
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,928
No, but that cliff is about 50 m.

197
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:34,428
It would take even an expert climber at least an hour.

198
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,028
No good.

199
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,528
Then, it's the river!

200
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:38,528
-River? -River?

201
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:41,628
Yep. Mr. Ashizuka were kayaking, right?

202
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,128
If he used the river that is near this open square

203
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,728
and go downstream on the currents.

204
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:49,928
True, it zigzags all the way to the scene.

205
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,128
It may be okay going there but what about coming back?

206
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,428
You can't reverse upstream

207
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:58,928
and you would need time to put the canoe away.

208
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,828
No good.

209
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,328
I got it!

210
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,028
The sky...

211
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,228
The hot air balloon.

212
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:06,528
-Hot air balloon? -Hot air balloon?

213
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,028
Yeah. The perp flew like a bird

214
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:11,128
and went to the scene of the crime as well as the woods.

215
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:14,128
The wind is blowing from the south to the north

216
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,028
so a balloon could make the flight.

217
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,828
One hot air balloon can carry a maximum of up to five to six kg,

218
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:21,928
so it's impossible for humans to ride it.

219
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:25,728
That's why all the balloons were inflated and set out.

220
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,328
How about it, Conan?

221
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:31,028
Mr. Hayashida said that he had balloons to last ten days, right?

222
00:12:31,028 --> 00:12:32,828
Now, he has nine balloons left.

223
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:34,928
In other words, even if he were to use all his balloons,

224
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,228
I think it'd be difficult.

225
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,128
-No good. -No good.

226
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:41,328
This is a difficult problem.

227
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,928
I can't think of anything.

228
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,228
It's out of place.

229
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:49,928
"Helium"

230
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,628
Mud?

231
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,128
Over here.

232
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:04,528
The traces of a rope?

233
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:06,928
Conan.

234
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,328
What's the matter?

235
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,828
What?

236
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:13,328
What's this?

237
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,128
Wait, Edogawa.

238
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,628
That's wool.

239
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,028
Hey!

240
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,928
There's some commotion at the mountain hut!

241
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:34,295
Is this a balloon?

242
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,095
Yes. The drone found it a little into the woods

243
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:40,595
where the backpack was found on the ground.

244
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:43,295
It seems to have gotten stuck on the branch of a tree and tore.

245
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,895
A balloon.

246
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,095
I see.

247
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:48,295
So, you're the perp after all.

248
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,395
Me, the perp?

249
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:54,295
Right. You used this to transport the backpack, didn't you?

250
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,295
Transport the backpack with the balloon?

251
00:13:56,295 --> 00:14:00,095
At 3 am, you said that you were going on an observation,

252
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:03,595
took one balloon and went below the cliff.

253
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,695
And then you killed Takemi.

254
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,995
Then you tied the backpack onto the balloon

255
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,795
and flew off to the sky and transported it to the woods.

256
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:13,595
This way, you can do it within two hours.

257
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:17,095
It was unlucky that it got stuck part way to a tree.

258
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,595
Wait.

259
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,895
I was on observation then.

260
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,595
"Observation Notes" -I also have the observations notes.

261
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,695
It's easy to fake one of those any day.

262
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:28,495
Besides the red compass that was found at the site.

263
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:32,295
Isn't that what Motoki gave you as a keepsake?

264
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,495
You saw it at the site too, didn't you?

265
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:36,895
Why didn't you say anything about it?

266
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,095
I didn't want to be suspected.

267
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,195
Liar!

268
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:43,395
You just pretended you didn't know, right?

269
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:45,995
You're the perp after all!

270
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,595
Inspector!

271
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,495
We found this in Mr. Hayashida's belongings.

272
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,895
What's this?

273
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,295
It's an observation device that is attached to the balloon.

274
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:57,495
But, I usually carry it around with me.

275
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,595
There's blood on it.

276
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,195
I could be the victim's.

277
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:04,395
No, I didn't do it!

278
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:07,295
So he was the perp after all.

279
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:10,895
Balloons... Kerosene... Wool...

280
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,895
Something's bothering you, right?

281
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,395
Maybe...

282
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:25,695
Officer Takagi!

283
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:28,895
Stop in right there.

284
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,195
I thought so.

285
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:35,295
So that's the story.

286
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:37,995
No, I didn't do it.

287
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,395
It's not me.

288
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,095
Please wait, Inspector.

289
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:43,895
Hey, Shinichi.

290
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:46,095
Is something wrong, Dr. Agasa?

291
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,695
No. I just have several things that are bothering me.

292
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:50,995
Mr. Hayashida,

293
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:54,495
you wiped you hands and body very clean yesterday, didn't you?

294
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,795
What? Yes, I did.

295
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,395
That's why you don't smell of kerosene.

296
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,595
Kerosene?

297
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:06,695
Yes. You use it to reinforce the strengthen of rubber balloons.

298
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:09,995
If he used the balloon, the smell would still be there.

299
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,895
It could be that he wiped it off right after committing the crime.

300
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,895
Even if Mr. Hayashida were to be the perp,

301
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,695
he only had two hours at the most.

302
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:21,195
Did he really have that much time?

303
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,795
So, are you saying that the perp is someone else?

304
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,895
That is what it would mean.

305
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:29,195
There is something I would like you all to see.

306
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:31,995
It's this.

307
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,995
The board here could easily be removed.

308
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,395
One more thing.

309
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:39,595
Officer Takagi.

310
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:44,095
Will you please confirm how many balloons there are in that shed?

311
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:45,195
Yes, sir.

312
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,695
There are three left.

313
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:53,795
Mr. Hayashida, how many balloons are really supposed to be left?

314
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,095
Nine.

315
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,295
There are six missing after all.

316
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:00,395
The real perp used the balloons.

317
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,795
-What? -Dr. Agasa, what do you mean?

318
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:08,495
The perp before 3 am after everyone hit the sack,

319
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:13,095
left the mountain hut and got the six balloons ready.

320
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:16,795
But, when you inflate them, the sound is pretty loud.

321
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:20,995
So there was a need to go some distance away from the mountain hut.

322
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:23,895
There were the traces that were left behind back then.

323
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:27,895
Then after 3 am, after everyone offered prayer to Mr. Motoki,

324
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,995
and went back to bed,

325
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,595
the perp left the mountain hut,

326
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,895
took the six balloons that had been prepared beforehand

327
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:39,795
and jumped off the edge of the cliff.

328
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,195
Jumped off?

329
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,495
So, the perp flew through the sky after all.

330
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,495
Impossible.

331
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:47,995
People can't float using just six balloons.

332
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,295
True,

333
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:53,395
but that indeed is the key of this trick.

334
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,095
People can't float

335
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:58,195
but you can limit the descending speed.

336
00:17:58,195 --> 00:18:02,495
Like a bird that spreads its wings wide and decreases speed.

337
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:06,395
It lands once on a rock part way and slows down

338
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,795
and then the perp jumped below again.

339
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,595
In this way, the perp got there in the shortest amount of time.

340
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:15,495
You could never do something

341
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,195
so ridiculous.

342
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,195
Take a look at this.

343
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:21,895
It's a picture of a rock part way through the cliff.

344
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:25,695
There's an odd footprint where the tip of the toes are faced downwards.

345
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,195
Please wait.

346
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:29,495
If there were only six balloons,

347
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,695
the person would've had to be very light.

348
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,995
Right!

349
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:38,395
The real perp is you! Ms. Eiko Ikeguchi.

350
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,095
Me, the perp?

351
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,195
Wrong.

352
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:45,195
It's not her!

353
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:46,495
No.

354
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,695
After you reached the bottom of the cliff,

355
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,595
out of the six balloons, you let go of five.

356
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,395
The balloons were blown by the wind

357
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:57,095
and flew to the lake to the north

358
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,895
and would not be found by anyone.

359
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:01,395
As to the one that remained you released the gas,

360
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:04,495
scratched it and kept it.

361
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:06,495
After you killed Ms. Takemi,

362
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,895
you put Mr. Motoki's compass down

363
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:13,495
and headed north with Ms. Takemi's backpack and wallet.

364
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:16,195
After arriving at the woods three km ahead,

365
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,495
you put the backpack down

366
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:21,395
and left the balloon that you had deflated there.

367
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,195
Then you returned and

368
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,895
put the observation device

369
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:29,895
with Ms. Takemi's blood on it inside the backpack.

370
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,695
Wrong.

371
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:34,395
Wrong, I didn't do it!

372
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,395
You smell like kerosene, Miss.

373
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,795
What?

374
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,695
Come to think of it now,

375
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:44,895
all your actions had meaning to it, right?

376
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:45,895
Meaning?

377
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,295
Yep.

378
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:49,095
That argument too.

379
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,795
And calling Ms. Takemi's cell phone.

380
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:54,395
It was all to make her go

381
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,395
under the cliff and make it apparent that

382
00:19:57,395 --> 00:20:00,395
she was definitely alive till 3 am

383
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,295
Don't be ridiculous.

384
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:05,395
I was sleeping together with Ayumi when the incident took place.

385
00:20:05,395 --> 00:20:08,795
That was one of you calculated moves too.

386
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:13,295
You wanted Yoshida to testify your alibi for you.

387
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,595
Is it true?

388
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:15,795
No.

389
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:17,095
Enough already.

390
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,295
I didn't do it, and neither did I go to the woods!

391
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:22,095
I found this.

392
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,195
It's a species of thistle.

393
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,195
In this place, you can only find them growing colonies

394
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,995
in the area around the woods.

395
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,195
It was on Yoshida's pants.

396
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:33,995
It probably got there because she slept with you.

397
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:40,695
See, so you did go to the woods after all.

398
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:44,495
After going to the woods you came back right down here.

399
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,295
All you had left to do was to return home.

400
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:50,895
However, if you use the mountain trail, you may leave proof behind.

401
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:54,295
That's why you climbed this cliff on your way back here.

402
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,595
But since you were in such a rush,

403
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,095
you goofed at the very end.

404
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:00,795
This is blood.

405
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:01,795
Hey!

406
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:02,795
Yes, sir.

407
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,195
Excuse me.

408
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,995
This is the trace of the rope of the balloon.

409
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,495
Eiko, why did you...

410
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:17,695
I was secretly dating with Motoki.

411
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:22,395
I couldn't forgive Takemi who made him get into an accident.

412
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:26,695
You spent three years planning the murder

413
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,995
and studied about balloons just for that.

414
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:33,095
But why frame Hayashida for committing the crime?

415
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:37,195
Hayashida you knew about us, didn't you?

416
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,095
And you were jealous all the while.

417
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:44,395
So, even if you knew that Motoki was headed towards a dangerous wall,

418
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,195
you didn't say anything.

419
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:23,095
"Mount Kumomaru, Peak" -Okay!

420
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,295
Let's take a picture in memory of this trip!

421
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,795
Are you all in line everybody?

422
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:29,095
-Yeah. -Mitsuhiko, thanks.

423
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:32,895
Why? I wanna be in the picture with Haibara too.

424
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,395
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

425
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:35,795
I want to be in the picture too!

426
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:37,695
Thanks, Conan!

427
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,095
Who, me?

428
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,695
I guess I have no choice!

429
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:44,195
Officer Takagi!

430
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:46,995
Everybody, this is a special reward for all of you.

431
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,295
Here goes. Cheese.

432
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,495
"Next Episode" -Walking alone on the streets at night is dangerous.

433
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,795
Pops.

434
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:07,595
There's a weird smell mixed in with the smell of alcohol.

435
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,295
He smells kind of like peppers.

436
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:12,795
This wall sure is shiny like a mirror.

437
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:16,995
That's because it's UV coated.

438
00:24:18,995 --> 00:24:24,379
Next Conan, "Security System Pitfall"

439
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,838
Next Conan's Hint:

440
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,438
"Thief"

441
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:30,638
It's the middle of May.

442
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,638
"The Crimson Love Letter", the sooner the better.

443
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,838
-At your command. -At your command.
