1
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:20,932
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,632
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,132
The Youth Detective Squad goes mushroom hunting.

4
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:25,732
Beware of evil hunters.

5
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,232
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:29,232
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,732
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:59,791
"Mushrooms, A Bear And The Youth Detective Squad (Part 1)"

9
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:12,091
Listening, everyone. We are going mushroom picking.

10
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,691
However, you are not free to pick all you want.

11
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:17,091
Adults get to pick up to three and children up to two.

12
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:20,391
We'll cook the mushrooms you picked back at the inn.

13
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,291
Okay...

14
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,191
And pass the two wire fences is the hunting grounds,

15
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,991
so don't ever go inside!

16
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,691
Hunting grounds?

17
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,491
Bears appear.

18
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,491
Bears?

19
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,291
But, don't you worry. There is none on this side, so rest assured.

20
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:44,091
Hey, come on, what a place to go mushroom hunting.

21
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,291
I tell you.

22
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,091
At first, he made it sound like

23
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:50,991
there were loads of mushrooms growing everywhere.

24
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,291
There's nothing around, darn.

25
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,491
There, there.

26
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,791
It's all your fault, Genta.

27
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,191
You're the one who said let's go mushroom picking, right?

28
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,491
Actually I wanted to go apple picking.

29
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:07,191
But mushrooms are the thing to eat during autumn!

30
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:11,091
And besides, mushrooms are way more expensive than apples, right?

31
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,891
Oh, but an apple is the forbidden fruit, the fruit of knowledge,

32
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,991
that taught right from wrong that Adam and Eve ate,

33
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,691
and was banned from the Garden of Eden by God.

34
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,991
I think apples are way more mystical than mushrooms.

35
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:27,091
If it's the fruit of wisdom,

36
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,991
it'd do you good to eat a whole lot of it, Genta.

37
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,591
Shut up!

38
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:33,991
The Old Testament.

39
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,591
Although the saying that the fruit was an apple

40
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,191
is just popular belief.

41
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:50,391
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

42
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:52,991
What's with that look on your face?

43
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,191
What look on my face?

44
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:58,291
I was just looking at her.

45
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,191
You mean Ai?

46
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:03,591
Yes, although she's very blunt sometimes,

47
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,391
I think she's actually very sophisticated and diverse,

48
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,591
as well as very much of an adult.

49
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:11,391
Don't you think there's this mysterious air about her?

50
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,191
But that doesn't mean that I have special feelings for her

51
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,691
or anything like that you know.

52
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,191
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

53
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:23,891
Take it from me, stay away from her.

54
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,091
She's not one you can handle.

55
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:38,191
Hey, look.

56
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,091
It might be a mushroom!

57
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:44,691
Oh, that's a poisonous mushroom called agar-agar.

58
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:48,491
I can't take this anymore.

59
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:53,091
How the hell do we look for mushrooms without any hints.

60
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,591
There are hints.

61
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,991
Look around carefully.

62
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,891
See the pine needles that are yellow-green.

63
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,991
Mushrooms get their nutrition

64
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,591
by sticking onto the root of Japanese Red Pines,

65
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:06,691
so they are slightly weakened

66
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:08,091
and the needles change color like that.

67
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,091
So, that's the place to look.

68
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,691
Moreover, for mushrooms to grow,

69
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:16,591
good sunshine, good drainage of water and ventilation is a must.

70
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,791
If you check out the area with those things in mind.

71
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:25,791
See, you got what you want.

72
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,891
Where?

73
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,991
What a fine mushroom this is.

74
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:35,491
It sure looks delicious.

75
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,391
That's our first pick of the day.

76
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,891
Please look, everyone!

77
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:46,291
There are red pines with yellow-green needles over there, too.

78
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,691
Oh, really?

79
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:51,491
Okay, I'm going to find some, too.

80
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:58,391
Yellow-green needles. Under red pine trees.

81
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:05,791
I've found a mushroom, too.

82
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,291
See, me too.

83
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,391
Picking mushrooms does resemble treasure hunting in a way,

84
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,191
and is quite a lot of fun.

85
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,991
You can say that again!

86
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,991
Hey, where's Genta?

87
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:25,591
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around for a while.

88
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,791
I'm sure he's off somewhere using the men's room or something.

89
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,691
Well, he was gulping down a lot of mineral water.

90
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:37,291
He'll be in big trouble if he gets lost in a forest like this.

91
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,091
Let's go back and check.

92
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,191
Okay...

93
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,591
Genta went past the first wired fence?

94
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,291
Really?

95
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,291
Yeah. No doubt about it.

96
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,891
The soil is still new and the spacing is narrow.

97
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,591
It's proof that a child went over the fence.

98
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:04,391
Besides, there a lot of red pines with yellow-green needles

99
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,091
that I mentioned on the other side of the fence, too.

100
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:09,091
Good gracious.

101
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:12,591
Genta's Youth Detective badge is under repair right now,

102
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,891
so we can't use the tracing glasses either.

103
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,591
I've no choice.

104
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:20,391
I'll go look for him, so you all stay here.

105
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,291
You're going off on your own again,

106
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,091
and planning to get the credit all for yourself, aren't you?

107
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,191
We'll go look for him together with you.

108
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,691
Because we're worried about him, too.

109
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:31,891
But on the other side of the fence...

110
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,991
How about this?

111
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:38,091
I'll go as a pair with Mitsuhiko.

112
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:44,091
You go with Ayumi. Let's split up and look for him.

113
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,991
In the meantime, Genta may come back here,

114
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,791
so Dr. Agasa, will you wait here?

115
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,891
Well, it's more effective than looking around for him alone, isn't it?

116
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:58,591
Well, I guess so.

117
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:02,791
But, be careful, Ai. Two fences down is the hunting area.

118
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,891
It's not unusual that people picking mountain vegetables

119
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,791
are mistaken for animals and shot by hunters, in Japan.

120
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,191
Oh, thank you. So, you're worried about me.

121
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:14,391
You...

122
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:18,491
Anyway, let's all meet here in an hour.

123
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:19,891
If we can't find him,

124
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,291
let's have the people at the inn help us search for him.

125
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,491
Let's get started.

126
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:24,591
Okay...

127
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,091
Hey, let's get to it!

128
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,491
Let's go!

129
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:38,991
Okay!

130
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,591
Hey, Genta!

131
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,991
Genta, where are you? Answer me!

132
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,991
Darn.

133
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,191
I wonder where on earth Genta is?

134
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:56,291
-Genta! -Genta, where are you?

135
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,991
May I ask you a question?

136
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:06,691
Is there something between Conan and you?

137
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,291
Something?

138
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,191
Well, you two are always sneaking off

139
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:18,291
and talking in an adult Iike manner with each other.

140
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,591
You seem to understand each other really well.

141
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,991
You both have sort of a world of your own.

142
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,691
Don't let it bother you,

143
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,091
because it's not something all that romantic.

144
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:33,691
-But... -Come on, let's go.

145
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,591
Wait.

146
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,391
What was that sound?

147
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,691
It came from beyond the two wired fences, didn't it?

148
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,191
The wired fence is torn apart.

149
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,991
He could've gone in beyond from here.

150
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,391
It can't be. The hunting ground is beyond here.

151
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,291
If he got beyond the first fence,

152
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,191
and got lost in the forest in between,

153
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:00,791
he wouldn't be able to tell whether the hunting ground is

154
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,791
beyond these red pine bushes, would he?

155
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,591
Wait for me.

156
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,691
Genta? Come on. You worried us out of our wits.

157
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:21,091
Bear...

158
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,391
No sweat.

159
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,291
It's still a cub.

160
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,691
It doesn't even seem to be a year old yet.

161
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,091
How cute.

162
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:32,491
I guess so.

163
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,791
But, we've got to be careful,

164
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,891
because I'm sure the mother bear is somewhere nearby.

165
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,191
What?

166
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,491
Sound of gunfire?

167
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:44,791
Don't tell me that the mother of this cub was shot by a hunter.

168
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,391
Oh, no! Don't run that way.

169
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,991
There. It's a hunter.

170
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:57,091
I hope he doesn't think that we're prey.

171
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:01,291
Hey! We're people!

172
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,591
This is...

173
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,691
This wound...

174
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,391
is a rifle wound?

175
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:11,391
It can't be.

176
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:14,291
Hey! Don't shoot, please!

177
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,891
We're people.

178
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:24,591
Don't you see? That hunter is after us.

179
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,191
He thinks that we've witnessed a murder and he wants to shut us up.

180
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,491
What?

181
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Genta, that's enough!

182
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Do you have any idea of how worried we were about you?

183
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,380
I'm really sorry.

184
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,680
I was trying to pick mushrooms for everybody,

185
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,780
and before I knew it I went on in beyond.

186
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,080
Of all things!

187
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,980
Well, well, either way, you came back safely.

188
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,580
And, did you contact Ai and Mitsuhiko?

189
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,980
Well, I've been trying to contact them for a while now.

190
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,680
But I'm not getting any response.

191
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,280
Seriously, now it's those guys.

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,380
Hey, hey. The response from Mitsuhiko's badge

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,180
seems to be coming from the hunting area here.

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
What?

195
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,580
Strange.

196
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,680
After all, they should know that they are not supposed to go inside.

197
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
Seriously.

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
Let's find them while it's still bright

199
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,780
and go back to the inn before it gets dark!

200
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,980
Okay...

201
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,280
Hey, hey, I can't make up here.

202
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,480
Talk about helplessness.

203
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,780
What's the matter?

204
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,480
"Kiyoshi Yasaka (41)" -Coming to a place with children?

205
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,980
Two children seem to have got lost in here,

206
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,680
so we're looking for them.

207
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,480
Did you see a boy and girl somewhere around here, mister?

208
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,180
No, I didn't see any of them.

209
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,280
Hey! Here's Mitsuhiko's Youth Detective Squad badge!

210
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,980
Really?

211
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,580
But the two are nowhere in sight.

212
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,180
Blood stains.

213
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,780
Hey! What are these big footprints?

214
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,480
It's the footprints of a bear.

215
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,880
What? Which means that they were both eaten by a bear?

216
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,580
I don't think so.

217
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,880
Bears are basically afraid of humans,

218
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,180
and besides they don't take humans to be beasts of prey.

219
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,180
But, that's true when it comes to that certain bear.

220
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,080
"Matasaburou Saika (67)" -If it's the one

221
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,180
who has a grudge against humans,

222
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,580
the two kids would be

223
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,080
a feast for the bear before it goes into hibernation.

224
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,280
Yes, if it's that one-eyed Japanese bear, Jubei.

225
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,280
Oh, no.

226
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,180
I see. So the rumor about the bear was true after all.

227
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,980
My having come all this way was worth it.

228
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,380
Don't worry, girlie,

229
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,280
"Tomoya Negoro (28)" -I'll avenge the death of your friends for you.

230
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,580
What do you mean avenge the death of?

231
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,080
We don't even know whether they were attacked by the bear yet.

232
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,980
At any rate, let us help you look for the children.

233
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah. After all, we know this mountain better than you do.

234
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,980
Sorry, girlie.

235
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,380
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

236
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,580
Ai!

237
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
It's Conan and the others.

238
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,580
See. On the other side of the forest.

239
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,980
Hey!

240
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,080
Wait. The hunter we saw a while ago is with them, too.

241
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,380
What? But, why?

242
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Probably to block our path of escape,

243
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,680
since we witnessed him committing the murder.

244
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,080
If we go out carelessly, we'll be shot to death.

245
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,580
And, he'll probably justify by saying that he thought we were the bear.

246
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,780
Hey, Ai!

247
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,580
Where are you, Mitsuhiko?

248
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,180
Answer us if you're around somewhere!

249
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,280
Another piece of potato chip on the ground.

250
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,380
It's not stale yet, and I'm sure the two left it behind as a trail.

251
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,380
They're trying to show us the road they took.

252
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:27,180
Hey! Shouldn't we look for Ai's badge using Conan s glasses?

253
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,480
Can't do, because her badge is on my desk at home.

254
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I was testing whether the transmission function of your badge

255
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,180
that is under repair is working well, so...

256
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,880
Oh, no.

257
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,280
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

258
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Can you verbally describe the place

259
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,080
where I found Mitsuhiko's badge a while ago, can't you?

260
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,580
Yeah, because it was near the place the wired fence was torn apart.

261
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,080
Then, tell the person at the inn where it is,

262
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,980
and have the police check that area together with them.

263
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,080
What? The police?

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,880
Don't you think it's strange that a trail of their path is left behind,

265
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,980
and yet we can't catch up with them no matter how hard we try?

266
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,380
Aren't they running from the bear?

267
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,380
No, there were blood stains around the area

268
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,280
where Mitsuhiko's badge was found.

269
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,380
There was a brand new bullet mark on a tree nearby, too.

270
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,280
Maybe it's not the bear that the two are running from, but rather...

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,180
Hey, don't tell me that...

272
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Could it be Mitsuhiko and Ai?

273
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,680
Hey, what's with you?

274
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Darn, it got away.

275
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,080
A rabbit?

276
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Are you guys out of your mind?

277
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,780
What if it were the two kids?

278
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,280
I've got eyes good enough to distinguish prey from the kids.

279
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,980
Don't you worry even if that bear Jubei comes out.

280
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll get him with the swiftness you just saw.

281
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,980
That flimsy shot of yours wouldn't even skim by it.

282
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,180
What?

283
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,380
If you treasure your life, don't shoot even if Jubei appears.

284
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,180
The minute it senses the smell of humans,

285
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,680
it'll sneak soundlessly up to you.

286
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,280
A bullet shot will not kill him.

287
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,180
It is a monster of over 2 meters.

288
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,180
I'm the only one who can hunt it down.

289
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,480
Because I'm the one who got one of its eyes 20 years ago.

290
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,180
What's with that old man, anyway?

291
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,880
He's a well-known hunter in this area.

292
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,580
I hear that he used to be a hunter

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,580
in the mountains of the Tohoku region in the past.

294
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,580
But, since he ran into Jubei here, he's decided to stick around it seems.

295
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,580
He was a hunter?

296
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,880
Yeah, the boss of a group of hunters.

297
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,580
I guess we don't have to worry about when the bear shows up then.

298
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,980
Dr. Agasa, will you make the call?

299
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
All right.

300
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,780
Just as I thought.

301
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,380
That hunter was going to fire at us

302
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,080
the minute we showed up in front of him.

303
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,380
What?

304
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,980
But what if we shout out loud and wait in the middle of the road?

305
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,080
They've got little Ayumi on their side you know.

306
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,180
He may be thinking of taking her hostage and killing everybody off.

307
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,280
After all, he's already murdered someone.

308
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,080
Oh, no.

309
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,780
Judging from how he looked when he fired at us,

310
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,680
it seems that he came into the mountains with a hunter

311
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,480
that he had a grudge against and shot him to death.

312
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,380
But, don't you have to submit papers before you're allowed to hunt?

313
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,480
If the corpse is found, wouldn't he be the prime suspect,

314
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,980
being that he came in together with the one he killed?

315
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,780
Not really. You can submit the papers way before you come.

316
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,680
Then, you're allowed to come and hunt anytime

317
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,280
between the duration of the permit.

318
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,480
You don't need to report when you're coming.

319
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,380
In other words, if you make the person that you're planning to kill

320
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,480
submit the papers,

321
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,780
and you go on and make yourself a fake alibi,

322
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,980
even if the corpse is found, chances are,

323
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,780
the officers will think that some hunter had mistakenly fired at him.

324
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,380
Which means that since we saw what happened...

325
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,280
Yes, his plan went down the drain.

326
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,380
He's probably dying to kill us.

327
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,880
Then maybe we shouldn't have made a trail with potato chips,

328
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
to let them know where we are,

329
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,080
but rather escape through the woods.

330
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
No.

331
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,780
Moving on our own in a forest we are not familiar with is dangerous.

332
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,580
We have no way of getting out of these mountains

333
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,180
without joining Dr. Agasa anyway.

334
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,580
We'll be fine.

335
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,280
If you dropped your badge near the corpse,

336
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,180
I'm sure that Conan will notice something is wrong.

337
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,880
Yes, I'm sure he will.

338
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,880
Come on, we've got to think while walking

339
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
if we want to save ourselves.

340
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,380
We've got to figure out a way

341
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,580
to let Conan alone know the predicament we're in.

342
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,880
Not only for ourselves do we have to be careful,

343
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,980
but also for this bear cub that for some reason is coming along with us.

344
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,180
We don't want to endanger it, do we?

345
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,580
No.

346
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,580
I'll bet a bear did this.

347
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,480
The bear peeled off the outer wood with its nails

348
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,280
and ate the sweet wood on the inside.

349
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,680
The space between the nails is wide and it's pretty high, too.

350
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,180
It's a pretty big one.

351
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,580
-It's Jubei. -What?

352
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,880
Look, it's bitten the tree

353
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,580
together with the cub that it gave birth to this winter.

354
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,380
Birth to? Isn't Jubei a male?

355
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
You mean you don't know?

356
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,780
It has been said since the days of old

357
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,380
that the god who resides in the mountains is a jealous goddess.

358
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
In order to complete hunting safely,

359
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,780
it is necessary to avoid the envy of mountain goddess,

360
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,080
that's why the bear has a male's name.

361
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,380
She was named after the superb, one-eyed swordsman, Yagyu Jubei.

362
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,380
You mean it's a female bear that is over 2 meters in height?

363
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,080
I sure gotta get a look at this one.

364
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,280
All do anything to get to see it.

365
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Is there anything on my face, mister?

366
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,580
Oh, no.

367
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,780
It's just that you talk so much like one of my friends that I...

368
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,680
Is that friend of yours here in the mountains today, by any chance?

369
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,780
What?

370
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,280
Because when you took your camera out a while ago I saw a shotgun.

371
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,680
The bullet of that gun splits into

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,580
9 directions and flies, doesn't it?

373
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,780
But the one you fired a while ago was a one-direction gun.

374
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,980
I've heard that there is no hunter that carries

375
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,980
two types of bullets when hunting.

376
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,080
Well...

377
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,980
My friend forgot to take his extra bullet

378
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,780
and went into the mountains without it.

379
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,380
I thought I'd give it to him if I ran into him,

380
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,080
and brought it along with me.

381
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,980
But, will he be okay?

382
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Your friend's still in there alone, isn't he?

383
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,680
He'll be fine.

384
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,180
He's been here many times,

385
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,380
and we always hunt apart from each other anyway.

386
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,080
Do you sense something, Ayumi?

387
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,680
No. It's nothing.

388
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Hey, they're starting off.

389
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,780
Yeah.

390
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,680
Hey, Ayumi!

391
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
Wait for me.

392
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,280
"Next Episode" -He's here!

393
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,980
Without a doubt.

394
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
The murderer is...

395
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,180
among the three.

396
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,780
He probably wants to shut Ai and Mitsuhiko up

397
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,280
for having witnessed the murder.

398
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Don't come out!

399
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,480
Next Conan,

400
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,301
"Mushrooms, A Bear And The Youth Detective Squad (Part 2)"

401
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,982
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:33,582
"Mushrooms"

403
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:36,582
Hey, how come you're the expensive mushroom and I'm the cheap one.

404
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:37,982
That's life.
