1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.210
As times change,
difficult cases will increase in number!

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.800
Today's stage is a golf range!

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.090
A nice shot, full of bloodlust!

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.020
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.180
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.430
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.497
The Golf Range Murder Case.

8
00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:37.987
Beika Golf Garden

9
00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:48.627
Off it goes!

10
00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:57.327
I don't think he
and golf mix well...

11
00:01:57.327 --> 00:02:01.947
Yeah, he says he's not good
at any sports that use equipment.

12
00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:04.927
Then he should've said no...

13
00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.887
The reason he picked up golf

14
00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:11.817
was a phone call from
Nichiuri TV three days ago.

15
00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:15.997
Huh? Pro-amateur
charity golf tournament?

16
00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:19.577
I'm sorry, but golf's not really my--

17
00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:22.497
What?! Okino Yoko recommended me?!

18
00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.657
Yoko-chan's entering?!

19
00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:27.657
I'll do it! I may not look like it,

20
00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:31.577
but I'm actually a golf master!

21
00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:34.497
Still...

22
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:40.157
...just because
early morning is cheaper,

23
00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:42.197
6:30 is too early!

24
00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:44.107
Especially when
you're dragging us along!

25
00:02:48.307 --> 00:02:50.887
Well, then! Let's work up
another good sweat today!

26
00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:54.977
Yes, it's perfect exercise
just before work!

27
00:02:54.977 --> 00:02:58.947
Thanks to you,
my health's gotten much better!

28
00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:01.907
Oh? I bet so!

29
00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:05.907
Reserved

30
00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.947
What? Your stomach hurts?!
What a wet blanket!

31
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.817
Just go to the bathroom already!

32
00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:37.997
Strike three, you're out!

33
00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:40.697
When is one gonna make it to the stands?

34
00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:51.157
I'm gonna go watch the other people!

35
00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:52.487
Don't bother them, now.

36
00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:53.267
I won't!

37
00:03:57.587 --> 00:03:59.157
Sir. You can have mine.

38
00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:00.587
Oh, thanks.

39
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:02.587
What a brown-noser...

40
00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:06.047
Little boy. You should stay away,
it's dangerous here.

41
00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:09.017
This is far enough away, isn't it?

42
00:04:09.747 --> 00:04:10.767
Hey.

43
00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:15.187
Be sure to write off his driver
repair as a section expense!

44
00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:16.897
Yes, I know.

45
00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:32.327
See? I told you it was dangerous...

46
00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:34.577
No kidding...

47
00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.977
Nice shot!

48
00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:58.827
That one really flew!

49
00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:03.317
You have Sunday's farewell
contest in the bag!

50
00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:04.607
Yes!

51
00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:15.117
That guy's done already?

52
00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:18.997
He hit them at
a pretty quick pace...

53
00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:22.797
Plus he gave some of
his golf balls to his boss.

54
00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:26.337
What an obvious suck-up.

55
00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:38.597
Nice shot!

56
00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:41.957
Here's your driver.

57
00:05:58.077 --> 00:05:59.997
Damn you!

58
00:05:59.997 --> 00:06:01.417
C'mon!

59
00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.487
Another miss?

60
00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:05.267
Yep. Twenty in a row...

61
00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:24.357
What happened?!

62
00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:28.017
Sir!

63
00:06:28.017 --> 00:06:30.047
Stop! Don't touch him!

64
00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:34.237
He's dead...

65
00:06:34.657 --> 00:06:37.077
Ran! Call Inspector Megure!

66
00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:38.357
Right!

67
00:06:38.357 --> 00:06:40.537
What on earth happened?!

68
00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:43.497
It was most likely a bomb that exploded.

69
00:06:43.497 --> 00:06:44.597
A bomb?!

70
00:06:48.217 --> 00:06:51.797
This unique acrid smell...
Black powder!

71
00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:55.657
Chief!

72
00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:56.827
Call the police!

73
00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:59.827
No, there's a hospital
just down the street!

74
00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:01.847
Oh! You're injured, too!

75
00:07:02.197 --> 00:07:05.187
I'm fine! But we gotta
get him to the hospital!

76
00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:05.977
Understood!

77
00:07:15.407 --> 00:07:19.657
The deceased is Director
Tachibana of Itsui Electronics...

78
00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:21.117
And who are you?

79
00:07:21.117 --> 00:07:24.157
I'm Yasui, the section manager,

80
00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:26.697
and this is Okubo and Minami.

81
00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:31.587
We all work under Director Tachibana
in Product Development.

82
00:07:31.587 --> 00:07:34.007
Do you come here often?

83
00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:37.497
Yes, as it's close to the office.

84
00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.017
But today was the director's last day.

85
00:07:40.017 --> 00:07:41.187
His last day?

86
00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:46.767
He was going to be promoted
to head of the New York branch.

87
00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:52.617
Inspector. It appears it was
black powder that was used.

88
00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:55.367
And please come over here.

89
00:07:57.037 --> 00:08:00.157
This is a fragment of the driver head.

90
00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:04.287
And these are all ball fragments...

91
00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:06.207
...but look at this.

92
00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:08.207
What's this?

93
00:08:08.617 --> 00:08:10.497
It appears to be a fuse.

94
00:08:10.497 --> 00:08:11.417
In other words...

95
00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:15.327
...the bomb was inside the ball,

96
00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:20.517
and set to explode when he hit it.

97
00:08:20.517 --> 00:08:21.677
Precisely.

98
00:08:26.697 --> 00:08:31.037
Tell me, do all the golf balls
here have red lines on them?

99
00:08:31.037 --> 00:08:32.997
No, blue lines.

100
00:08:32.997 --> 00:08:33.817
Blue lines?

101
00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:37.277
There are some there.

102
00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:42.287
I see. They have single blue lines.

103
00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:48.087
Which means the red,
crossed lines mark the bomb ball.

104
00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:53.907
The question is, was this meant
specifically for Director Tachibana,

105
00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:56.547
or was it a random act of terrorism...

106
00:08:56.547 --> 00:08:59.967
I think it was meant for him specifically.

107
00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:02.427
Oh? Why is that?

108
00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:10.937
Because all three of us here
hated him enough to kill him.

109
00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:12.357
Come again?!

110
00:09:12.827 --> 00:09:14.657
W-What are you talking about, Minami?!

111
00:09:14.657 --> 00:09:16.327
That's true.

112
00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:19.407
We both had plenty of reason to kill him.

113
00:09:19.697 --> 00:09:25.117
He had already taken credit
for three of my product ideas,

114
00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:31.377
and he always ignored you, no matter
how many good ideas you had.

115
00:09:31.377 --> 00:09:34.697
N-Not me! I had no
problems with the director!

116
00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:37.327
Drop the act.

117
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:42.347
We all know he stole your
girlfriend a long time ago!

118
00:09:42.657 --> 00:09:47.157
N-No! She didn't get stolen!
She dumped me!

119
00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:52.277
That's it! I know who killed
Director Tachibana, Inspector!

120
00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:54.237
You do, Mori-kun?!

121
00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:57.617
Yes! First is the M.O...

122
00:09:57.617 --> 00:10:02.907
The killer mixed the bomb ball
with other balls in the machine,

123
00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:04.907
so that the victim would hit it!

124
00:10:06.247 --> 00:10:08.657
The question then is,

125
00:10:08.657 --> 00:10:14.087
who got the golf balls
for Director Tachibana?

126
00:10:14.087 --> 00:10:16.837
That was this Okubo person.

127
00:10:23.407 --> 00:10:26.947
Meanwhile, Minami-san
was in the restroom,

128
00:10:26.947 --> 00:10:29.867
and the Yasui guy
was at his own machine.

129
00:10:29.867 --> 00:10:32.057
So it was you!

130
00:10:32.287 --> 00:10:34.827
The kid's right, neither me nor Minami

131
00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:37.447
touched the director's basket!

132
00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:41.527
No one else could've put
the bomb ball in there but you!

133
00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:44.987
But that's not necessarily the case.

134
00:10:45.247 --> 00:10:47.327
There's no question that Minami-san

135
00:10:47.327 --> 00:10:50.747
was far away from the victim.

136
00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:53.947
But not you, Yasui-san.

137
00:10:53.947 --> 00:10:58.167
I hear you shared some of
your golf balls with the victim.

138
00:11:00.907 --> 00:11:02.507
T-That was...

139
00:11:02.507 --> 00:11:03.497
In other words,

140
00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:08.057
you could have put
the bomb ball in there.

141
00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:13.327
W-Wait!
If I did put it in there,

142
00:11:13.327 --> 00:11:18.437
I could've died in the explosion too!

143
00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:20.907
The machines use a queue system;

144
00:11:21.157 --> 00:11:25.237
the last balls in
are the last ones out.

145
00:11:25.907 --> 00:11:30.707
And you finished hitting
before Tachibana-san.

146
00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:34.657
Could that've been so you would finish

147
00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:37.087
before he hit the bomb ball?

148
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:41.157
No! I just have a
habit of hitting quickly!

149
00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:44.047
Isn't that right, Okubo?! Minami?!

150
00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.827
Then one other thing...

151
00:11:47.827 --> 00:11:51.247
Where were you during the explosion?

152
00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:55.077
At this point, Okubo-san
can also be removed as a suspect.

153
00:11:55.077 --> 00:12:02.357
The reason being that he was
caught in the blast, as was Minami-san.

154
00:12:02.697 --> 00:12:06.697
But I believe you were by the entrance.

155
00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.657
T-That was...

156
00:12:09.327 --> 00:12:17.407
Was it because you saw the
red-lined ball come up and took cover?

157
00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:20.627
No! I went to order coffee!

158
00:12:20.997 --> 00:12:22.427
Coffee?

159
00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:28.997
Yes! The director liked to
drink coffee after he finished hitting!

160
00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:35.897
So I always went and ordered
it ten minutes before he finished!

161
00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:37.827
He's telling the truth.

162
00:12:37.827 --> 00:12:40.497
We brew our coffee from beans,

163
00:12:40.497 --> 00:12:43.317
so he always asks ahead of time.

164
00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:55.577
But it seems a bit too convenient
that you were gone when it blew up.

165
00:12:55.827 --> 00:12:57.157
In other words,

166
00:12:57.157 --> 00:12:59.287
you think Yasui-san did it?

167
00:12:59.287 --> 00:13:00.497
That's right!

168
00:13:00.497 --> 00:13:02.167
There's no question about it!

169
00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:03.827
You can't be serious!

170
00:13:03.827 --> 00:13:06.387
I'm not the killer! Honest!

171
00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:10.807
Yasui-san. Just to be sure,
may we check your things?

172
00:13:11.077 --> 00:13:13.767
Y-Yes, that's fine...

173
00:13:15.727 --> 00:13:19.827
The old man's logic so far
has been unusually consistent.

174
00:13:19.827 --> 00:13:22.687
But if Yasui-san
really was the killer...

175
00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:28.987
Inspector! I found this in his bag!

176
00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:30.527
This is--!

177
00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:32.747
T-That's impossible!

178
00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:34.947
This is immutable proof!

179
00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:40.537
You had a backup
ready in case of a dud!

180
00:13:40.537 --> 00:13:42.507
No! I didn't put that there!

181
00:13:42.507 --> 00:13:47.157
Boy, what an incredibly
simple case this was!

182
00:13:47.157 --> 00:13:50.327
For the great Mori Kogoro,

183
00:13:50.327 --> 00:13:53.647
it was truly a piece of cake!

184
00:13:55.577 --> 00:13:57.617
This is way too simple.

185
00:13:57.617 --> 00:14:02.107
Did Yasui-san not care if he got
caught for killing Director Tachibana?

186
00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:06.067
No... There's something we're overlooking!

187
00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:09.027
Something not even I noticed!

188
00:14:11.907 --> 00:14:14.617
Huh? There's a ball on the tee...

189
00:14:14.617 --> 00:14:18.327
Guess the old man missed it again!

190
00:14:18.997 --> 00:14:20.997
Wait! I'm pretty sure I--

191
00:14:25.117 --> 00:14:30.087
I just assumed the old man
hit the ball into a metal post.

192
00:14:30.867 --> 00:14:32.677
But he didn't...

193
00:14:33.287 --> 00:14:35.597
Then what was that sound?

194
00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:49.037
Smells like explosives.

195
00:14:49.037 --> 00:14:52.907
Which means this was
the ball Director Tachibana hit,

196
00:14:52.907 --> 00:14:58.247
and that metallic
sound was when it hit a post.

197
00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:02.117
Then what were
those bomb ball fragments?

198
00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:03.497
That's it!

199
00:15:03.497 --> 00:15:05.377
This is a trick the killer set!

200
00:15:05.377 --> 00:15:07.587
The real culprit is someone else!

201
00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:13.959
We can talk down at the station.

202
00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:15.369
Oh no! I have to hurry!

203
00:15:19.249 --> 00:15:20.999
Alright! The usual method!

204
00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:29.229
Inspector! Please believe me!

205
00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:31.849
I'm not the killer, honest!

206
00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:35.439
That's right, you're
not the killer, Yasui-san.

207
00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:38.189
Dad?!

208
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:43.809
Assuming the explosion happened
when the victim hit a bomb ball

209
00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:46.149
was a mistake from the very start!

210
00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:48.199
What are you saying, Mori-kun?!

211
00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:52.449
We found a ball fragment
with a fuse at the scene!

212
00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:57.209
Yes, we did. But Inspector,
take a look at this.

213
00:15:57.209 --> 00:16:01.559
I found that ball by a
metal post at the far end net.

214
00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:04.899
It's not much, but it
should smell of explosives.

215
00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.169
Yes, indeed.

216
00:16:06.729 --> 00:16:08.849
When the bomb went off,

217
00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:11.229
Tachibana-san had hit
not the red ball,

218
00:16:11.229 --> 00:16:15.639
but that one with a blue stripe.

219
00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:17.559
H-Hold on, now!

220
00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.519
I don't get what you're saying!

221
00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:25.519
The killer didn't place the bomb
ball in Tachibana-san's machine;

222
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:28.489
he planted it inside
the driver head beforehand!

223
00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:29.409
Eh?!

224
00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:34.059
This is where the killer was crafty.

225
00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:38.059
If there were fragments
left over after the explosion,

226
00:16:38.059 --> 00:16:46.259
everyone would simply
assume it was the ball that blew up.

227
00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:49.059
Yes! After the explosion,

228
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:51.019
the killer set down a
pre-prepared fragment

229
00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:52.599
when given the opportunity!

230
00:16:52.809 --> 00:16:55.519
B-But that would mean the killer...

231
00:16:56.059 --> 00:17:02.609
Yasui-san. I believe you mentioned
the director's driver repair fees?

232
00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:08.559
Yes. The shaft had a crack in it,
so I had Minami send it for repairs.

233
00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.329
Minami! You--!

234
00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:12.899
Minami-san.

235
00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:15.079
Where did you have the driver repaired?

236
00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:16.899
Oh, with us.

237
00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:19.289
We also do club repair here.

238
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.749
In what way did you repair it?

239
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:30.719
I felt it best to turn it
into a carbon shaft club.

240
00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:36.059
That club was given to the director
by the current CEO fifteen years ago.

241
00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:39.349
So the director
was very attached to it...

242
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:43.399
So it was an old-fashioned wood head?

243
00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:46.319
So, when did you return
the repaired club to Minami-san?

244
00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:49.029
I returned it to him two nights ago.

245
00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:51.559
Two nights ago?!

246
00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:54.489
But you gave it to
the director this morning!

247
00:17:54.939 --> 00:18:01.959
Meaning the driver was in your
possession for an entire day and night.

248
00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:08.149
Let us look back at your actions today.

249
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:09.879
Immediately after arriving here...

250
00:18:10.229 --> 00:18:13.559
What? Your stomach hurts?!
What a wet blanket!

251
00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.379
Just go to the bathroom already!

252
00:18:17.439 --> 00:18:23.309
That was just one
of the steps of his plan.

253
00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:28.849
Did you perhaps usually have
Minami-san get your golf balls

254
00:18:28.849 --> 00:18:34.199
and have him put ten or so in
Director Tachibana's own machine?

255
00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:35.909
T-That's right...

256
00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:41.649
This time, he purposely said his
stomach hurt and fled to the restroom

257
00:18:41.649 --> 00:18:43.539
to pass that role onto you.

258
00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:50.059
Moreover, he planned to narrow
down the suspects to just you,

259
00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:54.099
by having you be away from
the scene the instant of the explosion.

260
00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:59.229
He managed this by giving him the driver

261
00:18:59.229 --> 00:19:04.939
just as you left for coffee.

262
00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:07.849
On top of that,

263
00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:11.359
to completely clear
himself of suspicion,

264
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:17.869
he stood nearby so that he
would get caught in the explosion.

265
00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:19.229
Inspector.

266
00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:22.369
Think about where Minami-san was injured.

267
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:26.189
Okubo-san received injuries
to almost his entire body,

268
00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:30.729
yet he only received injuries
outside his left elbow and leg.

269
00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:32.779
Why his left side?

270
00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:35.549
Why outside, and not inside?

271
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.899
It's because moments
before the explosion,

272
00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:40.559
he quickly covered his eyes

273
00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:42.689
with his left arm
and hid behind a pillar.

274
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:49.729
Minami-san.

275
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:55.229
Today was the last chance
you had to kill Director Tachibana,

276
00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:57.809
as he was about
to move to New York.

277
00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:05.399
But wasn't using the driver only
you could've had in the last two days

278
00:20:05.399 --> 00:20:08.619
as the murder weapon
a bit careless on your part?

279
00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:13.899
I've always hated the director.

280
00:20:13.899 --> 00:20:17.149
The director who would
never acknowledge my skill,

281
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:20.599
and Manager Yasui, who never
did anything but suck up to him...

282
00:20:22.309 --> 00:20:27.269
So I plotted to kill the director
and have him take the fall.

283
00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:32.979
And you didn't care if anyone
else died in the explosion?!

284
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.989
Had this golf range been crowded,
even more people would've--

285
00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:39.949
I don't give a damn about that.

286
00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:46.599
Alright, let's go.

287
00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:56.529
Do you think he really meant that?

288
00:20:56.529 --> 00:20:57.469
Conan-kun!

289
00:20:57.899 --> 00:20:59.429
After all, he...

290
00:21:00.309 --> 00:21:02.889
Little boy. You should stay away,
it's dangerous here.

291
00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:07.349
I think he said that so I wouldn't
get caught in the explosion!

292
00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:08.809
Yeah.

293
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:15.809
Who knows, he might've actually
been a nice person who lost his way.

294
00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:19.769
Conan-kun!

295
00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:22.109
W-We're late for school!

296
00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:55.579
1st Annual Nichiuri TV Pro-Amateur
Charity Golf Tournament

297
00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:04.219
Yoko-chan! Nice shot!

298
00:23:05.649 --> 00:23:06.679
The following Sunday,

299
00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:09.439
the old man entered
the golf tournament

300
00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:13.559
on the condition that
he be on Okino Yoko's team.

301
00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:17.189
Yoko-chan was a bit unsteady,
but it was a nice shot!

302
00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:20.019
Next up is the famous detective,
Mori Kogoro-san!

303
00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:22.989
Mori-san! You can do it!

304
00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:25.949
Leave it to me!

305
00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.579
Is Dad gonna be alright?

306
00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:29.909
Of course not.

307
00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:36.959
Yikes...

308
00:23:39.309 --> 00:23:41.359
Gimme a break!
