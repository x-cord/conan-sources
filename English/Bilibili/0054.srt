1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.520
As long as modern-day
crimes involve people,

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.630
there are no
unsolvable mysteries!

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.170
The stage today
is a first-class hotel!

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.760
I found the mysterious organization!

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.520
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.140
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.159
The Game Company Murder Case.

9
00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.119
Your dad supervised a game?
Baker Hotel

10
00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:44.319
That's right!

11
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.329
It's titled, "Detective Kogoro
Mori's House of Reasoning!"

12
00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.989
The player encounters a dead
body in a mysterious mansion,

13
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.489
and gets hints from Detective Mori
who just happens to be there

14
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.169
to solve the case!

15
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.089
That's practically the pattern
with me every time...

16
00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.669
But is it okay for
their guest to be like that?

17
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.159
This is what you get for
drinking so much last night

18
00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.109
for your "pre-celebration"!

19
00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.809
I only had five or six drinks...

20
00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.279
Gin, vodka, bourbon...

21
00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.239
Gin and Vodka...

22
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.809
Those are the codenames
for the men in black

23
00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.159
who shrunk me!

24
00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.199
What long lines!

25
00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.659
Of course they are!

26
00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.919
Almost everyone in
the gaming industry is here!

27
00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.589
Mori-san!

28
00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.449
It's me! Nakajima from Mantendo!

29
00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.799
I planned "Detective Kogoro
Mori's House of Reasoning!"

30
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.969
Thanks to you, we've
produced an amazing game!

31
00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.949
You definitely excel
at your work, Nakajima.

32
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.519
Assuming you
really did plan that game.

33
00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:56.269
Ueda!

34
00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
I shouldn't have told you
that the game would do well

35
00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.739
if we used Detective Mori.

36
00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.159
Three days later, your proposal
just happened to highlight that idea,

37
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.489
and voila, here you are.

38
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.739
You're a genius at
stealing people's things!

39
00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.369
Work, women...

40
00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.119
Isn't that right, Takeshita?

41
00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.159
Yeah...

42
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.009
But that was back
in college. It's in the past.

43
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.819
Well, I'll overlook it this time.

44
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.429
After all, you seem to be in trouble
with the debt-collectors and all.

45
00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.199
Here's the number
tag for your luggage!

46
00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.439
96.

47
00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.139
Hey, we're really late!

48
00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.239
What?!

49
00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.189
We need to hurry to the
show floor and get things ready!

50
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.849
Check this in first!

51
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.069
Mine too!

52
00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.319
Hey, don't cut in line!

53
00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.529
You should hurry too, you know!

54
00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.949
The president will
yell at you if you're late!

55
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.289
You have a point...

56
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.779
Please try not to mix ours up.

57
00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:59.159
All three of you
have the same briefcase!

58
00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.989
Yes. And it's not just
our briefcases--

59
00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.069
...our necktie pins
and wristwatches too.

60
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.069
It's was the company president's idea

61
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.469
to give ordinary people an
impression of our company.

62
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.159
But in actuality, the briefcases
are way too big and heavy.

63
00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.819
We brought them today,

64
00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.399
but almost everyone in the
company has left them here.

65
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.469
The president's probably the
only guy lugging one around!

66
00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.739
Well, excuse me.

67
00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:25.989
Sir!

68
00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:28.069
Get to your posts!

69
00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.949
Yes! Right away!

70
00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.499
Despicable...

71
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:35.609
Here's your number tag!

72
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.159
Thanks!

73
00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.779
How lucky!

74
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.159
Look, Conan-kun!
Our tag number is 100 exactly!

75
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.379
Maybe today's our lucky day!

76
00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:47.339
She's easily excited...

77
00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.889
Ahh! Stop!

78
00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.689
How do you like this?!

79
00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.819
I did it! I came from behind to win!

80
00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.319
Great job, Ran-chan!

81
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.779
Very few people
can pull that move off!

82
00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.239
Eh? Really?!

83
00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:11.199
She might be lucky, after all...

84
00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:17.369
So close! It really lights up
if you get over 250...

85
00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:19.739
Hey, Nakajima!

86
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.699
Will you come give this a try?

87
00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:22.609
Sure.

88
00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.669
It looks like Nakajima-san's going to try!

89
00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:36.109
Wow! Have you
ever practiced anything?

90
00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:38.349
A little boxing
during my college days.

91
00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:41.159
Why don't you give it a shot, Ran-san?

92
00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.859
No, that's okay...

93
00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:44.819
It's a good stress-reliever!

94
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.339
Stress?

95
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.529
Get back here now, Shinichi!

96
00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.669
Want to try, Conan-kun?

97
00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.819
I need to use the bathroom!

98
00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.499
Then let's go together, little boy.

99
00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.069
I believe the restrooms are--

100
00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.219
He's huge!

101
00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.489
Does he work at
the game company too?

102
00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:19.179
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

103
00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.319
All three of you were in the
same boxing club during college?

104
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:24.949
Yeah.

105
00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.489
Until he quit
halfway through, anyway.

106
00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:29.239
Ueda...

107
00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.949
But to think we would all
wind up in the same company...

108
00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:37.029
Number 98.

109
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.159
That's the logo for
Nakajima-san's company.

110
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.739
Thank you!

111
00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:47.069
But that's strange.

112
00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.199
He should have the company's
necktie pin if he's an employee...

113
00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.809
Anyway, I should buy the old man

114
00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:00.859
some tomato
juice for his hangover...

115
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.769
It's me, Tequila.

116
00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:07.819
The deal's done.

117
00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.189
Don't worry, Vodka.

118
00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.859
Pass the word on to Gin.

119
00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:18.539
This guy's one of the men in black!

120
00:07:19.359 --> 00:07:22.249
Just a kid. He dropped some change.

121
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.119
I finally found you!

122
00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.319
Hey, Mister! Could you move your leg?

123
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.669
I can't get my 10-yen coin...

124
00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.809
Don't touch me, boy!

125
00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:37.779
Alright!

126
00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.179
I stuck a hidden microphone
and transmitter onto his shoe sole!

127
00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:42.849
He'll lead me to the others!

128
00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:47.649
To Gin and Vodka!

129
00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.429
Huh? It won't open...

130
00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:51.429
A door?

131
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.609
Is this empty?

132
00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:55.409
A restroom stall?

133
00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:04.499
Wait! Little boy!

134
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.029
That big man
was wearing this shoe!

135
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:12.879
He was in the explosion!

136
00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.029
Little boy! It's dangerous here!

137
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.969
Hurry outside!

138
00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:20.819
I had finally found
a clue leading to them!

139
00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:22.359
Why did this have to happen?!

140
00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:24.349
A terrorist attack?

141
00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:28.159
My guess is that the
explosives were attached

142
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:29.809
to the toilet or something else.

143
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.659
A random murder...

144
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.199
There was one victim.

145
00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:36.069
Any idea who it was?

146
00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:37.779
All that's left are shreds...

147
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:42.199
Did any of you see
anybody suspicious?

148
00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:43.719
No...

149
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:45.159
Not really...

150
00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:47.249
I did!

151
00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:49.459
I saw the guy who died!

152
00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.499
You did, Conan-kun?!

153
00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.489
He was a really big man!

154
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:55.669
He might have been
from western Japan...

155
00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:59.159
You saw him too, Nakajima-san!

156
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:02.259
The big man in black clothes
we bumped into in the lobby!

157
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:05.229
Oh, him...

158
00:09:05.489 --> 00:09:07.359
How do you know he
was from western Japan?

159
00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:11.519
I heard his accent in the
bathroom right before he died:

160
00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:15.949
"Huh? It won't open. Is this empty?"

161
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:18.489
He must've been
talking about a restroom stall!

162
00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:24.119
In that case, the explosives must
have been set near the stall door.

163
00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:26.499
Excuse me...

164
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.069
Company president!

165
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.619
President?

166
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:32.819
Yes. I'm Mantendo's president, Ishikawa.

167
00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:37.469
I actually received a
strange letter three days ago.

168
00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:39.819
A strange letter...

169
00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:42.759
"Cancel the show or else."
This is a threat letter!

170
00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.989
Why didn't you contact the
police the minute you received this?!

171
00:09:46.989 --> 00:09:50.939
I apologize. I thought it was
an ordinary harassment letter.

172
00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:54.569
Inspector. We found this in the debris.

173
00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:58.859
The key makes sense,
but what's this round thing?

174
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:01.659
That's my company's emblem.

175
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:06.159
Come to think of it, that big
man had one of those briefcases.

176
00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:09.779
But why did he have it?

177
00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:11.619
He took it from the
baggage counter, but...

178
00:10:11.989 --> 00:10:16.089
What tremendous power!
It bent this piece of iron!

179
00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:17.779
What?!

180
00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:19.609
There's something strange
about that emblem!

181
00:10:19.609 --> 00:10:22.319
Why is it bent away
from the briefcase?!

182
00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.659
If the explosion happened
outside the case,

183
00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:26.259
it should be bent inward!

184
00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:29.529
This was no terrorist attack!
It was a murder!

185
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.639
Somebody wanted that man dead!

186
00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:35.519
Yes. The bomber is the
one who gave him the briefcase!

187
00:10:36.109 --> 00:10:38.569
The deal probably took place there--

188
00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:41.359
--the best place to make an
exchange without arousing suspicion

189
00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:43.159
by switching number tags!

190
00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.069
The baggage counter!

191
00:10:45.489 --> 00:10:51.159
No, nobody else has claimed
their things except for that large man...

192
00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:55.779
Which means that the other person
hasn't come to claim the other bag!

193
00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:56.289
Great!

194
00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:02.669
There still might be clues
leading to Gin and Vodka!

195
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:05.779
Where do you think you're going?

196
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:07.559
I need to see the Inspector!

197
00:11:07.869 --> 00:11:10.179
No way. He's busy right now.

198
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:12.979
Let me go before
the bomber gets away!

199
00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:14.599
If that happens, then their--

200
00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:16.989
Ran...

201
00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:19.659
Where were you?!

202
00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.319
You're hurt...

203
00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:22.989
What on earth happened?

204
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.359
100 and 96...

205
00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:31.699
Those are the number tags for
our things at the baggage counter.

206
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:34.999
100 is mine, and 96 is Dad's.

207
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:38.589
He's still not doing well,
so I'm holding his for him.

208
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.559
If I remember right,
that man's tag number was--

209
00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:46.469
Number 98.

210
00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:49.109
Which means the
other person in the deal

211
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:51.449
cut in between
the old man and Ran!

212
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:52.979
It was those three!

213
00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:57.439
That big man exchanged tags,
and completed the deal.

214
00:11:57.439 --> 00:12:01.609
And then the instant he opened
the briefcase to check its contents...

215
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:04.949
Wait.

216
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:07.489
If the goal was to
kill him from the very start,

217
00:12:07.489 --> 00:12:11.079
why did they choose
this place to make the deal?

218
00:12:11.659 --> 00:12:14.319
If an incident happens
at your own trade show,

219
00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:17.279
you could make yourself
suspect if you're not careful.

220
00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:21.089
Yet they knew for a fact that
he would check the briefcase...

221
00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:25.299
And the fact that the key doesn't
match the briefcase bothers me.

222
00:12:26.489 --> 00:12:30.259
Wait! Could I have
made a really big mistake!

223
00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:32.659
Number 38.

224
00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.779
Number 56.

225
00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:39.659
Looks like nobody
knew who that large man was...

226
00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:43.439
Nope. And nobody saw
anybody suspicious, either.

227
00:12:44.109 --> 00:12:46.779
Number 99, right?

228
00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:47.409
Yes!

229
00:12:47.859 --> 00:12:49.979
Number 97.

230
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:50.779
Here.

231
00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:53.409
Number 124.

232
00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:54.739
Here.

233
00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:56.949
What?

234
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:58.749
No, nothing.

235
00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:02.159
Hey, you guys should
check your briefcases.

236
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.419
They all look the same, after all.

237
00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:06.409
No, that's alright.

238
00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:08.129
There's nothing
important inside, anyway.

239
00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:14.929
Wait a minute! Could this be...
Now I see! So that's how it was!

240
00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:19.069
In the eyes of the killer,
this was an unexpected murder!

241
00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:26.167
Alright, folks.

242
00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:29.007
You can go home for today,

243
00:13:29.007 --> 00:13:30.467
but if anyone recalls seeing someone

244
00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:33.047
who might have been the bomber,

245
00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:35.597
please contact me at
the police headquarters!

246
00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:36.797
This is bad!

247
00:13:36.797 --> 00:13:40.647
If they let everyone leave now,
we'll never know who did it!

248
00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:42.837
Darn it!

249
00:13:42.837 --> 00:13:45.177
I have an idea who
the bomber might be,

250
00:13:45.177 --> 00:13:46.967
but I'm still not sure!

251
00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:47.967
I have no choice.

252
00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:49.607
I'll have to use the
old man's voice and body

253
00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:51.567
to lay a trap!

254
00:13:53.757 --> 00:13:54.907
It hit Ran in the butt!

255
00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.637
Are you alright, Dad?

256
00:13:57.637 --> 00:14:01.877
Hey. Do you still got my number tag?

257
00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:05.207
Why isn't Ran getting sleepy?

258
00:14:05.797 --> 00:14:08.887
Don't worry,
I have it here in my pocket.

259
00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:11.467
Oh, it hit the tag...

260
00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:14.427
But I only have one sleeping dart!

261
00:14:14.757 --> 00:14:16.987
Let's get our stuff
and go home already...

262
00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:18.637
Alright.

263
00:14:20.307 --> 00:14:21.147
Pervert!

264
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:25.797
Don't tell me that was you...

265
00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:29.637
It was lint! There was some
lint on your bottom, so--

266
00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:32.777
You really should put
your leg down now...

267
00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:34.987
Dad!

268
00:14:36.177 --> 00:14:37.837
Are you alright?!

269
00:14:37.837 --> 00:14:39.247
I'm fine, Ran.

270
00:14:39.677 --> 00:14:41.677
You just helped
me realize something.

271
00:14:41.677 --> 00:14:42.917
Realize something?

272
00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:45.507
Inspector Megure.

273
00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:48.627
You can't let the
people leave just yet.

274
00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.547
You can't be serious!

275
00:14:50.547 --> 00:14:52.797
We're dealing with a random bomber!

276
00:14:52.797 --> 00:14:55.347
There could be more bombs!

277
00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:57.547
A random bomber?

278
00:14:57.547 --> 00:15:01.807
There were never any
bombs planted in this hotel.

279
00:15:01.807 --> 00:15:05.297
That bomb was planted
in that man's belongings

280
00:15:05.297 --> 00:15:07.727
in order to specifically kill him.

281
00:15:08.137 --> 00:15:10.467
Do you wish to let them go,

282
00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:14.257
even though the
bomber is among them?

283
00:15:14.257 --> 00:15:16.947
What? You know who did it?!

284
00:15:17.587 --> 00:15:21.467
If we check the
contents of something,

285
00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:24.377
the person responsible
will admit to doing it.

286
00:15:24.717 --> 00:15:26.047
The contents of what?

287
00:15:26.047 --> 00:15:27.167
That would be--

288
00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:28.677
Nakajima-san.

289
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:34.387
The contents of that briefcase
you've been holding so importantly!

290
00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:37.257
Let us see what's inside.

291
00:15:37.257 --> 00:15:38.597
No, you can't!

292
00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:41.837
You idiot! Do you want
to look like the murderer?!

293
00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:42.667
Show them!

294
00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:43.437
Let go!

295
00:15:43.927 --> 00:15:44.847
Stop!

296
00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:48.647
Takeshita!

297
00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:54.217
Now there's no doubt about it.

298
00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:57.237
Takeshita-san. You're the bomber.

299
00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.697
How so, Mori-kun?!

300
00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:04.927
Because he thought the bomb
he put in the briefcase would explode.

301
00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:06.667
A bomb inside the briefcase?!

302
00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:08.137
Indeed.

303
00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:11.467
The briefcase emblem found
at the scene of the explosion

304
00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:14.637
was bent away from the case.

305
00:16:14.637 --> 00:16:18.677
In other words, it received
a shock from the inside.

306
00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:21.887
Meaning that the bomb
was inside the briefcase.

307
00:16:22.427 --> 00:16:25.677
Wait. Then when he said,

308
00:16:25.677 --> 00:16:29.937
"Huh? It won't open.
Is this empty?" he meant--

309
00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:31.967
That's right.

310
00:16:31.967 --> 00:16:34.637
The key wouldn't open the briefcase.

311
00:16:34.637 --> 00:16:37.157
And it was the briefcase's
cover that was empty.

312
00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:41.237
So he gave that briefcase
bomb to that large man?

313
00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:43.467
No.

314
00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:47.427
The person the victim was making a
deal with gave him the briefcase...

315
00:16:47.427 --> 00:16:49.167
...you, Nakajima-san!

316
00:16:51.337 --> 00:16:55.587
The deal was done by having everyone
temporarily check their bags in

317
00:16:55.587 --> 00:16:58.967
and then exchanging
number tags afterward.

318
00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:00.257
As proof of this,

319
00:17:00.257 --> 00:17:03.637
I got ♪96 and my
daughter Ran got ♪100.

320
00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:07.637
But Ueda-san, Nakajima-san,
and Takeshita-san

321
00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:09.467
cut in between us.

322
00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:16.237
Naturally, their tag numbers
would have been 97, 98, and 99.

323
00:17:16.237 --> 00:17:17.297
But for some reason,

324
00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:19.247
when Nakajima-san went
to claim his briefcase,

325
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.637
his tag was--

326
00:17:20.637 --> 00:17:22.697
Number 124.

327
00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:26.257
And then the tag of the large
man Conan overheard was--

328
00:17:26.257 --> 00:17:28.167
Number 98.

329
00:17:28.677 --> 00:17:30.967
The tags were probably exchanged

330
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:34.627
when Nakajima-san and
Conan bumped into the man.

331
00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:38.137
The man then took Nakajima-san's
briefcase from the baggage counter.

332
00:17:38.137 --> 00:17:40.677
The instant he checked the
contents while inside the restroom--

333
00:17:43.137 --> 00:17:46.557
But why didn't the key fit?

334
00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:48.757
Of course it wouldn't fit.

335
00:17:48.757 --> 00:17:53.967
Takeshita-san had switched
that briefcase in advance.

336
00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:55.257
Yes.

337
00:17:55.257 --> 00:17:59.297
Because Takeshita-san had
meant for that briefcase bomb

338
00:17:59.297 --> 00:18:00.657
to kill Nakajima-san!

339
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:02.067
What?!

340
00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:05.047
Your number tags were probably switched

341
00:18:05.047 --> 00:18:09.467
when you had Nakajima-san
play that punching game.

342
00:18:09.467 --> 00:18:14.137
But when Takeshita-san
checked the briefcase bomb in,

343
00:18:14.137 --> 00:18:16.887
a dangerous problem arose.

344
00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.797
My baggage tag number was 96.

345
00:18:19.797 --> 00:18:21.297
Nakajima-san was close behind me,

346
00:18:21.297 --> 00:18:24.047
so it was certain that
he would be in the 90's too.

347
00:18:24.047 --> 00:18:28.047
But Takeshita-san
hadn't gotten in line yet,

348
00:18:28.047 --> 00:18:30.007
so he would be in the 100's.

349
00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:33.297
There was a good chance
Nakajima-san might notice later

350
00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:35.227
if he switched their two numbers.

351
00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:39.607
That's why Takeshita-san
cut in between me and Ran...

352
00:18:40.007 --> 00:18:43.587
To ensure his tag number
would be in the 90's,

353
00:18:43.587 --> 00:18:45.327
the same as Nakajima-san's!

354
00:18:45.677 --> 00:18:47.967
But is there any proof?

355
00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:49.177
Yes...

356
00:18:49.177 --> 00:18:51.427
The briefcase Takeshita-san has right now

357
00:18:51.427 --> 00:18:55.037
is the one Nakajima-san was
supposed to give the large man.

358
00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:58.587
The key found at
the scene of the explosion

359
00:18:58.587 --> 00:19:01.007
should fit it perfectly.

360
00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:06.297
And it was a Mantendo
original briefcase that exploded.

361
00:19:06.297 --> 00:19:09.467
It should be obvious once
you inspect all the briefcases

362
00:19:09.467 --> 00:19:11.927
belonging to Mantendo
employees here today

363
00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:15.017
that Takeshita-san's
is the only one missing.

364
00:19:15.797 --> 00:19:20.987
Because his briefcase
was blown to pieces.

365
00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:28.297
To think that explosion
was from a bomb I set...

366
00:19:28.297 --> 00:19:29.967
I even wrote a threatening letter

367
00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:32.047
to make it look
like an act of terrorism.

368
00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:33.467
Boy, is my face red!

369
00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:34.667
Takeshita!

370
00:19:35.137 --> 00:19:39.047
That's right!
You were supposed to die!

371
00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:41.297
You murdered Yoshimi!

372
00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:43.427
Yoshimi?

373
00:19:43.427 --> 00:19:48.257
The manager of our boxing
team during our college days.

374
00:19:48.257 --> 00:19:50.717
She committed suicide
after Nakajima dumped her.

375
00:19:50.717 --> 00:19:51.517
Suicide?

376
00:19:51.967 --> 00:19:54.087
Yoshimi had been very
close friends with Takeshita

377
00:19:54.087 --> 00:19:56.087
ever since middle school.

378
00:19:56.087 --> 00:19:57.317
So he must have been--

379
00:19:57.317 --> 00:20:00.397
Let me go! I'm innocent! He did it!

380
00:20:00.757 --> 00:20:04.697
You narrowly avoided being
murdered, Nakajima-san.

381
00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.617
But what do you say we
move on to the real issue here?

382
00:20:09.637 --> 00:20:13.427
The man in black you
were making a deal with...

383
00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:16.077
Who exactly was he?!

384
00:20:16.387 --> 00:20:17.787
Um...

385
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.677
You've ruined the deal--

386
00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:23.217
their organization is going to
come after you, no matter what.

387
00:20:23.217 --> 00:20:24.297
Organization?!

388
00:20:24.297 --> 00:20:28.097
I think your wisest choice
would be to tell us everything

389
00:20:28.097 --> 00:20:30.637
and seek police shelter...

390
00:20:30.637 --> 00:20:32.887
I really don't know anything!

391
00:20:33.467 --> 00:20:37.177
Just that the place I met
them at was always the same.

392
00:20:37.177 --> 00:20:41.647
A bar named "Cocktail," on the
top floor of the Daikoku Building...

393
00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:43.737
"Cocktail," at the Daikoku Building!

394
00:20:44.677 --> 00:20:47.797
Hey, Mori-kun! What organization
are you talking about?!

395
00:20:47.797 --> 00:20:48.557
Hey!

396
00:20:51.987 --> 00:20:56.587
Daikoku Building

397
00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.167
So this is the place!

398
00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:07.587
I made it!

399
00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.847
I finally found them!

400
00:21:10.897 --> 00:21:12.347
I finally made it here!

401
00:21:20.297 --> 00:21:21.107
What?!

402
00:21:23.887 --> 00:21:25.177
What?!

403
00:21:25.177 --> 00:21:26.067
Damn it!

404
00:21:27.587 --> 00:21:29.487
Stay out of there, little boy!

405
00:21:29.487 --> 00:21:31.947
Let go! I'm not a little boy!

406
00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:33.087
I'm... I'm...

407
00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:34.297
Let go!

408
00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:04.257
According to police
investigation afterward,

409
00:23:04.257 --> 00:23:06.337
the amount of explosives
used was incredible,

410
00:23:06.337 --> 00:23:08.797
and the bar was
completely obliterated.

411
00:23:08.797 --> 00:23:11.927
There was no way to tell
if anybody had been inside.

412
00:23:13.587 --> 00:23:15.097
All that I found out this time

413
00:23:15.097 --> 00:23:17.887
was that the men in black
were attempting to purchase

414
00:23:17.887 --> 00:23:21.257
a list of the world's top
programmers

415
00:23:21.257 --> 00:23:24.477
that Nakajima-san had
smuggled out of the company.

416
00:23:27.137 --> 00:23:29.137
Are Gin and Vodka dead?

417
00:23:29.137 --> 00:23:31.857
Or did they disappear on their own?

418
00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.507
Everything remains a mystery.

419
00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:36.717
Just as the black
smoke covers the sky...

420
00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:39.007
...so too is the case
buried in darkness.

421
00:23:48.537 --> 00:23:51.287
Hey, Mister!
Your button's about to fall off!

422
00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.837
This was neither
an accident nor a suicide!

423
00:23:54.837 --> 00:23:57.997
It was a homicide! A murder!

424
00:23:57.997 --> 00:23:58.627
Why, you...

425
00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:01.177
You're in the way! Go outside!

426
00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:07.667
That's it! Now I understand
Dr. Date's train trick!

427
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:10.127
On the next Conan--

428
00:24:10.127 --> 00:24:12.487

Next Conan's Hint:
Snack Cart Sales.

431
00:24:16.771 --> 00:24:19.188
