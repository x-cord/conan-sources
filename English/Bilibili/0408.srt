1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,740
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,340
Today's story is the finale of the magic case.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,740
Solve the miraculous trick with Conan and Heiji!

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:59,225
Due to popular magician Dogo Hoshikawa's show,

9
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:03,925
we got invited to the legendary magician, Mr. Masakage's house.

10
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:07,925
It has been exactly 10 years since the day,

11
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:10,925
Mr. Masakage suddenly disappeared.

12
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:14,225
The pupils magicians have gotten together there

13
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:18,725
and Tenko Himemiya among them

14
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:22,025
was discovered dead in the hallway on the 2nd floor!

15
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,225
More than 30 minutes have passed since she died.

16
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,625
Did you find her yourselves?

17
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,125
No, Hoshikwa was also here with us.

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,825
What the heck is this?

19
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,925
Tell me, what is this room?

20
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:39,525
Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

21
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,525
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

22
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,125
I found it!

23
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,825
So, this is the Christmas tree magic, huh?

24
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,525
What's more, the tree is where

25
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,525
Ms. Tenko's body was found at the end of the hallway.

26
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,425
She must be hiding something.

27
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,525
Oh!

28
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:59,125
Look at this, Kudo. This picture.

29
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,825
The pictures of the 3 pupils when they were young.

30
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,125
This might be...

31
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,025
That's right, the shadow!

32
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:09,425
That's right, the shadow of the vase is wrong!

33
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,425
The shadow of the vase?

34
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,025
The moonlight was shining on the vase from behind,

35
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:16,425
so we couldn't see the patterns on it.

36
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:21,125
But after the blackout, when we found Tenko's dead body,

37
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,225
the moonlight was shining on the vase from the side,

38
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,525
so we could see the patterns!

39
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:29,725
There's no way the moon moves that fast!

40
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,525
The shadow of the vase.

41
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:39,525
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Solution)"

42
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,925
The moonlight.

43
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,825
-The vase. -What's happening?

44
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:46,625
That's not possible, that doesn't.

45
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,525
First the moon was covered by clouds,

46
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:53,225
so it was dark and the design of the vase couldn't be seen.

47
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,925
The cloud disappeared during the blackout

48
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,825
and so the design could now be seen?

49
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,225
If you say so.

50
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,725
It may be so.

51
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,425
And then?

52
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:08,325
Didn't you hear the culprit run away or voices during the blackout?

53
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,625
It may have been so,

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,325
but the lights suddenly turned off and we were screaming so...

55
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:18,725
Mr. Hoshikawa was telling us in a soothing voice to calm down.

56
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,125
Soothing voice?

57
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,325
It's all right!

58
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,225
He repeated, "I'm with you so it's all right".

59
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:28,425
He really seemed so reliable!

60
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:32,625
Well... good for you.

61
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,325
Come on!

62
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:38,325
Then just in case,

63
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,625
Mr. Handa is said to have been taking a nap during the blackout,

64
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,925
please lead us to your room.

65
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,325
Sure.

66
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,125
Kazuha, you stay with that lady there!

67
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,825
What? Why?

68
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,325
You annoy me when you're around.

69
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,025
What's that supposed to mean?

70
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,925
Maybe it's because...

71
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,725
Maybe he's burning with jealousy?

72
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,225
Burning?

73
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:13,425
Heiji's not red because of the sunburn.

74
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:16,425
I don't mean that.

75
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,925
So, this is the room Mr. Handa used

76
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:25,625
when you were still Mr. Masakage's pupils.

77
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,825
That's right.

78
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,725
The bed that was used then

79
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:34,025
was disposed of when Mr. Handa left 10 years ago.

80
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:38,625
And? Where were you and Mr. Handa when there was a blackout?

81
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,625
When I opened the door, he was lying down on the sofa,

82
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:46,425
and was standing still for about one minute of the blackout.

83
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:51,525
I told her it wouldn't be a good idea to move around in the dark.

84
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,025
Then who reset the breaker?

85
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,225
I did.

86
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:59,925
Me and this kid was right by the breaker when it was thrown.

87
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:08,425
This room definitely is right under the data storage room.

88
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:11,425
It's impossible to climb out from that small window.

89
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,225
Thought there might be some tricks to the house

90
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,625
since a magician built it.

91
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,025
There seems to be no elevators to carry

92
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,625
Ms. Tenko's body to the 2nd floor.

93
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,525
If you and Mr. Handa was in this room during the blackout,

94
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,925
it would be impossible to commit the crime.

95
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:33,025
When Ms. Tenko's body was found, Mr. Hoshikawa who was the closest

96
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,425
was being clung onto by Kazuha

97
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,825
couldn't have put the body there.

98
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:43,525
Then the crime must have been committed by someone from outside.

99
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,525
Inspector Megure!

100
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:45,725
Huh?

101
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,325
What is it?

102
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,625
When I investigated the shrubbery,

103
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,725
I found some broken branches and footprints all around

104
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,625
that seemed to have been smoothed out.

105
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,425
That shrubbery is right under Mr. Masakage's room.

106
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:02,325
Hattori! Just like you said.

107
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,325
The culprit was hiding in the storage room,

108
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,425
threw the breaker and left the body

109
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,625
and went into Mr. Masakage's room,

110
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,725
leaped from the window and used the shrubbery as cushion.

111
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,425
He seems to have escaped from the backdoor.

112
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:15,425
Okay!

113
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:19,625
Ask around the neighborhood if anyone has seen a suspicious figure.

114
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,825
Yes, sir!

115
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:23,425
If it's an outsider...

116
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,525
The rest should be left in the hands of the police.

117
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,725
-Our role... -is finished.

118
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,825
I see.

119
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:46,825
So, that's it.

120
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,725
What?

121
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,225
Do you know who did it?

122
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,325
That's right.

123
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:58,325
The culprit who beat Ms. Tenko to death,

124
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:01,525
used this as a trick to cover up the crime.

125
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,625
Trick?

126
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,325
I will show you the trick,

127
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:11,425
so let me borrow your tall officer and fat officer.

128
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,425
Tall one? Fat one?

129
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:18,225
Oh, Takagi and Chiba!

130
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:21,825
I'll let you borrow them but what are you planning to do?

131
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,125
You don't mean to use them as a guinea pig in a dangerous trick.

132
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,925
No need to worry.

133
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:32,525
I understand you being worried about your men.

134
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:39,425
Hey Hattori, are you okay?

135
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,425
He's okay!

136
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:45,225
Bring everyone to where Ms. Tenko's body was found

137
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,225
in the hallway on the 2nd floor in 10 minutes!

138
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:51,125
You will be surprised too!

139
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,425
Is what Brother Heiji was saying! Right?

140
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:56,725
Yeah.

141
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,025
I'm counting on you, Hattori.

142
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:04,925
Right! I'll get Takagi and Chiba to come to this room.

143
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:11,525
Will Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage please go back to your rooms and wait?

144
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,325
Get Mr. Hoshikawa too.

145
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:17,125
Yes. Then I'll go to the living room.

146
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,525
Hey, Kudo.

147
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,825
I think I got it.

148
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,125
That's why we're gathering everyone up.

149
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,325
No, not that!

150
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,525
I'm not talking about the case.

151
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,725
I'm talking about why there was something about Kazuha

152
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:35,925
that was annoying me!

153
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:39,225
Well, good for you.

154
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,125
It's almost 10 minutes.

155
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,225
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

156
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:49,325
Then, can you all step up on the stage

157
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,425
where I will unravel the mystery,

158
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,225
of course, with the culprit who is among us.

159
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,725
Huh?

160
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,125
The killer is...

161
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,325
Among us?

162
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:10,647
But, Hattori!

163
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,647
You just said!

164
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:17,147
The culprit who killed Ms. Tenko was an outsider!

165
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,147
The intruder's target

166
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:23,047
was Mr. Masakage's notes in the storage room on the 2nd floor

167
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:26,647
down the hall to the right!

168
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,347
And Ms. Tenko ran into him when he was looking for the book,

169
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,847
was killed,

170
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:35,247
and afterwards, Mr. Hoshikawa, Kazuha and Ran came in.

171
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:36,647
After the blackout,

172
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:39,747
the culprit put Ms. Tenko's body at the end of the hallway,

173
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:42,947
went into Mr. Masakage's room down the hall to the left

174
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,447
and escaped from the window.

175
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,947
There were works on the hallway switch to make it look like a blackout.

176
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,047
During the blackout,

177
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:54,547
Mr. Handa and Mrs. Masakage were in the room downstairs,

178
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:57,947
Mr. Hoshikawa was being clung onto by Kazuha and Ran

179
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,447
and couldn't move.

180
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:02,847
If it wasn't an outsider,

181
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:09,147
how would someone among the three put Ms. Tenko's body over there?

182
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,547
Also Mrs. Masakage, you said that,

183
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,847
5 years ago, a suspicious person who called Mr. Masakage,

184
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,947
your husband a phony visited.

185
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:24,847
If there's anyone to be suspicious about, wouldn't it be him?

186
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:29,347
The man that visited many times,

187
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,647
didn't he have a habit or something?

188
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,147
Huh? Habit?

189
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:39,747
I don't know. There might have been, but it's been 5 years...

190
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,547
For example,

191
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:46,447
pushing up the middle of his sunglasses with his left hand little finger.

192
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,247
Right, right! That habit...

193
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,147
What?

194
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,447
Why does Heiji know?

195
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,347
I don't know

196
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,347
but I know that what Mrs. Masakage is saying

197
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:00,047
the person in the very right of this picture,

198
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:03,847
the man with a hat, sunglasses, and a moustache is the one!

199
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,847
Isn't it...

200
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:09,047
Mr. Handa when he was young?

201
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,147
That's right. Mr. Handa pushed up the middle of his sunglasses

202
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:14,647
with his left hand little finger.

203
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:19,047
Then, the suspicious man Mrs. Masakage met 5 years ago

204
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,347
was Mr. Handa.

205
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:21,747
Stupid!

206
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:24,747
If that man was Mr. Handa who was living in this house

207
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:27,347
as Mr. Masakage's pupil,

208
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,847
Mrs. Masakage would've recognized him!

209
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,247
Oh, that's true.

210
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,047
Well, that's to say... when people say things that's not true

211
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,847
but actually sounds like it's true,

212
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:42,347
they usually visualize someone they know in their heads!

213
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:45,847
It would be bothersome if things don't add up later on.

214
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,347
And that someone is...

215
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:52,047
Mr. Handa when he was young!

216
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:56,547
I see. If that man's habit is just like Mr. Handa's,

217
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:59,347
Mrs. Masakage will have no problem recognizing it,

218
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:01,547
so it will not be suspected.

219
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,047
But...

220
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:04,947
Why lie like that...

221
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,047
She realized who the culprit was

222
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,047
from where Ms. Tenko's body lay

223
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,647
and from the state the body was found.

224
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,047
Mr. Hoshikawa...

225
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,547
you are the murderer!

226
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:26,547
Then Mrs. Masakage, you covered up for Mr. Hoshikawa.

227
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,347
No, that can't be true!

228
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,847
When Mr. Hoshikawa found Ms. Tenko,

229
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:34,247
I was clinging on to him so he wasn't able to move.

230
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:39,147
That's why I'm going to unravel that mystery right now!

231
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,947
Look at this, this hallway.

232
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,347
It's the same as last time, right?

233
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,147
Yes, just like this.

234
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:47,047
It was poorly-lit

235
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,447
but I noticed there was nothing at the end of the hallway.

236
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,847
Well, at that time,

237
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:56,647
I was holding on to Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this!

238
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:57,847
Stupid!

239
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:58,947
You're too close!

240
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:00,747
So you won't play any tricks on me!

241
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,247
So behave!

242
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,247
Hey.

243
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:06,547
Hey, so hurry up and unravel the mystery!

244
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:11,047
When Mr. Hoshikawa pressed this switch,

245
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:13,847
you said it blacked out.

246
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,347
If it blacked out, the breaker...

247
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,747
Conan?

248
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,247
Since when were you there?

249
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:27,647
How did you...

250
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,247
I was here all the time.

251
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,147
Don't lie to me!

252
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,247
When it got dark,

253
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,247
you came out of the storage room, didn't you?

254
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,847
No.

255
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,847
I was here in this storage room the whole time

256
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,947
but the door didn't open.

257
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:46,947
But I didn't see Conan.

258
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,347
Huh? What?

259
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,747
What is it, Conan?

260
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:55,647
-Huh? -Disappeared?

261
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,347
We didn't disappear!

262
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:58,947
Conan?

263
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,147
Like this.

264
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:05,947
Brother Heiji just moved Mr. Masakage's room door like this.

265
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:09,847
During the blackout.

266
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,347
Just like Mr. Hoshikawa did.

267
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,447
That can't be true!

268
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:24,347
This is...

269
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,147
Isn't it similar? This room...

270
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,147
looks just like the end of the hallway.

271
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,347
The door of the storage room is that closet.

272
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,947
The right wall is this screen!

273
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,447
And...

274
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,647
The small window at the end of the hallway is...

275
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:48,947
The big window hidden by this sideboard.

276
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:53,347
This is the door in front of Mr. Masakage's room that can be seen.

277
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:54,647
And...

278
00:15:55,247 --> 00:16:00,447
if behind Mr. Masakage's room door is the mirror...

279
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,347
You can tell already, right?

280
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:05,647
Before the blackout, what Kazuha and Ran saw

281
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:11,647
was the room seen as reflected in the mirror behind the door!

282
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:16,147
Then, the body was at the end of the hallway from the very beginning?

283
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:19,047
So during the blackout,

284
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:23,947
Mr. Hoshikawa shut the mirror door and showed it!

285
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:29,047
But when we entered the room, there was no mirror in back of the door.

286
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:33,047
That's right, that's right! There was no extra door at all!

287
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,547
Conan?

288
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:38,447
This door is some door

289
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:43,747
move the mirror by the knob and put the door together.

290
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:47,347
And it becomes one door. Some trick!

291
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:50,747
You noticed the trick because the door was too thick

292
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,447
and the line down the center, right?

293
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,447
Yes.

294
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,847
And also

295
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,047
because of the uncomfortable feeling Kazuha and that lady

296
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,847
-was talking about! -Huh?

297
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:04,947
You were saying, before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

298
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:08,047
the shadow of the vase was different.

299
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,047
I was convinced as I recalled that

300
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:13,847
before and after Ms. Tenko's body was found,

301
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,847
it must have been a different place

302
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:18,647
where the moonlight was cast differently.

303
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:22,447
But this house is a convenient house for tricks.

304
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,947
Of course,

305
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:26,547
this door, room, hallway,

306
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:32,447
Mr. Masakage made everything in order to play this trick.

307
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:33,847
What?

308
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,747
Bring the guests to this hallway.

309
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:39,247
When he turns off the light closes the door,

310
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:42,447
and shows the Christmas tree at the end of the hall

311
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:46,247
and surprises everyone with the magic.

312
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:47,347
So that's it!

313
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,247
That's why Mrs. Masakage knew that Mr. Hoshikawa

314
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,947
was the culprit from the beginning.

315
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:56,147
But, wasn't it you who wanted to come here, Mr. Handa?

316
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:00,547
Mr. Hoshikawa didn't intend to kill.

317
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,647
His intent to kill probably developed

318
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,147
when Ms. Tenko said she was going to do

319
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:07,347
the trick "Witch Reborn" in the next show.

320
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:08,747
No.

321
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:11,847
Actually it's "The Resurrection of the Devil",

322
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:15,747
the title of the magic Mr. Masakage thought of.

323
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:20,347
-Huh? -The same stage setup and performance.

324
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:22,347
I realized right away

325
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:25,447
that she looked at Mr. Masakage's trick book

326
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,847
and was going to copy it.

327
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,647
The magic that had been sealed because it was too dangerous.

328
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,647
That miracle magic.

329
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,447
But, she was just going to steal the master's trick.

330
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:40,847
She didn't know that.

331
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:42,647
Everyone, in other words, we discussed

332
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,047
and decided not to do that magic

333
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:49,247
because it was before she became my husband's pupil.

334
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:51,647
Mrs. Masakage covered up for me

335
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,947
when she said the book was in the storage room.

336
00:18:55,947 --> 00:19:00,347
Master always carried the book around.

337
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:05,747
But one day ten years ago, he misplaced the trick book

338
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:10,147
and said he was going to go look for it but never came back.

339
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:14,547
I thought it was strange for her to be able to look at the book

340
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:18,647
so I called her to the teacher's room and confronted her.

341
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,947
That's right, I stole it.

342
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:24,347
I am clever with by hands by profession.

343
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:27,747
I was going to return it to the teacher when he returned

344
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:29,547
but I didn't think he would be so shocked

345
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:32,347
as to disappear from before everyone.

346
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,447
But...

347
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,647
the teacher who was always telling us to surpass him

348
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,947
didn't realize that he was betrayed.

349
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,547
It was probably his time to quit

350
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,247
as a magician.

351
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:53,047
Well, if I perform Mr. Masakage's not-yet-performed magic

352
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,947
all over the world,

353
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:59,947
the master will be happy from under the sod, don't you think?

354
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:08,247
That's why you killed her?

355
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:13,147
My mind went into total panic, and when I snapped back to myself,

356
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:16,147
she was all bloody lying in front of me.

357
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:20,447
I recalled the master's Christmas tree magic

358
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:24,247
and used that to make it look like an outsider had killed her.

359
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,747
Then you broke the branches in the shrubbery,

360
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:31,147
and erased the footprints.

361
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,547
Yes.

362
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:37,247
Probably, the weapon was the vase in Masakage's room.

363
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,247
There was blood on the base of the vase

364
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:45,047
and maybe a few drops of blood got on Mr. Hoshikawa's black clothes.

365
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,447
The evidence is all over the place.

366
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,347
I failed as a magician.

367
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:52,747
You're a failure even if you're not a magician!

368
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:55,447
Brace yourself.

369
00:20:55,447 --> 00:21:00,047
Unlike magic, your charge will not disappear easily.

370
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,647
Wow, what can you expect of Hattori!

371
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,547
It was excellent deduction!

372
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:45,647
You are no less than Kudo, maybe even more!

373
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:49,147
Inspector, you think so too?

374
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:53,647
By the way, Brother Heiji, weren't you saying?

375
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:54,947
Huh?

376
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:59,847
That you get annoyed when Sister Kazuha is friendly with other men!

377
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:00,947
Huh?

378
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,447
What does that mean?

379
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:07,347
Oh, that's right! Now I know why.

380
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:09,047
Huh? What?

381
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:13,447
I probably think of you...

382
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:14,747
What?

383
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:18,947
No. No, Heiji, not in front of everyone.

384
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:20,647
As my henchman.

385
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:22,247
Huh?

386
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:24,447
What did you just say?

387
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,547
Henchman, my henchman!

388
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:30,947
As the boss, I wouldn't feel good if you wag your tail at someone else,

389
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,547
I'll lose face, right?

390
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:35,847
That's why I was annoyed!

391
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,047
Why should I be your henchman?

392
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:40,347
Your father is my father's henchman!

393
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:42,347
So, of course you're my henchman!

394
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:47,747
That night, I got mail from Ran.

395
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:53,847
P.S. Shinichi, I hope you don't think of me as your henchman?

396
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,247
Hey, hey.

397
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,247
"Taketori Story"

398
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,147
Okay, stop!

399
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,647
Behave yourself!

400
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,947
The traveling acting group featuring Tamanosuke Ito

401
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:14,747
has come to our town to put on a show again.

402
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:18,247
Then, it was just a week ago,

403
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:20,947
that the threat note was sent over the internet.

404
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:23,447
Something's not right.

405
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,547
Next Conan,

406
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,547
"Concurrent Stage and Kidnapping (Part 1)"

407
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,374
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,574
"Taketori Story"

409
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,474
Conan is now in 3D!

410
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,074
Come see us at Tempozan, Osaka during summer vacation!
