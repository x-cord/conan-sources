1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.040
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.740
Today, there is a coffee shop located by a slope.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.040
A truck Is this a case or an accident?

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.790
I can't walk anymore.

9
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.690
Hey, hang in there.

10
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.490
Just a little more to go.

11
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.590
According to Dr. Agasa's map, it's right around the curve up ahead.

12
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.390
Hang in there, Genta.

13
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.890
Maybe taking the bus would've been faster.

14
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.590
No way. We're going to be treated to lunch,

15
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.890
so if we take the bus it would render everything meaningless.

16
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.590
You mean you just wanted to save bus fare?

17
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.590
What a tight brat...

18
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.690
"Coffee Shop Truck Crash"

19
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.790
It's supposed to be around here...

20
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.190
Mitsuhiko, isn't that it?

21
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.590
Peach Sunday.

22
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.290
This is the place after all.

23
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.890
Can you read English, Mitsuhiko?

24
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.290
I'm bilingual.

25
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.790
Come on let's go inside. I'm starved.

26
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.190
Yes, let's go.

27
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.390
Hello.

28
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.890
We're...

29
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.490
The Youth Detective Squad, right?

30
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.590
You're going to meet with Dr. Agasa here, aren't you?

31
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.890
-This way please. -All right...

32
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.290
I'm hungry.

33
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.590
I want the window seat.

34
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.290
Hi, welcome to our shop.

35
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.490
Dr. Agasa called me about you.

36
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.190
He said that he's going to be a little late,

37
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.690
so for you to eat anything you like.

38
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.690
It looks so good!

39
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.790
Hey, Genta, ladies first.

40
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.590
Of course!

41
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.890
Here you go.

42
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.290
Thank you.

43
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.790
Welcome.

44
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.190
My name is Ohara. I have reservations.

45
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.990
Please come this way.

46
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.190
The most recommended menu here is Peach Sundae.

47
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.690
It's the master's original menu.

48
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.190
I'll take that, then.

49
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.890
Me too.

50
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.090
What would you like, Conan?

51
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.890
The same as all of you is fine.

52
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.990
Four Peach Sundaes please.

53
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.390
Okay.

54
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.390
It looks delicious!

55
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.690
This is really delicious.

56
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.490
-You see. -Aren't you going to eat, Conan?

57
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.290
Give it to me then.

58
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.090
-Genta. -What a waste if the ice cream melts.

59
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.490
What's that?

60
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.190
-Leaflets again? -It's a rush job.

61
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.890
"Kazuo Ohara (52)" -They're going to be passing it out

62
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.790
"Ohara Planning's President" -at the shopping arcade this coming Sunday.

63
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.790
"Toru Aida (35)" -You should just refuse such a cheap paying job.

64
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.390
"Ohara Planning's Designer" -I can't do that.

65
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.390
This is the kind of job that leads to a stable income. Right?

66
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.790
Right.

67
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.490
Will you think about it for me?

68
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.790
No matter how many times you ask me, my answer will not change.

69
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.990
Is it money you want? If so I'll increase the amount...

70
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.990
I don't think you can, with the work that you're doing now.

71
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.690
Maybe not just yet,

72
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.190
but I promise that someday I'll...

73
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.590
There you go again.

74
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.190
Can't you do something about it?

75
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.590
Talk about persistence.

76
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.890
I don't want to end my life making leaflets.

77
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.490
Working with you is ruining my talent.

78
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.790
Take it easy.

79
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.690
I'll bet you don't have any gripes on the pamphlets of the resort hotel

80
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.890
that I'm asking you to work on this time.

81
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.190
Yeah, as for that, I'll take the job as retirement pay.

82
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.090
You can't handle it anyway if I leave, can you?

83
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.490
What?

84
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.590
But, I promise to finish these leaflets

85
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.690
before I leave.

86
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.490
Let's get started. You're in a rush, aren't you?

87
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.190
To do this leaflets.

88
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.390
I'm going to the restroom.

89
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.590
Jeepers, it was that delicious.

90
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.090
Two of them?

91
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.490
Talk about fast.

92
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.590
Mitsuhiko, what's your second recommendation?

93
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.990
You'll get a stomach ache if you eat too much.

94
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.290
I'll be fine, no big deal.

95
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.390
-I told you so. -I have to go to the restroom.

96
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.190
Genta somebody's using the restroom now...

97
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.890
Somebody's inside.

98
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.490
That was good.

99
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.890
It's indeed worth recommending.

100
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.990
Genta, someone was inside, right?

101
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.190
Yeah.

102
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.590
I don't know who's in there,

103
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.090
but he doesn't answer when I knock.

104
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.590
I feel like I'm going to explode.

105
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.690
He's come out.

106
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.990
It can't be.

107
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.190
You mean the guest.

108
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.490
Saved.

109
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.090
If you're going to order another serving, order one for me too!

110
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.490
He's using his right hand this time.

111
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.090
Talk about skill.

112
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.090
He's ambidextrous.

113
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.190
Hello.

114
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.490
- Dr. Agasa. -I'm sorry I'm late.

115
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.490
We're all digging in.

116
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.490
Eat all you like.

117
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.990
I won the raffle at the shopping arcade.

118
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.590
Okay then, I'll take...

119
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.090
Chocolate parfait, pudding a la mode

120
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.690
and strawberry shortcake!

121
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.190
Is your stomach okay?

122
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.790
No problem, no problem.

123
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.690
Look, look at that bus.

124
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.790
I wonder what it is. It's beautiful.

125
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.890
True.

126
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.590
I think I dropped my lighter. I'll go check.

127
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.790
I want it done by sundown.

128
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.390
I'm counting on you.

129
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.490
Yes, yes.

130
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.490
Conan, what are you going to have?

131
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.790
I'll have coffee.

132
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.890
Coffee?

133
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.690
Oh, no, I mean...

134
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.190
What is this?

135
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:03.990
What is this?

136
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.490
Which means that you just happened to leave your seat,

137
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.390
so you were spared?

138
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.890
Yes, I just happened to go to the restroom to look for my lighter.

139
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.090
Thank goodness you were spared.

140
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.390
You're the president of Ohara Planning.

141
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.090
The office is located right above this hill, isn't it?

142
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.590
Mr. Saito.

143
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.690
I've found the driver of the truck!

144
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.690
Okay, I'll be right there.

145
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.690
Did you park your car part way up the slope like this

146
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.490
and make your delivery?

147
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.690
I'm sorry,

148
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.790
"Jiro Kobayashi (25)" -I usually park on a flat place

149
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.990
"Courier" -up the slope

150
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.490
but that car was parked here today,

151
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.690
so I had no choice but to park my car in front of it.

152
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.390
I made sure my side brakes were locked

153
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.890
and had my gear in reverse just to be safe.

154
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.490
Mr. Saito, I went to the site right away

155
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.490
and checked the driver's seat

156
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.490
but the side brakes weren't locked.

157
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.890
It can't be.

158
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.490
Please check more carefully.

159
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.990
I'm positive that I pulled my side brakes and locked it.

160
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.390
Of course he's lying.

161
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.390
Aida was...

162
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.090
Aida was my precious right hand man.

163
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.890
Without him, my company is finished.

164
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.690
Oh no... did someone pass away?

165
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.690
President.

166
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.890
Segawa.

167
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.790
What are you doing in a place like this?

168
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.890
"Michiko Segawa (46)" -If we don't deposit the money today,

169
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.690
"Ohara Planning's employee" -they're going to stop shipment of the goods!

170
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.890
I know.

171
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.190
But, this is no time for something like that.

172
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.290
-Aida passed away. -What?

173
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.290
He got mixed up in an accident.

174
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.290
Oh no.

175
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.490
Strange. I wonder what it means.

176
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.790
- Conan. -Conan.

177
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.090
Hey, this place is off limits.

178
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.490
I forgot something in the restroom.

179
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.690
He was licking his finger

180
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.490
when he first came out of the restroom.

181
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.790
I wonder if he got hurt in the restroom?

182
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.790
But why?

183
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.790
Blood stains?

184
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.690
These are traces of a hand touching the frame from outside!

185
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.490
I see.

186
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.390
The blood got here when he came back from outside.

187
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.090
That's why there was no answer when Genta knocked.

188
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.890
Mr. Ohara wasn't in the toilet then.

189
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.390
He hurt his left hand when he was outside.

190
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.190
That's why he held the pencil in his right hand after coming back.

191
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.390
But, where did he go to do what?

192
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.590
Before the accident,

193
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.890
Mr. Ohara seemed very concerned about the time.

194
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.390
Did he have to go out at a certain time?

195
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.890
Time...

196
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.890
Conan, where were you?

197
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.490
I just went to get something I forgot.

198
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.290
Does anybody remember what time the accident occurred?

199
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.990
About 2:30 pm.

200
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.090
It was right after Dr. Agasa got here.

201
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.790
2:30 pm.

202
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.890
There's one at 2:07 pm.

203
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.590
-Is something wrong? -Yeah.

204
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.590
I wonder what route the bus that left here

205
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.590
just before the accident took place?

206
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.490
I think it's about time it'll come back.

207
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.890
It supposed to make a round from the apartment complex back

208
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.990
to the shopping arcade.

209
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.190
Why was that bus parked?

210
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.590
This is the terminal as well as the depot,

211
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.590
so the buses take a 5 to 10 minutes time adjustment break time.

212
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.490
What is it?

213
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.790
Do we have a case?

214
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.090
No fair, Conan!

215
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.990
You're always hogging the clues!

216
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.790
He's right!

217
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.290
Hey, I'd like to ask you kids some questions too.

218
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.690
So come here, will you?

219
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.690
Okay!

220
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.490
A piano cord?

221
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.390
I see, I've got it.

222
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.290
This is homicide! And the killer is...

223
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.190
I'm sure it's him!

224
00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:47.279
Officer.

225
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.679
Yes?

226
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.979
I have some urgent business to attend to

227
00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:52.079
so I'd like to be excused for a while.

228
00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.479
We can't allow that.

229
00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:57.079
I have to go make a transfer to one of my clients.

230
00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:00.579
30 minutes... no, 20 minutes will do.

231
00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:01.779
Please.

232
00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:05.779
Has he been interrogated?

233
00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.579
Yes, briefly.

234
00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.279
I guess you can go then.

235
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.179
Thank you so much.

236
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:13.379
No good.

237
00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:16.279
If he is released, he'll go and get rid of all the evidence.

238
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.779
Dr. Agasa.

239
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:21.179
This is homicide.

240
00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:22.479
What?

241
00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:25.479
-Move your lips like always for me. -Okay.

242
00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:27.879
Wait just a minute!

243
00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:29.079
Who, me?

244
00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:32.679
Yes, I can't have you leave just yet.

245
00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.279
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:36.779
We've got a homicide case.

247
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:42.679
Who are you?

248
00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:45.879
I am Dr. Agasa.

249
00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.879
Will outsiders stay out of this?

250
00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:50.379
Hold it, let's at least hear him out.

251
00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:52.879
Dr. Agasa, do you have any leads?

252
00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:55.879
I not only have a lead, I even have proof.

253
00:14:55.879 --> 00:15:00.179
Mr. Ohara, I have proof that you are the killer.

254
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.579
Don't be ridiculous.

255
00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:05.979
No matter how you look at it,

256
00:15:05.979 --> 00:15:07.779
this is an accident caused by the carelessness of the driver

257
00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:09.579
whose truck crashed into the shop.

258
00:15:09.579 --> 00:15:10.779
That's not true.

259
00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.179
I'm all ears, Dr. Agasa.

260
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:19.079
All right, let me start with the trick involved in this case.

261
00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:20.579
Nonsense.

262
00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:22.179
I'm a busy man.

263
00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:24.979
I don't have time to waste listening to a fabricated story.

264
00:15:24.979 --> 00:15:26.579
Mr. Ohara.

265
00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:30.579
It'll just be a short while, so let's hear him out.

266
00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:34.479
Please go ahead.

267
00:15:34.479 --> 00:15:38.779
Mr. Ohara, you parked your car on the top of the hill

268
00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:42.079
where the courier truck always parks.

269
00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:44.179
Then you asked Mr. Aida to come with you to the coffee shop

270
00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:45.879
at the bottom of the hill.

271
00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.379
And then, you made him sit by the window

272
00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:50.679
so that he couldn't see the slope from his side.

273
00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:53.479
Isn't that right?

274
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:54.779
No.

275
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:57.979
I didn't make him sit by the window so that he couldn't see the slope.

276
00:15:57.979 --> 00:16:00.979
The place he sat just happened to be by the window.

277
00:16:00.979 --> 00:16:02.279
I see.

278
00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:06.779
Then, you left a while later in the middle of negotiations

279
00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:09.579
pretending to go to the restroom.

280
00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:11.079
I wasn't pretending.

281
00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:12.979
I really went to the restroom.

282
00:16:12.979 --> 00:16:15.279
That's strange.

283
00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:17.179
Genta here says,

284
00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:19.679
he tried knocking at the door many times

285
00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.579
but you didn't answer.

286
00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:24.979
That's right. My stomach was so sore, I thought I'd die.

287
00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:26.679
That's because...

288
00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:30.179
Back then, you snuck out of the toilet,

289
00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:33.179
and went over to the courier truck.

290
00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:37.479
You placed a wooden linchpin that you had set up beforehand

291
00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.579
in front of the front tires of the truck.

292
00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:41.979
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:16:41.979 --> 00:16:45.079
Why would I have to do something like that?

294
00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:50.279
It was a trick to make it look like you weren't committing the crime.

295
00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:53.579
You tied a piano cord to that linchpin,

296
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:56.979
and then tied the piano cord

297
00:16:56.979 --> 00:16:59.479
onto the rear end of the bus that was parked for time adjustment.

298
00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:03.479
Then, you shifted the gear of the courier to neutral,

299
00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.879
and released the side brake.

300
00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:10.079
You then returned to the coffee shop as if nothing had happened.

301
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.679
When the time came, and the bus leaves,

302
00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:14.679
the linchpin would come off.

303
00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:18.479
That would make the courier truck,

304
00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:22.279
roll down the hill on its own.

305
00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:25.879
All you had to do next, was wait for the bus to go by the coffee shop

306
00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.179
and get out of the way

307
00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:31.979
by pretending to go to the restroom to look for your lighter.

308
00:17:33.879 --> 00:17:35.279
I see!

309
00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:37.279
The thing that was shimmering at the rear end of the bus

310
00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:39.079
was the piano cord.

311
00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:42.879
Yes. And this is that stopper.

312
00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:43.879
Lets see...

313
00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:45.079
You mean this?

314
00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:48.579
-Here you go. -Oh, yes.

315
00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:54.279
It's just a plain piece of wood.

316
00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:56.679
The wooden linchpin is dragged along by the bus,

317
00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:00.179
and shatters as it bounces on the pavement.

318
00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.779
That is what is left of the linchpin.

319
00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:05.679
The car which had gained speed because of the slope,

320
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:09.479
crashed into the window of the coffee shop and burst inside,

321
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:11.179
just as you had planned.

322
00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:23.079
Mr. Aida was hit by the truck from behind and passed away.

323
00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:26.679
Let's say the trick is as you say.

324
00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:29.679
But, do you have proof that I did it?

325
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.379
I have proof.

326
00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:35.079
Your mistake was, when you tied the piano cord on,

327
00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:38.579
you hurt your finger.

328
00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:44.179
My hand got stuck to the knob of the door of the restroom.

329
00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:48.179
The courier truck can be operated with just one hand,

330
00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:50.279
so you didn't leave any blood stains there.

331
00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:52.579
But, when you went in through the toilet window,

332
00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:55.579
you touched it and left blood stains on it.

333
00:18:58.879 --> 00:19:03.179
Blood is left on the inside of the window of the toilet.

334
00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:06.179
After returning from the restroom,

335
00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:08.979
you continued making arrangements.

336
00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:11.479
But since you hurt your left hand,

337
00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:14.579
you held the pencil with your right hand.

338
00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:20.479
Conan witnessed you licking your left hand occasionally.

339
00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:21.879
Isn't that right, Conan?

340
00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:23.879
Yes.

341
00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:27.779
It's true that I hurt my finger.

342
00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:32.079
But like I said, it was scraped by the door knob.

343
00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:34.179
Can something like that be considered proof?

344
00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:35.679
Can it, officer?

345
00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:37.279
True.

346
00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:39.779
-Shut up. -Yes, sir.

347
00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.179
Anyway, if you insist that I'm the killer,

348
00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:46.179
-show me concrete evidence. -Hey, what's that?

349
00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:55.279
There's a glove with a strange pattern in the car.

350
00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:10.279
What is the meaning of this Mr. Ohara?

351
00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:13.279
If the piano cord on the bus is checked

352
00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:17.179
your blood should also be detected on it.

353
00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:21.079
The wound that you acquired on your hand in the toilet,

354
00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:25.279
and the glove with blood stains on it is in your car.

355
00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.879
The blood stain on the frame of the window of the toilet

356
00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:29.679
shows that you held the frame from outside.

357
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:33.079
Furthermore, your blood stains are also on the piano cord

358
00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:35.879
that is tied to the bus.

359
00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:39.979
How are you going to explain all this?

360
00:20:42.979 --> 00:20:45.179
How about it, Mr. Ohara?

361
00:20:48.579 --> 00:20:51.279
Yes. I killed him.

362
00:20:56.179 --> 00:21:00.179
That guy... Aida, he dared forget all that I did for him now,

363
00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:05.079
and betrayed me by saying he was going to quit working for me.

364
00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:11.579
If he quits the company, my company may go bankrupt.

365
00:21:11.579 --> 00:21:13.579
If it were going to go bankrupt any way,

366
00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:16.179
I figured I should kill him, making it look like an accident,

367
00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:21.379
and at least get of hold of his life insurance money as compensation.

368
00:21:21.379 --> 00:21:22.379
To tell the truth,

369
00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:24.379
I was undecided until I began making arrangements with him

370
00:21:24.379 --> 00:21:25.979
at the coffee shop.

371
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.279
But, he had the nerve to say,

372
00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:31.579
he was going to take away a big job that I found,

373
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:35.179
as retirement pay, so...

374
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.879
What a thing to do...

375
00:21:38.879 --> 00:21:41.579
I'm very sorry.

376
00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:20.479
"Celebration, Renovated and reopening"

377
00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:24.879
Thank you so much, Dr. Agasa.

378
00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:28.079
Thanks to you, my innocence has been proven.

379
00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:29.279
No problem, no big thing,

380
00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:33.379
I can handle things like this hands down.

381
00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:39.379
For I am the one who taught that famous high school detective,

382
00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:41.479
Kudo the skills of being a detective, after all.

383
00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:43.379
Oh, really?

384
00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:45.679
Oh yeah, sure.

385
00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:48.079
Oh well, who cares?

386
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:50.579
Amazing.

387
00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:52.279
Yeah, right?

388
00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:01.679
"Next Episode" -This is dated 10 years ago.

389
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:04.679
This is 10 years before Misaki got married.

390
00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:08.079
Oh no.

391
00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:16.179
Could there be more than one attacker?

392
00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:19.879
What is this a piece of?

393
00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:22.379
Just as I thought, this is...

394
00:24:22.879 --> 00:24:24.279
Next Conan,

395
00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:28.300
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 1)"

396
00:24:28.997 --> 00:24:30.897
Next Conan's hint:

397
00:24:30.897 --> 00:24:33.197
"Sculpture"

398
00:24:33.197 --> 00:24:35.097
The next episode is a sonorous story.

399
00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:36.997
I'm taking the content from the story.

400
00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:37.997
That's good.
