ALIVE

3
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,270
Hello? It's me. Can you come here for a minute?

4
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,040
Yes. That's right. Lab No. 4.

5
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,560
I have something interesting to show you.

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
Right.

7
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,660
The smell?

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,270
I didn't smell anything.

9
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,890
We are just like sharks.

10
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,910
We pick up the scent of blood, hurry to the crime scene,

11
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,020
and use every sense we have to find the culprit.

12
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,330
Once they've taken the bait, we sink
our razor-sharp teeth known as "evidence"

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,140
into their flesh until they confess.

14
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,260
That's what a detective does.

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,390

(Case Closed Episode "One"

17
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,660
Isn't it better to give up on this?

18
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,620
I mean having your big surprise reunion and romance revival plan

19
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,730
at an aquarium where a murder took place.

20
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,620
Well, you have a point.

21
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,390
Oh, it's starting to rain.

22
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,180
So it is.

23
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,600
Then, let's run back home.

24
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,260
Ah? Hey! I told you not to run!

25
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,000
Why? Why shouldn't I?

26
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,900
Are you kidding me? Why was my phone in my hood?

27
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,430
Err, sorry!

28
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,470
I was trying to figure out where the killer
put the phone to record a video like that,

29
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,200
and I forgot I left the phone in your hood.

30
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,280
How are you going to pay me back? My dad just bought it for me!

31
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,950
D-Don't cry!

32
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,950
I'll buy you a new one in a few days.

33
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,560
Shinichi, you're terrible!

34
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,650
Nothing good ever happens when I'm with you!

35
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,210
Even when we were in the U.S., we did nothing but handle cases!

36
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,160
Alright! Then...

37
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,120
I'll take you

38
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,910
to Tropical Land.

39
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,420
Tropical Land?

40
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,920
What's that place? It sounds fun!

41
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,480
Yeah! It's due to be completed soon in Tokyo!

42
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,850
And I certainly don't expect any cases
to turn up at an amusement park.

43
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,460
If it's your treat, I'd love to go with you.

44
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,770
Then let's go there if I win the regional karate tournament, okay?

45
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,980
Hey, wait a second. You were the runner-up last year, weren't you?

46
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,110
And isn't the senior who won

47
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,870
about to retire from the club?

48
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,330
It's a deal!

49
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,330
But I don't have much of an allowance.

50
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,840
And, when you buy me a new phone,

51
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,460
remember to put a "sea cucumber man" strap
sold at the Beika Aquarium on it!

52
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,930
Yeah! Got it!

53
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,030
And then...

54
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,100
What? There's more?

55
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,600
Well, I'll let you off for now.

56
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,260
Thanks!

57
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,820
Wow, it's pouring!

58
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,920
The forecast was way off!

59
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,530
I'll have what he's having.

60
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,760
You're not gonna check?

61
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,890
Hmph! If it's fake, I'll have you pay with your life.

62
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm going to check.

63
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,060
Suit yourself.

64
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,580
Okay. It's all here.

65
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

66
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,350
So, what's my next job?

67
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,380
There's got to be something you can tell me.

68
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,910
Did you know about that?

69
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,670
It seems there's a rat that's been nosing

70
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,350
around our organization lately.

71
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,210
What do you think of that?

72
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,870
I...I had no idea!

73
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,040
I'd not heard anything like that.

74
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,510
Really?

75
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,260
So, my next job is to find out the rat you just mentioned?

76
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,050
No. I already know that rat's identity.

77
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,970
This cocktail is delicious!

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,070
What's in it?

79
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,320
Rum.

80
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,490
Cointreau.

81
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,450
A bit of lemon juice.

82
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,090
X, Y, Z.

83
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,160
It's a drink called "This is the end."

84
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,670
L-Let me know when you have a job for me.

85
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,180
Is that okay, boss?

86
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,310
Just letting him leave like that?

87
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,720
He's obviously the rat, isn't he?

88
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,690
Mmm.

89
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,640
It'll be fine.

90
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,470
It's a drink called "This is the end."

91
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,590
It's me.

92
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,720
Understood. We'll leave immediately.

93
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,640
So, boss, what do we do with this?

94
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,310
The file of the smuggled weapons.

95
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,020
Don't worry about this. Just go ahead with the plan.

96
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,030
They've accepted the price

97
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,670
that we earnestly proposed, right?

98
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,120
Yes. But it could be a trap.

99
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,410
We should give him the benefit of doubt before we contacted him.

100
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,840
I guess you're right.

101
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,130
Besides,

102
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,420
it'd be a shame to give up too soon.

103
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,170
Who is it?

104
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,190
Shinichi?

105
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,130
Oh, it's you, Ran!

106
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,920
What are you doing here so early?

107
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,070
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,300
It's 11 already! 11!

109
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,420
Eh? Seriously?

110
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,820
My goodness!

111
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,830
Sorry to bother you!

112
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,670
So, what brings you here on a Sunday?

113
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,430
You really forgot, didn't you?

114
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,800
Huh? About what?

115
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,030
What do you mean, about what?

116
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,090
When I told you that I'd finally have a day off from karate practice,

117
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,820
you said, "Then let's go buy a new phone."

118
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,970
Don't you remember, Shinichi?

119
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,730
I...I'm sorry! I completely forgot.

120
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,960
Gosh, you stayed up late and read mysteries again, didn't you?

121
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,980
Hehehe! Bingo!

122
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,150
Anyway, hurry and get changed.

123
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,370
I'll go cook something to fill you up in the meantime.

124
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,090
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

125
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,670
Not yet. Thank you!

126
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,670
And listen! Don't forget the "sea cucumber man" strap!

127
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,540
You bet!

128
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,880
That's strange!

129
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,920
The night we went to the aquarium last week,

130
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,830
a car near Beika Harbor exploded.

131
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,570
Mmm.

132
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,200
So, what about it?

133
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,070
It looks like it's still under investigation.

134
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,080
You're right! That's terrible!

135
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,040
But I'm sure it'll be solved soon.

136
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,800
Because Japan's police are amazing!

137
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,970
"And someone like me who's admired
by the police is even more amazing!"

138
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,960
Isn't that what you want to say?

139
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,100
Pretty much!

140
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,260
Be humble for once, will you?

141
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,220
I was kidding. Just kidding!

142
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,810
Then, it's time to head out.

143
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,850
Okay.

144
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,900
Mitsuhiko-kun! Pass! Pass!

145
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,080
Ayumi-chan!

146
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,080
Here I go, Genta-kun!

147
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,710
I'm ready! Do it!

148
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,020
Piece of cake! Piece of cake! Haha!

149
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
I'm sorry, Ayumi-chan.

150
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,220
Alright! Now it's my turn!

151
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,110
Come on, Genta-kun!

152
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,060
Watch where you're kicking that, okay?

153
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,980
My bad! My bad!

154
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,860
I'm sorry!

155
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,980
Could you stop the ball for us?

156
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,950
Wow! That's amazing!

157
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,340
Are you a soccer player?

158
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,470
Yeah. I used to be.

159
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,350
Here.

160
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,070
Thank you very much!

161
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,200
Bye-bye!

162
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,930
If only we had a friend who's good at soccer like him,

163
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,220
then we could get better, too!

164
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,220
You're right!

165
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,240
If you hadn't quit the soccer club,

166
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,260
you might have become a member of the national team by now.

167
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,660
I'm only an 11th grader. It's too early for that.

168
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,650
Is it?

169
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,200
Besides, I only played soccer to build up the stamina

170
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
that a detective needs.

171
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,700
Look, Holmes also practiced fencing, right?

172
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,700
That's just a novel, though.

173
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,950
But he's a famous detective that everyone around the world knows!

174
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,450
That's true...

175
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,830
He's incredible!

176
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,750
He's always calm and collected,

177
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,250
overflowing with intelligence and refinement.

178
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,040
And no one can top his abilities of observation and deduction.

179
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,800
Moreover, his violin skills are as good as a professional's.

180
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,720
Sherlock Holmes, created by novelist Sir Conan Doyle,

181
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,010
is the world's greatest detective!

182
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,520
Someone! Catch him! He stole my purse!

183
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,030
Someone! Help!

184
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,570
Outta my way!

185
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,790
Excuse me! Sorry!

186
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,250
Excuse me!

187
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,090
Who the hell are you?

188
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,170
Hina Wada, from Haido High, second year.

189
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,130
It's that girl...

190
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,110
Come on, Ran, let's go and help her!

191
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,330
There's no need! She's got it. Trust me.

192
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
Damn! How dare you mess with me?

193
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,790
Oh? You've got a knife, huh?

194
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,300
Then I'll have to show you what I've got!

195
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,580
Karate?

196
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,800
Shall I keep going?

197
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,690
She's amazing!

198
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,910
That girl seems pretty strong!

199
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,450
Not just seems. She's truly strong!

200
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,130
And that was her first encounter with an unavoidable lifelong rival

201
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,520
after reaching the highest karate level.

202
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,800
Ran Mouri, 16 years old. It happened in the spring.

203
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,880
Sonoko!

204
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,900
Just kidding!

205
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,310
What's with that impromptu narration?

206
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,430
And it's not even spring yet!

207
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,010
So what? It helped set the mood, didn't it?

208
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,910
Besides, it's not my first encounter with her.

209
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,630
What? You know her?

210
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,150
Yeah. We've met several times during competitions.

211
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,800
Anyway, Ran, would you come to my house?

212
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,640
But we are still going to...

213
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,200
You can always make time for a date!

214
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,230
Come on! Let's go!

215
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,610
Wait, Sonoko!

216
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,570
I'm back!

217
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,960
Welcome home, Sonoko-sama.

218
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,850
Here! Come in!

219
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,280
Thank you for having us!

220
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,580
Welcome, Mouri-sama, Kudo-sama.

221
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,010
I got the Soft 'n Fluffy Cheese Tarts

222
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,210
delivered from Hokkaido today.

223
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,650
The cheese tarts with a three-month waiting list to reserve?

224
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,430
Yep! Let's enjoy them together!

225
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,610
Okay! Great!

226
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,020
Are you sure about that?

227
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,470
Eating sweets before the championship?

228
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,620
Don't complain about it if you gain weight.

229
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,520
It's fine. I heard Kazumi-senpai will join us for practice tomorrow.

230
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,870
So I'll take the chance to practice
the basic moves several times more.

231
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,660
Jeez!

232
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,520
What a nagging husband!

233
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,170
Hey, what do you mean, husband?

234
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,640
What's up, Sonoko?

235
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,530
Sorry! We have guests?

236
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,050
Welcome home, Sonoko!

237
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,680
You should knock, first.

238
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,670
It's okay! It's more important to keep the energy up!

239
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,420
So she must be your daughter, right?

240
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,890
Yes. She's my second daughter, Sonoko.

241
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,930
It's a pleasure to meet you.

242
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,550
I'm sorry about her behavior.

243
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,150
She is still lacking in self-awareness
as a successor of the Suzuki Group.

244
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,870
Just leave it to my big sister.

245
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,590
It's a matter of being prepared.

246
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,640
Oh, by the way,

247
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
the two standing behind my daughter

248
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,110
are her friends, Ran Mouri and Shinichi Kudo.

249
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,100
Ran-san's father used to be a police officer

250
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,130
and is now working as a private detective.

251
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,050
Why don't you consult with him
regarding that matter you told me of earlier?

252
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,490
Well...

253
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,990
Which matter was that?

254
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,530
Oh, Sewa-san here is going to hold a party this weekend,

255
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,220
and he came with his wife to invite us to the party.

256
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,640
Unfortunately, I had already

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,310
made plans to take part in a jewel exhibit
at the Beika Museum that day,

258
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,100
so I won't able to go to the party.

259
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,890
Ah? You mean the Black Star exhibit that Mr. Jirokichi talked about?

260
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:54,970
That's right.

261
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,600
However, Sewa-san just told us

262
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,150
that they received a threatening letter
asking them to cancel their party,

263
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,110
otherwise, one of the guests would die during the party.

264
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
I see.

265
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,260
In that case, you should let
this Shinichi Kudo-kun to take care of it.

266
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,910
To tell you the truth,

267
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,740
Shinichi-kun is a high school student
who's solved many difficult cases!

268
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
It might be a little offensive to Ran,

269
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,900
but I think he's a better detective than Ran's father.

270
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,170
If you let me handle this, I think I can help you!

271
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,510
That's certainly promising.

272
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,900
However, we have

273
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,920
taken extra precautions by increasing security and hiring more guards,

274
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,680
so we won't need to trouble you anymore.

275
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,990
Then we'll be excusing ourselves now.

276
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,610
Right?

277
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,300
Yes.

278
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,230
Dear!

279
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,220
What are you doing?

280
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,010
Can't you be more careful?

281
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,970
Oh... Well...

282
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,920
Thanks to you nothing happened.

283
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,880
Miss, thank you!

284
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,830
Not at all.

285
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,340
Ran's such a good girl!

286
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,400
Thank you very much!

287
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,210
You're not injured, are you?

288
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,470
I'm fine! I guess I take after my father, having such a strong body!

289
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,230
You still can't get over what I said? Sorry!

290
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,860
It's not like that! The Mouri family is really amazing!

291
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,220
Come on, Sonoko.

292
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,230
Kudo-kun.

293
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,770
Is something wrong?

294
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,590
No. Nothing.

295
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,740
Wow! This uniform is really nice!

296
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,880
It's made from an extremely lightweight material
that's been newly developed

297
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,500
by our very own Suzuki Group's fabric manufacturer!

298
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,760
In addition, we slightly narrowed the sleeves,

299
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,810
so it fits better and is easier to move around in.

300
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,250
Believe it or not, I'm also a martial arts enthusiast!

301
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,730
But is it okay for me to take it?

302
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,220
Of course!

303
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,360
Actually, I took a tiny part in designing it.

304
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,260
You did?

305
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,590
Yes! Call me Lady Sonoko, the charismatic designer!

306
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,470
As long as you have this uniform on,

307
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,890
you'll win the championship for sure!

308
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,670
This is the power of love!

309
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,910
Ah, about that...

310
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,780
What's the matter?

311
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,710
She can't wear this in the match.

312
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,280
What? Really?

313
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,040
Yes. The match has strict regulations about the uniforms.

314
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,340
I'm sorry, Sonoko. But I'll wear this during practice and do my best!

315
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,850
Then there's nothing we can do. But in return,

316
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,760
you've got to win the competition, or I won't forgive you!

317
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,520
Ma'am, I'm sorry!

318
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,510
That's quite alright.

319
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,020
We can't be there to cheer for you,

320
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,010
but we wish you good luck!

321
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,390
Thank you!

322
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,960
Turns out we didn't get to buy a new phone.

323
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,020
Yeah.

324
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,470
I'll go home after picking up some things for dinner.

325
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,050
Okay. I'll get you a phone some other time.

326
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,490
Mmhm. See you!

327
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,080
Take care!

328
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,780
I left my wallet at your house!

329
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,490
Gosh!

330
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,170
Shinichi!

331
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,490
Shinichi!

332
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,670
I found my wallet. I'm going home now.

333
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,050
Okay.

334
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,200
Wow, there are so many books here.

335
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,970
And all of them are mystery novels.

336
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,730
It must be because your father has read them all

337
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,890
that he was able to become a world-famous mystery writer.

338
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,410
You, however, only turned into a mystery geek.

339
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,730
Will you be quiet?

340
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,480
And on top of that, your mom is the legendary, beautiful actress,

341
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,500
Yukiko Fujimine.

342
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,980
I'm so jealous of you!

343
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,910
What's so good about that?

344
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,670
Hey, I bet your first love was your mom, right?

345
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,270
No! Not at all!

346
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,830
Then who was it?

347
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,300
My first love was...

348
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,050
Who?

349
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,140
She was...

350
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,780
Can't you give me a break, Professor Agasa?

351
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,080
Hahaha! How's it going?

352
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,360
How's your homework coming along?

353
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,580
I thought it was about the time you got sleepy.

354
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,710
So, you're wide awake now, aren't you?

355
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,430
Ouch!

356
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,970
Don't move, Professor!

357
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,080
Sorry!

358
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,590
So, what were you experimenting with this time?

359
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,020
So you really are interested after all!

360
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,090
Well, not really.

361
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,150
Well, since you've asked, I may as well just tell you.

362
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,240
Ta-da!

363
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,970
It's Personal Mobility Rocket! Ta-da!

364
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,190
Stop saying "Ta-da."

365
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,800
When I complete it, not only will it relieve traffic congestion,

366
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,610
it'll also make me rich!

367
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,540
I can prevent accidents and become rich!

368
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,460
Ah... But

369
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,090
it might be worse in that case.

370
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,320
Isn't it basically a missile?

371
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,540
What are you talking about? My inventions are always the safest!

372
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,190
What happened just now was just an accident.

373
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,850
Ah! Whoa! Shinichi!

374
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,870
P-Professor!

375
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,890
Hopeless!

376
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,090
What? You're such a bother! Don't blame me!

377
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,100
I don't wanna go with you, either!

378
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,090
I said yes because Ran asked me to be there!

379
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,670
As a father, being there to support your daughter is your job!

380
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,120
What I'm saying is, don't you have

381
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,520
something much more important coming up before that?

382
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,450
I bet you haven't got any requests for work this month anyway.

383
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,190
Don't you jump to conclusions like that!

384
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,710
I've found three animals this month!

385
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,080
Three animals?!

386
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,580
What is that? A well-known private detective is looking for lost dogs?

387
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,800
Not dogs, but cats!

388
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
Don't underestimate me! The other day...

389
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,410
-I'm home!
-I caught a famous actress having an affair with her producer...

390
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,900
What? It was a case! A big case!

391
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,110
-You think you are a first-class business consultant? How smug!
-I'll call you when dinner is ready, then.

392
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,090
You're just only trying to fool us!

393
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,100
But, why did the president

394
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,120
pick a place which would draw so much attention

395
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,730
as the site to make the deal?

396
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,630
He probably thinks that we won't dare cause any trouble

397
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,360
since it's such a public place.

398
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,630
And even if he brings his people with him,

399
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,370
they can hide in the crowds.

400
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,750
So it's a trap after all.

401
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,370
Bourbon said that the president
also had a connection with the Deisankai.

402
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,280
Hmph, Bourbon?

403
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,170
His nose is as sharp as usual.

404
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,550
Well, even so...

405
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,640
We're aware ahead of time, so it should be okay .

406
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,880
He will be killed eventually anyway.

407
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
(Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium   Main arena
Inter-High Athletic Competition  Karate Tournament)

408
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,030
Stop!

409
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,020
Awesome!

410
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,790
Yeah!

411
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,230
Blue, one upper kick!

412
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,710
Blue won!

413
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,170
-Freestyle Karate  Women's group  Semifinal match one  Blue victory
-Amazing! That's amazing! Ran's amazing!

414
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,400
-Freestyle Karate  Women's group  Semifinal match one Blue victory
-The final round is coming up, Mr. Mouri!

415
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,030
Piece of cake!

416
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,590
After all, Ran inherited the good luck needed to win from me!

417
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,780
But you always fail quickly because you get carried away too soon.

418
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,690
I hope Ran didn't inherit that part from you!

419
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,250
But since Ran is also my daughter, I won't have to worry about that!

420
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,690
Why, you...

421
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,700
Ran! Do your best again in the final!

422
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,000
Speaking of that, where is that guy?

423
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,670
Yes! Yes! Understood!

424
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,250
I'll be right there, captain!

425
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,300
The final match of the freestyle karate,

426
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,260
women's group, will now begin.

427
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,930
Red, Hina Wada, from Haido High.

428
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,720
Ready!

429
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,770
Blue, Ran Mouri, from Teitan High.

430
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,720
Ready!

431
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,350
Begin!

432
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,340
Yes! Yes! That's it! Keep it up!

433
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,220
Easy does it, Ran!

434
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,480
Stop!

435
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,580
Red, mid-body kick, waza-ari!

436
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,980
Continue!

437
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,050
Stop!

438
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,260
What are you doing, Ran?

439
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,890
Ran! Keep your spirit up! Spirit!

440
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,400
Fighting spirit! Fight! Fight!

441
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,900
Ah-haha! Fighting spirit!

442
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,290
Calm down.

443
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,270
Shinichi? What's up?

444
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,500
A...

445
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,610
case...

446
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,020
A case?

447
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,520
Every time!

448
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,610
It's always case, case, case!

449
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,410
You mystery geek!

450
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,230
I want you to end this right now!

451
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,570
I don't have time to waste on your fruitless investigations.

452
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,230
Come on, don't say that.

453
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,610
I'm sure the culprit of this murder

454
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,360
is standing here in the room with us!

455
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,040
In that case, hurry up and point him out!

456
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,550
I already know

457
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,870
who the murderer is.

458
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,870
Oh! Kudo-kun! You are finally here!

459
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,510
Sorry I'm late.

460
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,630
Who is that guy?

461
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,750
He looks quite young!

462
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,140
You don't remember me? We just met the other day at Suzuki's.

463
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,100
Huh? At Suzuki's?

464
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,950
To tell you the truth,

465
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,310
Shinichi-kun is a high school student who's solved many tough cases!

466
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,820
That high school detective?

467
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,900
Mr. Yamazaki, the president of Beika Bank,

468
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,490
was murdered in the guest room of the third-floor in this mansion

469
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,910
right in the middle of the party.

470
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,400
He was stabbed to death.

471
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,290
The room door was locked,

472
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,960
and the key was in Mr. Yamazaki's pocket.

473
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Only the balcony window overlooking the courtyard was open.

474
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,550
In other words,

475
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,890
the murderer snuck in through the balcony window
and killed Mr. Yamazaki in his sleep.

476
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,000
And then he fled through the window again.

477
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,820
But, there weren't any footprints under the window, were there?

478
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,360
Besides, all the rooms around the guest room were locked.

479
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,700
It's true. No footprints were found under the window

480
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,230
and the windows of the surrounding rooms were all locked.

481
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,120
So, how did the murderer get in?

482
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,000
He flew in.

483
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,760
How's that possible?

484
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,220
Hold on!

485
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,960
W-wait, Kudo-kun!

486
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,460
I didn't say he flew in from the sky.

487
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,970
Look, there's a small window on the
opposite side of the guest room window.

488
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,220
That's the window where the murderer jumped in through the guest room.

489
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,640
Nonsense!

490
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,150
Those two windows are at least five meters apart!

491
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,870
How could one jump that far?

492
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,650
Although narrow, there's an overhang

493
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,940
that goes along from the small window to the roof.

494
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,340
If one uses that as a foothold and moves along the edge of the wall,

495
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,170
it's only one or two meters to the balcony.

496
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,580
Therefore, the murderer is one who is intimately familiar
with the unique construction of this mansion,

497
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,110
and one who could move around

498
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,090
the mansion at that time without raising anyone's suspicion.

499
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,590
So, hurry and spill it!

500
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,310
Who killed President Yamazaki?

501
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,530
It was...

502
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,850
you,

503
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,530
Yamazaki's best friend, as well as the master of this house,

504
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,800
Takanori Sewa-san!

505
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,020
Th-That's preposterous!

506
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,270
How could I do that with a leg like this?

507
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,450
I've seen through your trick!

508
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,580
What are you doing, punk?

509
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,340
F-Father?

510
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,450
Master!

511
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,810
H-Honey, your leg...

512
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,220
I noticed this when I first met you at Suzuki's.

513
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,940
When your wheelchair went out of control,

514
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,630
you instinctively used that leg to stop yourself!

515
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,220
Your leg actually healed a long time ago, didn't it?

516
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,510
Darn it all!

517
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,100
Stop!

518
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,270
Don't you run away!

519
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,300
Goal!

520
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,270
Oh, you helped us again, Kudo-kun.

521
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,380
Not a problem.

522
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,570
If you have any tough cases,

523
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,830
feel free to call me, Detective Shinichi Kundo!

524
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,620
Hey, have you heard?

525
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,830
That high school detective solved another case!

526
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,740
Yes! He's so amazing!

527
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,140
He can, most certainly, be called the savior of the Japanese police.

528
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,570
Ow! What did you do that for?

529
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,070
You were grinning and laughing like an idiot.

530
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,640
Ran, are you mad at me or something?

531
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,870
Not at all.

532
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:44,480
Though my dad is out of business because of your popularity,

533
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm not upset about that at all.

534
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,050
But it's not my fault that your dad

535
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,340
is out of business, it's his lack of skills.

536
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,230
That's why

537
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,230
I said I wasn't upset at all!

538
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,860
She's the head of the karate team indeed!

539
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,690
Honestly, even though people keep calling you "famous detective,"

540
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,370
you are simply a mystery geek after all.

541
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,800
But look at all the fan letters I got!

542
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,560
People admire a mystery geek like me!

543
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,420
Oh, is that so?

544
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,910
(To Kudo-kun)

545
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,590
Flirting with girls is fine,

546
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,210
but you need to be serious when you find one you really like.

547
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,260
The one I really like, huh?

548
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,640
Gosh!

549
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,020
What is it?

550
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,790
Why have you been staring at me?

551
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,570
Uh... Nothing.

552
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,180
If you are too obsessed with solving cases,

553
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,950
you may get yourself in danger one day.

554
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,150
Maybe.

555
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,800
But why a detective?

556
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,520
If you are fascinated by mystery novels,

557
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,220
you could easily become a novelist like your dad.

558
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,550
I don't want to write about detectives.

559
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,080
I want to be one!

560
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,710
I wanna be the Sherlock Holmes of the modern day!

561
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,380
The more tough cases there are, the more exciting it is!

562
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,750
As long as you experience once the thrill
and joy when you catch a culprit,

563
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,100
you will never be able to stop!

564
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,810
And that is a detective!

565
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,690
See you!

566
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,360
Wait, Shinichi!

567
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,200
You didn't forget what we're doing tomorrow, did you?

568
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,080
Tomorrow?

569
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,380
You promised

570
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,010
that if I won the karate tournament,

571
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,580
you'd take me to Tropical Land!

572
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,580
Eh? Did I say that?

573
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,410
You did forget!

574
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,890
I didn't want to go with you, anyway!

575
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,820
Why don't you hang out with those fangirls
who wrote you all those letters?

576
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,070
I was kidding! Just kidding!

577
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,880
Don't be mad! Of course I remember.

578
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,890
Tomorrow at 10 a.m., Tropical Land.

579
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,390
There's no way I'd forget that.

580
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,470
It's your treat, too! Don't forget that either!

581
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,280
In that case, it's a little...

582
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,860
Hey! Wait a second! Ran!

583
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,890
Are you kidding? It's been so long since we came back last time,

584
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,660
and we already have to go back before we could see our son?

585
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I put a lot of work into this disguise,

586
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,700
thinking I could surprise Shinichi.

587
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,930
It was such a waste of effort!

588
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:37,430
But we came back this time only to get those old materials.

589
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,580
You can save these disguises for some other time.

590
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,730
Besides, we'd only become a third wheel anyway.

591
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,070
I want to be a third wheel and bug Shinichi so much!

592
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,470
Here. You must be thirsty.

593
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,680
Thank you!

594
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,460
This way! Come on!

595
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,980
Hey, where are we going, Shinichi?

596
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,440
Don't ask. Just follow me!

597
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,800
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

598
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,480
five, four, three, two, one,

599
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
zero!

600
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,790
Wow!

601
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,750
This is amazing! How wonderful!

602
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,760
You like this kind of things, don't you?

603
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,380
Mmhm.

604
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,270
And, one of the things that are so amazing about Holmes

605
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,630
is when he first met his assistant, Watson,
he could tell instantly that he'd been

606
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,450
to Afghanistan as a military doctor just by shaking his hand.

607
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,600
Just like this.

608
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,390
You are a member of a gymnastics team, aren't you?

609
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,300
H-How did you know?

610
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,640
Hey, do you know him?

611
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't.

612
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,010
It's her hand.

613
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,380
For a girl to have all these blisters on her hands,

614
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,660
she must be someone who has practiced the horizontal bar.

615
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,140
But you can get blisters by playing tennis, too.

616
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,000
I was just joking. Actually, when the wind

617
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,470
blew her skirt up earlier, I saw she has

618
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,580
some unique bruises on her thighs that can only be caused

619
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,450
by practicing on the uneven bars.

620
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,590
Never neglecting to observe one's surroundings
is fundamental for a detective.

621
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,620
Don't be so smug!

622
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,080
Isn't it cheating if you knew before you shook her hand?

623
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,520
Hey, you!

624
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,640
Stop flirting with my friend!

625
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,050
Ah? He's your friend?

626
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,770
Yes, he is.

627
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,900
In that case, you can take our places.

628
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,760
No. It's fine.

629
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,670
We don't want to bother those two.

630
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,690
Ran, honestly, since long time ago I've...

631
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,260
Shinichi, me, too!

632
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,720
Shinichi?

633
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:00,830
Shinichi?

634
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,880
Shinichi, hurry up!

635
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,750
Hope you had fun!

636
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,090
Watch your steps!

637
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,360
Man! That was so scary!

638
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,730
I wanna do it again!

639
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,930
And then, that was when Holmes...

640
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,570
There are still seats available. Please.

641
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,780
Do you know that?

642
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,680
Conan Doyle must have wanted to say that.

643
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,370
Holmes is...

644
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,080
That's enough! Will you stop talking about Holmes and Conan Doyle?

645
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,620
You mystery geek!

646
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,380
I've been looking forward to coming here with you, Shinichi.

647
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,080
Why can't you understand my feelings?

648
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,850
Ran...

649
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,060
Well... Actually, I also...

650
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,680
Silly! Why are you getting nervous?

651
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,530
I was obviously kidding!

652
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,600
Darn it!

653
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,470
Ah? Did I really fool you?

654
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,500
You are so easy to trick! I don't think you're detective material!

655
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,540
We're ready to go!

656
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,470
Have fun!

657
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,090
But

658
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,560
it's true that I've been looking forward to this!

659
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,470
Hmph, what is this? We don't even get a turn?

660
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,600
Come on. Off we go.

661
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,940
He asked us to leave.

662
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,550
What? You wanna ride that?

663
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,130
What is it? Water?

664
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:10,940
It's salty.

665
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,440
What is this?

666
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,660
Huh? What?

667
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,800
Hope you had fun!

668
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,700
Watch your steps!

669
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,010
An accident!

670
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,530
Call an ambulance!

671
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,100
And call the police!

672
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,020
Why did Kishida-kun...

673
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,320
Shinichi.

674
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,750
Hmph. What an unlucky guy!

675
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,000
It's an accident anyway.

676
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,180
Just let us leave.

677
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,980
Hold on!

678
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,340
It's not an accident.

679
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,200
It's a murder.

680
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,350
And the murderer is amongst the seven of us who rode

681
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,160
the same coaster as the victim.

682
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,020
Shinichi.

683
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,950
Hmph! I don't have time for this!

684
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,230
Excuse us!

685
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,520
Coming through! Excuse us!

686
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,610
Excuse us! Over here.

687
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,490
Oh, Kudo-kun!

688
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,370
Ah, Ran-kun is also here!

689
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,240
Hi, Inspector Megure.

690
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,740
Kudo!

691
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,230
Oh! So that's the famous high school detective, Shinichi Kudo!

692
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,500
The one who's been solving tough cases one after another!

693
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
He's known as the savior of the Japanese police!

694
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,420
Hey, come here! It's Kudo-kun! Kudo-kun!

695
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,010
Will you show us what you can do?

696
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,670
Well...

697
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:04,920
Oh! Come on!

698
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,560
I see.

699
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:13,570
There's certainly no sign of an accident
or malfunction of any kind on the roller coaster.

700
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,630
And judging from the body, it's highly unlikely that it was a suicide.

701
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,820
Yes, Inspector Megure. That's why it's clearly a murder.

702
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,500
But, who killed him, and how?

703
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,420
Inspector.

704
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,990
We'll have those who rode with the victim remain here.

705
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,950
The rest of you are free to leave.

706
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,720
It's not an accident?

707
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,120
What's going on?

708
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,760
Please stand back!

709
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,310
This coaster has eight seats.

710
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:58,150
Assuming you and Ran are innocent, there are five possible suspects.

711
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:04,240
Riding in the first row were the victim's friends A and B.

712
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,440
Riding next to the victim in the third row

713
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,020
was the victim's friend/lover, C.

714
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:16,620
And lastly, riding behind the victim were the men in black D and E.

715
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,410
But that being the case, everyone was locked in by the safety guard

716
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,840
and couldn't move,

717
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,830
which means only the woman sitting next to him could have killed him.

718
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,590
Wait. It could also be the two men sitting behind him...

719
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,390
Hey! Hurry up!

720
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:39,020
We don't have time to play this detective game with you!

721
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,640
B-Boss...

722
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,450
Sorry for the inconvenience, but we need you to cooperate.

723
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,210
What is that?

724
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,000
This guy has got this murderous look,

725
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,810
as if killing people was a game to him!

726
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,030
Wh-Who is he?

727
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,410
Inspector Megure.

728
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,210
Yes? What is it, Chiba-kun?

729
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,080
We found this

730
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,720
in this woman's purse.

731
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,220
N-No way! I know nothing about this!

732
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,920
A-Aiko! Why did you do such a thing?

733
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,730
No! It wasn't me!

734
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,280
I thought you and Kishida-kun were in love! Why?

735
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,980
You have to believe me! It wasn't me!

736
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,030
Alright! You've found the murderer!

737
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,560
Hurry and let us leave, detective!

738
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,160
Finding the killer was a lot easier than I thought it'd be.

739
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,310
I also think that woman is suspicious.

740
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,480
Is it because they had a fight?

741
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,630
Women are horrible!

742
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,930
Okay. Take that woman in as our prime suspect!

743
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,520
Now, come with us.

744
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,920
Th-This can't be...

745
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,720
And as a precaution,

746
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,620
we'll also need to confirm the identities of the other riders.

747
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,960
It's not a problem, is it?

748
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,350
Hold on, Inspector!

749
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,240
Eh? What's wrong, Kudo-kun?

750
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,170
You've got the wrong suspect.

751
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,170
S-Shinichi?

752
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,120
Kudo-kun.

753
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,170
The one who murdered

754
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,750
Kishida-san on the roller coaster

755
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,050
is you!

756
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,220
W-What?

757
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,580
What are you talking about?

758
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,910
You saw the murder weapon in Aoko's purse!

759
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,050
A knife like that can't sever a human's neck at all,

760
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
much less with a woman's strength.

761
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,750
Besides, if she were the killer,

762
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,920
she would've had plenty of chances to get rid of the weapon.

763
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,660
Why would she wrap it up with a piece of cloth
and hide it in her purse?

764
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,900
It's because you framed Aiko-san!

765
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:17,350
You put the knife in her purse beforehand, didn't you?

766
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,430
Stop talking nonsense!

767
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,420
My seat was separated by another row from Kishida-kun's!

768
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,930
How could I manage to cut off his head?

769
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,050
And you just said it yourself

770
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,060
that it can't be done with a woman's strength!

771
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,950
It's true that a woman alone can't do it.

772
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,780
But, when you factor in the speed of the coaster

773
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,950
and the use of piano wire or steal rope, it's certainly possible.

774
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,210
Inspector Megure, I need all the officers to do me a favor.

775
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,350
I want to reenact the crime.

776
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,710
Oh, of course!

777
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,070
Are you ready, guys?

778
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,480
I'm playing the suspect, Hitomi-san.

779
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,140
And Inspector Megure is playing the victim, Kishida-san.

780
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,930
First, before lowering the safety guard,

781
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,630
you put a bag or something between your back and the back of the seat,

782
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,200
then lowered the guard.

783
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,500
And before the crime, you removed the bag
and freed yourself from the gap.

784
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,200
See? It's easy to get out.

785
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,180
Next, you pulled out a tool such as a piano wire or steel rope

786
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,000
that had a hook-like apparatus attached,

787
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,410
and climbed on the safety guard

788
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,270
and reached back

789
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,260
to place the noose around the victim's neck.

790
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,810
All of this happened in the pitch-black tunnel, of course.

791
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:49,920
And finally, you toss the hook attached to the rope
and hooked it onto the coaster's rails.

792
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,710
Then you could just let the speed and pulling power of the coaster

793
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,990
take care of the rest and rip through the victim's neck!

794
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,380
Th-That's nonsense!

795
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,630
Like I could do that on a fast-moving coaster!

796
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,370
But, you are a gymnast.

797
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,820
The other girls may not be able to do it,

798
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,730
but you, as one who's been trained in your sense of balance,

799
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,590
can surely complete those moves on a coaster.

800
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,920
Hey!

801
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,650
Will you knock this o...

802
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,740
What happened to your necklace-

803
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,380
the pearl necklace you had

804
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,080
around your neck before getting

805
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,890
on the coaster?

806
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,390
You swapped out the thread in your necklace for piano wire

807
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:38,440
and had the hook attached to it hidden in your purse.

808
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:40,750
Wait a second!

809
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,930
If that's what happened,

810
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,830
the two sitting behind Kishida-kun

811
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,410
could also easily do that!

812
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,990
No. Though they appear to be suspicious,

813
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,380
they didn't kill him.

814
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,550
How do you know?

815
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:58,300
I don't know why they'd ride the roller coaster,

816
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,680
and they've been anxious to leave since the police got here.

817
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,800
Their sudden change of attitude is quite suspicious.

818
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,710
But if they were the killers, they should've seen this coming.

819
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,560
That's right. The killer knew that the victim was going to die,

820
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,080
so she cried.

821
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,390
What is it? Water?

822
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,870
It didn't take much time for the coaster
to reach the terminal from the moment

823
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,960
we got out of the tunnel and found out the death of the victim.

824
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:38,060
So, no one except the killer would shed a long trail of tears

825
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,990
while riding the coaster.

826
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:44,530
Then did you see Hitomi crying on the coaster?

827
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,300
Can you prove that?

828
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,180
The traces of her tears are hard evidence!

829
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,270
Only when riding a coaster

830
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,170
can one's tears flow horizontally!

831
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,770
It's... It's all...

832
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,650
It's all his fault!

833
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,080
Because he dumped me!

834
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,090
H-Hitomi, you and Kishida-kun dated each other before?

835
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,590
Yes!

836
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,770
We fell in love long before we met

837
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,970
all of you in college!

838
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,290
But, it was ruined by Aiko...

839
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,940
that woman...

840
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,570
That's why... That's why...

841
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,560
I decided to use the necklace he gave to me
to kill him on the roller coaster

842
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,560
which we rode on our first date,

843
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,130
and

844
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,880
to pin the crime on Aiko!

845
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:03,740
Later, a large quantity of sleeping pills was found in her purse.

846
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,340
Apparently she wanted to commit suicide after killing Kishida-san.

847
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:15,970
Two hours later, the necklace used as a murder weapon
was located in the tunnel.

848
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,940
The thread, as I thought, was swapped out for piano wire.

849
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,830
The pearls scattered everywhere.

850
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:26,460
The few still left on the thread basked
in the setting sun, giving off a faint glow,

851
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,340
almost as if they were huge teardrops.

852
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:43,960
Come on. Stop crying.

853
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,900
You sure can stay calm!

854
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,120
I'm used to a crime scene like that.

855
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,720
Once, I even saw a dismembered body.

856
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,320
That's horrible!

857
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,310
Well, it's best to get it out of your mind.

858
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,660
Because this kind of thing happens all the time.

859
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,100
It does not!

860
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,700
That guy!

861
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,520
One of the suspicious men who just rode the coaster!

862
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,300
You are the one who told me that
nothing would happen at an amusement park...

863
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,040
I'm sorry, Ran, just go home without me.

864
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,200
I'll catch up with you in a bit!

865
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,160
Shinichi!

866
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,580
He's gone!

867
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:34,380
Shinichi!

868
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,890
Somehow, I had a horrible feeling at that moment

869
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:46,920
that I might never see Shinichi again...

870
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,210
Damn... I lost him!

871
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,310
Sorry for the wait, Mr. President.

872
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,930
There he is!

873
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,910
A-As promised, I came here alone.

874
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:10,880
Yeah. I know you came here alone.

875
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,390
I confirmed it from the rollercoaster.

876
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,560
Hurry up and give it to me!

877
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,470
What's the rush? Show me the money first.

878
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,270
Here! Will this shut you up?

879
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,570
Wow! That could easily be a hundred million Yen!

880
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,150
Good! Deal accepted.

881
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,070
Now, give me the film!

882
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,080
Film?

883
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,080
Here!

884
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,880
Those are all the photos and recordings that could be taken
as evidence of your company smuggling weapons.

885
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,030
I suggest you quit that bad business.

886
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,870
Shut it! It's nothing compared to what your organization is doing!

887
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:54,220
Hey! Exactly what do you know about us?

888
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,930
Ah... Nothing!

889
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:01,630
I've made it clear that the one hundred million
you've paid is for your own life.

890
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,230
If you get that, you should shut down your company
and disappear immediately!

891
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:11,130
We are going to build a new lab on that piece of land!

892
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,590
Okay!

893
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,910
Oh, man! Seriously?

894
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,170
The detective game is over!

895
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,910
Boss!

896
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:35,650
You idiot! You were followed by this kid!

897
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,930
Isn't he the detective from earlier?

898
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,520
Damn! Let's kill him!

899
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,600
Wait!

900
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,640
With that death that just happened, the cops should still be around.

901
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,320
Then what should we do?

902
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,650
Use this.

903
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,340
This is the poison newly developed by our organization.

904
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,670
It leaves no traces that can be detected in the body,

905
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,450
making a perfect crime possible.

906
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,600
Although, it's only a prototype drug yet to be tested on humans.

907
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,410
Boss, we have to go now!

908
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,560
Okay.

909
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,800
So long, famous detective.

910
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,370
Damn! My body's burning up!

911
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,820
If feels like my bones are melting!

912
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:58,800
Damn it! I'm dying!

913
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,720
Hey! Get over here!

914
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,130
It's a dead body!

915
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:17,910
What?

916
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,180
Am I really dead?

917
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,030
No! He's still breathing!

918
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,490
Hurry! Call an ambulance!

919
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,150
I'm alive?

920
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:30,750
I see! That drug must not work on humans!

921
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,340
Lucky me!

922
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,520
How awful! His head is bleeding!

923
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,860
The police?

924
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,250
So many of them!

925
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,350
Alright! I'll tell the cops what happened!

926
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,410
Hey! Hang in there!

927
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,730
Can you stand up,

928
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,100
little boy?

929
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,310
Huh?

930
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,670
Are you okay, little boy?

931
01:02:58,670 --> 01:02:59,700
Little boy?

932
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,960
What is he talking about?

933
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,690
I'm a second-year high schooler!

934
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,700
How did you get the wound on your head?

935
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:09,200
Wound? Oh, right!

936
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,340
I was hit from behind by that man in black.

937
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,010
Ow!

938
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:19,960
Huh?

939
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,310
Wh-What happened to my clothes?

940
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,060
You must be scared, little boy.

941
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,940
But we are here now. So, don't worry!

942
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,430
Th-This man lifted me up with such ease...

943
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:40,200
Yes. We found a young boy with cranial injuries
near the ferris wheel and we've taken him into our care.

944
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,360
We'll send him to the medical room now.

945
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:48,080
He looks about six or seven years old.
I think he's an elementary schooler.

946
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:51,500
An elementary schooler? Who?

947
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,380
I'm home.

948
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,840
Oh! Ran, you're back!

949
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,680
Come on, dad! You made a mess again!

950
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,030
That's why you don't have any clients,

951
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,320
and why my mom ran out on you!

952
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,930
Stop it! I'm just being selective!

953
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,190
Speaking of that, where's that high school detective guy?

954
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,310
Weren't you with him today?

955
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,700
I'll catch up with you in a bit!

956
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,490
What happened exactly, Shinichi?

957
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,040
Haha! You had a fight, didn't you?

958
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,130
Well, just get over him!

959
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:32,750
Detectives are usually bad people anyway!

960
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,050
But you're also a detective, dad.

961
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,250
I've told you that.

962
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,460
I saw them!

963
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,260
A weapons smuggler and a blackmailer!

964
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,900
But the blackmailer's partner found me.

965
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,760
He attacked me from behind and wounded my head.

966
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,480
Hey, little boy.

967
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,390
You watch too many police dramas.

968
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,320
I'm not a little boy! I'm an 11th grader!

969
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,160
So strange.

970
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,870
What happened to me?

971
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:16,540
We just checked, but no one called in for a missing child.

972
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,420
Those people's reactions...

973
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,380
These baggy clothes...

974
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:22,800
And...

975
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:25,810
my voice...

976
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,660
Damn! How could it be possible?

977
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:34,410
No! No matter how impossible it seems,

978
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,770
only one truth will...

979
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,780
What's going on?

980
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,750
It can't be! My body has actually shrunk!

981
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,070
Like I said, he doesn't want to go home,
and he's been telling wild stories.

982
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,760
In that case, it's highly possible that he ran away from home.

983
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,490
Anyway, let's report this to HQ first.

984
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,000
We'll have to send him to the police child care center.

985
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,360
C-Child care center?

986
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,440
Okay, little boy, we...

987
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,180
H-He's gone!

988
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,780
The window! He escaped through the window!

989
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,370
You've got to be kidding me!

990
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,840
Like I'd let you put me in a place like that!

991
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,700
Hey! Little boy!

992
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,710
It's huge!

993
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,870
There he is! This way!

994
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,350
Damn!

995
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,460
Stop running, little boy!

996
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,180
Jeez! I'm not a criminal, okay?

997
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,820
Hey, little boy!

998
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,950
Hey!

999
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,150
Hey! Did you see him?

1000
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,240
Ran!

1001
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,870
Great! If I have Ran come here and pick me up...

1002
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,750
But with my current voice

1003
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,880
and this body...

1004
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,050
Damn!

1005
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,080
Got it! At least I can text her!

1006
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:31,100
But who would believe an uncanny thing like this?

1007
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,220
If you are too obsessed with solving cases,

1008
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,440
you may get yourself in danger one day.

1009
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,110
Go search over there!

1010
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,550
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

1011
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,240
"Hi, this is Kudo.

1012
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,430
I'm not available at the moment.

1013
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,680
please leave a message after the beep."

1014
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,480
He's not home, either.

1015
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:19,680
I bet he's having dinner with his father, that famous novelist!

1016
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:24,720
What are you talking about? Shinichi's parents
relocated in the U.S. three years ago.

1017
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,150
Shinichi lives by himself.

1018
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,190
Oh. I see.

1019
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:37,200
Something must have happened to him!

1020
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:40,900
I'm going to Shinichi's!

1021
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:41,450
Hey!

1022
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,010
What about my dinner?

1023
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,910
A short run already has me

1024
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,300
panting like this!

1025
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,960
And what on earth

1026
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,120
happened to my body?

1027
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,180
Wait! I remember after

1028
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,500
he attacked me...

1029
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,520
This is the poison newly developed by our organization.

1030
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:36,140
Although, it's only a prototype drug yet to be tested on humans.

1031
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,300
Is it because I took that drug?

1032
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,440
Seriously?

1033
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:53,440
Are you stupid, standing in the middle of the road like that?

1034
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,950
Watch out, you damn kid!

1035
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,270
Damn kid!

1036
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,450
How embarrassing!

1037
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,050
Shoot!

1038
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:43,420
Shoot! I can't even get into my own house?

1039
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,800
I can't do anything like this, can I?

1040
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,380
Oh, no! This is bad!

1041
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:00,550
Professor Agasa!

1042
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,550
Who are you?

1043
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,790
It's me! Shinichi!

1044
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:11,030
What? So you are a child relative of Shinichi's?

1045
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,360
You know, you look just like Shinichi when he was your age!

1046
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,000
No! I am Shinichi!

1047
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,660
Shinichi Kudo, the 11th grader at Teitan High School!

1048
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,610
Hey, Shinichi! You've got a visitor!

1049
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,110
Argh! You still don't believe me!

1050
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,560
Ouch!

1051
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,720
Hey, are you okay?

1052
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,330
Now, here's what I know about you!

1053
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,970
Professor Agasa, 52 years old,

1054
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,390
an eccentric inventor who lives next door.

1055
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,360
You may call yourself a genius,

1056
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,400
but you've invented nothing but junk!

1057
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,850
Even worse, you have a mole on your butt
with a hair growing out of it.

1058
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,320
My butt...

1059
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:54,320
No one but Shinichi knows that secret of mine!

1060
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,370
I can't believe

1061
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,860
he told my secret to you!

1062
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,410
That's not it! I am Shinichi!

1063
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,360
I was drugged and my body shrank!

1064
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,870
What? Drugged? Shrank?

1065
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:09,780
Yes.

1066
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,420
A drug?

1067
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,680
If there's such a drug,

1068
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:19,510
I'd love to see it for myself!

1069
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,590
Come with me, you little liar!

1070
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,430
I'll take you to the police!

1071
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,980
Then... Then how about this?

1072
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:30,860
Professor, you just got back from Columbo restaurant, right?

1073
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,880
And in quite a hurry.

1074
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,890
How... How did you know that?

1075
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:39,880
Your clothes, Professor. The front is all wet,

1076
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,320
but not the back.

1077
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,820
Because you ran back in the rain.

1078
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,380
In addition, you have mud splashed on your pants.

1079
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,360
What?

1080
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,890
The only muddy road in this neighborhood

1081
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:53,210
is front of Columbo restaurant, which is under construction.

1082
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:59,590
Furthermore, you have the distinctive color
of Columbo's specialty meat sauce on your mustache.

1083
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,340
So...you are really...

1084
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,600
It's only an initial judgment, Mr. Agasa!

1085
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,690
S-Shinichi?

1086
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,940
Are you really Shinichi?

1087
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,850
Haven't I told you so? I was drugged and my body shrank!

1088
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,020
It's still hard to believe!

1089
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:23,970
Scientifically speaking, such thing is impossible...

1090
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,820
But since you were right about my butt...

1091
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:30,240
Anyway, let me get inside first!

1092
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,580
What? A weapons smuggler?

1093
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,250
Yeah.

1094
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:45,600
And then I saw a guy was blackmailing him.

1095
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,510
So they drugged you to keep your mouth shut?

1096
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,950
I see.

1097
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:56,140
So basically, a strange side effect of the incomplete drug

1098
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:59,450
made your body shrink!

1099
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,650
Pretty much!

1100
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,240
Professor, please! You are a genius, right?

1101
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,580
Could you make a drug to turn me back to normal?

1102
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,290
Don't be absurd!

1103
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,590
I know nothing about the composition of that drug...

1104
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,590
Oh, boy! My childhood clothes fit me perfectly!

1105
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:24,900
Then I'll just need to track down their whereabouts

1106
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,170
and get a sample of that drug.

1107
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,770
Yes. If we had that drug, I might be able to do something with it.

1108
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:37,060
But, Shinichi, you can't tell anyone else about your accident!

1109
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,900
Eh? Why?

1110
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,950
If they find out

1111
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,630
you are still alive and you are Shinichi Kudo,

1112
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,560
they'll surely come for you again.

1113
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:50,660
In that case, it'll put those around you in danger, as well.

1114
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,930
Remember, the fact that you are Shinichi Kudo

1115
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,920
is a secret between only you and me!

1116
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,130
No one else can know about this!

1117
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,640
Not even Ran-kun, of course!

1118
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,940
Okay. I got it!

1119
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,370
Shinichi! Are you home?

1120
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,260
Jeez! If you are home, at least pick up the phone!

1121
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,280
And you didn't even lock your door!

1122
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,250
It... It's Ran!

1123
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,410
Oh, no! Go hide!

1124
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,410
Hide... Where?

1125
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,820
Oh! Professor Agasa?

1126
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,740
Ah! Long time no see, Ran!

1127
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,970
Where's Shinichi?

1128
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:45,400
Well...he was just here.

1129
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:46,500
Well...

1130
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,260
-My father's glasses! It could be a disguise.
-He rushed out for a case.

1131
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:58,230
Who's this boy?

1132
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,230
Well...this kid...

1133
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:05,000
What a shy boy!

1134
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,260
Hey, turn around!

1135
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,740
This is bad...

1136
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,370
Th-This kid...

1137
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,590
Crap!

1138
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:22,250
You're so cute!

1139
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,990
Her chest!

1140
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:29,330
Professor, who is this boy?

1141
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:34,220
Well, he's the child of a distant relative of mine.

1142
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,040
How old are you?

1143
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,720
16... Oh, no! 6!

1144
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,200
Oh, so you are a first grader!

1145
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,350
Mmm!

1146
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,520
What's your name?

1147
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,590
My name is Shin... No...

1148
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,150
Um...

1149
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,960
Well, my name is...

1150
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,720
Conan!

1151
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:59,410
Eh?

1152
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,870
My name is Conan Edogawa!

1153
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:08,080
Crap! It just slipped right out of my mouth!

1154
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,850
Conan? What an unusual name!

1155
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:15,720
B-Because my father is a big fan of Conan Doyle, so...

1156
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,720
He looks a little like Shinichi.

1157
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,730
Doyle would work...

1158
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,720
Professor.

1159
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,410
But why Conan? You're not a foreigner!

1160
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:27,930
She caught me off guard!

1161
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,280
I couldn't think of anything else!

1162
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,310
Oh, right! Ran,

1163
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:40,880
could you help me babysit him at your house for a while?

1164
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:41,470
Huh?

1165
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,520
You've got to be kiddi...

1166
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,970
His parents had an accident and were hospitalized.

1167
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,310
Though they asked me to watch over him,

1168
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:50,840
I'm just a man living by myself...

1169
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,980
Well, I think it's fine, but I have to ask my dad.

1170
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,280
Really?

1171
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,370
So you agree!

1172
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,070
Ow!

1173
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,040
You want me to stay with Ran? What if she finds out who I really am?

1174
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,390
Okay, listen.

1175
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:17,860
Those men will sooner or later find out that you are not dead.

1176
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,120
And when that happens, they'll first suspect the people
who have access to this house!

1177
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:26,650
Then why can't I stay with you?

1178
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,870
If you wanna get back to normal,

1179
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:32,800
you'll have to find the men who drugged you, right?

1180
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,880
Well, that's true...

1181
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:38,180
Ran's family runs a detective agency.

1182
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,520
Oh, right! They might get some information!

1183
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,190
There you go!

1184
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,940
Excuse me, Professor.

1185
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,890
Yay! I wanna go home with you!

1186
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:53,890
He's so cute!

1187
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,910
Professor, please have Shinichi call me when he comes back home.

1188
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,790
Okay, I will.

1189
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,390
Bye, uncle! Bye-bye!

1190
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,910
See you, Conan-kun!

1191
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,270
It's all up to you now, Shinichi.

1192
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:17,150
Oh, no! Conan Edogawa-kun.

1193
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,930
Hey, Conan-kun.

1194
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:26,940
Conan-kun?

1195
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,550
What's up, Ran-neechan?

1196
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,060
I'm really not used to this name!

1197
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,560
Do you have someone you like?

1198
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,350
Eh?

1199
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:44,010
I mean, is there someone at school you are fond of?

1200
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,030
No. Not really.

1201
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,460
I have one.

1202
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,950
And I like him a lot.

1203
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,600
Well, by any chance

1204
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,960
is it that guy called Shinichi you were looking for?

1205
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:05,470
Correct!

1206
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,070
He's always been naughty,

1207
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,400
full of himself and a big mystery geek,

1208
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:17,350
but he can be very dependable, brave and cool

1209
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,640
at critical moments.

1210
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,490
I really like Shinichi!

1211
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,470
You need to keep it a secret, though!

1212
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,670
Okay!

1213
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,130
I've only told this to you, Conan!

1214
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,990
You can't tell Shinichi. Got it?

1215
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,370
Okay!

1216
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,770
This is my home.

1217
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,940
It feels like I suddenly have a cute younger brother,

1218
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,500
to whom I can tell everything!

1219
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,580
Ran...

1220
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:57,010
I think my dad is home. Let me introduce him to you.

1221
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,810
Wait! Ran...

1222
01:20:58,820 --> 01:20:59,430
Huh?

1223
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,320
Actually, I...

1224
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:05,280
What is it?

1225
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,690
I'm actually...

1226
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,250
Fantastic!

1227
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,290
What's the matter, dad?

1228
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,490
It's here! It's here! It's here!

1229
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,560
A job! I've finally got a request in six months!

1230
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,430
Hey! It's dangerous! What is the request?

1231
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:33,050
A rich family's daughter was kidnapped

1232
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,760
by some men in black!

1233
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,320
Men in black?

1234
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:43,820
Conan-kun!

1235
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,000
Just you wait and see, you men in black!

1236
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,510
Once I've tracked down your whereabouts

1237
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:59,350
and got a sample of that drug, I can change my body back

1238
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:05,060
and I'll expose all your evildoings!

1239
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,650
Thus, in order to obtain information on the men in black,

1240
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:17,750
I came to stay with Ran, whose father worked as a detective.

1241
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:22,220
But her father turned out to be a terrible detective.

1242
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:26,590
Unable to stand it, I started impersonating her father

1243
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:31,580
and managed to solve tough cases
one after another with the help of my natural

1244
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,410
deductive reasoning and the gadgets Professor Agasa invented.

1245
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:44,920
I didn't expect that Narumi-sensei planned on
dying from the very beginning...

1246
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,400
Narumi-sensei!

1247
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:50,470
No, Conan-kun!

1248
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,500
Let me go, Ran-neechan!

1249
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,280
What's that sound?

1250
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,460
It's the code.

1251
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:05,150
He's playing it in the flames.

1252
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,160
You idiot!

1253
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,830
There's no winning or losing

1254
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,180
when it comes to deduction!

1255
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:22,230
Because only one truth will prevail!

1256
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,450
Hey, Hattori.

1257
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,840
Have you ever killed someone?

1258
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,280
You idiot...

1259
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,420
A detective who corners a murderer

1260
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,350
with their deductions and watches him commit suicide

1261
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:44,080
is no different from that murderer.

1262
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:48,420
Hattori, when you have ruled out the impossible,

1263
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,970
whatever remains, however improbable,

1264
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,130
must be the truth.

1265
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:59,170
I told you this would be your last chance!

1266
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,680
Masami-san!

1267
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,900
Ran-neechan, hurry and call an ambulance!

1268
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,250
And inform uncle and the others!

1269
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:10,260
Alright!

1270
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,200
It doesn't matter.

1271
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,390
It's too late.

1272
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:19,990
Don't talk. If you do, your wound will...

1273
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,250
Little boy...

1274
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:28,030
you are with that detective agency, right?

1275
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,380
"Organization"?

1276
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,940
Yes. It's a large, mysterious organization.

1277
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,000
As one who's at the lowest rank, all I know is

1278
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,190
that the color of the organization is black. That's it.

1279
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:47,480
Black...

1280
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,050
That's right.

1281
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:58,020
Those in the organization prefer wearing clothes as black as crows.

1282
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,060
Could it be?

1283
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,220
The men in black?

1284
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,440
I'll leave the rest to you...

1285
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,770
Little...detective.

1286
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:16,500
He's been given all kinds of names,

1287
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:20,740
such as the Modern-Day Lupin, or the Moonlight Magician.

1288
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,870
But there's one that's better-known than the rest.

1289
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:27,380
Better-known?

1290
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:31,020
Because he leads the police of many nations
by the nose, as though playing games.

1291
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:36,350
A certain young novelist with an interest in Kaitou No. 1412

1292
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,210
looked at the number and read it like this,

1293
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,260
"K I D."

1294
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,990
K I D?

1295
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,140
Wait... So...

1296
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,280
That's right!

1297
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,340
Kaitou No. 1412.

1298
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:56,810
People call him

1299
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:00,790
Kaitou Kid!

1300
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,840
Seems like you are no ordinary kid, boy.

1301
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:16,280
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

1302
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,560
Yes. That's right.

1303
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,970
I'm on my way to the shoot location for the drama.

1304
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,200
It's a wrap once we are done shooting this scene.

1305
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:33,860
And then I can go find you.

1306
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,360
My job is to help Pisco out and to make sure he won't fail, right?

1307
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:40,360
I have something to do there, anyway.

1308
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,250
And I want to meet him, too!

1309
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,920
I'm hanging up now.

1310
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,970
I gotta lose the FBI's kitty.

1311
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,890
Let's meet there, Gin.

1312
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,260
Shoot! Move it!

1313
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:26,490
Out of my way!

1314
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:27,550
Move it!

1315
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,750
It's no use.

1316
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,340
But, Shuu...

1317
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,970
You can never catch up to her with your driving skills.

1318
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,710
But don't worry. I know where she's going.

1319
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,020
Eh? Where?

1320
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,150
Japan.

1321
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,640
(Two Months Later)

1322
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:46,070
(Shinichi, where are you? Please contact me!
Contact me as soon as you see this!)

1323
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,280
(Shin-chan's kid clothes)

1324
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,830
Conan Edogawa?

1325
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:45,430
You know, the boy with glasses! The one I mentioned to you before!

1326
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:47,390
And you said you'd go

1327
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,940
visit someone in the Beika district.

1328
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,600
Yeah. Shinichi Kudo.

1329
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:58,100
Yeah. That's the boy with the detective agency
in the same neighborhood.

1330
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:00,230
So what's with that boy?

1331
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,610
Something's not right!

1332
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,380
He's really calm and collected for a child,

1333
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,040
almost like an adult.

1334
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,000
Oh, I see!
