1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.470
"Kometo Brigde"

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.070
This river...

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.370
dries up during this season.

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.470
What a dirty bridge.

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.970
The railing is completely black.

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.170
So, what is it you want to talk to me about?

7
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.070
Oh, there's something I want to show you right across the bridge.

8
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.870
Gosh, I tell you

9
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.770
I want to go to the shopping arcade in front of the station.

10
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.570
I'm sorry, it won't take long.

11
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.570
What's up, gramps?

12
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.370
Hey, what's that?

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.270
What's that?

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.670
A canvas stained black with crime.

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.070
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.170
A glowing toy leads to a case.

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.370
A chance meeting causes a miracle.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.070
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:56.928 --> 00:03:01.828
"Wonder Boy"

22
00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.528
Hey, you guys.

23
00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.528
Are you going to look for UFOs again tonight?

24
00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:12.228
Of course, we've already been going for two days.

25
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:14.528
There was nothing those two days though.

26
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.528
That's why we think it'll come around tonight.

27
00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:19.128
-That's right. -That's right.

28
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.328
UFOs...

29
00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:24.628
Oh, you don't believe us, after all.

30
00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:26.928
Since this month there've already

31
00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:29.128
been three eye-witness reports, three, you know?

32
00:03:29.128 --> 00:03:32.428
And all of them were near Kometo Bridge here.

33
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.328
A thing that glowed goldenly

34
00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.328
seems to have flown through the riverbed at tremendous speed.

35
00:03:37.328 --> 00:03:38.828
Yes, that's right.

36
00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:39.928
There are people saying

37
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.828
they've seen extraterrestrials at the riverbed, too.

38
00:03:41.828 --> 00:03:45.028
We, as members of the Detective Squad, cannot overlook this.

39
00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:47.628
That's not the job of a detective, is it?

40
00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:50.328
Anyway, we're going through with it tonight, too.

41
00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:52.628
Aye!

42
00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.728
Look, the curtains of "Nagai Toy Shop" are open.

43
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.728
Maybe they're going to be opening the shop again?

44
00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:05.628
It won't open.

45
00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:09.528
They closed quite some time ago.

46
00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:11.828
I came here several times, too.

47
00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:15.728
A kind looking grandpa and grandma used to run this shop.

48
00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:19.428
But there wasn't much of anything I wanted,

49
00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:22.228
because all the toys were of the olden days.

50
00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:26.628
Hey, what're you doing? Let's go.

51
00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.928
Yeah.

52
00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:31.928
Your hands are smeared with ice cream.

53
00:04:31.928 --> 00:04:33.628
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:35.828
Gosh, I'm all sticky.

55
00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.228
"Tsutomu Oshiro (30)" -I tell you, even shops like this...

56
00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:43.528
"Kuromaru Finance Employee" -are still of some interest to kids.

57
00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:45.228
That boy wearing glasses was

58
00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:48.028
staring with great interest at this locomotive.

59
00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:49.128
Hey, don't!

60
00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:50.228
Don't touch it.

61
00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.628
Don't scare me. I dropped it.

62
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.328
"Tokujiro Nagai (72)" -Never mind that stuff already.

63
00:04:57.328 --> 00:05:00.728
"Owner of Nagai Toy Shop" -This is something my wife treasured.

64
00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:04.628
Anyway, sell this shop and make money.

65
00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:06.928
I can't wait any longer.

66
00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:11.628
Okay, I'll do as you say.

67
00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:12.728
Really?

68
00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:14.628
Yeah. But in exchange for that,

69
00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:17.828
will you at least offer incense to the altar?

70
00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:21.328
I can't be doing something like that.

71
00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:24.528
I see. I got it, then.

72
00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:27.028
Oh, right. Take this with you.

73
00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:29.428
You like liquor, don't you?

74
00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:33.328
Is it okay? Isn't that expensive Scotch?

75
00:05:33.328 --> 00:05:36.828
I bought it when I went on a trip to Britain with my wife.

76
00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:39.128
I stopped drinking, you see.

77
00:05:40.828 --> 00:05:42.528
Thank you.

78
00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:46.928
This is good stuff.

79
00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:51.528
I'll come again with the documents, then.

80
00:05:51.528 --> 00:05:53.028
See you.

81
00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:01.928
Gosh, that brat.

82
00:06:05.828 --> 00:06:08.328
What? Are you going out, too?

83
00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:10.528
I have something to talk to you about.

84
00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:12.128
Come with me, will you?

85
00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:13.228
Talk to me?

86
00:06:13.228 --> 00:06:15.228
Sure, I guess.

87
00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:20.828
"Kometo Brigde" -This river...

88
00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:24.328
dries up during this season.

89
00:06:24.328 --> 00:06:27.328
What a dirty bridge.

90
00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:29.928
The railing's completely black.

91
00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:32.128
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

92
00:06:32.128 --> 00:06:35.828
Oh, there's something I want to show you across the bridge.

93
00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.628
Gosh, I tell you

94
00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:41.828
I want to go to the shopping arcade in front of the station.

95
00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:44.528
I'm sorry, it won't take long.

96
00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:50.428
This way!

97
00:06:50.428 --> 00:06:52.628
That's unmistakably a UFO.

98
00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:55.428
It came flying over from the bridge and landed.

99
00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:58.828
Really? I didn't see anything.

100
00:06:58.828 --> 00:07:00.728
I didn't either.

101
00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:05.028
It was around here that the lights went out.

102
00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:06.728
Okay, let's start searching!

103
00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:08.128
-Aye! -Aye!

104
00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:09.928
It's along the wall, I'm sure.

105
00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:12.228
Along the wall? It's a UFO.

106
00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:14.928
What's this?

107
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.028
This is...

108
00:07:18.028 --> 00:07:20.028
Why is something like this over here?

109
00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:24.228
Hey, Edogawa?

110
00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:29.128
You guys stay away!

111
00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:33.828
Haibara, call the police.

112
00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:34.828
All right.

113
00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:41.328
The victim is Tsutomu Oshiro, age 30.

114
00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:45.228
It seems he worked at Kuromaru Finance in Haido.

115
00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.528
A loan shark debt collector?

116
00:07:47.528 --> 00:07:49.428
Yes, probably.

117
00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:51.528
According to the security camera of the shopping arcade,

118
00:07:51.528 --> 00:07:53.528
at about 4:00 pm, he went out of the station,

119
00:07:53.528 --> 00:07:54.928
walked through the shopping arcade

120
00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:57.428
and headed directly over this way.

121
00:07:57.428 --> 00:08:01.228
It's most likely that he came around here to collect debts.

122
00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:02.728
I see.

123
00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:04.328
Judging from the circumstances,

124
00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:06.428
it's likely he got drunk

125
00:08:06.428 --> 00:08:09.528
and fell off this bridge.

126
00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:13.028
But just in case, go check on Kuromaru Finance tomorrow.

127
00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:14.828
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.628
So you guys in order to look for UFOs

129
00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:18.928
came here?

130
00:08:18.928 --> 00:08:20.128
Yes...

131
00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:21.928
Did you hear any suspicious sounds

132
00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:24.628
or see any suspicious characters back then?

133
00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:26.128
Thanks everyone.

134
00:08:26.128 --> 00:08:27.328
By the looks of it,

135
00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:29.728
it's most likely an accident.

136
00:08:29.728 --> 00:08:31.028
After the investigation is done...

137
00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:32.728
Hey, Inspector Megure.

138
00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:37.928
There's a printout for a half-price discount ticket

139
00:08:37.928 --> 00:08:41.128
for a ramen shop in this person's wallet.

140
00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:43.228
What about it?

141
00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.828
To have printed it out like this and bring it along with him,

142
00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:49.428
he must've really wanted to eat ramen at Shinobiya.

143
00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.328
But it's strange, isn't it?

144
00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:53.128
This bridge doesn't lead

145
00:08:53.128 --> 00:08:56.528
to Shinobiya Ramen near the station shopping center.

146
00:08:56.528 --> 00:09:00.128
Maybe he was planning to go on another day.

147
00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:04.228
No, this discount ticket is only valid till today.

148
00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:09.028
Which means he was planning to drop by after work.

149
00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:12.028
If so, it's strange after all,

150
00:09:12.028 --> 00:09:13.728
that he would go pass here.

151
00:09:14.928 --> 00:09:19.028
If he finished work, he wouldn't have gone by this road.

152
00:09:19.028 --> 00:09:20.328
And if he wasn't finished,

153
00:09:20.328 --> 00:09:22.828
he wouldn't have been drinking either.

154
00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:25.128
This is...

155
00:09:32.228 --> 00:09:33.828
Who is it?

156
00:09:52.528 --> 00:09:53.928
Who is it?

157
00:10:17.194 --> 00:10:19.194
What's the matter at this hour of the night?

158
00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:23.194
I live near here but forgot my house key

159
00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:24.994
and can't get inside.

160
00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:27.194
Where are your mother and father?

161
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:28.694
They're not home.

162
00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:31.594
May I stay here until they come back?

163
00:10:31.594 --> 00:10:32.894
Here?

164
00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:35.694
No, sorry, I don't think...

165
00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:38.894
Somebody died at Kometo Bridge.

166
00:10:38.894 --> 00:10:40.094
A person?

167
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:43.494
That explains the sirens I heard.

168
00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:45.994
A murder, it seems.

169
00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:48.694
It's gotten dangerous around here.

170
00:10:48.694 --> 00:10:51.094
Okay, come in.

171
00:10:51.094 --> 00:10:53.894
If just for a little while you can wait here.

172
00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:55.394
Thank you.

173
00:10:59.694 --> 00:11:01.794
What're you doing?

174
00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.094
Come in.

175
00:11:06.094 --> 00:11:08.994
This flashing boomerang is nostalgic, isn't it?

176
00:11:08.994 --> 00:11:11.994
I haven't seen it around recently.

177
00:11:12.994 --> 00:11:14.894
Did it broke?

178
00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:18.794
Yeah. It was on the shelf, but it dropped.

179
00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:20.494
The shelf, you mean there?

180
00:11:20.494 --> 00:11:21.894
Right.

181
00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:25.794
I tried to take it but dropped it.

182
00:11:27.494 --> 00:11:29.594
Do you live here alone, Grandpa?

183
00:11:29.594 --> 00:11:32.894
Yeah. My wife died last year.

184
00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:35.494
She was in the hospital

185
00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.694
because of a difficult illness.

186
00:11:37.694 --> 00:11:39.994
Were you alone all this time?

187
00:11:39.994 --> 00:11:41.094
Yeah.

188
00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:45.794
Did someone come to see you today?

189
00:11:45.794 --> 00:11:48.194
No, nobody came.

190
00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:50.694
Were you here all this time?

191
00:11:50.694 --> 00:11:53.794
Yeah, I was here all day today.

192
00:12:01.494 --> 00:12:04.594
What are you doing, sonny?

193
00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:06.894
Does your shoulder hurt, Grandpa?

194
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.194
From about six months ago.

195
00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:12.594
When I try to raise my arm, it hurts really bad.

196
00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:15.494
But how'd you know?

197
00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:18.794
The lower part of this shelf is clean,

198
00:12:18.794 --> 00:12:21.294
but the upper part is full of dust, right?

199
00:12:21.294 --> 00:12:24.794
So, I thought maybe you can't raise your arm.

200
00:12:24.794 --> 00:12:27.094
It's exactly as you say, sonny.

201
00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:30.194
Cleaning the upper shelf is hard.

202
00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:32.994
Then, you can't take the locomotive, can you?

203
00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:36.894
-What? -That shelf is up pretty high.

204
00:12:36.894 --> 00:12:40.594
How did you take the locomotive if your shoulder hurts so bad?

205
00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:44.194
I tried to do what I couldn't that's why I dropped it.

206
00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:46.594
Why did you try to take it when you couldn't?

207
00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:48.494
There's no reason.

208
00:12:48.494 --> 00:12:52.194
I was here alone, so I started feeling nostalgic.

209
00:12:52.194 --> 00:12:56.194
But I'm sure somebody came to see you today.

210
00:12:56.194 --> 00:12:58.494
How do you know?

211
00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:01.094
I'm not lying.

212
00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:03.994
The traces of shoe polish are left behind.

213
00:13:03.994 --> 00:13:05.894
Is something wrong?

214
00:13:05.894 --> 00:13:07.894
See, look over there on the floor.

215
00:13:07.894 --> 00:13:10.394
There's a brown stain, right?

216
00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:16.094
That's the remains of shoe polish, right?

217
00:13:18.494 --> 00:13:20.794
Come to think of it, it seems that the person

218
00:13:20.794 --> 00:13:23.294
who was found dead by the bridge was also wearing brown shoes.

219
00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:25.994
An insurance salesman came at noon.

220
00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:29.094
Those traces are probably his.

221
00:13:29.094 --> 00:13:30.994
I'm not interested in insurance,

222
00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:32.994
so I had him leave right away, though.

223
00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:35.394
That's why I forgot about it.

224
00:13:35.394 --> 00:13:38.694
This trace was left behind when someone wears his shoes.

225
00:13:38.694 --> 00:13:42.694
Which means that person took off his shoes and came in here, right?

226
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:46.494
Why did you let him in when you had no interest in insurance?

227
00:13:46.494 --> 00:13:50.194
Sonny, isn't it about time your parents are coming home?

228
00:13:50.194 --> 00:13:52.794
Grandpa, try smelling my hand.

229
00:13:52.794 --> 00:13:54.294
Sonny, that's enough.

230
00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:56.094
Please.

231
00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:03.494
You smell strawberries, right?

232
00:14:03.494 --> 00:14:05.194
Yeah, I do.

233
00:14:05.194 --> 00:14:07.194
At sundown today, my friend

234
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:10.694
touched the door here with ice cream on his hands.

235
00:14:10.694 --> 00:14:13.694
I touched the door a while ago when I opened it.

236
00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:15.694
So see, it smells of strawberries.

237
00:14:15.694 --> 00:14:18.894
I see, I'll wipe it in the morning.

238
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:22.694
This same smell was on the man who died, too.

239
00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:26.194
He came here today, didn't he?

240
00:14:26.194 --> 00:14:28.994
What... what are you getting at, sonny?

241
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:30.294
It sounds like you think

242
00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:33.794
that I'm involved with the case or something.

243
00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:35.194
You are, aren't you?

244
00:14:35.194 --> 00:14:38.594
You killed him, didn't you?

245
00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:41.994
What... what a thing to say.

246
00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:44.494
If it's as you say,

247
00:14:44.494 --> 00:14:48.494
you're here together with a murderer.

248
00:14:48.494 --> 00:14:50.294
Aren't you afraid?

249
00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:52.294
I'm not scared.

250
00:14:52.294 --> 00:14:55.294
Because I know you're really not a bad person, Grandpa.

251
00:15:06.694 --> 00:15:11.694
No matter what you say, I have nothing to do with any murder.

252
00:15:11.694 --> 00:15:15.794
First of all, didn't that man mistakenly fall off the bridge?

253
00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:18.494
You threw this from the bridge

254
00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:20.894
and when that man was distracted seeing this,

255
00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:23.194
you pushed him over.

256
00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:27.294
I don't think a toy boomerang would fly that well, though.

257
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:30.994
You experimented at the riverbed several times, didn't you?

258
00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:35.394
To test how the boomerang would glow and fly.

259
00:15:35.394 --> 00:15:38.894
When people saw it, they started saying it was a UFO.

260
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.694
A UFO?

261
00:15:40.694 --> 00:15:43.594
It's a rumor among us, too.

262
00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:45.394
Ridiculous.

263
00:15:45.394 --> 00:15:48.094
Besides, why would I have to do something

264
00:15:48.094 --> 00:15:51.494
as troublesome as that to push somebody off a bridge?

265
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:54.994
The man who died was young and of good built,

266
00:15:54.994 --> 00:15:56.894
so you couldn't match up to him in strength.

267
00:15:56.894 --> 00:16:00.494
Besides, you have a bad shoulder and you can't raise your arms.

268
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:02.794
That's why you had to distract him with something,

269
00:16:02.794 --> 00:16:05.594
then scoop up his legs.

270
00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:08.894
How do you know I scooped his legs?

271
00:16:08.894 --> 00:16:12.294
The dirt of the railing wasn't on the slacks of the corpse.

272
00:16:12.294 --> 00:16:15.694
On the other hand, the palm of his hand was dirty and completely black.

273
00:16:15.694 --> 00:16:18.794
It's proof that he was leaning over holding the railing.

274
00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:22.494
But that doesn't show that I did it, does it?

275
00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:25.394
I could never do something so ruthless as to kill somebody...

276
00:16:25.394 --> 00:16:29.894
No store sells this toy boomerang anymore.

277
00:16:29.894 --> 00:16:31.694
But there are a lot here.

278
00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:34.294
And the strawberry ice cream, too.

279
00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.294
It's only a coincidence.

280
00:16:36.294 --> 00:16:38.294
I don't know anything.

281
00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:41.794
If so, how did you know he fell off the bridge?

282
00:16:41.794 --> 00:16:44.894
I just said that somebody died at the bridge.

283
00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:48.094
If you hear that someone died at the bridge,

284
00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:49.694
you'd think he fell, right?

285
00:16:49.694 --> 00:16:53.594
That guy drank too much Scotch and accidentally fell off.

286
00:16:53.594 --> 00:16:55.194
I'm sure that's...

287
00:16:57.094 --> 00:17:01.394
How do you know that the victim was drinking Scotch?

288
00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:05.294
You didn't say beer or plain whisky but Scotch?

289
00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:09.094
I just thought so

290
00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.794
for some reason.

291
00:17:18.694 --> 00:17:20.894
It doesn't move, does it?

292
00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:23.594
It seems to be missing a part.

293
00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:26.294
I think it's a small gear.

294
00:17:26.294 --> 00:17:27.894
Did you try looking for it?

295
00:17:27.894 --> 00:17:29.094
Of course.

296
00:17:29.094 --> 00:17:32.394
Uh, try remembering once more.

297
00:17:32.394 --> 00:17:34.894
The time when the locomotive dropped.

298
00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:47.094
I think the gear went into the shoe.

299
00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:52.094
It seems the police doesn't think he died of a mere accident, too.

300
00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:54.694
I think that they'll find out right away

301
00:17:54.694 --> 00:17:56.994
that he came here, too.

302
00:17:56.994 --> 00:18:00.794
On top of that, if the gear is found in his shoe.

303
00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:06.294
My wife was ill and in the hospital for a long time.

304
00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:09.194
It cost a lot of money, too.

305
00:18:09.194 --> 00:18:11.794
I ended up borrowing money from a bad place

306
00:18:11.794 --> 00:18:15.394
to pay for the hospital bills.

307
00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:19.194
The man who fell from the bridge and died was a debt collector.

308
00:18:19.194 --> 00:18:22.094
He was really cruel.

309
00:18:22.094 --> 00:18:25.794
But nothing bothered me.

310
00:18:25.794 --> 00:18:28.894
Because it was all for my wife.

311
00:18:28.894 --> 00:18:30.794
But that guy...

312
00:18:30.794 --> 00:18:35.594
went over to where my wife was hospitalized and asked to be repaid.

313
00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:39.294
My wife who got depressed suddenly got worse.

314
00:18:39.294 --> 00:18:41.294
Her last words were...

315
00:18:41.294 --> 00:18:43.494
"I'm sorry".

316
00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:52.594
I remember you now, sonny.

317
00:18:52.594 --> 00:18:55.494
I thought you looked familiar.

318
00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:58.694
Yes. You're the one who came to the shop, aren't you?

319
00:18:58.694 --> 00:18:59.694
Back then...

320
00:19:02.194 --> 00:19:03.794
Who dropped it?

321
00:19:03.794 --> 00:19:05.594
Oh, I don't know.

322
00:19:15.594 --> 00:19:18.194
That boy's the one who dropped the locomotive.

323
00:19:18.194 --> 00:19:20.094
It... it wasn't me.

324
00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:22.094
Don't say stuff like that.

325
00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.894
I'm not just saying it.

326
00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:27.194
Your shoeprints are on the footstool there.

327
00:19:27.194 --> 00:19:30.794
The one who did it got on it and tried to take the locomotive.

328
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:33.694
This is the print of the sneakers of a boy.

329
00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:36.394
So the girls are excluded.

330
00:19:36.394 --> 00:19:39.794
All the remaining three are wearing sneakers.

331
00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:41.894
But the soil that is left on the footstool

332
00:19:41.894 --> 00:19:44.194
is damp and sticky.

333
00:19:44.194 --> 00:19:46.294
This is not what was found on the school campus.

334
00:19:47.294 --> 00:19:50.994
Yes, it's the soil of the shrine in the back.

335
00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:53.794
The soil on your shoes is dry.

336
00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:55.594
It's probably from school,

337
00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:58.294
so you're not the one.

338
00:19:58.294 --> 00:19:59.794
You're tall,

339
00:19:59.794 --> 00:20:02.694
so you don't need a footstool to take the locomotive.

340
00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:04.194
So, we're left with...

341
00:20:05.194 --> 00:20:07.394
only you.

342
00:20:08.394 --> 00:20:10.194
Hey! Wait!

343
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.494
Why don't you go after him?

344
00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:18.594
I don't have to because he'll be back.

345
00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:20.094
What?

346
00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:22.294
I believe him.

347
00:20:22.294 --> 00:20:24.794
But the locomotive broke.

348
00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:27.894
If it broke, all I do is fix it.

349
00:20:37.394 --> 00:20:38.994
I'm sorry.

350
00:20:44.394 --> 00:20:48.294
My late wife used to talk a lot about that day, too.

351
00:20:53.394 --> 00:20:55.894
No, it can't be.

352
00:20:55.894 --> 00:20:59.094
You haven't changed at all, since 10 years ago.

353
00:21:00.094 --> 00:21:01.694
What on earth...

354
00:21:29.094 --> 00:21:31.294
If he goes to the police at this point,

355
00:21:31.294 --> 00:21:33.294
he would be turning himself in.

356
00:21:33.294 --> 00:21:36.794
You were really lenient to this perp, weren't you?

357
00:21:37.794 --> 00:21:39.094
I guess so.

358
00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:07.694
All right.

359
00:23:07.694 --> 00:23:11.094
Officer Takagi, please rush over to Mr. Nagai's shop.

360
00:23:11.094 --> 00:23:12.694
-Yes, sir. -Officer Sato,

361
00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:14.894
I want you to continue your investigation on Kuromaru Finance.

362
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.094
If it's a fact that they are conducting malicious debt collection,

363
00:23:17.094 --> 00:23:19.094
check them out thoroughly.

364
00:23:19.094 --> 00:23:20.294
Yes, sir.

365
00:23:21.294 --> 00:23:25.194
Then, Mr. Nagai, please come to the station.

366
00:23:25.194 --> 00:23:26.494
Yes, sir.

367
00:23:26.494 --> 00:23:29.294
It's not for me to say,

368
00:23:29.294 --> 00:23:32.194
but what made you decide to turn yourself in?

369
00:23:32.194 --> 00:23:35.194
A wonder boy appeared.

370
00:23:35.194 --> 00:23:37.394
A wonder boy?

371
00:23:37.394 --> 00:23:38.394
Yes.

372
00:23:38.394 --> 00:23:42.994
He looked exactly the same as he did 10 years ago.

373
00:23:42.994 --> 00:23:44.094
He could've...

374
00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:49.394
He could've been a messenger

375
00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:52.594
sent from my wife in the heavens.

376
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:56.694
"Next Episode" -Conan.

377
00:23:56.694 --> 00:23:58.494
This forest really look like zombies would appear

378
00:23:58.494 --> 00:24:01.394
and is kind of creepy, isn't it?

379
00:24:04.094 --> 00:24:06.094
This... this is...

380
00:24:06.094 --> 00:24:07.494
the sword that Yoko was talking about.

381
00:24:07.494 --> 00:24:10.994
The cursed sword that turns zombies that touch it into ashes.

382
00:24:10.994 --> 00:24:12.994
Mr. Harawaki.

383
00:24:15.994 --> 00:24:18.094
Let's go and get out of here already!

384
00:24:19.094 --> 00:24:20.694
Next Conan,

385
00:24:20.694 --> 00:24:24.294
"A Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 1)"

386
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.537
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:29.437
"Zombie Blade"

388
00:24:29.437 --> 00:24:31.037
Ran, you can be such an airhead.

389
00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:32.037
What? Why?

390
00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:33.937
You can practically count on it.
