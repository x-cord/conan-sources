1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.240
We were invited by Sera

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.840
to go to solve a series of mysteries related to The Red Woman

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
and came to a rental villa in the remote mountains.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.640
But, a guest at the villa, Hakuya Masaie, is found dead.

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.440
Furthermore, Sumika Kawana is slashed with a knife by a mysterious woman.

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.440
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.140
Sera's behaviour is a point of concern.

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.340
But the mystery of The Red Woman is finally disclosed.

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.140
His name is Detective Conan.

13
00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:30.394
"The Tragedy of The Red Woman (Revenge)"

14
00:02:34.994 --> 00:02:37.794
I've called a car to come to get you for now,

15
00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:41.294
so please wait in this living room until it comes.

16
00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:46.894
I'll check the other rooms,

17
00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.094
so please guard those five.

18
00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.494
Oh, but...

19
00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:53.694
What about them?

20
00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:54.994
Right.

21
00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:56.494
I've got something I'd like to ask

22
00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.294
this high school girl detective, you see.

23
00:02:58.294 --> 00:02:59.494
As to this boy detective,

24
00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:01.594
Inspector Yamato said a while ago on the phone,

25
00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:04.394
"Take him along on the investigation."

26
00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:06.194
Take care of things here, okay?

27
00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:11.294
Hey, why isn't Inspector Yamato coming here?

28
00:03:11.294 --> 00:03:13.194
He's on the same team, isn't he?

29
00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.794
He said that he had something he wanted to confirm

30
00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:19.694
before the press conference announcement tomorrow on The Red Woman

31
00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:22.894
and went along with Inspector Morobushi to ask around.

32
00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:25.394
It seems that those two were a bit involved

33
00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:27.994
in The Red Woman case in the past, you see.

34
00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:34.494
It's nowhere.

35
00:03:34.494 --> 00:03:37.394
No long-haired wig, no knife,

36
00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:38.994
no wet clothes.

37
00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:40.694
Judging from the fact that

38
00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:44.194
there are no wet or muddy spots around the window,

39
00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:48.894
it seems that The Red Woman who attacked Sumika is not Tamami.

40
00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:53.094
Ninda's room on the second floor was the same when we checked, right?

41
00:03:53.094 --> 00:03:56.594
There were no wet places by the front door or in the corridor either.

42
00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:57.894
Right.

43
00:03:57.894 --> 00:04:01.894
I thought that either one of the two did it, but...

44
00:04:01.894 --> 00:04:04.294
Which means that there's a possibility that

45
00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:08.594
Sumika made up the story about being attacked, no?

46
00:04:08.594 --> 00:04:10.894
In order to avoid suspicion,

47
00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:12.694
maybe she deliberately slashed herself

48
00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:14.694
to make it look like she was attacked.

49
00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:17.094
I don't think that's possible.

50
00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:19.094
Because the slash on her back

51
00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:22.094
was single clean horizontal cut, wasn't it?

52
00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.494
She couldn't have done something like that herself.

53
00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.994
Then who on earth attacked Sumika?

54
00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:29.894
Maybe

55
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:33.294
the killer isn't inside this villa.

56
00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:35.494
Maybe there's really is something in the forest...

57
00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:37.994
Hiding out there.

58
00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.994
And waiting to come after us.

59
00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:48.694
I was joking. It's a joke.

60
00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:51.094
You're a cop, aren't you?

61
00:04:51.094 --> 00:04:53.994
By the way, what did you want to ask me?

62
00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.694
Oh, right.

63
00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:59.794
About the strange incidents that happened here

64
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:01.794
at this villa in the past.

65
00:05:01.794 --> 00:05:03.794
If you were called over here as a detective,

66
00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:06.494
I figured maybe you were told of the details.

67
00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:09.294
You've got the pictures of back then too, don't you?

68
00:05:09.294 --> 00:05:10.394
Yes.

69
00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:14.994
I see.

70
00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:17.894
It sure is a strange case.

71
00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:23.194
Red apples, red roses and red paint.

72
00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:26.794
At the scene of the crime that occurred this time,

73
00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:29.894
tons of tomatoes were floating in the tub, right?

74
00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:33.994
They're all things that help bring The Red Woman to mind, aren't they?

75
00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:35.194
Huh?

76
00:05:35.194 --> 00:05:37.794
Only this picture looks old.

77
00:05:37.794 --> 00:05:38.794
Yes.

78
00:05:38.794 --> 00:05:42.594
It seems to have been taken in the afternoon 12 years ago

79
00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:46.794
when their classmate went missing.

80
00:05:46.794 --> 00:05:49.194
See, the one in the middle

81
00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:52.594
is Satoko Imoto who found dead by the swamp.

82
00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:53.994
Strange.

83
00:05:53.994 --> 00:05:57.594
She's wearing a beige cardigan, right?

84
00:05:57.594 --> 00:05:58.694
Yes.

85
00:05:58.694 --> 00:06:01.194
When she was found,

86
00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.494
I was told that she was wearing a long red coat.

87
00:06:05.894 --> 00:06:09.294
The fact is, the knife near the swamp where she drowned,

88
00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:15.294
was found three years after the incident by Inspectors Yamato and Morobushi

89
00:06:15.294 --> 00:06:18.194
who were still trainees at the police academy.

90
00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:22.794
Since then, they've never stopped arguing about the incident.

91
00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:25.294
Inspector Yamato insists that

92
00:06:25.294 --> 00:06:29.094
the skeleton that was found together with the girl isn't The Red Woman,

93
00:06:29.094 --> 00:06:34.094
but Inspector Morobushi insists that it's most likely is The Red Woman.

94
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:38.494
They found out that the skeleton was The Red Woman after all,

95
00:06:38.494 --> 00:06:42.594
so Inspector Morobushi is proud of himself,

96
00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:45.394
while Kan's still not convinced at all.

97
00:06:45.394 --> 00:06:47.194
Kan?

98
00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:50.894
Well, I mean Inspector Kansuke Yamato...

99
00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:54.094
I... I call him that because we're childhood friends.

100
00:06:54.094 --> 00:06:59.894
And, they went over to the police officer

101
00:06:59.894 --> 00:07:04.794
who was at the crime scene 15 years ago

102
00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:08.394
who is now retired and works at a Pachinko parlour.

103
00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:11.294
Don't you think it's odd?

104
00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:14.394
After the incident you went looking for The Red Woman

105
00:07:14.394 --> 00:07:16.194
and thoroughly checked the forest, didn't you?

106
00:07:16.194 --> 00:07:19.494
Why would the murder weapon that couldn't be found then,

107
00:07:19.494 --> 00:07:22.794
just happen to pop up three years later?

108
00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:26.994
Maybe it was just hidden under a leaf of a tree or something...

109
00:07:26.994 --> 00:07:30.494
It was not in plain sight when we found it either, you see.

110
00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:33.294
But, it's been three years since the incident, you know?

111
00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:36.494
Wouldn't the knife normally be more rusted?

112
00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:40.194
Because the knife was made of special anti-rust material.

113
00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:44.194
Even so, after The Red Woman slashed you,

114
00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:46.194
you ran right after her, didn't you?

115
00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:49.794
You should've known that there was a quicksand swamp

116
00:07:49.794 --> 00:07:51.594
in the direction that The Red Woman fled, didn't you?

117
00:07:51.594 --> 00:07:54.494
Why didn't you also search the quicksand swamp back then?

118
00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:58.594
I... I couldn't go after her right away.

119
00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:01.294
Because my legs gave out.

120
00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:02.594
What?

121
00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:11.094
I mean, that woman threw the knife at me, you know?

122
00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:14.894
Besides, her face was red with splattered blood too!

123
00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:15.994
What?

124
00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.494
It... It was so traumatic

125
00:08:18.494 --> 00:08:23.094
that I quit the police force after that incident.

126
00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:25.494
Hey, in other words...

127
00:08:25.494 --> 00:08:27.894
Yes. It's most likely.

128
00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:30.394
What? Report error?

129
00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:32.194
Yes, that's right.

130
00:08:32.194 --> 00:08:35.794
The uniformed police officer, who arrived at the crime scene,

131
00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:38.494
was terrified out of his wits and made a mistake.

132
00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:42.094
Well, I'm heading over there with Komei now,

133
00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:44.094
so you be careful, Uehara.

134
00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:46.494
Be careful of what?

135
00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.394
You idiot, come on! Don't you understand?

136
00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.394
She may still be in the forest.

137
00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:53.694
Oh, no. The battery's dead.

138
00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:56.594
What did Inspector Yamato say?

139
00:08:56.594 --> 00:09:00.394
He mentioned the report that was filled out 15 years ago.

140
00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:05.194
Although it said that the officer was slashed by The Red Woman who fled,

141
00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:09.794
but the fact was the woman threw the knife at him and fled.

142
00:09:09.794 --> 00:09:12.394
I see, so that's the story.

143
00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:15.394
If so, just as first deduced.

144
00:09:15.394 --> 00:09:18.394
That person's the one who killed Hakuya.

145
00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:22.694
As I expected, evil spirits...

146
00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:24.394
-don't exist in this world! -Don't exist in this world!

147
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.470
Good work, ma'am.

148
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.570
-And, did you find something? -What?

149
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.270
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -I'm asking if you figured out

150
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.270
who the killer that sunk Hakuya into the bathtub and slashed Sumika is.

151
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.670
No. Not yet.

152
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.470
Just what do you think you're doing?

153
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.370
You're cops, aren't you?

154
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.670
Just as I thought.

155
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.270
-"Sumika Kawana (28)" -It's an evil spirit after all.

156
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.170
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is coming after us.

157
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.670
We can't really say yet.

158
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.370
-"Tamami Minegishi (28)" -But, you don't know yet,

159
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.270
so she may be right, no?

160
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.770
Which means it may be dangerous for us to just stay here like this?

161
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.270
One by one, we're all going to...

162
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.670
End up like Satoko and Hakuya.

163
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.070
The evil spirit of The Red Woman is going to kill us.

164
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.670
I mean it's impossible to run from an evil spirit.

165
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.570
Nobody's going to get killed.

166
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.670
The evil spirit of The Red Woman that you're all talking about

167
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.970
doesn't exist.

168
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.470
But...

169
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.970
you don't know who attacked Hakuya and Sumika yet, do you?

170
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:46.970
Not quite.

171
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:53.570
I do know who killed Mr. Hakuya in the bathtub,

172
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.270
But, that's...

173
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.070
Isn't it the same person that attacked Sumika?

174
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.670
Don't tell me the killer's here with us.

175
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.870
Yes.

176
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.370
But, when Ran went to check the temperature of the water,

177
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.170
everything seemed normal.

178
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.070
However, after cleaning, when everybody went to take a bath,

179
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.670
tons of tomatoes were found floating in the bathtub.

180
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.870
And, Mr. Hakuya's body was found at the bottom of the bathtub.

181
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.270
So, the crime must've occurred while the three of you were cleaning up.

182
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.870
That means the ones who had the chance to kill Hakuya during that time are

183
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.970
Tamami who was in the kitchen making preparations for dinner,

184
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:35.970
and Ninda, who went shopping at a shop located a kilometer away.

185
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.470
Didn't you say that it was impossible for the two to commit the crime?

186
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.770
Yes. During that time,

187
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.470
Sumika and the others were cleaning the first floor where the bathtub is.

188
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.270
I think it'd been impossible to kill someone back then

189
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.770
without Sumika and the others noticing.

190
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.970
So in order to fill the surface of the bath tub with tomatoes

191
00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.970
and use dumbbells to keep the body at the bottom of the tub,

192
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.870
the killer must have taken several trips back and forth.

193
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.070
Then, the three couldn't have committed the crime?

194
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.470
Not quite.

195
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.570
If by the time Ran and the others went to check the water temperature,

196
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.670
Hakuya's body was already at the bottom of the bathtub,

197
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.070
there is one person who could've committed the crime.

198
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.170
Right.

199
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.370
The person who was cleaning the second floor alone,

200
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.970
before the water temperature was checked,

201
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.570
Ms. Sumika Kawana.

202
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.170
You could've committed the crime!

203
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.670
Sumika killed Hakuya?

204
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.270
Just what're you talking about!

205
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.070
She couldn't have!

206
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.270
Right!

207
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.970
Sumika was really cleaning the second floor right through back then!

208
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.670
We heard the sound of the vacuum cleaner

209
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.070
as well as the nozzle of the cleaner knocking against the wall too.

210
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.270
As for the knocking sound you heard,

211
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.770
a piece of cardboard was taped onto Ninda's bat

212
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.970
and hanging it from a column, then a rotating fan was pointing at it.

213
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:09.070
Then each time the wind blows, the bat float up.

214
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.170
When it swings back,

215
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:18.170
the bat hits the column making knocking sounds periodically.

216
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.770
As proof of that on the tip of the bat,

217
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.270
there were traces of something having been stuck on it.

218
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.470
Moreover, Ninda's room is right above this living room

219
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.870
where Ran and the others were cleaning.

220
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.670
There was a hook on the column of his room

221
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.670
where a bat could be hung from too.

222
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.270
But, when I went to check the water temperature there was no corpse.

223
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.570
The water was green with bath salt

224
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.570
that the bottom of the tub wasn't visible, right?

225
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.370
That could be,

226
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.370
but there wasn't a single tomato afloat.

227
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.370
They were just not afloat.

228
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.670
In other words,

229
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.370
it was just that he tomatoes were not afloat.

230
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.670
Just what do you mean, Conan?

231
00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.470
This is a tomato that Sera snatched from the crime scene.

232
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.970
If you put this tomato into the water...

233
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.270
See, it'll sink.

234
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.970
They done this sometimes at the vegetable section of supermarkets, right?

235
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.570
Yes, tomatoes with a large sugar content,

236
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.370
unlike regular tomatoes, sink.

237
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.370
Maybe that's why you couldn't see the tomatoes

238
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.170
that were at the bottom of the bathtub.

239
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.770
Then, how were the tomatoes made to float up?

240
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.270
With salt.

241
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.370
Salt?

242
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.570
Yes. If you insert enough salt beforehand,

243
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.770
to barely keep the tomatoes from floating,

244
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.270
all need is to sprinkle salt.

245
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.370
-It floated! -It floated!

246
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.670
It floated because by increasing salinity,

247
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:54.070
specific gravity exceeds that of the tomato with high sugar content.

248
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.870
Well, I figure bath salt

249
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.970
was probably used to avoid suspicion later on.

250
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.770
In other words, Sumika pretended to be cleaning the second floor,

251
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.370
while she snuck up to Hakuya who was cleaning the bathroom

252
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:14.170
and struck him out cold from behind with the dumbbell.

253
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.070
After drowning him in the bath tub,

254
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.970
she placed dumbbells on him and threw a load of tomatoes in the tub

255
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.470
then she put in just enough bath salt to keep the tomatoes from floating,

256
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.270
then covered the tub.

257
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.070
She makes Ran and Sonoko go to the check the temperature of the water

258
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.570
and make them confirm that nothing is floating in the bathtub.

259
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.770
Finally, she goes into the bathroom

260
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.470
and adds bath salt into the bathtub,

261
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.670
making the tomatoes float up!

262
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:46.170
As proof of this, when I pulled the body out of the bathtub, like me.

263
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.470
There should be a lot on your sleeves too.

264
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.170
The traces of something on your sleeves that got wet

265
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.270
after soaking into strong salt water then dried,

266
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.970
Salt crystals.

267
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.270
At first, I figure you got it wet

268
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.870
when you first put a lot of bath salt into the water,

269
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.970
but it was so obvious.

270
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.070
When we first met, your sleeves were rolled down,

271
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.470
but after the incident your sleeves were rolled up right through.

272
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:20.470
Well, I suspected you from the time we first met though.

273
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.270
From the time we first met?

274
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:27.270
Because all the others thought that Sera was a boy

275
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:31.670
but you handed over photos of the incidents without asking her anything.

276
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:36.570
Which means you knew that Sera was a high school girl detective, right?

277
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:40.570
That's why I figured that The Red Woman that we saw in the forest was you

278
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.170
and that you'd been listening to our conversation.

279
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.370
No joke.

280
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.070
You mean that was Sumika?

281
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.370
Sumika killed Hakuya.

282
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.070
Is it true?

283
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.570
Yes, it is.

284
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.770
I wore a red wig, a red raincoat and red boots

285
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.670
to act out being The Red Woman.

286
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.470
In order to bring to light the ruthless coward

287
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.570
that left Satoko to die.

288
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.370
Left to die?

289
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.870
I found out after hearing from the officer some years ago.

290
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.970
That Satoko's corpse that was found in the swamp was wearing a red coat.

291
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.470
Wait.

292
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.670
If I remember correctly,

293
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.270
wasn't Satoko wearing a beige cardigan back then?

294
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.570
Satoko was also disguising herself to be The Red Woman.

295
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.470
But back then,

296
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.070
wasn't it Satoko who said she saw The Red Woman in the forest?

297
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.270
Right.

298
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.370
After saying that,

299
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.270
she pretended to get lost when everybody went to search for the woman,

300
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.570
disguise herself as The Red Woman and scare everybody.

301
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.870
If so, she should've had an accomplice

302
00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:01.370
who guided us to her, who was disguised as The Red Woman.

303
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.770
So, it was Hakuya?

304
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.970
Yes. Right.

305
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.270
That's why I used apples, rose petals and paint to remind him

306
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.770
of The Red Woman to scare him but I wasn't able to expose him.

307
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.970
But once I disguised as The Red Woman,

308
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.870
he finally gave himself away.

309
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.970
The only one who would mistake The Red Woman for Satoko,

310
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.170
had to be the accomplice who carried out the trick.

311
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.570
He was blabbering off in the bathroom back then

312
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.170
that when he went to meet Satoko as promised, she wasn't there,

313
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.670
so he got scared and couldn't mention it.

314
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.670
I'm sure that she just got lost in the forest

315
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.670
and couldn't make it to the place they promised to meet but...

316
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.370
back then, if he had told us straightforwardly about the prank.

317
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.970
Satoko...

318
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.170
Satoko wouldn't have had to die.

319
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.370
Wait a second.

320
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.470
Then, who is the woman that attacked you?

321
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.570
Maybe it was Ninda or Tamami who realized the crime I committed.

322
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.170
We would never do something like that.

323
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.370
He's right.

324
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.470
If... If so...

325
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.470
Then, who on earth?

326
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.970
There's one likely person

327
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.770
although deeply involved in this incident.

328
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.270
No one knows whether she is dead or alive.

329
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.070
I found you.

330
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.370
That's it!

331
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.270
There's no Red Woman here.

332
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.870
Your revenge ended 15 years ago.

333
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.970
Be quick to amend one's wrongs.

334
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.370
When a mistake is made be quick at making amends.

335
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.670
There's no need for hesitation at all.

336
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.470
We, the Nagano Prefectural Police Department

337
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.370
are planning to reveal the reporting officer's mistake,

338
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.970
on the murder case that happened 15 years ago

339
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.670
at the press conference tomorrow.

340
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.070
So, please bury the hatchet, Shinobu Kagawa.

341
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.070
You are also one of the victims of The Red Woman incident after all.

342
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.370
A lover?

343
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.370
She was the lover of the man who was killed by The Red Woman?

344
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.070
Be it an extramarital affair,

345
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070
but after seeing her beloved brutally murdered before her eyes,

346
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.870
the shock and rage probably been drove her to find an opportunity

347
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.270
to get back at The Red Woman for the past 15 years.

348
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.670
Then Sumika was attacked by.

349
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.970
You just thought it was The Red Woman

350
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.270
because she was wearing red clothes in the forest.

351
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:19.770
It could be that Satoko wasn't at the promised place

352
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.270
because she was attacked by her and fled.

353
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.370
But, how could you have come up with that?

354
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.870
It was because I heard about the mistake on the report 15 years ago.

355
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:32.970
If the knife was thrown at the victim,

356
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.170
there would be no time to pick it up, right?

357
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.470
And yet, that knife was found three years later near the swamp,

358
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.870
and the fact that The Red Woman herself

359
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.370
was stuck in the swamp after she fled, so I figured.

360
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.470
The killer had to be the lover

361
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.070
who was at the crime scene and witnessed the murder.

362
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.270
Hey.

363
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.170
Don't you have to tell your brother about this case?

364
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:03.770
I thought I should, but I lost my cell.

365
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.970
Won't you try ringing it with your cell?

366
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.370
I think I can find it by the ringtone.

367
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.570
Okay.

368
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.770
Oh, it's under the dish cabinet.

369
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.270
How come it's in a place like this?

370
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.070
Who is this?

371
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.170
Thank you for finding it.

372
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.570
Oh. Yes.

373
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.770
Brother?

374
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.970
Geez, I really had a tough time.

375
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.770
In order to bring that display up after receiving the call,

376
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.170
you'd have to display the photo and leave it as is.

377
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.070
Which means she deliberately showed it to me?

378
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.870
For what?

379
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.270
I'm telling you, it's true!

380
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.670
Dodonpa. Dodonpa doesn't lie.

381
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.670
That's not it?

382
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.970
-No, sir. -What's wrong, Inspector?

383
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.270
It's me! I'm the killer!

384
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:11.770
Everyone throughout Japan understands how you feel, Mr. Dodonpa.

385
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.670
Who'd leak out such information?

386
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:17.070
Next Conan,

387
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.070
"The Comedian Who Turned Himself In (Part 1)"

388
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.670
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.070
"Press Conference".

390
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.470
It's almost time for the festival!

391
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.370
After The Red Woman comes the yellow pumpkin.

392
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.770
Happy Halloween!
