1
00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.424
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:06.024
The Youth Detective Squad is energetic as always.

4
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.024
They accidentally came across a crime scene.

5
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.724
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:11.624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:14.024
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.611
Help!

9
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.711
Help!

10
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:17.311
Help!

11
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:25.711
Help! Help!

12
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.811
Ayumi. You're not supposed to laugh here.

13
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.611
You must scream.

14
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:37.711
Suspense was building, and you messed it up.

15
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.211
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.111
It was so funny.

17
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:42.911
Darn it.

18
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:47.811
Then, let's play the game of "The Case of the Bald Head".

19
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:53.011
How about "The Case of the Abducted Pretty Blonde Girl"?

20
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.411
Oh, but... it's about time we go home.

21
00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:00.011
Oh, yes. It's Yaiba Day.

22
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.211
It's the last episode of the Yaiba series.

23
00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.411
We can't miss it.

24
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.211
What was that?

25
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:15.811
What are you doing, Mr. Kurata?

26
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.211
Shut up! You traitor!

27
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:22.511
I know everything you've done, Suzuki.

28
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.811
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.811
You're trying to join Sanada Transport

30
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.411
and take our customers with you, right?

31
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.011
Why...

32
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.511
I won't let you, turncoat.

33
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:33.911
No.

34
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:35.611
I'm not letting you out.

35
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.111
What shall we do?

36
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:40.411
What? If we don't stop them, it will become a serious problem.

37
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:42.911
But, how are we to stop them?

38
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.911
Well...

39
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.211
We... we're in trouble.

40
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:02.711
It's a real...

41
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.211
Murder.

42
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:12.211
"Little Witnesses"

43
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.511
"Mouri Detective Agency"

44
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.311
The shadow of the Yaiba pretender threatens Shunsuke.

45
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:20.611
What can you do, Satoshi? What can you do, our hero Yaiba?

46
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:22.011
The Masked Yaiba.

47
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.711
The Last Days of the Yaiba Pretender.

48
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.911
From 7:30 tonight.

49
00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:29.111
Don't miss it. Yaiba Kick!

50
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.711
Conan here. What happened?

51
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:38.011
Is that you, Conan? Help. Somebody's been killed.

52
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.411
What? Where are you, Ayumi?

53
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.411
We are...

54
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:47.011
We've got to hurry. He's going to move out the body.

55
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:48.211
What?

56
00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:54.511
What are we to do, Mitsuhiko?

57
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.611
No choice.

58
00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:00.611
We have to get on the truck now to find out where he's going.

59
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.011
All right.

60
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.411
Hey. What happened, Ayumi?

61
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.011
Answer me!

62
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.011
The Squad badge.

63
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:16.311
Did you drop it?

64
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:17.711
Looks like it.

65
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.211
Never mind, we have no choice.

66
00:05:20.211 --> 00:05:23.011
The man will be back right away.

67
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.311
Ayumi? Can you hear me?

68
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.411
Say something! Ayumi!

69
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:58.011
Ayumi!

70
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.711
Ayumi? What happened? Ayumi!

71
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:15.411
Is that blood?

72
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.711
What?

73
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.311
Looks like it.

74
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.311
I'm sorry, guys.

75
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:29.411
If I didn't lose the badge, Conan will be here.

76
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.611
It's not your fault.

77
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:35.011
Don't forget that we forgot our own badges.

78
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:37.711
But...

79
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:41.811
Anyway, where is this truck heading?

80
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.411
Well...

81
00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:46.211
He might be planning to dump it in the ocean or in the mountains.

82
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:50.411
That any rate, we have no choice but to see everything through.

83
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.511
Remember, in the name of the Youth Detective Squad.

84
00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:56.711
I've never seen this place before.

85
00:06:56.711 --> 00:06:58.311
What?

86
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:07.111
Hey, it stopped.

87
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:11.211
Gee, I wish this happened tomorrow.

88
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.111
Why so?

89
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.011
Today is Yaiba Day, remember?

90
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:18.611
I was looking forward to this day.

91
00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.211
Good grief.

92
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:23.611
It is the Masked Yaiba!

93
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.611
There it is.

94
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.911
There you go.

95
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:31.711
Yaiba. Miracle. Kick.

96
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.911
Hey, stop! Don't move!

97
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:36.711
Genta, turn down the volume.

98
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:39.211
He'll hear you from the driver's seat.

99
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:46.911
Darn. The story was just getting better.

100
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:51.711
It's a train.

101
00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:00.111
It seems it's getting quieter.

102
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:01.211
Yeah.

103
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:12.011
I think we're getting on an unpaved road.

104
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:13.711
Are we in the mountains?

105
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:22.011
It stopped.

106
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:23.911
We're getting there.

107
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:38.711
What's that sound?

108
00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:40.711
He must be digging a hole.

109
00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:42.211
A hole for what?

110
00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:44.311
Of course.

111
00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:46.711
To put the dead body in.

112
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:03.211
How long are we supposed to be doing this?

113
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.011
I actually want to go to the boy's room.

114
00:09:06.011 --> 00:09:09.911
Looks like there is traffic jam.

115
00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:11.511
This is our chance.

116
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:13.011
Let's escape.

117
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:16.711
Hurry up and make a phone call.

118
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.811
Did you see the license plate?

119
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:31.511
Yes. Shinjuku 1015.

120
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:38.111
Yes. This is the Mouri Detective Agency.

121
00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:39.211
Conan.

122
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.111
Ayumi?

123
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.311
Where are you now? Is everyone all right?

124
00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:44.411
Yes, we're all right.

125
00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:46.611
Right now, we just escaped.

126
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:49.711
Let me see... where are we...

127
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.011
So, this is where the crime took place?

128
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:01.411
Yes, no question about it.

129
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.211
Gosh.

130
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:10.411
Calling me so early when I have a hangover.

131
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.011
There was a murder!

132
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.411
A man named Suzuki was killed here.

133
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:17.611
The culprit is...

134
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:21.211
The culprit is Kurata. The victim is Suzuki.

135
00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:24.011
That is how they were calling each other, right?

136
00:10:24.011 --> 00:10:25.711
Exactly.

137
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.411
In addition, we have seen the truck that the killer used.

138
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:33.811
Yes, Shinjuku 1015.

139
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:37.111
Well, the truck in question is registered

140
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:40.011
to a freight company called Kurata Transport.

141
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.611
Kurata Transport.

142
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:44.311
The address is just around here.

143
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.411
-Let's give it a try. -Okay.

144
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:49.711
Hello.

145
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.711
Yes, may I help you?

146
00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:56.911
-Mr. Mouri. -Okay.

147
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:01.511
My name is Kogoro Mouri of the Mouri Detective Agency.

148
00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:02.711
Yes?

149
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:05.411
Kogoro Mouri, you must be...

150
00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:07.511
Amazing!

151
00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:10.911
I'm a great fan of Sleeping Kogoro.

152
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:12.611
Well, thank you.

153
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:15.711
I'd be happy to cooperate.

154
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:18.311
Well, actually, these children

155
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.811
insist that they have seen a strange incident last night.

156
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:24.411
That's why I'm making an inquiry.

157
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.511
It's him.

158
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:29.311
I won't let you, turncoat.

159
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:34.011
He is the killer, Conan.

160
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:36.011
Hey, kids.

161
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:39.911
Ma'am, is this person the president, Mr. Kurata?

162
00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:41.211
Yes. But why?

163
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:42.411
Where is he now?

164
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:44.111
We want to see him here.

165
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:45.611
We have something to ask him.

166
00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:50.111
Hey, hey. Kids. Calm down.

167
00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:54.111
Mr. Kurata usually comes to the office past noon.

168
00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:56.111
Past noon?

169
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.011
There is possibility of an escaped.

170
00:11:58.011 --> 00:12:00.611
Hold it, hold it.

171
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.511
Is there a person named Suzuki here?

172
00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:05.411
You mean Director Suzuki?

173
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:08.911
Mr. Suzuki? Look there.

174
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:12.511
You see him on that photo we took when we went on an employee trip.

175
00:12:12.511 --> 00:12:17.611
You see him here, the one smoking at the fringe of the group.

176
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:20.911
And then. This Mr. Suzuki, where is he?

177
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:24.611
Well, he's missing.

178
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.611
Kaori, what do you mean by that?

179
00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:28.611
Hey, didn't I tell you?

180
00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:31.811
I got a call from his wife telling me

181
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:34.711
he hasn't returned home last night.

182
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:36.711
I wonder.

183
00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:38.611
He is a very hardworking, sincere man.

184
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:40.411
Maybe he's stressed out.

185
00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:43.411
I saw him arguing with the president the other day.

186
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:44.811
What?

187
00:12:44.811 --> 00:12:46.611
You mean Mr. Kurata and Mr. Suzuki

188
00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:48.711
aren't getting along with each other?

189
00:12:48.711 --> 00:12:50.611
You bet.

190
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:54.311
The two started this company together 20 years ago.

191
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.311
But now they are on each other's throat.

192
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:58.511
Everybody's talking that Mr. Suzuki is planning to leave

193
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.311
and start his own business.

194
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:02.011
That's enough, Kaori.

195
00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:05.211
No big deal. Everybody knows that.

196
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:15.611
Shinjuku 1015.

197
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:17.511
This is it.

198
00:13:21.811 --> 00:13:24.511
Did you find the bloodstain?

199
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:26.111
That's solid evidence.

200
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:28.511
I saw that last night.

201
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.511
He used this truck to carry off the body.

202
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.711
No, this is paint.

203
00:13:34.711 --> 00:13:36.711
-Paint? -No kidding.

204
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:39.711
You made a mistake, because it was dark.

205
00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:40.911
But...

206
00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:43.211
Look at that.

207
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.711
It was all your imagination.

208
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:49.711
You might have taken a mannequin for a dead body.

209
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:52.211
All those detective games you play

210
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:53.511
are making you imagine things.

211
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:55.211
It's not imagination.

212
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.711
It's true!

213
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.211
Mr. Kurata really did dump a body in the mountains.

214
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:04.011
Then, did you see him bury the body?

215
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:06.711
Give me the truth.

216
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:09.811
Did you really see with your own eyes?

217
00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:13.911
Well...

218
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:17.311
What a waste waking up so early in the morning.

219
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:21.411
I apologize for this. Interrupting you during business hours.

220
00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:23.111
No trouble.

221
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:24.411
Then, this is it.

222
00:14:24.411 --> 00:14:27.911
I'm going back to bed.

223
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:30.711
You should all go back home.

224
00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:34.211
Conan.

225
00:14:44.811 --> 00:14:47.811
Conan, you do believe us, don't you?

226
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:55.411
What we need to do is to identify the location

227
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:57.111
where the victim was buried.

228
00:14:57.111 --> 00:15:00.211
If we can find the body, your claim will be proven.

229
00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:01.811
Okay.

230
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:13.061
Around 7:10 p.m., the truck with the body

231
00:15:13.061 --> 00:15:16.061
left from the front of this building.

232
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:20.761
It took roughly three hours from departure until we returned.

233
00:15:20.761 --> 00:15:23.461
In other words, it took 90 minutes one way

234
00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:27.361
to reach the mountains where Director Suzuki was buried.

235
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:31.461
Mountains that can be reached in about 90 minutes are...

236
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:34.761
There are three possible routes.

237
00:15:36.661 --> 00:15:39.161
Could you tell which direction you went?

238
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:42.861
Well, I'm sorry we couldn't tell at all.

239
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:44.461
Couldn't you see something?

240
00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:48.161
We were in a strange town.

241
00:15:51.961 --> 00:15:54.161
I saw White Duck.

242
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:56.961
White Duck is a major convenience store chain.

243
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:59.661
It has lots of stores in the city.

244
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:03.561
Yes. I could smell broiled eel on the way.

245
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:07.061
Let's check all the eel restaurants in the city.

246
00:16:07.061 --> 00:16:08.761
We'll know for sure.

247
00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:11.661
Can't you think of anything better?

248
00:16:11.661 --> 00:16:15.261
I was counting the number of gas stations.

249
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:18.361
There was Heart Sekiyu on the right side of the road.

250
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:21.161
Next, there was MM Sekiyu.

251
00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:24.161
Then another Heart Sekiyu.

252
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:26.861
That's how many I could see.

253
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:32.761
Heart Seikyu. MM Sekiyu and Heart Sekiyu.

254
00:16:32.761 --> 00:16:34.961
The route might have been this.

255
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.861
Yes. I saw the Masked Yaiba.

256
00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:40.861
Masked Yaiba?

257
00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:43.861
I saw it on TV at an electrical appliance store.

258
00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:49.361
It was right at the best part Yaiba Miracle Kick.

259
00:16:49.361 --> 00:16:52.461
Then the truck started moving.

260
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:56.161
Then, the truck stopped there, right?

261
00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:57.861
Yeah.

262
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:00.761
It must have stopped at a traffic light.

263
00:17:00.761 --> 00:17:03.561
It stopped for quite a long time.

264
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:05.461
Yeah. And then...

265
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.361
Right after the truck started moving,

266
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:10.261
a train passed right above us.

267
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:14.661
Train passing above?

268
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:16.361
A railway overpass.

269
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:22.261
That means the truck passed under it around 7:50.

270
00:17:22.261 --> 00:17:23.361
What?

271
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:26.161
How do you know it was 7:50?

272
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:32.561
The Masked Yaiba's kick comes out at around 7:50 all the time.

273
00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:34.761
Yes.

274
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:36.361
7:50 p.m.

275
00:17:36.361 --> 00:17:39.861
That's about 40 minutes after the truck left this place.

276
00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:42.361
It crossed an overpass then,

277
00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.861
plus it was a point with traffic lights.

278
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:50.361
The only mountain you can get to in 90 minutes along this route is...

279
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:52.461
Here.

280
00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:05.861
It's scary.

281
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:09.461
Tire tracks.

282
00:18:10.461 --> 00:18:11.861
They're still fresh.

283
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:13.661
That way.

284
00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:36.361
The truck stopped here.

285
00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:39.361
Look.

286
00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:47.361
Soil just recently turned up under the leaves.

287
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:49.061
We found it.

288
00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.361
Let's dig.

289
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:52.761
Here?

290
00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:15.861
We found it.

291
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:17.661
Oh, no.

292
00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.561
What's going on?

293
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:26.461
Conan. What is this?

294
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:28.561
Well, the truth is...

295
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:33.161
When Kurata and Suzuki were fighting, something happened.

296
00:19:33.161 --> 00:19:39.961
That made the killer, the victim and the victim, the killer.

297
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:42.161
Kurata getting killed,

298
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:48.061
and Suzuki over there becoming the killer.

299
00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:56.361
Did I get anything wrong, Mr. Suzuki?

300
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:03.461
I knew it when I saw the ashtray inside the truck.

301
00:20:03.461 --> 00:20:07.961
All of the cigarette butts in the mound were put out

302
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:12.161
the same way crushed at the tip and bent sharply.

303
00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:15.861
Exactly the same as the cigarette butts in front of you

304
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:18.961
in the group photo taken during the trip

305
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:21.361
and the same brand.

306
00:20:23.061 --> 00:20:25.761
When I saw that, I was convinced that

307
00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:28.161
the man who drove the truck for 3 hours last night

308
00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:32.161
was not Mr. Kurata, but you.

309
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:38.561
I didn't mean to kill him. It was self defense.

310
00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:42.961
It is for the judge to decide, not us.

311
00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:45.761
You brat.

312
00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:50.961
I'm no brat.

313
00:20:50.961 --> 00:20:54.161
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

314
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:55.961
And we are...

315
00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:58.461
The Youth Detective Squad.

316
00:20:58.461 --> 00:21:00.761
He was wrong!

317
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.861
It's not my fault.

318
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.261
I just... just...

319
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:06.961
Oh, darn it.

320
00:21:12.061 --> 00:21:15.561
Oh, yes. I forgot to tell you.

321
00:21:15.561 --> 00:21:19.061
I've already reported to the police.

322
00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:23.761
Darn it!

323
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.161
Ouch...

324
00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:38.661
Don't move.

325
00:21:38.661 --> 00:21:40.061
Keep still.

326
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:41.661
Give up.

327
00:21:41.661 --> 00:21:44.261
You, brats!

328
00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:57.361
Hey, what happened to him?

329
00:21:57.361 --> 00:21:59.761
He tripped on himself and passed out.

330
00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:02.561
-That means... -We did it!

331
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:07.161
Another victory for the Youth Detective Squad!

332
00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:42.461
Conan.

333
00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:50.361
Let's play.

334
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:52.861
Why don't we play another detective game?

335
00:23:52.861 --> 00:23:55.161
Let's go look for another crime.

336
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:58.861
You must join us next time.

337
00:23:58.861 --> 00:24:03.661
Hey, I'm not... when do you learn?

338
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:07.861
Ayaka, what happened?

339
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:13.161
What in the world is going on?

340
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:16.361
Mr. Majima?

341
00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:20.061
Don't enter. This is a murder scene.

342
00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:23.261
Strange? What's so strange?

343
00:24:25.661 --> 00:24:27.961
What is this?

344
00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:31.161
Next Conan,

345
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:33.161
"Mystery of the Japanese Water Flowing Rock Garden"

346
00:24:33.161 --> 00:24:35.182
"(Part 1)"

347
00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:37.779
Next Conan's Hint:

348
00:24:37.779 --> 00:24:40.079
"Beautiful rock garden"
