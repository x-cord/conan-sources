1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,099
Speed!

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:04,199
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,899
Our car with three of us inside was rigged in a way that

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,599
it would explode if the speed is reduced!

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:08,999
What're you going to do, Pops?

6
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,499
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:11,999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,199
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,500
"Chasing rabbits in the mountains"

10
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,400
"of my homeland."

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,400
"Fishing on a small boat"

12
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,600
"in the river of my homeland."

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
Ran. How much more is there to go

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
before we reach the hot spring we're headed for?

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,900
Just about 100 km more.

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,600
We've only driven 10 km so far.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,500
Dad! You've been asking the same question every five minutes.

18
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,200
I don't mind you being super happy.

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,700
But please watch out not to speed so much.

20
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,700
I know. Today sure is a nice day.

21
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Bathing in a hot spring.

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,000
Delicious food, good liquor.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Moreover, we get to enjoy all of it at half price!

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
I'd like to speak to Inspector Megure

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,300
of MPD First Investigation Division.

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,900
Dad...

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
-Ran, will you answer it. -Okay.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,500
Who is it from?

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's see. Inspector Megure?

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Inspector Megure?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,300
-Hello. -Mouri! Where are you now?

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
In Takaoka-cho.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is Ran.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,300
I'm in the car together with Conan and dad.

35
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Ran? Takaoka-cho?

36
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,000
Their present location is Takaoka-cho!

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,100
What does the Inspector want?

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,400
Well...

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Listen, Ran.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,100
Stay calm and listen.

42
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,900
The car that you're riding in now is...

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
An explosive device is rigged onto it!

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
An explosive device?

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
What?

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
Ran!

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,600
If the car that you're in now go further than 10 km,

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
the switch of the explosive device will turn on.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,800
Ten km?

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,300
Then the switch has already...

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,400
The car...

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Don't stop the car!

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Keep going the way you are!

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,700
Once the car reduces speed to below 20 km/h...

55
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,400
it'll explode!

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,900
It seems that a device that works that way is rigged to the car.

57
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,100
"Rental Car Goes Out of Control"

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,600
But, Inspector, maybe someone's just playing a prank.

59
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,400
The culprit says that he will first blow up the water tower.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,300
So as long as we haven't confirm whether or not this warning is true,

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,800
it's better to think that a real explosive device is attached.

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,900
An explosive device.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,400
A bomb.

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,900
A time bomb is rigged so that when Pops goes by, it will explode.

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,100
This is a demonstration to show.

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,400
That was done to prove this wasn't a lie.

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,300
It's a demonstration

68
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,100
from the culprit who set the bomb to this car.

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
Mouri?

70
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,200
Mouri!

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,500
Don't worry.

72
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,100
Just stay calm and drive on.

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
I've deployed an emergency squad just now.

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
We're counting on you.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We'll catch up with you soon too.

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,000
And Inspector, about the culprit...

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,700
All right, I'll tell you now.

78
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,100
Just a while ago, I got a call from a man who called himself Sugiyama.

79
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,000
It's most probably an alias, though.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,500
He said that he rigged an explosive device

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
to the car that Kogoro Mouri rented.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you have any idea who this Sugiyama could be?

83
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Sugiyama.

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,400
The name of the worker at the rental car company was called Sugiyama.

85
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
That man introduced

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,800
this half price discount hot spring campaign we're headed for today.

87
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,700
But why me?

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,900
He says that if he kills you, a famed detective,

89
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,600
he would be famous as well.

90
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,500
I thought it may be a prank.

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,800
But he's aware of your moves.

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
And he did blow up the water tower.

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
So, we've no choice but to subject to his orders.

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
Orders?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
Sugiyama is saying

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,900
he wants you to take the expressway.

97
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,300
Expressway? What's his purpose?

98
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,600
I don't know.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Until we get a hold of the situation,

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
please do as he says.

101
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,100
All right.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,800
The culprit disclosed his name

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,100
and ordered the car to take the expressway.

104
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,800
Could there be a reason for the culprit having chosen today too, then?

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Report on the circumstances on the road block

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
near the Takaoka ramp of the expressway.

107
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,200
The east intersection of the expressway toward Takaoka is now closed.

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Likewise, roads leading to Takaoka-cho have been blocked.

109
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Route eight leading to the Takaoka ramp has been blocked

110
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,900
and a detour has already been secured.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,900
All the sidewalks near the respective roads have been blocked off.

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Confirmation of all roads that have been blocked is completed.

113
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,600
The detour to the expressway has also been set.

114
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Roger.

115
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,000
Mouri! We have visibly confirmed your car.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,700
Starting now a speed cop on a white motorbike will lead your car along.

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,100
Got it!

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
Ran, Conan.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,200
The Inspector come to help us.

120
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
The police will handle this matter for us.

121
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,700
So don't worry.

122
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,400
Okay.

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Kogoro Mouri. Writhe in agony!

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,900
I'll watch you suffer for a while, then kill you.

125
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,900
You gotta be kidding!

126
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
What's up, dad?

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
Gas.

128
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,900
We only have less than half left!

129
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm sure it was on full when we rented this car.

130
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,700
Darn it!

131
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,900
He made us confirm the tank once

132
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,000
and after we checked, he drained the gas out just before we left.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,300
Don't worry! I'll get you two out of this car

134
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,900
before we run out of gas.

135
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,600
Mouri, let's get the two out of the car first.

136
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,900
Open the window, please.

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,500
It won't open!

138
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,000
The door won't open either!

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ran, what about that side?

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
This side is no good either.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Darn it! He broke it beforehand.

142
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,600
The gas is less than half.

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,900
If we go at 20 km/h which is the minimum speed,

144
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
we've got to maintain we may at most keep for an hour.

145
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,400
Once we run out of gas, the car will stop and explode.

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,100
The windows and doors cannot be opened from inside.

147
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,200
What now?

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,500
This is Megure.

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,400
Officer Takagi, where are you now?

150
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm approaching the merge!

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Inspector Megure, sorry to keep you waiting!

152
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm counting on you, Takagi.

153
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Good! Keep this position!

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,700
Roger!

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm counting on you.

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Takagi.

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Conan. Let's back off from the window.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Even if the glass is successfully cracked

159
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
and Ran and I get to evacuate from the car.

160
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,400
What about Pops?

161
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,900
If he takes his foot off the accelerator when escaping,

162
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,500
the car will reduce speed.

163
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,100
What should I do?

164
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
While maintaining the speed at over 20 km/h,

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
will anything work?

166
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
The position of the tires!

167
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,100
The position of the tires are falling out of line!

168
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,700
Back the car off a bit!

169
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Okay!

170
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,400
Tires...

171
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,700
Spin.

172
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,600
Tires!

173
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Stop without stopping.

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,900
That's it!

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Yes, we've got to do it. In order to do it...

176
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Ran! Conan!

177
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Officer Takagi, hurry and help us! I'm scared!

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Hold on, Conan.

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300
Okay!

180
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,800
I'll pull you out right now!

181
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,800
Darn it!

182
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Conan!

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Are you all right, Conan?

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, once more!

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
-It'll be okay. Stay calm. -Okay.

186
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,500
They rescued one person.

187
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,200
Well...

188
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Only 10 minutes before the car runs out of gas.

189
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,200
That's the time Mouri dies.

190
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
We've safely secured Conan!

191
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,500
Next, we'll work on getting Ran out!

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
Oh, no! Inspector Megure!

193
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Bad news! The car is approaching a jammed area several km away.

194
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,700
A space enough to let one car through has been secured

195
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,400
but going pass while moving is impossible.

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
We may have to drop rescuing while the car is moving!

197
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,000
Please stop the rescue procedure!

198
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,200
Ran! Hurry!

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
-Ran! -Quick!

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Ran!

201
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,000
No good, can't do!

202
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,400
No good!

203
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Takagi, get way! Hurry!

204
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,400
Ran.

205
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,100
Mouri.

206
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
Inspector!

207
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,800
Pops said...

208
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,792
Ran.

209
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,492
Cover your head with my jacket.

210
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:56,092
And after you jump out, get down right away.

211
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:59,492
You may get hurt but it's better than losing your life.

212
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,392
You can do it.

213
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,092
But what about you, dad?

214
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,392
First priority is for you to be saved.

215
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,992
Listen to me, I'm your parent.

216
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,192
Mouri?

217
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,992
Can you hear me, Mouri?

218
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,892
Just a while more.

219
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:25,492
Just a little while more, big brother!

220
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:27,592
Ichiro Matsumiya?

221
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:28,792
Yes.

222
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,492
The case that you and I were after.

223
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:34,792
The culprit who killed his girlfriend who fell out of love with him.

224
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,592
He was being pursued by us

225
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,592
and sped his motorbike along the expressway.

226
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,592
He crashed into a fence at the turn off and died

227
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,292
three years ago today.

228
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:49,192
But, didn't he commit suicide?

229
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,992
Matsumiya had a younger brother that was staying in the U.S.

230
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,492
as a student back then.

231
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,092
If he thinks that we were responsible

232
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:56,992
for his older brother's death

233
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,792
without knowing of all that happened then...

234
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:03,292
No. He has a grudge against us because of a misunderstanding?

235
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,892
We're looking for the whereabouts of Matsumiya's younger brother now.

236
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:09,192
We'll take custody of him soon.

237
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,592
And...

238
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,392
how's the gas tank?

239
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:16,192
It's practically on empty.

240
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,392
I wonder how much longer it's going to hold up.

241
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,392
Ran.

242
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,592
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,892
I got you messed up in this because of me.

244
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,892
You can do it.

245
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,492
Hurry up and go!

246
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:32,992
Dad.

247
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,492
Stupid! Get out of my way!

248
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,092
Don't come near me!

249
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:54,092
Kogoro Mouri.

250
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:57,292
The time for us to part is about to come.

251
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:00,392
That tunnel will be your grave!

252
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:54,892
I did it...

253
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:57,392
I killed Kogoro Mouri.

254
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,092
I avenged my brother's death.

255
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:00,392
Big brother!

256
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,792
Where are you going?

257
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,392
I'm Megure from the Metropolitan Police Department.

258
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:16,992
You're Mr. Jiro Matsumiya?

259
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:24,492
I checked the cases having to do with the expressway

260
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:27,992
three years ago today that involved Kogoro Mouri

261
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:31,892
and found the case involving your older brother, Mr. Ichiro Matsumiya.

262
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:34,192
And thus, found you, Mr. Jiro Matusmiya.

263
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:37,192
That's how we got to you.

264
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,892
So, what?

265
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,092
There is suspicion that the Public Roads Administration's security

266
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:46,192
was hacked by the computer at your residence today.

267
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,792
We'd like to ask you questions on it.

268
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,792
So please come with us to the station.

269
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,692
What's the matter?

270
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,892
Mr. Sugiyama...

271
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:01,192
No, Mr. Matsumiya.

272
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:04,092
You look like you've seen a ghost or something.

273
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,492
Why?

274
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,692
Why are...

275
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,392
why are you alive?

276
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,492
I'm alive and kicking as you can see.

277
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,492
It was set to explode when the car stopped.

278
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:20,992
The car's still running while gas is being pumped into it.

279
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:21,992
It's only a matter of time

280
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,292
until the bomb disposal squad removes the explosive device.

281
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,392
How?

282
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:28,292
The device is on the back of the body of the car!

283
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,292
There's no way it can be removed!

284
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:34,792
The car isn't stopped but still running.

285
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,692
They're working to remove the explosive device right now.

286
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:54,992
The speed is being maintained at 20 km/h.

287
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,492
When on earth...

288
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:00,892
What about that explosion?

289
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:04,692
Yeah. In that tunnel...

290
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,092
On the bed of a large truck

291
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:17,792
and by the bomb disposal squad that was in the tunnel beforehand.

292
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,792
A slope was used, a net was hooked up.

293
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,492
All set!

294
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:31,192
The car that I drove was lead onto a large truck.

295
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:42,192
The car that is on the truck was stopped by the net

296
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:45,192
and the tires are still spinning on rollers.

297
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,392
Afterwards, the bomb disposal squad were able to move in and rescue Ran

298
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:50,492
and keep supplying gas to the car.

299
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:53,492
They opened the door on my side

300
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,792
and fixed the accelerator in place.

301
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:05,592
Like so, the car is stopped but the tires are still spinning.

302
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:09,192
Thus, the explosive device can be removed.

303
00:20:09,192 --> 00:20:11,392
A smoke candle and fireworks were used...

304
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:12,792
Fire!

305
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,392
We rigged it so that it would look like the car exploded.

306
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,192
No way.

307
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,292
It can't be.

308
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,692
Darn it!

309
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,992
If you guys didn't chase my brother too far.

310
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,792
He didn't have to die.

311
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,592
Just what're you talking about?

312
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:33,592
Your brother committed suicide.

313
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:34,892
Wrong!

314
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:38,092
Brother was killed by all of you!

315
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:41,192
My older brother was not such a weak person that would commit suicide!

316
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,792
There were no brake traces at the scene

317
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,692
where your brother crashed.

318
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,492
Moreover, he took off his helmet and threw it down

319
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,792
just before crashing into the fence.

320
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,692
He was determined to die.

321
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:54,992
No.

322
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,292
Matsumiya.

323
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,292
It's your biased perception.

324
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:02,592
Besides, do you think your dead brother is happy about what you did?

325
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,292
Shut up!

326
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:08,592
Matsumiya. Unlike your brother, you're a lucky guy.

327
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:11,392
Nobody's dead.

328
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:16,092
You're not a killer.

329
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:19,792
Mouri.

330
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:23,792
Well, lucky you found out the truth. I'm glad.

331
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:29,392
Mr. Mouri.

332
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,192
Well, it sure was a surprise.

333
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:13,392
That the driver of that huge truck was Officer Sato.

334
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,792
Yes, it was me!

335
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,392
There's nothing to be surprised of, is there?

336
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:24,192
After all, you're the one who gave us order of what to do through Conan.

337
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:28,592
What's the matter, dad?

338
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:30,892
We've got to hurry to the hot spring!

339
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:32,992
Why don't you go again some other day?

340
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:36,692
No, the half price discount sale is just for today!

341
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:41,792
Maybe that was just a made-up story to get us to ride the car.

342
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,292
No way!

343
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:46,992
Maybe only that part is true.

344
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,292
So, Inspector Megure.

345
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,692
Could you lend us a police car?

346
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:55,292
You idiot! Just what're you talking about?

347
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,992
Well, you know...

348
00:23:56,992 --> 00:23:59,492
You've really got a great personality, Pops.

349
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,492
"Next Episode"

350
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:07,192
Okay, let's go to the library then.

351
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,992
Oh, wait!

352
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,192
Shinichi.

353
00:24:24,392 --> 00:24:26,192
It won't open!

354
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,192
What?

355
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:33,092
Next Conan, "The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 1)"

356
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:50,592
Next Conan's Hint:

357
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,992
"Shinichi Kudo's younger brother"

358
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,292
The next episode will be about 10 years ago.

359
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,792
Which means you're not in it, right, Conan?

360
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,992
-But Shinichi was. -Right?
