1
00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:02.224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:04.224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:05.824
Hattori Heiji has returned.

4
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:08.124
He solves a mystery with Jodie.

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.924
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.111
What?

9
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.611
All the investigation records of the cases that

10
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.711
Detective Mouri helped solve,

11
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:04.911
were stolen from the Metropolitan Police?

12
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:05.911
Yeah.

13
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:09.311
Did Officer Takagi really say that?

14
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.611
Not so loud.

15
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:15.611
Hey, don't tell me that the thieves are...

16
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.211
Yeah, maybe they had a hand in this.

17
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.611
If they heard rumors that I, who was supposed to have been dead

18
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:23.811
by that drug, am still alive,

19
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.111
and if they noticed something suspicious

20
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.611
about Kogoro Mouri's deductions,

21
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.411
it's possible.

22
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.311
And if someone among the men in black found out that

23
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:37.611
Shinichi Kudo was advising Kogoro Mouri...

24
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.311
Well, my disappearance

25
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:46.711
coincided with the time when "Sleeping Kogoro" started,

26
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.111
so it wouldn't surprise me if they thought it strange.

27
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.911
Yet, rumors are rumors. Don't worry.

28
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:58.411
Shinichi Kudo isn't around anymore.

29
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.311
And no one could imagine that the drug shrank me

30
00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:06.811
and that I'm still solving cases by, putting Pops to sleep.

31
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:08.911
Even if they did see me going around solving cases

32
00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:10.611
behind the scenes,

33
00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:14.911
they'd only think of me as a super smart kid for my age.

34
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:16.411
Besides, it hasn't been determined that

35
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:19.311
they're the ones who stole the records yet.

36
00:03:19.311 --> 00:03:21.311
Yeah, but...

37
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.711
Oh, well, it's definite that someone is spying on Pops.

38
00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:29.311
Just in case, I have a favor to ask you, Doc.

39
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:33.611
You use me when you want and then you ignore me.

40
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.311
Why don't you go ask someone more reliable than me, huh?

41
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:42.311
So, are you mad that I didn't tell you about the stolen records?

42
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.611
Humph!

43
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.811
Hey, don't be mad at me, Doc.

44
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.411
I can't help it

45
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:53.011
because she was there at the time.

46
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.611
She? You mean Ai?

47
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:57.911
Yeah. If she knew that

48
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:01.211
somebody was snooping something around here,

49
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:06.311
I'm sure she would refuse to go out again.

50
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.911
That's why I gave her my word

51
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.611
and told her not to worry, because I'd would do everything I could

52
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:14.411
to help her if things start looking bad.

53
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.511
So you see, I can't have worrying.

54
00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:22.711
Now, where's Haibara?

55
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:25.811
In the lab downstairs, I think.

56
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.011
Anyway, don't let her know about this.

57
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:33.811
She's not as tough as she pretends to be.

58
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.911
Idiot.

59
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.811
"English Teacher vs. Great Western Detective"

60
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.411
"(Part 1)"

61
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:49.211
But there's something I don't get.

62
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.511
What is it?

63
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.511
The guy who stole the files

64
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.811
sent everything back to the Metropolitan Police,

65
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.411
in a sealed envelope.

66
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.311
Well, the culprit probably returned the files

67
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:03.311
because he or she already finished examining them.

68
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.211
That's nuts. If they finished examining the files,

69
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:07.011
then why didn't they just throw them away?

70
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:10.111
Why would they go out of their way to send the files back

71
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.011
and breed more suspicion?

72
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.411
That's true.

73
00:05:15.411 --> 00:05:16.711
The most possible explanation is that

74
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:18.711
they trying to relay a defiant message,

75
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:21.911
"We're already on to all your tricks."

76
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:23.111
Or...

77
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:26.511
They're trying to lure someone out.

78
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:30.111
Well, in this case, the person they are trying to lure out is...

79
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:32.411
Kudo, you, that is.

80
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:35.111
Yeah. Most likely.

81
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.811
What I don't get is if it's really a trap,

82
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:42.111
then why are they doing it in such a complicated way?

83
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:43.411
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:47.411
There're a lot of ways to lure someone out...

85
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.911
What... why are you doing here, Hattori?

86
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.211
This old man called me,

87
00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:03.111
saying that if I, your best friend, came,

88
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.311
I could help you.

89
00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:07.411
Well, I was under the impression that

90
00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:09.011
Shinichi was burdened with something

91
00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:11.511
he had a hard time finding a way out from.

92
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.511
But I guess we're dealing with something similar to grasping clouds,

93
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:16.811
so there's not much we can do.

94
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:19.111
Wrong, old man.

95
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:23.411
Why do you think Kudo came to tell you such an important thing,

96
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:25.511
which he hadn't told you until now?

97
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:27.411
He came here either because he found

98
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:29.711
a very important piece of information,

99
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.311
or because he has found a way to counter-attack them.

100
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:38.511
Hey, correct? Say something, will you?

101
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:40.911
You face is telling me that I hit the mark.

102
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:44.711
Well, do you remember I told you before,

103
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:48.811
that I had a brush with them at Haido City Hotel?

104
00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:51.811
Yeah. You went there with that little girl named Haibara

105
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.511
and hunted down the old man named Pisco, right?

106
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:57.911
That's right.

107
00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:01.111
I've been wondering for a while.

108
00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:03.811
Why did Pisco have the handkerchief of the party,

109
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:04.711
which he wasn't supposed to have,

110
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:07.611
when he was questioned at the police station?

111
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:13.111
There were 7 suspects detained for questioning by the police.

112
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:15.311
Of course, Pisco didn't think that his handkerchief

113
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:17.811
would be checked by the police.

114
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:19.311
That means...

115
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:21.111
An accomplice.

116
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:25.011
Someone among the other six suspect,

117
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.611
who knew that he was gonna be checked first,

118
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:31.611
secretly gave Pisco the handkerchief.

119
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:33.911
Besides Pisco, the other six suspects were

120
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.511
Mika Nanjo, Yasuo Mihei, Yoshiharu Tahara,

121
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:42.611
Naoya Tarumi, Naomichi Mugikura and Chris Vineyard.

122
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.811
All six of them are celebrities who appear frequently on the media.

123
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:48.211
But there is one person

124
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.311
who announced taking a break from work, and disappeared

125
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:53.111
since that case.

126
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:54.911
And that is...

127
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:58.411
Chris Vineyard.

128
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.511
The American movie star.

129
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:05.811
Chris? The second generation actress?

130
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.811
Oh, that clever and beautiful actress with big boobs?

131
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:13.611
Yeah, the only child of the famous actress, Sharon Vineyard.

132
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:18.911
I checked on a lot of things, but, she's the most suspicious.

133
00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:21.011
I didn't want to think so though.

134
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.711
So, I want to ask a favor of you, Doc.

135
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:25.411
What is it?

136
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.111
An internet address?

137
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:30.111
Yeah.

138
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:31.611
It's a website uploaded by fervent fans of hers

139
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.511
wanting her to come back.

140
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.911
Can you access the site and gather information?

141
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:40.611
Her biographical data, interests or habits.

142
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.511
Any hot topics, anything that her fans know about her.

143
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:45.411
Going to the Internet Cafe any more than

144
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:49.111
I already have, as a kid, checking out foreign websites

145
00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:52.511
is going to make people suspicious of me.

146
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:54.011
Okay, I'll try,

147
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:56.611
but what're you gonna do with all the information?

148
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:59.611
Well, it may come in handy one day.

149
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:01.311
You have somebody, don't you?

150
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.711
There's a suspicious foreign woman around you.

151
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.311
Don't be silly. No way.

152
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.811
No joke?

153
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.711
Hey. Are you talking about Jodie, the teacher?

154
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.311
Jodie?

155
00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:17.711
Who's she?

156
00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:18.911
She's...

157
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:22.811
She's a newly appointed English teacher at Ran's high school.

158
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:26.411
A newly appointed English teacher?

159
00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:29.411
Idiot. If you tell him things like that...

160
00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:32.911
All right. Let's go to her house.

161
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.711
I knew it.

162
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:36.111
Do you know where she lives?

163
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:38.511
Well, we can ask Ran.

164
00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:45.011
If things go well, we might get that medicine called Ahotoxin.

165
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:47.111
It's Apotoxin.

166
00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:49.311
I'll bet you think those guys are no big deal.

167
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:53.411
You can stay here and not go if you don't want to.

168
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:54.811
What the...

169
00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:02.911
What a tall building.

170
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:06.111
Are all English teachers really that rich?

171
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:11.111
I remember hearing from Ran that her parents are very rich.

172
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.911
Okay, it's Room 4 on the 21st floor.

173
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:18.911
That way.

174
00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:25.011
Here. Jodie Saintemillion.

175
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:26.511
All right, Hattori.

176
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:28.411
You are here only to gather information today.

177
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.211
Don't get funny, now.

178
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:32.111
Okay, I know.

179
00:10:32.111 --> 00:10:35.811
So, what're you gonna say to her? Why are we here?

180
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:37.811
What? You haven't thought of anything?

181
00:10:37.811 --> 00:10:39.611
This is your idea, you know.

182
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:41.411
What makes you think I'd know what to say

183
00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:43.211
when this is the first time I'm seeing her?

184
00:10:43.211 --> 00:10:46.511
Oh, come on. Never mind then, let's head on home.

185
00:10:46.511 --> 00:10:48.511
We don't want her getting suspicious.

186
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:52.511
Get off it, idiot. We can't turn back after coming this far...

187
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:56.311
Who is it?

188
00:10:58.011 --> 00:10:59.211
Shoots.

189
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:03.111
Oh, it's me, Conan.

190
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:04.411
Conan?

191
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:08.211
Oh, the cool, kid? What's up, Conan?

192
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.111
I just came to see you.

193
00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:14.511
Okay, wait a minute.

194
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:20.711
All right, all right. I'm not drunk.

195
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:23.911
I can walk on my own, so let me go, Nakamachi.

196
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.911
Oh, look out, Mr. Kawakami.

197
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:30.711
I'm sorry,

198
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:34.411
he gave you both a bad time.

199
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.211
No problem, Mr. Takai is always like that when he's drunk.

200
00:11:40.911 --> 00:11:43.911
I'll bet his true self shows when he gets drunk.

201
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:46.711
You also turn nasty when you're drunk.

202
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.011
Shut up.

203
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.411
What's taking her so long?

204
00:11:54.411 --> 00:11:56.511
How long do we have to wait?

205
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.111
Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.

206
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.811
I was taking a bath. Sorry.

207
00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:09.511
Oh, are you cool kid's friend?

208
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:10.911
Yeah.

209
00:12:10.911 --> 00:12:13.211
Come on in.

210
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:18.211
But I don't have anything to serve you today.

211
00:12:19.011 --> 00:12:21.111
Shall we go out for dinner?

212
00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:23.211
Oh... yes.

213
00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:26.411
I'll go get ready then.

214
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:28.711
So, please wait in the living room.

215
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:32.011
Um, before that, may I use the bathroom?

216
00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:36.011
Oh, me too. I've been holding back for a while.

217
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.111
Okay. The rest room is over there.

218
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:41.511
Thanks.

219
00:13:08.811 --> 00:13:12.511
Oh. So, you're also friends with Ms. Mouri.

220
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:14.911
That's right. Nice to meet you.

221
00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:18.511
But I was surprised.

222
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:20.811
I didn't know that cool kid and Ms. Mouri

223
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:22.911
had a foreign friend like you.

224
00:13:22.911 --> 00:13:24.011
Foreign friend?

225
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.711
Your skin is quite dark for a Japanese.

226
00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:30.911
And your Japanese is a bit strange.

227
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:36.711
Idiot! Osaka-Ben is authentically Japanese!

228
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:40.111
Osaka-Ben? Is it some kind of Bento lunch box?

229
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.011
Hey, teacher.

230
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:43.211
It's a dialect of Japanese.

231
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:44.711
You know, there are also dialects in the U.S. too, right?

232
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:46.411
Like the Southern drawl.

233
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:49.311
Oh, yes, there are.

234
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:52.511
Osaka-Ben is authentically Japanese.

235
00:13:57.111 --> 00:14:00.011
Look? It's the woman we just saw.

236
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:04.811
Oh. She's my next door neighbor, Mr. Takai's girlfriend.

237
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.511
What's she doing, taking photos here?

238
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:14.311
What's that?

239
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:19.211
It's a cell phone.

240
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:21.111
Why would it be in a place like this?

241
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.311
It fell from above.

242
00:14:47.361 --> 00:14:49.161
Instant death.

243
00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:50.161
Yeah.

244
00:14:53.161 --> 00:14:54.461
But this guy...

245
00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.461
Where the heck did he fall from?

246
00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:06.461
Perhaps from the 21st floor.

247
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:08.761
How do you know?

248
00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:13.961
Actually he's my neighbor, Mr. Takai.

249
00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:16.061
What? You kidding.

250
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:17.361
It can't be true?

251
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:18.861
It's not Mr. Takai.

252
00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:33.661
So, she's Mr. Takai's girlfriend, right?

253
00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:34.861
Yes.

254
00:15:34.861 --> 00:15:39.261
Well, was Mr. Takai still in his room

255
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:41.961
when you left with the two men?

256
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.961
What? Oh, yes.

257
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:46.961
I'm sure he was drunk and asleep in bed.

258
00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:50.761
But why... why did he commit suicide?

259
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.961
Why? How do you know he committed suicide?

260
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:01.561
Maybe someone else in the room pushed him to the ground.

261
00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.861
Of course I know!

262
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:05.361
There was no one but him back in the room.

263
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:07.761
And I locked the front door when leaving,

264
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:09.561
and besides that's the only key there is.

265
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:14.761
Moreover, you can't hear the doorbell when you're in the bedroom.

266
00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:17.061
There's no other possible explanation but suicide.

267
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:18.061
No.

268
00:16:18.761 --> 00:16:20.561
It's doesn't necessarily have to be so.

269
00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:24.161
Hey. Look at this.

270
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:26.461
This is Mr. Takai's cell phone, right?

271
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:30.461
He talked with someone named Mr. Kawakami just before falling down

272
00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:33.061
And a minute before that, he seemed to have read a mail

273
00:16:33.061 --> 00:16:35.061
from a man named Mr. Nakamachi.

274
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:37.861
Besides, before Mr. Takai fell,

275
00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:43.461
there was a strange woman taking photos of this condo in the dark.

276
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.661
Oh, that was...

277
00:16:45.661 --> 00:16:47.361
Anyway, can you tell us more about it later,

278
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:49.561
after we call Mr. Kawakami who mailed him

279
00:16:49.561 --> 00:16:51.561
and Mr. Nakamachi who called him,

280
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:54.061
and the police as well?

281
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:15.761
Oh, I see.

282
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:17.861
You were taking pictures of this condo

283
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:19.961
where your boyfriend, Mr. Takai lived,

284
00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:24.061
because you wanted to show its exterior to your friends, right?

285
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:27.561
Yes. This is the first time I came here.

286
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:30.761
And I was going to go back to his room.

287
00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:34.661
After took some photos, a person suddenly came falling to the ground.

288
00:17:34.661 --> 00:17:37.561
I didn't think it would be Mr. Takai.

289
00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:41.161
But that's strange.

290
00:17:41.161 --> 00:17:45.061
You left Mr. Takai's room around 5pm

291
00:17:45.061 --> 00:17:47.561
but he fell just after 6 o'clock.

292
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:51.961
So, were you taking pictures for a whole hour?

293
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:59.561
No. I started taking pictures after I drove the two men home,

294
00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:02.061
because they were both quite drunk.

295
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:04.861
Excuse me, what is your connection with her?

296
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:07.361
We're working for the same company

297
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:12.161
We were drinking in the afternoon at Mr. Takai's room

298
00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:15.261
to celebrate his promotion from chief to director.

299
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:19.061
We were going to drink until much later.

300
00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:21.861
But Mr. Takai got too drunk.

301
00:18:21.861 --> 00:18:23.461
We had to cut the party short,

302
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:26.361
because that guy started taunting us, saying,

303
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:28.361
'If you want a promotion, you have to get rid of your emotions'

304
00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:30.361
'and just continue looking up ahead.'

305
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:33.261
'As long as you can't do so, you can't move up'

306
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:35.361
'the ladder no matter how much you try.'

307
00:18:35.361 --> 00:18:38.961
Oh, he said, if you want promotion, get rid of your emotions?

308
00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:42.261
Yes. So, after Ms. Shimoda drove me home,

309
00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:44.761
I sent an email to Mr. Takai.

310
00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:48.361
Saying, 'Please don't forget to take care of your subordinates too'.

311
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.261
Because I remembered the incident of Ms. Hiraya too.

312
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:52.861
Ms. Hiraya?

313
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:55.861
Sumiyo Hiraya who committed suicide last month.

314
00:18:55.861 --> 00:18:58.161
She was a co-worker of ours.

315
00:18:58.161 --> 00:18:59.161
Suicide?

316
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:00.161
Yeah.

317
00:19:00.161 --> 00:19:04.261
Ms. Hiraya was two years Nakamachi's senior in junior high school.

318
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:08.161
And, she and he were also Takai's, as well as my junior in college.

319
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.661
So, Takai took a big-brotherly interest

320
00:19:10.661 --> 00:19:13.261
in Ms. Hiraya and Nakamachi, but...

321
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:17.561
Did Ms. Hiraya join the company in the same year as you, Ms. Shimoda?

322
00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:18.461
Yes.

323
00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:20.461
I see.

324
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:22.761
Then why did she kill herself?

325
00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.461
She suffered a nervous breakdown caused by overwork

326
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:26.461
and committed suicide.

327
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.761
Mr. Takai once threatened Ms. Hirai over drinks,

328
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:32.961
saying: 'If you can't fulfil your quota, you will be fired.'

329
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:35.361
I think she took the joke seriously.

330
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:39.461
Takai seemed to have forgotten all about it.

331
00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:42.161
So, after Ms. Shimoda drove me back home by car,

332
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:44.261
I called and told him,

333
00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:47.961
'It's your fault she's dead!'

334
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:52.661
'You've earned your promotion at the expense of her life.'

335
00:19:52.661 --> 00:19:56.461
Even Takai seemed to be in shock and at a loss for words.

336
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.861
After that, he suddenly hung up the phone.

337
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:02.261
I was told to come here, and this is what I see.

338
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:04.961
Then why did Mr. Takai jump to his death?

339
00:20:04.961 --> 00:20:07.061
Yeah, that's right.

340
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:10.661
It's almost like I killed him.

341
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:13.161
But, Inspector.

342
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:16.861
I didn't tell him, 'Drop dead right now.'

343
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:19.061
I just told him the truth.

344
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:21.761
I'm not going to be held criminally responsible for killing him, right?

345
00:20:21.761 --> 00:20:24.161
That's true.

346
00:20:24.161 --> 00:20:25.361
Okay. So, what more do you want to hear?

347
00:20:25.361 --> 00:20:26.961
Can we leave now?

348
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:30.061
We've already answered the same questions twice.

349
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:31.061
Twice?

350
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:36.361
We were asked the same questions before you came here.

351
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:38.261
By a foreign woman,

352
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:43.461
a boy speaking Osaka-Ben and a little kid with glasses.

353
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:46.361
Don't tell me those three are...

354
00:20:46.361 --> 00:20:48.061
Do you know where they're now?

355
00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:49.461
Oh, yes.

356
00:20:49.461 --> 00:20:53.861
They took the key to Mr. Takai's room and went to the 21st floor.

357
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.661
21st floor?

358
00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:14.861
So it was you after all?

359
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:18.061
I'm really glad you held back from entering the room.

360
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:21.061
All right, you can go now, leave this to us.

361
00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:23.061
What do you mean, huh?

362
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:24.961
Of course, we've already checked the room thoroughly.

363
00:21:24.961 --> 00:21:27.661
I've also taken a bunch of pictures of the room.

364
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:29.561
Oh, I see.

365
00:21:31.161 --> 00:21:34.761
Had the front door been locked?

366
00:21:34.761 --> 00:21:37.161
Yeah. It was locked up tight.

367
00:21:37.461 --> 00:21:40.461
Well, this room was locked up.

368
00:21:40.461 --> 00:21:43.061
So, it must be suicide.

369
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:46.061
That is what I first thought too.

370
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:50.961
Until I saw the curtain of the bed room window

371
00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:53.061
from which Mr.Takai jumped.

372
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:02.461
It's pretty much definite that he jumped from this window.

373
00:22:03.261 --> 00:22:06.561
But, isn't it just that the curtain blew outward because of the wind?

374
00:22:06.561 --> 00:22:08.361
Look closer.

375
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:11.961
The curtain was pulled down, so the curtain rail is bent,

376
00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:14.161
and 2 or 3 hooks seem to have come off, right?

377
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:17.061
This is evidence that he involuntarily grabbed the curtain

378
00:22:17.061 --> 00:22:19.661
when he came close to falling.

379
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:23.461
Would someone trying to kill himself do that?

380
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:26.561
If so, this is not suicide, but...

381
00:22:27.061 --> 00:22:28.261
Murder.

382
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:32.961
This is a homicide case.

383
00:24:05.561 --> 00:24:07.261
I don't get it.

384
00:24:07.261 --> 00:24:10.661
Me neither. I don't know how the culprit lead Mr. Takai

385
00:24:10.661 --> 00:24:13.361
to jump from the window?

386
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:14.361
Memo?

387
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:19.561
I see.

388
00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:21.361
That was it.

389
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:23.761
No mistake.

390
00:24:23.761 --> 00:24:27.061
Yeah, the murderer is that guy.

391
00:24:29.561 --> 00:24:30.961
