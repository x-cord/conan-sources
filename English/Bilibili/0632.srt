"Mouri Detective Agency" -"I am the timekeeper.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,740
You imbecile who blasphemies the passage of time,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,440
as punishment for this,

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,640
I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,640
at the exact time that you were born into this world.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,740
Timekeeper."

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,940
Wait.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,240
This is blackmail of forewarning of the intent of murder.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,540
Yes.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,240
"Oume Gakumichi (42)" -Every year since two years ago,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,040
"Hoshina Family Butler" -when Mrs. Hoshina's birthday approaches,

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
it's been sent here.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,540
That letter with no sender's name on it.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,140
But despite it coming from two years ago,

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,440
that is, last year as well as the year before last,

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,740
Mrs. Hoshina is fine, isn't she?

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
Yes.

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,540
Her birthday went well with nothing bad happening.

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,440
However, since she tells the guests about the letter,

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,340
the number of guests attending the party

21
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,040
keep decreasing year after year.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Therefore, you want me, Kogoro Mouri

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,040
to find out who the sender of that letter is?

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,140
Yes, sir!

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,040
So, we would like you to come to Mrs. Hoshina's 50th birthday party

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,140
and serve as her bodyguard.

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,440
A middle-aged lady in her fifties?

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,440
No, I'd like to decline the bodyguard part.

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,140
We were planning to pay you about this much.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,040
I'll accept the work!

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,940
Thank you so very much.

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,040
So,

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,340
what does blasphemy the passage of time mean?

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,640
Who knows?

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,140
Maybe it means somebody is going against time to the point of corruption?

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,240
If so, is that lady really not punctual or something?

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,940
No.

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,440
Well...

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
it's completely the other way around.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Like the fog clears.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Let's see through love and crime as well.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,140
A blackmail warning that time will be stopped is delivered.

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,340
Fear sweeps through the birthday party.

44
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,740
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,965
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 1)".

48
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:50,165
2 minutes and 17 seconds late.

49
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:54,165
You promised to come at 14:30, didn't you, Detective Mouri?

50
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,465
Well...

51
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:58,665
it was quite a walk from the garage to here

52
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:00,865
and moreover, it was also raining.

53
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,565
"Hoshina Rukako (50), Head the Hoshina Family" -My days are numbered,

54
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:06,665
so I don't want to waste even a second of my time.

55
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,365
And Mr. Oume,

56
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:12,065
the clock in the study is about a second delayed.

57
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,865
Yes, ma'am! I'll have them fix it immediately!

58
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,565
I see.

59
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:20,965
She commands time as if she were God.

60
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:22,665
Come, come now, Mrs. Hoshina.

61
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,865
Just as people need time to rest,

62
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,565
"Karube Teigo (45), Architect" -I think that it's better

63
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:33,865
to have the space to sometimes give clocks time to rest too.

64
00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,465
"Suou Chiaki (39)" -Clocks aren't alive

00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,265
"Interior Designer" -with blood flowing through them,

66
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:40,865
so I don't think they need to rest like humans, do they?

67
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,365
No, they're just like humans.

68
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:45,165
Unless you perform maintenance on them sometimes

69
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,965
like people go to get a physical exam,

70
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,665
they will rust and soon start malfunctioning.

71
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,965
Clocks keep on working

72
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,765
"Furagaki Rinsaku (64), Clock Technician" -even when we humans are asleep

73
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,465
and each time the clocks move to indicate time

74
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:58,465
the cogwheels wear out

75
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,765
and the springs also gradually become weak.

76
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:04,365
Who are they?

77
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:07,265
Mr. Karube who designed this building

78
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,265
and Ms. Suou who was in charge of interior decorating.

79
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:11,765
And he's Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

80
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,365
that is here in this building.

81
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:19,365
They're all guests who were invited to tonight's party.

82
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,265
I just came to check on the grand clock.

83
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:27,165
I just happened to be at your birthday party while I was at it.

84
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:30,065
Sorry, but I'm helping myself in.

85
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,865
I gave my word to an old friend

86
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,565
that I would take care of that grand clock

87
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,865
as long as I'm alive, you see.

88
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:39,065
An old friend?

89
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,865
A clock technician that was hired here before.

90
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:43,765
He was a very outstandingly skilled

91
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,065
and until he died of an accident four years ago,

92
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:50,165
he was in charge of almost all the clocks in this building.

93
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:53,065
If I remember correctly, was he your older brother?

94
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,165
Yes!

95
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,465
I got to do the interior here

96
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,965
because he introduced me here.

97
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:00,365
Oh, that's right, ma'am!

98
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:03,265
I found a really nice carpet,

99
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,465
but would you like to see a sample of it?

100
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,765
-Later then. -Yes, ma'am!

101
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:08,965
Well,

102
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,565
shall we all go inside instead of standing here talking.

103
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:14,465
I shall keep your umbrellas for you.

104
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:15,765
Thank you.

105
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,365
Sure.

106
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,765
-Thank you. -No problem.

107
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:21,465
Not me,

108
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,865
because it's a folding umbrella.

109
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:23,965
I see.

110
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:25,165
Here you go.

111
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,565
I shall take it for you.

112
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:28,765
But,

113
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,365
talk about a huge number of clocks!

114
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,465
Really.

115
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:36,465
Did you buy all this, Mrs. Hoshina?

116
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:37,565
Yes.

117
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,065
My late husband who died of an illness last year,

118
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,665
used to always complain about them

119
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,965
saying, "I feel like I married clocks".

120
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:49,665
Well, it's true that I'm entranced by clocks,

121
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,265
the cute tick-tocking sound

122
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:56,265
and the sound that it plays when the long hand faces the top of the clock.

123
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,565
It's true

124
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:07,365
that it sure is grand when they start sounding altogether.

125
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,465
True!

126
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:11,065
It's lively and almost like being at an amusement park!

127
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:13,365
-Mr. Oume. -Yes, ma'am?

128
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,365
One of the clocks is 0.5 seconds late!

129
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:18,865
What's going on?

130
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,365
I'm sorry!

131
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,065
I'll have it fixed immediately!

132
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,365
Then, go and tell him

133
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,065
just in case that unless all the clocks

134
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:30,165
sound in unison at 6:00 p.m. sharp, the time I was born,

135
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,265
he's fired!

136
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,865
I understand!

137
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:40,865
Nobody can adjust the clocks like your older brother did, after all.

138
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:46,165
I hired three people already to take his place after he passed away,

139
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:50,665
and yet there are one or two clocks that are late every week.

140
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:54,665
But not so for that large clock that comes with the building.

141
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:58,065
It's only been late a number of times during the past 10 years.

142
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:01,965
Well, the very one who made it comes every year to tune it up

143
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,665
so I guess it's only natural, but...

144
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,165
Fantastic!

145
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:15,165
This sure is quite overwhelming.

146
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,365
I wonder what this door is.

147
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,165
You mean the face of this clock

148
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:25,965
is also in view on the backyard side!

149
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:30,865
It's the man from before.

150
00:08:30,865 --> 00:08:33,865
Why is he facing the well and praying?

151
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:37,365
It's because he fell there and died.

152
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,365
My older brother, who used to be a clock technician here,

153
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,565
was repairing the face of the grand clock

154
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,665
when he was blown by the wind and...

155
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:48,265
The well was here before we rebuilt this place.

156
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:51,065
People are supposed to be here next week and bury it

157
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,065
because it's dangerous.

158
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,365
Everyone, I guess I'll offer my prayers later too then.

159
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,565
I used to be childhood friends with him, you see.

160
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,565
Please pray on my behalf too then.

161
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,865
Aren't you going to offer your prayers?

162
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,465
You're his baby sister, aren't you?

163
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,865
I already offered my prayers this morning.

164
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,665
Today is the day he passed away.

165
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,765
He died today?

166
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,865
In an accident on Mrs. Hoshina's birthday?

167
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:20,865
Yes.

168
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,765
Well, I'll tell you the details in my room.

169
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,765
I would like Detective Mouri to find out

170
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,765
who the sender of that blackmail is too.

171
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:32,865
Yes.

172
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:51,765
It was nothing.

173
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,765
So you mean,

174
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,365
she didn't tell you anything about the accident after all?

175
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:56,565
No,

176
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:59,265
she did tell me about the guy who she has business with

177
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,265
that hates her in detail, though.

178
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,165
So, the name of the sender of that letter

179
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,065
was "The timekeeper" right?

180
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,565
So what?

181
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,365
If so, then...

182
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,965
clock technicians are also timekeepers, aren't they?

183
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:17,465
Then, are you saying that the three clock technicians that she's hired

184
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,265
are the ones who sent her the blackmail?

185
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,765
It's just a possibility.

186
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:23,965
But if so,

187
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,965
it seems more likely that Mrs. Hoshina who's very particular about time

188
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:28,765
would be the timekeeper.

189
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:30,665
Mr. Oume, I think it's about time.

190
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,265
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:37,265
It's been bothering me from some time ago,

192
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:40,765
but that gold watch... May I have a look at it?

193
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,465
Yes, go ahead.

194
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,365
Very nice.

195
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:50,765
Well! The silver flashlight clock was nice too,

196
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:53,565
but this one matches you too, Mrs. Hoshina!

197
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:57,465
This is a one of a kind specially ordered watch

198
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,465
that I had a Swiss clock craftsman make for me.

199
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,865
I feel sorry for the watches that are on the verge of rusting

200
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,865
being put away in drawers just because of their capricious owner

201
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:09,565
who wants to purchase them at will.

202
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,065
You need not worry about that.

203
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,565
That watch has already been...

204
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,765
I don't have it anymore.

205
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:22,265
It broke, so I disposed of it.

206
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:27,765
-No. -A blackout?

207
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:28,865
Oh, no!

208
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,165
Come on,

209
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:43,565
she's going to blow out the candles of her birthday cake?

210
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,365
Hey, what's going on?

211
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,765
What? What's the matter?

212
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,265
Somebody fled from the window?

213
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:16,065
What was that?

214
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,265
The light!

215
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,865
Somebody, turn on the light!

216
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:36,712
I see.

217
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,512
After the candles on the birthday cake were blown out,

218
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:42,012
right after the room became dark,

219
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,012
someone pierced the chest of the owner of this building,

220
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:48,712
Rukako Hoshina in one blow.

221
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:51,212
Then within the few seconds before the lights were turned on again,

222
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,412
the culprit fled along with the weapon,

223
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:57,112
going out to the backyard through the window facing it?

224
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,812
Yes, sir. Please take a look at

225
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,412
the blood that splattered on the floor when Mrs. Hoshina was stabbed.

226
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:07,212
Just about here, there are no blood stains, are there?

227
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,112
This is evidence that when the culprit pulled the knife out,

228
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:11,712
he was standing here

229
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:14,112
and a lot of blood would've splattered on him.

230
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,912
In spite of this, although the people who are in this room

231
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,612
may have a slight amount of blood on them,

232
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,712
no one seems to have been splattered with a huge amount of blood.

233
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:26,712
Moreover, on the window frames and handrail of the balcony there

234
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,812
are traces of smeared blood.

235
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,712
Inspector, there is no doubt that the culprit

236
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:35,512
who was splattered with the victim's blood fled out that window.

237
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,412
But if so, Mr. Mouri,

238
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:40,712
the thing that's supposed to be here isn't.

239
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,012
This is the second floor.

240
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:48,512
If it was raining till evening and the ground was wet,

241
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:50,712
an obvious definite trace of it should be here, shouldn't it?

242
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:53,512
Traces of the shoe prints of the culprit

243
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,312
when he jumped to the ground from this balcony.

244
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:58,112
That... that's ridiculous!

245
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,412
It's started to rain again.

246
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:05,112
Are you sure that there are really no footprints of the culprit?

247
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,112
There were none.

248
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,212
Then, maybe the one who sent the blackmail

249
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:14,012
was the clock technician that died four years ago.

250
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,412
Idiot!

251
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,912
How can a dead person send a letter?

252
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,112
But...

253
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:23,112
the sender was "Timekeeper", right?

254
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,912
A clock technician is also a timekeeper, no?

255
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:29,312
What's this blackmail thing about?

256
00:14:29,312 --> 00:14:31,612
It seems to have been sent to the madam, the victim,

257
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:33,812
from about two years ago.

258
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:36,912
"I shall stop your time with my invisible sword

259
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:40,412
at the exact time that you were born into this world"

260
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,112
is what it says in the blackmail.

261
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,812
The time that she was born in this world?

262
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:49,312
It seems that the victim was born at exactly 18:00 today.

263
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:51,412
And she also seems to have blown out the candles

264
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:53,612
at 18:00 sharp every year.

265
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,212
And?

266
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,812
Did that clock technician who died four years ago

267
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,912
have a grudge against the victim?

268
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,612
I... I'm not sure of the details,

269
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,012
but it seems that he died of an accident

270
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:09,212
on the very day of Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

271
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,112
He didn't die.

272
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,912
He was killed!

273
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,412
By that callous woman who was dominated by time,

274
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:19,412
as if she were God or something.

275
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:22,212
It was a very stormy day, back then.

276
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,712
It was so bad

277
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:27,912
that despite the clock technician who is tied to a rope

278
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:31,112
to keep from falling while fixing the face of the clock

279
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,212
was blown by the wind and fell into the well below.

280
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,712
But wasn't it an accident?

281
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:37,112
Yeah.

282
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:39,812
It would've been just a plain stupid accident,

283
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,512
if that lady

284
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,512
didn't insist on celebrating her birthday party at 18:00 sharp,

285
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,612
and went to look for the clock technician.

286
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,912
You mean she went on having the party despite one person missing?

287
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:55,312
Yes. Therefore, his body ended up being found the following morning.

288
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,912
According to the police,

289
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,012
it seems that he drowned to death

290
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,812
during the time the party was being held,

291
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,712
because the well had water in it.

292
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,112
Well, if somebody else went out to look for my older brother,

293
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,212
he may have made it alive too, though.

294
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,212
Once the party begins,

295
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:10,712
I got so busy

296
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:13,312
that I have no time to go look for anybody.

297
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,712
Inspector.

298
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,712
It sounds like the one who would've most hated the victim

299
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:21,312
is that clock technician that passed away.

300
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,612
Come on.

301
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,812
Just as I thought.

302
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:28,812
The killer is that person's ghost.

303
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:31,012
That's why we heard no footsteps either.

304
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:34,012
If so, then the ghost must've had really bad eyes.

305
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:39,912
Because look at Mrs. Hoshina's necklace.

306
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,712
It shines in the dark.

307
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:44,412
I'm sure that it has fluorescent paint on it.

308
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:47,612
So that everyone would know where she is despite it getting dark.

309
00:16:47,612 --> 00:16:48,812
Hey!

310
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:50,712
Who's the one that painted the necklace?

311
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:55,812
She was letting a lot of people touch it during the party.

312
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,212
This party was also one in which she planned

313
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:59,912
to show her newly bought accessories

314
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,512
to the guests who came, so...

315
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:04,912
Come to think of it, she was also showing off

316
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:06,712
and letting everyone touch her gold flashlight watch too.

317
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,012
Then,

318
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:11,612
isn't the guest with fluorescent paint on his fingers the culprit?

319
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,612
Well, if I were the culprit,

320
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:17,012
I would've washed it off in the restroom by now though.

321
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:19,412
If we could at least specify the suspects down

322
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,012
to a few people with the fingerprints.

323
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:25,112
I'm sure a lot of people touched it.

324
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,512
How stupid, Pops.

325
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,112
If a ghost touched it,

326
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,812
there would be no detectable fingerprints.

327
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:35,312
Because a ghost can flee like air, with nobody noticing,

328
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,712
floating through the air.

329
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,612
You're the one who's stupid!

330
00:17:39,612 --> 00:17:42,312
A ghost wouldn't possibly go through the trouble of coming out

331
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,312
to paint fluorescent paint on the necklace, then stab somebody in the dark!

332
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,812
But,

333
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,512
you didn't find any footprints of anyone fleeing, right?

334
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:50,712
If the culprit's not a ghost,

335
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,712
then, that person deceived everybody into believing that he fled

336
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:57,212
and yet could still be here, right?

337
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:58,912
I see!

338
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,212
The culprit could've smeared blood

339
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,912
on the railing of the balcony and the window frame beforehand.

340
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:06,412
To make it look as if he fled outside after opening the window.

341
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:10,812
Moreover, if the culprit hasn't gone outside yet, it means that

342
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,912
it is highly likely that he still has

343
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:16,312
the ice pick like long sharp murder weapon that he used to stab

344
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,812
and pierce right through the heart of the victim on him!

345
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:19,912
Okay, then,

346
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,312
let's have each of you come one by one to another room

347
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:24,412
so that we can interrogate you and do a body check.

348
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:26,912
Hold it!

349
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:31,112
What about the blood that splattered from the victim to the culprit?

350
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,212
According to you,

351
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,112
the culprit should've gotten a lot of blood on himself, right?

352
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,612
Right,

353
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,412
unless that's cleared,

354
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:43,312
I don't feel like going through an interrogation or body check either.

355
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,912
Right.

356
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:47,612
To think that we're not even suspects and are being investigated anyway...

357
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,012
Is rude, don't you think?

358
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:52,012
Well, it's just to be sure.

359
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,712
I'm sorry,

360
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,912
but I've got other things to attend to, so I'm leaving.

361
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,212
-Me too, then. -Same here.

362
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,612
Please wait!

363
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,812
Please wait, everyone!

364
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,412
Do you all understand

365
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:06,412
that a person has died?

366
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,712
We've all come here today

367
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,312
to celebrate Mrs. Hoshina's birthday.

368
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:15,812
If the culprit who has done harm to her may be here,

369
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:19,412
isn't it only right to cooperate with the police?

370
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,812
If things are left as is,

371
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:26,312
the ghost of the clock technician who was my childhood friend

372
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,712
could end up being the killer too.

373
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,512
So you're an architect.

374
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,812
I'm Karube,

375
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,212
the one who designed this building.

376
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,712
Your hands and sleeves have blood on them.

377
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:46,112
It probably got there

378
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:49,112
when I ran over to Mrs. Hoshina who fell to the floor.

379
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:52,712
But there's no blood anywhere else is there?

380
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:54,012
No.

381
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:55,812
And? Is there anything

382
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,512
that you noticed at the time of the crime?

383
00:19:58,512 --> 00:19:59,812
Come to think of it,

384
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,112
I think I heard something like cloth

385
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:03,912
being rubbed against something approaching,

386
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,412
so the culprit could be a woman who is wearing a dress.

387
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:11,512
By the way, the mouthpiece of your pipe

388
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,912
also looks long and sharp.

389
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,412
Is it all right if I check it?

390
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:18,412
Sure.

391
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:23,012
Hey! Enough already!

392
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:25,112
It's true that the clock technician who died four years ago

393
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,412
was my older brother,

394
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:29,512
so I have the most motive to be the killer

395
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,612
but that was an unfortunate accident!

396
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:34,712
I had no grudge against Mrs. Hoshina.

397
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:39,312
But you were given charge of decorating the interior of this building.

398
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,512
Therefore, you could've rigged this place any way you wanted to.

399
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,812
As to that, Mr. Karube the architect,

400
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,612
as well as Mr. Furugaki who made the grand clock

401
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,212
would also be in the same boat.

402
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:53,712
But I guess Mr. Furugaki who is quite aged shouldn't be included.

403
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,212
Why not?

404
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,912
The culprit after stabbing Mrs. Hoshina,

405
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:01,912
went pass my left side quite swiftly!

406
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:07,112
So, see, there is a smear of blood on my left arm, isn't there?

407
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:12,412
By the way, the thing that you're wearing in your hair...

408
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,012
This is a hairpin that my older brother bought for me some time ago.

409
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,712
May I check it, please?

410
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,812
You can check it all you want!

411
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,112
But make sure that you give it back to me later!

412
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:24,112
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,312
I mean it's not a samurai movie or anything,

414
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:32,212
so I couldn't possibly have a sword or the like on me.

415
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,512
I guess not.

416
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:36,312
It was you, wasn't it?

417
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:39,512
The clock technician that made that grand clock.

418
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,312
Yeah, I'm Furugaki.

419
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:43,412
Your right shoulder

420
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:45,712
seems to have a bit of splattered blood on it.

421
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:51,612
It seems that woman was stabbed to my right, so...

422
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:54,512
It seems to be a pretty old cane,

423
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,412
have you been using it for long?

424
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:59,512
Yeah. This cane was given to me ten years ago

425
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:03,312
by the clock technician that we were talking about a while ago.

426
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:04,912
I could care less,

427
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:07,812
but I think the culprit is someone who is quite fat.

428
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,612
Just before that woman screamed,

429
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:16,012
I was pushed by a soft resilient body.

430
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,312
I'm sure the culprit

431
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:23,812
is someone who was in this large reception back then.

432
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,812
Who on earth is the culprit

433
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,412
who calls himself "The Timekeeper"?

434
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,312
"Next Episode"

435
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:54,812
I see, I got it!

436
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:57,312
The Timekeeper really passed through here

437
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,912
at the time of the crime!

438
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:01,712
Dad?

439
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:04,112
I'm spinning around and around.

440
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:07,212
I was almost about to fall

441
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,412
for the scheme

442
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:11,812
that the culprit set up.

443
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:16,112
Next Conan,

444
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:19,912
"The Blade of the Timekeeper (Part 2)".

445
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,239
Next Conan's hint:

446
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,139
"Hands of the clock".

447
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,639
Ran, I've figured it out! The culprit is a time stopper!

448
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,539
Stop him from making that deduction.
