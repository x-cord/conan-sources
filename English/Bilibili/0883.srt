00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,410
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks"

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,610
"By Kenichi Imai"

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,110
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks."

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,110
"Tick tock, tick tock.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,710
Grandpa Tick Tock is a clockmaker.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,110
He finished repairing the clocks.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,610
But he's exhausted,

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,910
and can't deliver them to his clients.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,210
'In that case, I'll deliver the clocks

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,910
to your clients for you!'"

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,110
Everyone, run!

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,710
There's a bomb in here!

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,310
It's going to explode soon!

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,110
Hurry up and run!

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,910
Please run!

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,410
It's a bomb!

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,510
Come on.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,110
Come on.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,310
We've done as you asked!

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,810
Now stop the timer!

21
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,910
Are you listening?

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,410
Dad.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,010
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,610
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,210
The countdown won't stop.

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,410
The clues to the bombs are hidden in a pop-up book.

27
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,110
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,110
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,710
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:24,867
"The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 1)"

31
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:33,967
"Five Hours Earlier"

32
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,067
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Mouri, delivery.

33
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,067
Coming!

34
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,467
"Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks" -What is this?

35
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:02,467
Grandpa Tick Tock and the Three Clocks?

36
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,367
And a smartphone?

37
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,967
Is it a picture book?

38
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,867
There's something wrong with it, though.

39
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,667
Oh, I know.

40
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,767
It turns into a pop-up book once you put it together.

41
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,267
You're right.

42
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,367
This looks like a test print, though.

43
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,167
A proof, huh?

44
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:28,167
But why'd they sent that to me?

45
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,567
At dawn this morning an explosion occurred

46
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,967
at the Sandcastle pachinko parlor located in Beika City, Tokyo.

47
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,467
Huh?

48
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,767
-What is it? -What's wrong, Conan?

49
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,467
Look at this.

50
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,367
"Tick tock, tick tock.

51
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,367
Deliver the first clock to the castle made of sand."

52
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,067
That's a sandcastle.

53
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,467
The name of the pachinko parlor that exploded is...

54
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,767
Now that you mention it, they said it was Sandcastle.

55
00:04:56,767 --> 00:05:00,067
Well, it's just a coincidence.

56
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,467
"Private Caller"

57
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:09,067
"Grandpa Tick Tock" -Tick tock, tick tock. Boom!

58
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:12,567
Sixty minutes until the target after the castle of sand.

59
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,267
Is this...?

60
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,567
Is it Block 8 of Haido City?

61
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,167
Or is it Block 3?

62
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,067
Where is the bomb?

63
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,267
Can the detective solve the mystery?

64
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:26,967
Are... are they

65
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,267
warning us about the next explosion?

66
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,367
No way.

67
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,367
What happens next in the picture book?

68
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,367
Give me a second.

69
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,167
"Tick tock, tick tock.

70
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:41,267
The destination of the second clock is a riddle."

71
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,767
"At a bus stop where five passengers are waiting,

72
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:49,367
a bus with three passengers arrives.

73
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,967
Two get off at the next stop, and one gets on."

74
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,167
"The next stop is the final stop.

75
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,267
How many passengers are on the bus?"

76
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,967
What's the answer?

77
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,067
Let's see.

78
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,767
It's torn.

79
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,567
In other words, there's a bomb at this location.

80
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,167
Hold on, hold on.

81
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,767
There's five people waiting,

82
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,067
and a bus with three passengers arrives,

83
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,767
so all together that's eight.

84
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,867
At the next stop two get off, so it's six.

85
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,167
And one gets on, so that makes seven.

86
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,367
The answer is seven people.

87
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,267
But the smartphone message says

88
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,367
it's either Block 8 or Block 3.

89
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,067
I know. The driver.

90
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,067
So all together, there are eight passengers.

91
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,267
"Beika Bus" -The bomb is at the bus stop at Block 8.

92
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,467
The great Kogoro Mouri would never fall

93
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:47,267
for such a stupid trick question.

94
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,067
Hello, inspector?

95
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,367
Wait, pops!

96
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,467
Huh?

97
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:57,967
It doesn't say the five people waiting at the bus stop got on the bus.

98
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,567
What? Which means...

99
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,667
subtracting five from eight gives you three.

100
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,767
Which means it's at the bus stop at Block 3.

101
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,267
Yeah. I think that's it.

102
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,467
Really? I understand, inspector.

103
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,667
Where did the messages come from?

104
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:20,767
Well, unfortunately, this is a burner.

105
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,567
Since the messages are being sent through several servers overseas,

106
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,767
they're having trouble determining where they came from.

107
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,567
Wait, why are you coming with me?

108
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,267
It's too dangerous! Go home!

109
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,367
Conan's the one who solved the riddle.

110
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,467
And if Conan's going, it's only natural for me to come.

111
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,267
Only natural?

112
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:40,667
We'll be fine.

113
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,067
We'll watch from a distance.

114
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,367
You don't need to worry.

115
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,667
Yeah.

116
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,867
Yeah, but...

117
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,067
And if this really is a bomb threat,

118
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,367
then the subsequent pages could be...

119
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,367
And this must be...

120
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,867
"Block 3 of Haido City, Haido Housing Complex North"

121
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,567
There's forty more minutes until the explosion.

122
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:17,167
Start searching the area immediately.

123
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,367
-Inspector! -Mouri.

124
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,667
We've identified the suspect.

125
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,767
What? Really?

126
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,867
Takuji Hirukawa, thirty-eight years old.

127
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,367
After causing an explosion five years ago,

128
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,767
he fled overseas.

129
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,667
It seems he secretly returned to the country.

130
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,467
"Takuji Hirukawa (38), Bomber" -Hirukawa's fingerprints

131
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,667
were discovered at this morning's bomb site.

132
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,767
But why did he send you a bomb threat, pops?

133
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,467
How would I know?

134
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:50,267
I'm not involved with him in any way.

135
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,767
Yes, that's the question.

136
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,067
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

137
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,767
Conan, could I see that book?

138
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,167
Sure. Here.

139
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,767
Thanks.

140
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,467
Well?

141
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,067
This is it.

142
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,667
Three days ago he took it from us,

143
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,667
claiming his younger brother left it to him.

144
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,867
I'm sure of it.

145
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:20,167
And Hirukawa injured you then, didn't he?

146
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,667
Yes.

147
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,867
What's going on?

148
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:28,167
Kenichi Imai, the author of this picture book,

149
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,267
is actually Takuji Hirukawa's half brother.

150
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,467
His brother?

151
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,567
Yes.

152
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:37,367
But he passed away while Hirukawa was abroad.

153
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,667
I see.

154
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,367
Oh, I hadn't introduced you yet.

155
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:46,567
This is Mr. Tomonaga, his brother's editor at the time.

156
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:51,567
"Hiroyuki Tomonaga (45), Editor In Chief" -Everyone was sure he'd win

157
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,167
the picture book new author award.

158
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,367
We were pushing his book.

159
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:00,367
But his brother's criminal history was exposed online.

160
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,067
"By Kenichi Imai" -People said it wasn't appropriate for him

161
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,067
to write books for children.

162
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:08,567
He was forced to withdraw from the contest.

163
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,067
He became sick right after that.

164
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,067
How awful.

165
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:18,467
Rumor was a private detective

166
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:21,467
exposed his brother's criminal history.

167
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,867
Hirukawa told friends and acquaintances

168
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:26,267
that it was the detective who killed his brother.

169
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,367
What?

170
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,967
Is that why he sent the book to me?

171
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,767
I don't remember doing anything like that!

172
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,567
Are you sure, Mouri?

173
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,067
Of course.

174
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:41,067
It's not as though every detective is fit to be one,

175
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:44,667
but I, Kogoro Mouri, will make sure the scoundrel pays.

176
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:50,567
No one was able to determine who the detective was either.

177
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,367
Most people think it was a groundless rumor.

178
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,267
So he was forced to choose you,

179
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:59,667
a famous detective.

180
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,767
That must be what happened.

181
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,067
Forced to?

182
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:06,167
His resentment's misplaced.

183
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,467
In fact, it's completely unjustified.

184
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,367
Hey, mister editor.

185
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:16,367
Were those pages always torn out of the picture book?

186
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,767
Torn?

187
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,567
That's odd. They shouldn't be.

188
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:27,067
After his death, we decided to delay publishing the book,

189
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,467
but we stored the proof in a secure location.

190
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,667
I think the torn pages

191
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:37,767
may have contained the answers to the riddles and questions.

192
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,767
I see.

193
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,667
Since hints pertaining to the bombs were written on those pages,

194
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,667
the suspect Hirukawa tore them out.

195
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:50,467
Which means there are still other bombs?

196
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,467
No way.

197
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,367
Yeah, it's definitely likely.

198
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,167
So, what did those pages say originally?

199
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,567
The answers to the riddles.

200
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,167
Well...

201
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,867
People started talking about his brother

202
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:07,667
right after we printed the proof.

203
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,267
I was overwhelmed by dealing with that,

204
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,767
so I never properly read them.

205
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,267
I see.

206
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,567
We found it!

207
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,367
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

208
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,634
Since hints pertaining to the bombs were written on those pages,

209
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,534
the suspect Hirukawa tore them out.

210
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:46,934
Which means there are still other bombs?

211
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,234
Yeah, it's definitely likely.

212
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,834
We found it!

213
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,634
It's inside a bag in a trash can!

214
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:01,534
Takagi, Chiba. Keep passersby away.

215
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,234
We'll wait until the bomb squad arrives.

216
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:05,834
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

217
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:09,034
So the threat was real.

218
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,834
What does he think he's doing?

219
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:13,634
Dad. Conan.

220
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:17,834
What?

221
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,634
What's going on, Mouri?

222
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,434
The remaining time on the bomb suddenly changed to twenty minutes!

223
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,434
"Private Caller"

224
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,734
Tick tock, tick tock.

225
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,634
Name, arrow, make.

226
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,134
Get it wrong, and kaboom!

227
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:37,134
Don't make it in time, and kaboom!

228
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:39,734
People will die because of the detective.

229
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,234
Run, run, detective.

230
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:45,434
What? Run?

231
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,434
Officer Chiba, can I see the book?

232
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:49,534
What? Okay.

233
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,334
Look.

234
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,834
"Who won the race?

235
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,734
Tick tock, tick tock.

236
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:02,734
Deliver the second clock to the park at the finish line."

237
00:14:02,734 --> 00:14:05,534
Darn it. Another riddle?

238
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:06,934
What's the answer?

239
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,634
It's torn again.

240
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:10,834
Darn!

241
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,734
Race... Race...

242
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,034
What's he talking about?

243
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:28,534
Officer Takagi, could you draw up a list of all the parks

244
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,034
within a twenty minute run from here?

245
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,334
That's it.

246
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:36,934
I found them!

247
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:41,034
The corresponding parks are Aozora Fountain Plaza,

248
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:45,234
Flower Garden Isobe and Kanematsu Park!

249
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,434
I'm stumped.

250
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:49,034
Which one are we meant to go to?

251
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:50,234
Hold on.

252
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:55,234
That's it. I've got it.

253
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:57,534
-What? -Really, Dad?

254
00:14:57,534 --> 00:15:00,834
"Flower Garden Isobe" -The kanji for the Isobe in Flower Garden Isobe

255
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:05,034
are either "Iso and Hen" or "Iso and Bu".

256
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,734
Iso, Bu. Isobu.

257
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,934
In other words, Aesop.

258
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,834
That's it. The participants of the race...

259
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,334
The one from Aesop's fables...

260
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,234
It was a hare and tortoise.

261
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,634
That's right.

262
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:21,534
In other words, the finish line is at Flower Garden Isobe.

263
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,734
But there's more to the message!

264
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,134
Let's head there.

265
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,634
Yes, sir...

266
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:32,834
Please take me with you.

267
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,334
I'm partially responsible.

268
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,234
And I may be able to remember something.

269
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:42,134
Very well. Get in.

270
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:44,834
Conan, we should go home.

271
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:45,834
Give me a second.

272
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:46,934
Officer Takagi!

273
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,834
Could you show me the list again?

274
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,334
You mean this?

275
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,434
Aozora Fountain Plaza.

276
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,634
Flower Garden Isobe.

277
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,834
Kanematsu Park.

278
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:05,434
That's it.

279
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,034
"Grandpa Tick Tock" -Tick tock, tick tock.

280
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,134
Boom!

281
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,534
In 15 minutes.

282
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,734
People will die because of you.

283
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,834
Run, run, detective!

284
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,534
Darn it! He won't beat me!

285
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,134
"Flower Garden Isobe"

286
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,934
I'm here. I made it.

287
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,134
Now it shouldn't explode.

288
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:40,234
Why hasn't it stopped?

289
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,634
Tick tock, tick tock.

290
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,634
Boom!

291
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,634
In ten minutes!

292
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:47,034
You can do it! You can do it!

293
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,234
Detective!

294
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:50,634
What?

295
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,134
I'm here! Stop the timer!

296
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,534
Are you listening?

297
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,234
What's wrong, Mouri?

298
00:16:57,234 --> 00:17:00,634
The timer won't stop!

299
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,334
What?

300
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,034
Tick tock, tick tock.

301
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,334
Boom!

302
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,234
In eight minutes.

303
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:11,034
What's wrong, detective?

304
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,634
Have you given up?

305
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:13,734
You can't be serious!

306
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,634
I, Kogoro Mouri, will never give up!

307
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,334
It's not here, pops!

308
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,434
Huh?

309
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:22,134
This park was another trick answer!

310
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:23,534
What?

311
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,734
Get in, Dad!

312
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,934
You're sure this is it?

313
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,334
Yeah. Look at this.

314
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:39,134
It says Kanematsu Park in English.

315
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:42,334
Remember the message before the riddle?

316
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:48,034
This "name, arrow, make" message?

317
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,334
Yeah.

318
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,534
The English translation for those words are "name" and "make".

319
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,334
In other words, "name, arrow, make" means

320
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,134
to turn name into make.

321
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:01,834
Turn "name" into "make"?

322
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,634
Turn name into make.

323
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:06,634
Turn name into make.

324
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:11,934
That's it! It means to change the N's into M's and M's into K's!

325
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,034
That's right.

326
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,734
So if you turn the N's into M's

327
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:19,034
and M's into K's of Kanematsu Park...

328
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:21,834
Ka-me-ka-tsu.

329
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,734
"Turtle wins" -Turtle wins!

330
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:28,534
That's right. This must be the finish line of the race.

331
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:29,834
All right.

332
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,734
Everyone, run!

333
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,134
There's a bomb in here!

334
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:39,934
It's going to explode soon!

335
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,634
Hurry up and run!

336
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:44,834
Please run!

337
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,034
It's a bomb!

338
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,134
Come on.

339
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:54,034
Come on.

340
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,934
We've done as you asked!

341
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,534
Now stop the timer!

342
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,534
Are you listening?

343
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,234
Dad.

344
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:12,934
Answer me!

345
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:19,134
Pops, the rabbit and turtle statues around you

346
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,834
are running towards the back of the park!

347
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,834
So the finish line is this way!

348
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,234
Conan!

349
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:32,434
This must be the finish line.

350
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:34,734
"Goal" -Yeah.

351
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,234
Mouri.

352
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,034
Conan, it's too dangerous.

353
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,434
Takagi, Chiba, lend me a hand.

354
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,134
We have to open the finish line.

355
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,134
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

356
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,034
Stand back!

357
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,034
Come on, Conan.

358
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,234
Get down!

359
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,334
It's not...

360
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,034
Exploding?

361
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,034
What's going on?

362
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,434
All right.

363
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,634
We did it.

364
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:32,534
The sewage must have damaged the detonator.

365
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,234
Mouri.

366
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,134
Inspector, we did it.

367
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,434
"Private Caller"

368
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,434
Tick tock, tick tock.

369
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:44,134
Boom!

370
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:48,034
Well done, Detective Kogoro Mouri.

371
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:51,834
But the game isn't over yet.

372
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,634
What?

373
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,034
Mouri, does this mean...

374
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:01,634
Yes. The bomb threat isn't over yet.

375
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,834
Mouri, where's the next bomb?

376
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:09,334
Well, until we receive the next message...

377
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,434
Conan, that book.

378
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:17,234
That's it. There's more to the book.

379
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,034
That's it.

380
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:25,334
"Tick tock, tick tock.

381
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:29,434
Deliver the final clock to the middle of the 7."

382
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,534
What's next?

383
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:34,734
It's no use.

384
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,534
It's been torn out.

385
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,034
Darn it!

386
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:40,334
What's the middle of the seven supposed to mean?

387
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,834
The middle of the seven?

388
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,034
That's odd, though.

389
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:58,134
Until now, the riddles have been fairly straightforward.

390
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,134
But...

391
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:02,634
Middle of the seven?

392
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,834
That's too vague a clue.

393
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,234
What does it mean?

394
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:57,934
"Next Episode" -What does the number seven remind you of?

395
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,934
The seven colors of the rainbow?

396
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:05,534
There are seven notes in a musical scale, too.

397
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,234
What? You found the bomb?

398
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:11,834
We found all three of the bombs!

399
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:14,134
Tell us how to disarm them!

400
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,534
Hey, answer me!

401
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,134
Answer me!

402
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:20,734
Next Conan,

403
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:24,334
"The Pop-up Book Bomber (Part 2)"

404
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:27,577
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,477
"Seven"

406
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,177
-What does the number seven remind you of? -Ultra!

407
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:32,577
-Wild! -Mild?

408
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,977
They're products of their generations.
