1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,240
Amazing!

2
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
-What? -Super!

3
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,940
Darn it!

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,940
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

5
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,840
Mischievous Sanada's all out shoot

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
turns into a most unexpected incident?

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,540
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:46,653
"Promise with the J-Leaguer"

12
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:52,453
Big Osaka can't score.

13
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:56,853
What? Weren't you guys anti-Big?

14
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:00,753
No. It's just that we're fans of the Spirits.

15
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:05,353
But we got to know player Sanada at the soccer class so, you see...

16
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:09,253
So, we decided to cheer just for player Sanada.

17
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:14,953
But Big Osaka can't win without Higo after all.

18
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,553
It can't be helped

19
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,153
because Higo is going to the World Cup

20
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:21,953
and can't participate in this game.

21
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:26,753
He's a striker who represents Japan that aligns with Hide.

22
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,453
That's why Sanada's playing in place of Higo, right?

23
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,553
Sanada's Higo's sub, see...

24
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:35,353
But to us...

25
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:38,953
Hey, I'm not a sub!

26
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,453
I'm a super sub. Remember that!

27
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,653
Is what he said.

28
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,853
But his shoot a while ago was really too bad.

29
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,753
He kicked with his right foot, didn't he?

30
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:55,553
I think he tried to dodge the defender's shoot block.

31
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,753
I think he did the right thing.

32
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,953
-I wonder about that. -Huh?

33
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:03,853
At that timing, he didn't have to cut-back with a feint.

34
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:07,353
If he shot with his left foot aiming at the upper left of the goal,

35
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,253
he would've surely made goal.

36
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,753
Then, why did he go out of his way to...

37
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,353
I don't know why,

38
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,953
but he did the same thing a while ago too.

39
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,353
A while ago? What do you mean?

40
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,453
Remember, a perfect cross went up

41
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,453
before Sanada who was in front of the goal, right?

42
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,653
I thought he was going to volley shoot with his left foot, but...

43
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,753
Come to think of it, he shot with his right leg

44
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:39,053
and the ball largely went pass the cross bar.

45
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,453
I was also wondering back then

46
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:44,153
as to why he kicked with his right leg

47
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,253
which isn't his dominant leg.

48
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,353
Maybe he was just trying to show the coach

49
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,353
that he could also kick with his right foot?

50
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,953
Although the result didn't come out as he expected.

51
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:55,853
One more thing.

52
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:58,953
This has been bothering me for a while too,

53
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:02,753
but Sanada seems to be looking towards the stands off and on.

54
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,253
There he goes again.

55
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,953
See, he's looking around there somewhere.

56
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:10,853
I wonder who he's looking at?

57
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,353
I wonder. I can't tell from here.

58
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:16,653
But it's for sure that he's concerned about somebody.

59
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:21,053
I hope he's not being blackmailed by somebody

60
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,953
and deliberately kicking balls away from the goal.

61
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,253
What?

62
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,553
It couldn't be, though.

63
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,253
Why do you think so?

64
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,453
Did you encounter a similar case sometime before?

65
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,753
No, never.

66
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,453
Sorry. I was just getting a bit carried away.

67
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,253
Let's watch the game.

68
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:48,153
But the way that Sanada is playing is obviously strange.

69
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,653
I'm sure that something's happening.

70
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:53,653
Ayumi. Genta.

71
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:58,153
Maybe Conan's deduction is right.

72
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,453
You mean that Sanada is being threatened by someone

73
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:02,853
and is kicking the ball off goal?

74
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,053
Yes.

75
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:08,253
I'm sure that Conan has his reasons for thinking so.

76
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:10,953
Although he's hiding it from us.

77
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,353
If so...

78
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:15,353
Let's help him ourselves.

79
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:16,853
Okay.

80
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:18,453
Conan.

81
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:21,353
We're going to the restroom.

82
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,953
Okay.

83
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,253
That man.

84
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:37,053
He really looks suspicious.

85
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,953
Let's go up near and look.

86
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,853
Sanada, give it your best shot!

87
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:45,153
Go for it! Sanada!

88
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:51,453
Clear it!

89
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,453
Can't make it!

90
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:56,153
Sanada, no big deal! No big deal!

91
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,753
That man...

92
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,853
It looks like he's looking at Sanada

93
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:05,253
and the lady who's cheering Sanada on.

94
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,253
He looks suspicious.

95
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:12,253
Aren't you Conan?

96
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:13,953
Kaoru.

97
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:18,753
Are you here watching soccer with your girlfriend today?

98
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:20,953
-No... -No!

99
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:24,253
Is that so? Excuse me.

100
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,553
You're not here on the job, are you, Kaoru?

101
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,453
You're not wearing your press bib.

102
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,753
No, today's my day-off.

103
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,653
I was able to get back to the local news section

104
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,353
thanks to that scoop, you see.

105
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,553
Moreover, because of the events that took place then,

106
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:41,353
I happened to become personally interested in Takahiro Sanada.

107
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:46,953
I'm still following him around, you see.

108
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:50,753
Hey, don't you think there's something strange about Sanada today?

109
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,453
Yes. He's not the usual Sanada.

110
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,553
I took a picture of Sanada the day before yesterday

111
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,753
practicing on his own early in the morning at the field

112
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,253
near Nishishiba Hotel

113
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:04,853
that team Big always uses when they come to Tokyo.

114
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:08,453
Was he practicing shooting with his right leg at that time?

115
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:12,353
No. He was practicing PK.

116
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:15,253
He was kicking all his shoots with his left leg.

117
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,753
He shot strong kicks

118
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:20,553
aiming for the upper left corner of the goal.

119
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:24,753
He kept repeating the same course over and over.

120
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,553
Just as I thought.

121
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:29,053
And yet, today he shot with his right leg.

122
00:08:34,753 --> 00:08:36,953
Too bad!

123
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:40,453
How nostalgic this field is.

124
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,553
Have you been there before?

125
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:45,353
Yeah, Nishishiba Sports Park.

126
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:49,153
There was a soccer tournament here when I was in Jr. High School.

127
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,953
And a few days before the tournament,

128
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,053
I wanted to check on the grass of the field

129
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:56,653
and was kicking the soccer ball alone.

130
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,153
I tried shooting a PK at the end, too.

131
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:01,253
I kicked a strong straight ball

132
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,653
aiming at the upper left corner of the goal

133
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,453
just like Sanada did.

134
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,953
But the ball was too strong.

135
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,953
So a super ranking High School soccer boy

136
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:18,853
fails the PK without a goalkeeper.

137
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:21,153
I said, that was when I was in Jr. High!

138
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:24,753
Huh? In Jr. High?

139
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:28,053
You said when you were in Jr. High just now, didn't you?

140
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:31,353
No. I was talking about an acquaintance of mine.

141
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:39,053
Sanada! Give it your best shot!

142
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:44,653
What's that? The stuff on his lap.

143
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,853
I wonder what it is? It looks like a black cylinder.

144
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:53,353
A gun! I think it's the muzzle of a gun.

145
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:56,753
Is the muzzle of a gun so thick?

146
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,253
That's a silencer!

147
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:01,353
It's attached to the gun so there's no sound!

148
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,853
It comes out a lot in spy movies.

149
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:07,253
The truth is

150
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:12,453
that lady who is cheering Sanada on is his girlfriend,

151
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,653
and he's being threatened saying that

152
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,853
if he doesn't want his girlfriend to be shot,

153
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:18,853
to kick away from the goal.

154
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,753
That's why he's been shooting with his right leg

155
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,853
that's not dominant instead of his left that is!

156
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:24,053
What?

157
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:26,253
What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

158
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:31,753
Let's tell the security guards!

159
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,453
Good job, Sanada!

160
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,453
Shoots!

161
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:50,253
We've got trouble!

162
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,253
They've made goal!

163
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,253
-Don't! -No! Look out!

164
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:00,153
What... what's with you guys?

165
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,053
-Let go of me! -We won't let you go!

166
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,053
You're blackmailing Sanada, aren't you?

167
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,553
Ayumi! Get the security guard right away!

168
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:08,653
Both of you.

169
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:12,353
I don't think it's a gun.

170
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:13,553
What?

171
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,653
Hey, you guys!

172
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,853
Hey, let me go!

173
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,153
What're you guys doing?

174
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:25,253
We thought it was the silencer of a gun.

175
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,653
That's a video camera.

176
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,653
For taking peeping photos.

177
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,953
What the heck is this about? I don't know a thing!

178
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,253
That man! He's stalking Yuki!

179
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:45,353
Those ladies weren't Sanada's girlfriends.

180
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,853
I guess they were just merely his fans.

181
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:51,753
Thank God that was a video camera.

182
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,453
If it was a real gun,

183
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,853
who knows what would've happened to you guys.

184
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:59,053
But thanks to them, I got an interesting shot.

185
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,253
Thanks a lot.

186
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,253
I'll treat you to something at the shop

187
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,753
as a token of my appreciation.

188
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,553
It just happens to be half-time now anyway.

189
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:07,353
-Yeah! -Yeah!

190
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,553
-Gosh. -Talk for yourself.

191
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:13,153
They did what they did because of what you said, you know.

192
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:15,253
Well, that's true.

193
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:19,253
But there's no mistake that something's going on with Sanada.

194
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,153
I'm going to the restroom.

195
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,653
Are you all right? You want me to go with you?

196
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,653
I'm fine.

197
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,253
He was looking at that boy.

198
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:00,353
Hey, sir?

199
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:04,053
What's wrong with that boy's right leg?

200
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:07,353
He sprained it after he fell off the bicycle.

201
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:09,953
Are you his father?

202
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:11,653
No, I'm not.

203
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:15,453
You don't look like a coach of the soccer club either though.

204
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:18,653
Is that boy friends with Sanada?

205
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,053
Why?

206
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:24,053
Because Sanada was sending signals to him.

207
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:30,553
Hey, is there a connection between that boy

208
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:33,953
falling off the bicycle and Sanada?

209
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,953
What makes you think so?

210
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,353
When Sanada came to Tokyo,

211
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,953
there's a field in Nishishiba that he always used to practice alone at.

212
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:45,353
And it was also written on the boy's jacket,

213
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,853
the words Nishishiba Soccer Club.

214
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:55,453
I run a convenience store in Nishishiba.

215
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:58,053
When I was taking a walk near a sports park

216
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,753
in the morning the day before yesterday...

217
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,153
Are you all right, sonny?

218
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:18,453
My leg...

219
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:19,953
I'm sorry, really sorry!

220
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:21,453
I was practicing PK,

221
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,053
but the ball went over the goal.

222
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,053
Did you get hurt?

223
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:33,053
So, we took the boy to a hospital that I knew of nearby.

224
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:37,253
With this leg, I can't participate in the game.

225
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,353
You'll be fine.

226
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:41,453
10 days and you'll be able to run.

227
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:43,553
But I can't kick a shoot.

228
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:44,953
Yes, you can.

229
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,153
Besides, if you can't kick with you right,

230
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:50,353
then kick with your left!

231
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,653
Then can you shoot with your right foot

232
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:56,053
that's not dominant instead of your left, Sanada?

233
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:59,353
Of course. I'm a J-Leaguer, you know.

234
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,453
I'll do fine with my right, too.

235
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:05,353
Then, make goal with your right leg the next game.

236
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,753
Then, I'll do my best too.

237
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:12,253
That's why Sanada...

238
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:16,953
A few days later, Sanada sent us tickets for today's game.

239
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,453
But Koh's parents were busy,

240
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,753
so I took him in their place.

241
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,353
Thank you, sir.

242
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:29,553
What a story.

243
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:32,653
Where on earth would there be a J-Leaguer

244
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,053
who'd make such a stupid promise,

245
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,753
just because he hurt that boy.

246
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:40,053
Well, that's just like Sanada.

247
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:42,853
It's one of his good points.

248
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,753
I hope Sanada makes goal in the 2nd half!

249
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:48,953
I hope he doesn't make goofy shots like before.

250
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:52,653
I'd like him to score fantastically.

251
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:55,053
More than that, what bothers me is...

252
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:02,353
Hello, Nishishiba Sports Park maintenance office.

253
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:07,653
Huh? Mouri? You mean that famous Detective Mouri?

254
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,253
I heard about it from Mr. Fukazawa.

255
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:24,253
Please forgive Sanada.

256
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,353
No way! A promise is a promise.

257
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:31,053
But it's not Sanada's fault that you got hurt, you know.

258
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:34,153
What're you talking about? The ball that he kicked...

259
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,653
Will you tell me where you fell off the bicycle?

260
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,053
What?

261
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,753
Yeah. Around here, I guess.

262
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,253
Are you sure?

263
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:50,353
Yes, because it was right after I crossed the crosswalk.

264
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:53,253
Which way did the ball come flying from?

265
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:54,953
Diagonally behind.

266
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:57,353
Sanada kicked a strong straight ball

267
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:01,953
aiming at the upper left corner of the goal from this position.

268
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:06,553
But the ball largely flew over the goal.

269
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:09,553
If this ball flew over Mr. Fukazawa's head

270
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:13,453
and went out onto the main street...

271
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,553
See? The ball that was aimed at the upper left corner of the goal,

272
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:20,153
couldn't have come flying from diagonally behind you

273
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:23,053
who sped pass the side of the crosswalk.

274
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,653
What? But then why?

275
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:28,453
The only thing thinkable is, first of all,

276
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:34,053
the ball that Sanada kicked didn't fly pass over Mr. Fukazawa,

277
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,853
but hit him.

278
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,453
On his face, too.

279
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:39,853
What?

280
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:43,853
Mr. Fukazawa, your glasses doesn't look to be in great shape.

281
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:48,153
The temples are slightly bent out of shape.

282
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,953
Didn't you get hit by the ball?

283
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:52,853
No, I didn't!

284
00:19:52,853 --> 00:19:57,853
Wait. If the ball hit Mr. Fukazawa as you said,

285
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,653
why did that ball come over to where I was?

286
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:05,253
Right, the ball couldn't have come flying to where you were.

287
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:08,453
That is, unless Mr. Fukazawa who was hit by the ball on his face

288
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:12,253
got angry and threw it in the direction of the main street.

289
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,753
What?

290
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:18,153
No! I saw the ball way before that,

291
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:21,353
and the ball unmistakably flew over my head.

292
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,153
The course of the ball that Sanada kicked was wrong to begin with.

293
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:27,253
Try remembering again.

294
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,353
The ball didn't come from diagonally behind

295
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,953
but rather from the side!

296
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,953
Mr. Fukazawa.

297
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:42,053
That field... Did you know that there's a surveillance camera here?

298
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,353
What?

299
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:48,253
I called the maintenance office a while ago

300
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,653
and had them check the footage of the surveillance camera

301
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:51,553
of the day before yesterday.

302
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:15,053
Darn it!

303
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,453
Why are you going that far?

304
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:24,453
It's not that I want to disclose what you did

305
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:27,353
because I know you're not a bad person.

306
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,253
However, the truth has to come to light.

307
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:32,453
For the sake of Sanada

308
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:34,553
as well as for Koh.

309
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:37,253
It's a foul!

310
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,053
It's PK!

311
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,853
Nobu, I'm counting on you!

312
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,253
Yeah!

313
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:53,153
If I kick towards the goal with my left foot as I practiced,

314
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:56,053
I'm sure I can shoot the ball into goal.

315
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,053
But if I do that,

316
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:59,753
I wouldn't be keeping the promise I made with that boy.

317
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,753
No way.

318
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,753
Just as I thought, it's a goofy shot.

319
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,653
Darn it!

320
00:23:13,753 --> 00:23:17,153
No big deal, no big deal! I've no time to be feeling down!

321
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:20,653
-Idiot! -That's not for you to say!

322
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,453
Sorry!

323
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:25,053
Well, it's just like him.

324
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,853
Which means that the ball that you threw...

325
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:57,453
I'm sorry for lying, Mr. Sanada, Koh.

326
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:58,853
Please accept my apology.

327
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:00,953
Forget it, sir.

328
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:04,153
I'll try my best in the next game.

329
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:13,053
Hey, Mr. Sanada.

330
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:17,553
I'm sorry!

331
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:19,853
Even if you threw the ball,

332
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:24,253
Koh got hurt because of the ball that I kicked.

333
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:29,153
Moreover, that ball hit you on the face, I'm so sorry.

334
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:34,853
Mr. Sanada.

335
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:46,153
But that PK should've made goal.

336
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:51,753
"Next Episode"

337
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,053
The corpse of a young unidentified woman?

338
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,653
Hey, don't tell me...

339
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:02,353
No way...

340
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,053
What a bummer.

341
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:06,653
I finally woke up from pain.

342
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:09,353
This case is still not over!

343
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:12,453
Mr. Mouri, it's not over?

344
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:17,753
