1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,940
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,040
The Youth Detective Squad are trapped in the cave.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,740
And there's the question of Conan's blood type.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,299
We, the Youth Detective Squad went on a camping trip

9
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,399
with Doctor Agasa.

10
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,899
And we found a limestone cave.

11
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:04,999
We quickly decided to go inside and explore it,

12
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,899
but we come across some men carrying a dead body.

13
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,499
And on top of that, I...

14
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,399
-Why you... -Get down!

15
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,299
I got shot and suffered a severe injury.

16
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,099
Footsteps?

17
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,699
Oh, no! Those guys are coming!

18
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:25,899
What should we do?

19
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:41,599
"Perilous Return: The Wounded Detective"

20
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,299
Darn it! Which one did they go into?

21
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,299
Don't worry about it.

22
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,299
One of the kids is hurt, they won't be moving so fast.

23
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,299
We'll go after them,

24
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,499
so you just stand guard here.

25
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,899
Okay, I've got you.

26
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,599
Why did we come in a place like this?

27
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,299
It's not my fault.

28
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,199
I thought these were paths, so I picked the farthest one.

29
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,499
How could I know they were just holes?

30
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,099
Don't fight.

31
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,799
We've got to find the dragon's path that Conan told us about

32
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,499
or we're going to be killed.

33
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,499
By ourselves, without Conan?

34
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,299
You've got to be kidding.

35
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,599
I'm not kidding!

36
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,099
He's not budging.

37
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,499
That's strange.

38
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,499
If he move,

39
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,499
it'd give us the perfect chance to escape.

40
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,699
We can't wait for that to happen.

41
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,199
Besides, his friends could come back at anytime.

42
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,999
We've got to get out of this cave as soon as possible

43
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,399
so we can get Conan to a hospital.

44
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,299
Yes, you're right.

45
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,499
Let's look for the dragon's path Conan said would lead us out.

46
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,799
There are five openings.

47
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,599
The guard is in front of the rock egg

48
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,299
and we're right here.

49
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,699
Since this is just a hole and doesn't go anywhere,

50
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,499
the dragon's path must be in one of the other four openings.

51
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,499
The dragon's path. Dragon...

52
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,699
Hey, wait a minute!

53
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,499
The word dragon starts with the letter "D", doesn't it?

54
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,199
It's the fourth letter in the alphabet.

55
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,099
You mean the forth opening is the dragon's path?

56
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,399
That's right!

57
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,599
The forth from the entrance.

58
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,599
It's the one we're in right now.

59
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,299
You're kidding.

60
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:51,099
You know, Conan was mumbling something from behind me.

61
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,099
-Huh? -Huh?

62
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,099
I'm pretty sure he said the key words were...

63
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:57,099
"to", "dragon", and "egg". Something like that.

64
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:59,699
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

65
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,599
-You idiot! -Huh?

66
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,599
Oh, no. He's coming this way.

67
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,899
Hey! Didn't I tell you to keep a look out here?

68
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,799
Did you found those kids?

69
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,499
Nope, the first opening was a dead end.

70
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,199
Don't worry about it.

71
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,899
There's four more, we'll find them soon enough.

72
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,399
The kids might double back here,

73
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,499
-so keep your eyes open. -Okay.

74
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,999
So the keywords are "to", "dragon" and "egg".

75
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,299
It doesn't make any sense.

76
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,499
If the dragon were a snake,

77
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:48,799
eggs would be their favorite food.

78
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:49,999
Snake?

79
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,999
My grandmother who lives in the country told me.

80
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,399
She was born in the year of the snake so she studied them.

81
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,199
Year of the snake?

82
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,099
That's it! I'm sure of it!

83
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,799
"To", "dragon" and "egg" pertain to the Chinese zodiac.

84
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,099
Dragon means year of the dragon,

85
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,399
egg means year of the snake!

86
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,499
Then, what about "to"?

87
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:12,999
It probably means year of the tiger (tora) or chicken (ton).

88
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,199
If we put the egg into the snake's position,

89
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,899
the five openings and their pertaining zodiac symbols

90
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,099
will be like this...

91
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,199
Year of the dragon, which is the dragon's path

92
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,499
is right next to the egg...

93
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:26,299
But isn't that the opening those killers said was a dead end?

94
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,299
And besides, I think year of the chicken

95
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,299
is better suited for the word egg.

96
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:36,399
But then the meaning will overlap with the word "to".

97
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,499
Maybe it's pointing to the year of the rabbit.

98
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,699
The character for rabbit

99
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,499
looks a lot like the character for egg.

100
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,199
But it's the chicken that lays eggs.

101
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,799
I think "to", "dragon" and "egg"

102
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:55,299
aren't referring to the zodiac after all.

103
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,699
So the only other common denominator

104
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,899
is they're all written in one character.

105
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,499
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,399
Egg is two characters, isn't it?

107
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,099
I went to a restaurant close to where I live

108
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,499
and I read "tamagoyaki" as "ohji-yak".

109
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:11,499
And everybody, even mom laughed at me,

110
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,799
that's why I'll never forget the word.

111
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,299
And "tamago" is sometimes written as "tama-no-ko", too.

112
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,899
Right?

113
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,599
Hey, just wait a minute!

114
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,899
You know, it could be...

115
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,899
It has something to do with "shogi" (chess).

116
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,499
Huh?

117
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,799
"To" is in back of the pawn

118
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,799
and dragon is in back of the rook.

119
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,599
And just like Genta said,

120
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,699
the character for egg could be

121
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,899
the one he mentioned which would stand for "gyokusho".

122
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,599
What is "gyokusho"?

123
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,899
In chess,

124
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,699
it's the king with the lower score uses.

125
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,399
What I'm saying is, if the egg

126
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,299
is referring to the position of the king,

127
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,499
the five openings would be ranked

128
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,999
according to their proximity to the egg.

129
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,599
Thus, they would be "kinsho", "ginsho",

130
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,199
"keima", "kosha",

131
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,899
the opening in front of the "keima"

132
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,699
would be the path of the rook and...

133
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,599
What about the dragon's path?

134
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,199
The opening diagonally in front of it is the way out.

135
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,799
But what are we going to do?

136
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:11,099
We can't get to that one without passing in front of that man.

137
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,699
That is a problem.

138
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,499
The only weapons we have

139
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:18,099
is our watch shaped flashlights and our badges.

140
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,199
Our badges?

141
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,399
If I remember right, Conan...

142
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,799
Listen!

143
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:28,499
I don't know if it'll work, but...

144
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,399
Here goes...

145
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,099
Take that!

146
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:40,599
Idiot kids!

147
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,899
Do you think you can knock me out with those rocks?

148
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,699
Now! Let's go!

149
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,199
Hey, what's going on?

150
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,399
It's those kids!

151
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,299
They went into that opening.

152
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,699
I'll teach them! They won't get away from me!

153
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:01,999
It's the exit!

154
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,599
-Genta! -I've got you!

155
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:13,499
Okay, you two! Don't step outside and get back in here.

156
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,499
Come on! Hurry it up!

157
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,699
I'll shoot him in the head if you don't!

158
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,699
That's right, good kiddies.

159
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,099
This is the police!

160
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:31,199
You're completely surrounded!

161
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,799
Throw down your guns and come out with your hands up!

162
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:37,299
I repeat! You are completely surrounded!

163
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:39,099
Darn it.

164
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,699
You fools! Don't you see what I have?

165
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,999
If you don't want me to shoot this kid,

166
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,699
you'd better let me through!

167
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,099
You idiot.

168
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:54,099
I've already read your next move.

169
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,199
What?

170
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,499
Play it smart.

171
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,999
That's how the three robbers were caught

172
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:13,899
and our cave exploration came to an end.

173
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,599
It was Doctor Agasa and Haibara that notified the police.

174
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,799
They figured we'd be heading for the cave's exit.

175
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,399
So they talked to the local people and found out about this exit.

176
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,599
And they'd just arrived to stake it out.

177
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,599
According to this local man,

178
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,699
that mysterious sign has been around for ages.

179
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,499
And no one knows for sure who wrote it.

180
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,299
My consciousness started to slip

181
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,299
as I listened to the conversation.

182
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,099
And I was taken to the Beika General Hospital.

183
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,099
What? Surgery?

184
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,499
Wasn't it just a scratch?

185
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:51,999
Well, you see...

186
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,599
He was shot.

187
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,599
What?

188
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,299
The bullet passed through the abdomen on the left side,

189
00:10:57,299 --> 00:10:58,999
but there was a lot of bleeding

190
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,499
and there is a possibility of kidney damage.

191
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,499
He's in a very serious condition.

192
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,799
Conan!

193
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,099
Conan, hang in there!

194
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,699
You'll be fine in a little while!

195
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,499
Doctor, we have a problem!

196
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,499
The previous patient we operated on

197
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:28,899
has this boy's blood type.

198
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,199
And we used up almost all the blood we had in stock!

199
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,399
What?

200
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,299
Even if we call the blood bank now,

201
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,799
we'll never get it in time!

202
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,299
Excuse me.

203
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,999
You can use my blood.

204
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,699
I have the same blood type as him.

205
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,499
Hey, how do you know that?

206
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,499
But you'd better check to make sure.

207
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,599
Then, let's hurry and get you tested.

208
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,099
Yes, madam!

209
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,799
Ran, I knew it.

210
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,999
So...

211
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:05,699
you did know...

212
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,499
Shinichi.

213
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,088
Well, it looks like I'm still alive.

214
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,388
It hurts.

215
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:02,288
I guess I'm a pretty obstinate guy.

216
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:04,888
Ran.

217
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,288
You owe her your life.

218
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:14,088
She gave you 400cc of her own blood,

219
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:17,188
and she stayed up all night watching you.

220
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,388
Good grief.

221
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:22,488
You're lucky you and Ran just happened to have the same blood type.

222
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:25,588
If you had a rare blood type, you wouldn't be here today.

223
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:28,388
You'd be in the next world.

224
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:33,088
Excuse me. You can use my blood.

225
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:36,488
I have the same blood type as him.

226
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:39,388
No, it wasn't a guess.

227
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,688
Ran knew for sure.

228
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,688
She knew my blood type.

229
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,288
She knows who I am.

230
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:49,088
Hey!

231
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,988
Ran gave you a whole lot of her blood.

232
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:55,388
You'd better recover fast or I won't forgive you.

233
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,188
Yes, sir.

234
00:13:57,188 --> 00:13:59,588
"10 days later"

235
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,488
Are you sure?

236
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:02,588
Yes!

237
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,388
There was no damage to any major organ

238
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,788
and he's healing very well.

239
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,288
At this rate, he'll be able to check out within two or three days,

240
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:10,388
I'm sure of it.

241
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,888
That's wonderful!

242
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:16,788
But after the operation, his resistance is low.

243
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:19,788
And it appears he has an infection in his upper respiratory tract.

244
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:21,388
An upper respiratory tract infection?

245
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,088
Don't worry, it's just a cold.

246
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:31,788
See! Didn't I tell you this game is nice?

247
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,088
It's really popular at school.

248
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:35,288
There, go there!

249
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,688
Go left there!

250
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,088
That's enough.

251
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,988
Play time is over!

252
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:43,588
The patient is to return straight to his room.

253
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:47,288
As for you kids, it's getting late so go on home.

254
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:49,288
I'm sorry, guys.

255
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,488
See you, Conan!

256
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,688
Bye!

257
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,388
-See you! -We'll see you at school!

258
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,488
They said you could leave in two or three days,

259
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,288
our school's having the school festival then.

260
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,688
Three days from today, that's the day we have our play.

261
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,988
What are you going to do?

262
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,388
You can't pick him up since you'll be busy all morning.

263
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:10,388
Don't worry, I'll ask dad to do it.

264
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,588
By the way, did you get a hold of "you-know-who"?

265
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,888
Who's that?

266
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,588
Shinichi, of course!

267
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:17,588
If he finds out you're playing the lead,

268
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,588
I'm sure he'll come flying!

269
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,088
He won't come.

270
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,888
Besides, it doesn't matter to me anyway.

271
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:27,488
I'll be happy just having Conan get better

272
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:28,888
and coming to see the play.

273
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,088
You will come, won't you?

274
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:34,688
Sure.

275
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,588
What is this?

276
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,288
You two are acting so lovey-dovey.

277
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:43,188
Ran, don't tell me you're switching from Shinichi to this kid?

278
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,388
Don't be silly! That's ridiculous!

279
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:46,488
Hey.

280
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,688
Sonoko, what happened to your wrist?

281
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,188
You mean this?

282
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,688
I sprained it during rehearsal,

283
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,988
and I can't play the knight's part.

284
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,688
But you're lucky someone that nice offered to take your place.

285
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:00,788
Who's that?

286
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:04,588
You know, Mr. Arade, the teacher I told you about.

287
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,788
I hate to admit, but he's awfully good at it, too.

288
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,088
And that love scene with Ran is something.

289
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,788
Sonoko!

290
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:16,688
And if Ran can keep a cool head in front of all those people,

291
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,688
the play will be perfect!

292
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:18,688
Don't worry.

293
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,388
The cooler in the gym is broken and it'll be like a sauna inside.

294
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,488
Besides, there wasn't much of a crowd last year either.

295
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:29,488
I'll bet that scrawny guy planned things to work out this way.

296
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,688
Didn't you know that things will be different this year?

297
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:34,388
The drama club is putting up a stand in the gym,

298
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,988
they're going to sell cold drinks.

299
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,288
Oh, no! I don't believe it!

300
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,288
What in the world were you thinking of?

301
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:44,788
Why did you go and buy lilies?

302
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:46,388
Why don't you just shut up?

303
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,088
Flowers are flowers. What's the difference?

304
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,588
Aren't those voices coming from Conan's room?

305
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:52,988
You're right.

306
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,388
That voice, it couldn't be...

307
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,088
You fool! Lilies have a strong smell,

308
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,688
so some people don't like them.

309
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,888
You don't buy them for people in the hospital.

310
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,788
Why didn't you tell me that before, you idiot?

311
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,888
Hattori, Kazuha!

312
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,088
I didn't expect you guys to be here.

313
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:13,588
I heard the kid got hurt,

314
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:16,688
so we hopped on a plane after school.

315
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,688
So, how are you?

316
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,788
He's fine! He's healing very well,

317
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:23,188
they said he'll be able to leave in two or three days.

318
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,788
I'm glad to hear that.

319
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:25,988
Never mind that.

320
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,588
Why don't you go and buy different type of flower?

321
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,288
What? You sure have some nerve!

322
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:34,688
Will you girls go with Kazuha so that she doesn't get lost?

323
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,488
Of course.

324
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:42,288
So, what's the real reason you came here?

325
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:43,488
You hurt my feelings.

326
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:46,788
I came all this way just to see how you're doing.

327
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:49,988
I was shot in the stomach, too. We've got things in common.

328
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,788
I'm asking you again.

329
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,488
What is so important that you had to come all the way here

330
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,988
and brought flowers?

331
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:00,288
I guess I can't fool you, right?

332
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,988
Truth is,

333
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:05,888
I got a call from an old guy named Agasa last night.

334
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,888
He wanted to talk to me about you.

335
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,788
About me?

336
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,088
I don't know what's going on but...

337
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:13,288
Kudo.

338
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:14,888
You...

339
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:17,988
It seems that girl are starting to get suspicious

340
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,288
about who you really are.

341
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,788
No, she's not suspicious.

342
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:25,888
She already knows.

343
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:28,488
What? You told her?

344
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:31,388
Do you think I'm crazy?

345
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:32,888
Then, you and that old man

346
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:34,888
could be wrong about the whole thing.

347
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,588
You're so scared she'll find out,

348
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:38,388
your imagination got the best of you.

349
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:42,988
No, there's been a lot of signs she knows.

350
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,388
And unless I can come up with another me,

351
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:48,688
I don't think I can fool her.

352
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:50,688
But I don't understand,

353
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:52,588
if she knows,

354
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:55,288
why doesn't she just tell me?

355
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,788
You haven't changed, you can read other people's minds.

356
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:02,888
But you don't have the slightest idea

357
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,688
what's going on with yourself.

358
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:09,088
If that girl knows, but isn't saying anything,

359
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,588
then there's only one reason.

360
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,688
She's waiting!

361
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:18,188
She wants to hear it from you personally.

362
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:22,588
I guess you have to prepare for the worse and tell her everything,

363
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,688
about the so called group of men in black

364
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:27,088
and about the potion that made you shrink,

365
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,688
don't you think so?

366
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:32,088
You've got to be kidding.

367
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,488
Do you expect me to tell her all that? She's a kind person.

368
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,988
She listens to everyone's problems,

369
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,288
worries for them, and cries for them.

370
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,588
How can I do that to her?

371
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,988
But then again,

372
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,088
I don't think I can keep lying to her,

373
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:49,388
not after seeing how strained she was.

374
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:53,188
I really want to tell her everything and get it off my chest.

375
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:58,488
Hattori, listen.

376
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,388
What would you do?

377
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,688
What do you think is right?

378
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:13,988
Hey, Heiji.

379
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:16,088
Heiji.

380
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:17,888
On the last day of the school fest,

381
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,188
the play Ran's in.

382
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:22,888
It's on a Sunday, so you'll come with me, won't you?

383
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:29,388
Unless I can come up with another me,

384
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:33,088
I don't think I can fool her.

385
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:36,288
I'm sorry, but I can't go.

386
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:37,788
But why not?

387
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,288
I have something to do that day and I can't get out of it.

388
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,388
It's important.

389
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,588
"Potassium Cyanide"

390
00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:28,388
"Conan Edogawa"

391
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:38,188
Listen, Shinichi.

392
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:41,288
You must never tell anyone about this!

393
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:44,388
And that includes Ran!

394
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,588
If that girl knows, but isn't saying anything,

395
00:21:47,588 --> 00:21:50,688
then there's only one reason why.

396
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,188
You understand, don't you?

397
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:56,788
We can't let anyone know about us.

398
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,388
She's waiting!

399
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:02,188
She wants to hear it from you personally.

400
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,588
Don't leave me!

401
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:13,688
I guess I've got to tell her.

402
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,488
Haibara?

403
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:22,588
"Next Episode"

404
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:28,509
Next Conan, "Perilous Return: The Third Choice"

405
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,506
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:33,606
"Iced-coffee"

407
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,706
Next time, it's been a long time,

408
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,706
but that person will show up in front of that person!

409
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:38,606
Cheers! It's me! Long time no see.
