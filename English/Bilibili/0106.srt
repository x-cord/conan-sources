1
00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:04.398
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:06.028
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:10.228
A shutter chance of luck and skill!
Pictures reveal everything!

4
00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:11.698
He especially sees the truth today

5
00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:13.868
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:15.908
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.961
"The Scoop Photograph Murder Case."

8
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:20.121
Because I--no, the old guy,
solved the case that day,

9
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:20.321
the client invited us to a famous award ceremony.

10
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:23.541
35th Yomikiri Photography Award
the client invited us to a famous award ceremony.

11
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:25.281
35th Yomikiri Photography Award

12
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:27.171
And now, for the announcement.

13
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.501
The winner of the 35th
Yomikiri Photography Award...

14
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.921
...is Mr. Yanase Ryuichi's work,
nominated by the News Branch!

15
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:42.821
Yes!

16
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:10.241
Thank you! I have God and
sheer luck to thank for this award!

17
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.961
And a little bit of my skill.

18
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.321
This is that big of a ceremony?

19
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.621
Apparently it's the
biggest one in this industry.

20
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:27.071
I hear each winner gets a
contract with most major news outlets.

21
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:28.971
They're going to show his work!

22
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:34.491
The scene of a fire!

23
00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:37.081
They definitely are
photos of decisive moments!

24
00:03:47.451 --> 00:03:51.911
It's an honor to be in the
same room as the great Mori-san!

25
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.071
A news photographer
who chases incidents,

26
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.251
and a detective who solves them.

27
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:58.201
We're not so unrelated!

28
00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:00.171
It's a pleasure.

29
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:03.161
Likewise!

30
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.841
Those were amazing photos!
How did you take them?

31
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:10.821
Like I said, I have God to thank.

32
00:04:10.821 --> 00:04:14.811
I just happened to pass
by that fire at the time.

33
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.621
Yeah, "just happened." Sure.

34
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:21.411
What are you doing here?!

35
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:23.281
Uhh, who might you be?

36
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:26.361
You're Mori Kogoro-san, yes?

37
00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:28.861
Here is my card.
Nakai Akira, Investigative Reporter

38
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:30.821
Nice to meet you.

39
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:34.291
Nakai-san, an investigative reporter?

40
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:38.321
Yanase-san will be helping
me quite a bit from now on.

41
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:41.211
You better quit it!

42
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:43.461
Sure that's wise?

43
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:44.211
What?!

44
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.011
What is this?!

45
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:56.481
To hell with you!

46
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.621
What was that white powder?

47
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:09.151
Was it drugs?!

48
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.121
It's just limestone.

49
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:13.371
Limestone?

50
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:14.991
What's the deal?

51
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.381
Dad! Answer the phone!

52
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:24.951
I can't talk right now!

53
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:27.781
I'll get it, Ran-neechan!

54
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.621
Hello, Mori Detective Agency!

55
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:34.661
Yeah, this is Nakai.
Get the detective.

56
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.101
He's asleep now.

57
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:40.061
What? He's asleep?!

58
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:42.521
Then wake him up!

59
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:46.861
I got something important
to tell him! My life is in danger!

60
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:48.781
His life is in danger?!

61
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.921
Hold on!

62
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:56.241
Mister! Wake up! Mister!

63
00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:57.541
I can't drink any more...

64
00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:00.431
Sheesh. Guess I have no choice...

65
00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:09.881
Hello. This is Mori Kogoro.

66
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:13.071
Oh, about time! Took long enough!

67
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.471
What is this about
your life being in danger?

68
00:06:16.471 --> 00:06:20.431
Someone's out to get me.

69
00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:23.401
If anything happens to me,
investigate it.

70
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:24.861
What do you mean?

71
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.821
Just listen to me!

72
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.781
Nakai-san! What happened?!
Nakai-san!

73
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:34.621
Hello?! Nakai-san! Hello?!

74
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:38.991
It couldn't be!

75
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.581
Mister! Wake up! Mister!

76
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.411
I already told you,
I can't drink any more...

77
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.821
Damn! I have no choice!

78
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.341
Here it is! Nakai-san's business card!

79
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.161
Taxi!

80
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:06.741
Hurry here, Driver!
My daddy ran out on me!

81
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.281
What?!

82
00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.071
Alright! Leave it to me, kiddo!

83
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:26.491
C'mon! Hurry! Hurry!

84
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:44.271
Nakai-san!

85
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.031
That's--!

86
00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:08.831
Man on Fire Plummets

87
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:10.541
Man Falls While on Fire

88
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:12.251
Man Jumps to Avoid Fire

89
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:17.281
It was just sheer luck.
I have God to thank, yet again.

90
00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:24.681
For a news photographer,
he is incredibly lucky.

91
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:28.571
Still, it's too much of a coincidence!

92
00:08:32.321 --> 00:08:34.071
Well, Dad?

93
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:37.571
The investigative reporter Nakai-san
was murdered, wasn't he?

94
00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:42.531
It would seem not.

95
00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:44.501
What do you mean, Dad?

96
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.621
He did suffer a blow to the head...

97
00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:53.461
...but the examiners believe he
slipped and hit his head while drunk.

98
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:54.921
That can't be!

99
00:08:55.451 --> 00:09:00.891
As a result, the police have
deemed this an accident, not a crime.

100
00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:02.951
What caused the fire?!

101
00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:07.431
I don't know the details, but apparently
it started in the kitchen sink.

102
00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:13.271
Sink? Maybe a thrown-out
cigarette lit something on fire?

103
00:09:13.571 --> 00:09:17.951
Anyways, that was where
the fire burned the most.

104
00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:21.821
In either case, it would've
been an unfortunate accident.

105
00:09:24.451 --> 00:09:25.491
Conan-kun!

106
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:26.991
Forget about 'im.

107
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:31.831
Doing questioning first thing
in the morning has me starved!

108
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:33.751
Let's get some grub!

109
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:40.631
No Entrance

110
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:46.101
The call meant for the old guy
last night was at 10:30 p.m.

111
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:49.941
I arrived here in the taxi at 10:50.

112
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:56.821
Judging from how the fire was,
it must've started right after the call.

113
00:09:58.241 --> 00:10:02.701
Yanase, the photographer,
was taking pictures from there...

114
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:05.651
The only way up there is by car.

115
00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:08.451
What's that?!

116
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.041
The highway bus drop-off point!

117
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.731
It's the same height as
Nakai-san's apartment!

118
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.661
It's too perfect for someone
who just happened to pass by!

119
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:38.821
Plus, it's only three minutes
between here and there!

120
00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:41.161
This powder...

121
00:10:46.871 --> 00:10:48.881
Limestone!

122
00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:53.821
Wait a minute! The fire
started in the kitchen sink!

123
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.161
Could it be?!

124
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:00.281
This, please!

125
00:11:00.281 --> 00:11:01.131
Okay!

126
00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.161
This is it!

127
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:21.621
Oh! These are some great photos!

128
00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:24.031
They really are
from the decisive moment!

129
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.531
I want you to analyze them!

130
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:31.501
This one in particular!
See the mirror far in the back?

131
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:33.121
Mirror?

132
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.121
Oh, this? Yeah, I see it!

133
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:38.161
The kitchen can be seen in it...

134
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:40.461
Oh, you're right.

135
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:43.881
Think you can zoom in
on it and make it clearer?

136
00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:48.801
I guess you can't if it's not film?

137
00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:51.771
No, that's not true. Leave it to me!

138
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.021
Magazine found!

139
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:20.991
Yeah, you can't tell what's in the mirror...

140
00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:24.161
Hold on, now. I'm just getting started.

141
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:33.161
Let's see. Yesterday's weather...

142
00:12:34.371 --> 00:12:36.661
The time of the fire...

143
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:41.981
The positions of the moon and stars...

144
00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:46.241
The fire's heat had
about this much effect...

145
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:52.621
Whoa! You're good, Doc!

146
00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:54.411
It's nothing out of the ordinary!

147
00:12:58.701 --> 00:12:59.621
That's--!

148
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:01.821
Did you figure
something out, Shinichi?

149
00:13:01.821 --> 00:13:04.781
Yeah, it really was a murder!

150
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.121
Yanase, the photographer, did it!

151
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:08.091
Really?!

152
00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:11.161
But this is still
circumstantial evidence.

153
00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:13.261
He could play dumb and that'd be it.

154
00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:19.811
This Yanase guy is going to be
on TV tomorrow. I saw an ad for it.

155
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:21.981
He's going to be on TV?!

156
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:26.281
People in the spotlight
these days all get their own shows.

157
00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:28.991
And his guest is going to be Mori-san!

158
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:29.951
The old guy?!

159
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.911
Which means this will be my last chance...

160
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:37.871
In the spotlight, huh... I'm so jealous!

161
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.781
Doc! Help me out!

162
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:43.241
You'll be in the spotlight, too!

163
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:44.841
What?! Really?!

164
00:13:58.158 --> 00:13:59.778
Thanks for coming today, Mori-san.

165
00:13:59.778 --> 00:14:01.178
It's my pleasure.

166
00:14:05.948 --> 00:14:08.398
A police ticket...

167
00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.858
Yeah, I have to pay a fine.

168
00:14:11.858 --> 00:14:13.188
Fine?

169
00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:17.408
I must've gone over the speed
limit when I saw smoke from the fire.

170
00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:19.618
A surveillance camera caught me.

171
00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:23.738
A photographer out
to get a decisive moment

172
00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:28.158
was caught at a decisive
moment himself. It's hilarious!

173
00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:32.348
Wait, don't tell me...

174
00:14:34.568 --> 00:14:35.968
Conan-kun! Where are you going?

175
00:14:39.818 --> 00:14:44.368
Hello? Metro Police?
This is Mori Kogoro.

176
00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:47.438
Please get Inspector Megure immediately.

177
00:14:47.698 --> 00:14:50.448
Mori-san! It's time!

178
00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:51.938
Now to show my cool side!

179
00:14:52.198 --> 00:14:53.898
Mister! Come here a second!

180
00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:56.068
What do you want? I'm busy...

181
00:14:56.068 --> 00:14:59.198
There's something on
your collar. I'll get it for you!

182
00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.468
Thanks.

183
00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:06.038
The button speaker
is attached! All set to go!

184
00:15:06.318 --> 00:15:09.458
Hello, everyone.
I'm Yanase Ryuichi.

185
00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:12.618
Our guest for the first
episode of Yanase World

186
00:15:12.618 --> 00:15:15.418
is the great detective,
Mori Kogoro-san!

187
00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:25.018
You're also known as Sleeping Kogoro,
which I'd like to ask about.

188
00:15:26.698 --> 00:15:28.158
What's wrong, Mori-san?

189
00:15:28.158 --> 00:15:29.908
Oh, nothing.

190
00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.488
I hate to be sudden, Yanase-san,

191
00:15:32.488 --> 00:15:37.488
but I think I'd rather
focus on the incident.

192
00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:38.528
Huh?

193
00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:41.948
You know, the one
where you committed arson

194
00:15:41.948 --> 00:15:45.038
and murdered Nakai-san,
the investigative reporter?

195
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:46.958
C-Come again?!

196
00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:56.258
This certainly comes
as a surprise, but sure.

197
00:15:56.778 --> 00:15:59.238
I'll humor you, if you'd like.

198
00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:02.718
But your accusation
was completely off, Mori-san.

199
00:16:02.948 --> 00:16:04.678
Let me ask this.

200
00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:06.988
There's a happening
in the very first episode!

201
00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:09.988
Yeah! This is great!
The battle of the century!

202
00:16:11.118 --> 00:16:15.488
First of all, I was taking
photos of the highway at the time.

203
00:16:15.488 --> 00:16:19.858
How could I have possibly lit
a fire inside Nakai-san's apartment?

204
00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:22.158
Simple.

205
00:16:22.158 --> 00:16:26.158
Using the exit point for
passengers getting off the highway bus,

206
00:16:26.158 --> 00:16:29.868
you could travel between the
photo spot and the scene in three minutes.

207
00:16:30.618 --> 00:16:37.258
You used that to enter his apartment
and attack and knock him out.

208
00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:42.568
You then set up an ignition
timer and returned to the highway,

209
00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:47.098
where you waited for the fire
to start so you could photograph it.

210
00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:53.098
Oh? But no timing devices
were found in the remnants of the fire.

211
00:16:53.368 --> 00:16:58.528
Correct. Nothing was found.
It must've burned away.

212
00:16:58.988 --> 00:17:02.028
Then how can you make such a claim?

213
00:17:02.028 --> 00:17:03.658
Limestone. Or, to be technical, quicklime.

214
00:17:03.888 --> 00:17:06.448
Quicklime

215
00:17:06.448 --> 00:17:06.618
It was the timing device you used.
Quicklime

216
00:17:06.618 --> 00:17:09.948
It was the timing device you used.

217
00:17:11.278 --> 00:17:11.738
Unlike slaked lime, which is used for drawing lines on fields,

Slaked Lime
Unlike slaked lime, which is used for drawing lines on fields,

219

Slaked Lime

220
00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:20.238
when quicklime and water are combined,
a chemical reaction occurs

221
00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:23.338
that exceeds 300 degrees Celsius.

222
00:17:23.338 --> 00:17:23.738
Sake

223
00:17:23.738 --> 00:17:26.988

of quicklime left at construction sites

228
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:39.158
have ignited and caused fires
after rainwater leaked inside.

229
00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:42.238
This is what you used.

230
00:17:42.948 --> 00:17:50.488
You placed quicklime in the sink
and had water leak in and ignite it.

231
00:17:50.488 --> 00:17:54.278
With some paper and
flammable objects all around it,

232
00:17:54.278 --> 00:17:57.168
you'd have a fire in no time.

233
00:17:57.448 --> 00:18:02.408
This is probably how you took
your award-winning photos as well.

234
00:18:02.408 --> 00:18:05.968
But your victim found
out and blackmailed you!

235
00:18:07.818 --> 00:18:10.428
Most impressive!

236
00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:15.398
It may be true that such a trick
is possible, but you have no proof.

237
00:18:15.778 --> 00:18:18.358
Proof as definitive as photographs.

238
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:19.768
But I do.

239
00:18:20.778 --> 00:18:24.318
A photograph you took is definitive proof.

240
00:18:24.698 --> 00:18:25.658
What?!

241
00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:27.368
Dr. Agasa.

242
00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:32.788
Nobody told me about this!

243
00:18:32.788 --> 00:18:34.038
Doc?!

244
00:18:36.988 --> 00:18:40.748
Now, then! Let me
show you the definitive proof!

245
00:18:48.068 --> 00:18:49.448
Here you are!

246
00:18:49.448 --> 00:18:55.638
First, the kitchen faucet.
Have a look at the handle.

247
00:18:55.638 --> 00:18:59.278
This is the type where lowering
the handle will produce water,

248
00:18:59.278 --> 00:19:02.028
and it's one-fourth down here.

249
00:19:02.028 --> 00:19:06.648
In other words, when the fire
started, this water was running...

250
00:19:07.408 --> 00:19:10.068
...in order to activate the igniter.

251
00:19:10.948 --> 00:19:15.038
I don't know.
It might've just been left on.

252
00:19:15.038 --> 00:19:16.988
In that case, Yanase-san.

253
00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:21.998
What happened to the watch
you received for winning the contest?

254
00:19:22.948 --> 00:19:24.948
I asked the head office.

255
00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:29.218
Apparently, there's only one
wristwatch like it in the world.

256
00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:34.178
So why is it in the victim's kitchen?

257
00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:43.698
Are you sure you didn't remove
it before adjusting the faucet

258
00:19:43.698 --> 00:19:47.358
to keep it from getting wet,
but then accidentally left it there?

259
00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:52.328
As it was quite close to the source
of the fire, it was rather burned.

260
00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.488
Sorry, but it was stolen from me.

261
00:19:55.488 --> 00:19:57.708
Oh? When was it stolen?

262
00:19:58.158 --> 00:20:01.028
Right after the award ceremony.

263
00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:06.128
I just realized now that it
was the late Nakai who stole it!

264
00:20:06.658 --> 00:20:09.488
So you intend on
playing innocent to the end?

265
00:20:09.488 --> 00:20:11.388
In that case... Inspector!

266
00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:14.408
V!

267
00:20:15.678 --> 00:20:18.098
Jeez! V?!

268
00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:22.648
This is data from the camera
on the highway to catch speeders.

269
00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:27.488
Detective Mori asked me to bring it here.

270
00:20:28.068 --> 00:20:32.568
It's from 10:20 p.m.,
on the night of the incident.

271
00:20:32.568 --> 00:20:37.498
In other words, it's from ten
minutes before the victim called me.

272
00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:43.168
Doc, can you display
it on the computer monitor?

273
00:20:43.548 --> 00:20:45.128
Piece of cake!

274
00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:56.808
Now, zoom in, please.

275
00:20:56.808 --> 00:20:58.518
Got it!

276
00:21:07.698 --> 00:21:12.448
You claim your wristwatch
was stolen right after the ceremony.

277
00:21:12.448 --> 00:21:16.658
So why do you have it on
right before photographing the fire?

278
00:21:17.448 --> 00:21:21.868
The fact that wristwatch
was in Nakai-san's apartment

279
00:21:21.868 --> 00:21:25.318
is proof that you were there!

280
00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:33.868
A photographer out to
capture a definitive moment

281
00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:36.928
was caught at a
definitive moment himself.

282
00:21:39.618 --> 00:21:41.428
This can't be...

283
00:21:41.428 --> 00:21:48.068
It seems you forgot the most
important fact for a photographer.

284
00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:55.658
"Photograph" is written as
"displaying the truth" in Japanese!

285
00:23:42.448 --> 00:23:45.238
The staff said the ratings
were through the roof!

286
00:23:45.238 --> 00:23:48.908
Ironically enough,
now I'm in the spotlight too!

287
00:23:49.618 --> 00:23:51.518
Huh? Where's Dad?

288
00:23:52.028 --> 00:23:54.318
Oh no! I forgot about him!

289
00:23:54.318 --> 00:23:55.618
Hi!

290
00:23:55.618 --> 00:23:58.198
I'm the great Mori Kogoro!

291
00:23:58.198 --> 00:24:00.448
Okino Yoko-chan! Where are you?!

292
00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:07.978
Huh?!

293
00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:12.318
Your sister was killed
and buried in the yard?!

294
00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:17.168
But it's illegal to enter
others' yards without permission.

295
00:24:19.478 --> 00:24:24.518
But is there really a
body buried in this yard?!

296
00:24:26.818 --> 00:24:30.638
What exactly does Koda-san plan to do?!

297
00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:32.518
On the next Conan--

298
00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:36.178
"The Mystery of the Mole Aliens (Part 1)."
