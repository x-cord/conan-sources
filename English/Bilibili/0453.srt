1
00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:03,166
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,066
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:07,966
An unexpected misunderstanding at a premier preview of a movie.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,766
The Youth Detective Squad stop the case before it happens!

5
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,166
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,635
The game is over!

9
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,535
You have no way out!

10
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:20,135
You're out! Dark Sashimu.

11
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:21,635
What are you saying...

12
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,335
Can you catch a big shock...

13
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,135
like me?

14
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,235
Don't think...

15
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:44,035
It's feels like water...

16
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,735
"Worldwide release on the 30th of October!"

17
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:53,835
"Witness the legendary ending!"

18
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:58,035
Witness this event of the century.

19
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,135
Talk about a long line.

20
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:08,635
It can't be helped.

21
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:12,935
It's the last of a popular movie that's been playing for 20 years.

22
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,935
But, we're sure were lucky

23
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:18,435
to be able to get a hold of the ticket of this preview.

24
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:20,835
You got it from Yoko Okino, didn't you?

25
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,635
Yeah, be grateful to me.

26
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,735
Because I'm the one that had Pops ask Yoko Okino for it,

27
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:27,435
thinking that we had nothing to lose either way.

28
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,335
Well...

29
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,135
I'm not done yet.

30
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,435
I'll show you

31
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:36,435
the power of the master swordsman of darkness.

32
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,835
Your powers

33
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,135
don't stand a chance

34
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,835
against this master swordsman of light, Bei-Ju.

35
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:44,435
I'll defeat you with the sword of the sun of the woman,

36
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:46,435
warrior of fire, Kisasa!

37
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,935
I won't lose.

38
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,235
-That's hurt! -I'll bet you guys don't feel a tinge of gratitude.

39
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:59,935
"Preview of Karma and Friendship"

40
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:04,035
Hey, hey, come back here and stand in line!

41
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,835
Who cares, we've got tickets to go in, right?

42
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,235
Even if we don't stand in line,

43
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,735
if the time comes we get to go inside, don't we?

44
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:13,335
But, as far as the seats, it's first come first serve,

45
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:16,335
so you won't get good seats if you don't stand in line like you should.

46
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,735
I guess so, but just thinking that I'm going to get to see it

47
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,535
before any of my other classmates...

48
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,135
It's so exciting.

49
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,235
It's hard to stay still.

50
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:27,335
In that case, you have to dress up properly.

51
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,535
"Bungo Tatei"

52
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,635
As for Dark Sashimu's two sword style,

53
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,835
you've got to hold the long sword in your right hand

54
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:36,035
and the short sword in your left hand.

55
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:39,435
Moreover, Bei-Ju wears his eye patch over his left eye,

56
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,635
and Kisasa's sword of the sun is long

57
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,735
so you've got to stretch it out like this and use it.

58
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:46,735
Wow! This sword stretches!

59
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,335
You're really knowledgeable, aren't you?

60
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,335
Yes.

61
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:52,835
The fact is, I have the items that these children have too.

62
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,235
This guy is a maniac.

63
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:57,135
You like Star Blade too, don't you?

64
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:01,035
Yeah, I've been a great fan since I saw the first series

65
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,735
when I was about your age.

66
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,835
Besides, I met my girlfriend for the first time

67
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:08,235
at the preview for this movie too.

68
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:10,635
She's not with you today?

69
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:13,435
No... well, you know...

70
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:14,735
Did you have a fight or something?

71
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:18,535
Don't tell me you fought because you had only one ticket?

72
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,435
No, it's nothing like that.

73
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:23,935
My friend, Narukawa, who also likes Star Blade

74
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:28,535
kept bugging me to give him this ticket last night by phone but...

75
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:31,035
Hey, hey.

76
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,735
You've got to hang on nice and tight to your ticket.

77
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:35,935
It's an important ticket, you know.

78
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,335
Sorry, sorry.

79
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,535
It's only a while more till the doors will open.

80
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,135
-Please stand in one straight line! -It's the swordsman of darkness,

81
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,935
-Dark Takio! -Really!

82
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:47,235
Oh yeah, would you like me to take a picture of you with him?

83
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:48,735
-Yes, please! -Yes, please!

84
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:51,735
Okay, smile.

85
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,135
Thank you, sir!

86
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:56,635
You're welcome.

87
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,135
I'm sorry and thank you so much.

88
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:59,335
Oh, not at all.

89
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:01,035
By the way, I'm...

90
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,435
Here's my name card.

91
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:05,535
"Bungo Tatei, Freelance Photographer" -Mr. Bungo Tatei.

92
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:07,035
You're a camera man.

93
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:10,835
Yes, so I'll guarantee that the outcome of the picture will be good.

94
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,735
Would you like me to take a picture of you too, sir?

95
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,335
Okay.

96
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,935
Then, I'll take the picture with that camera.

97
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,735
Okay, say cheese!

98
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:22,435
Thank you.

99
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,335
I will send you the picture,

100
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,435
so could you write your name and address in my pocketbook here?

101
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,135
Okay.

102
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:29,635
Let's see...

103
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,935
Huh?

104
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,735
Oh, did you finish writing?

105
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:36,735
Oh, yeah.

106
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,935
Okay, I'll send it as soon as it's developed and printed.

107
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,435
To this address, right?

108
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,935
Of course, you don't have to pay me, so please don't worry.

109
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:51,035
But, I'm really looking forward to Dark Takio.

110
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,935
Yes! I wonder what he's going to do in this movie.

111
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:56,135
He's so strong. That is very exciting!

112
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:58,135
-Don't worry! -What?

113
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:02,535
I'm sure that Bei-Ju and Kisasa will beat Dark Takio up!

114
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:04,935
Evil never wins over good.

115
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,335
Huh?

116
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:09,535
The phone...

117
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,735
Yes, this is Tatei.

118
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:14,935
Oh, Narukawa?

119
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,435
What? Come in front of the second Okuho Building now?

120
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,035
Yeah, okay.

121
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,235
I'll be right over.

122
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:26,235
I'm sorry, could you keep my place for me?

123
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,135
I'll leave my things here so...

124
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:29,435
Okay, no problem.

125
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:31,235
I'll be right back.

126
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,235
Hey, mister.

127
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,235
Didn't that guy say something?

128
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,635
What do you mean something?

129
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:40,635
Didn't he take money from you or something?

130
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:43,535
No, all he took was our picture.

131
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:47,335
He insisted to take a picture of us too just a while ago.

132
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,435
He was really a pain.

133
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,935
I thought he was a new type of swindler or something.

134
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,735
I guess not.

135
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,135
"Joji Narukawa" -Hey, Narukawa!

136
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,135
-Huh? -Thanks for waiting.

137
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:05,235
What was that call all about?

138
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,335
You're the one who told me to call when I got here, right?

139
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,235
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

140
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,335
If it's not something important, I'm going home!

141
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,835
I don't have that much time to waste either!

142
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,235
Don't worry.

143
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,635
I'm sure you'll like it.

144
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,435
It's a present from the bottom of my heart...

145
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:27,035
that I got for my best friend.

146
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,135
But, that man was saying something strange a while ago, wasn't he?

147
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:35,135
Yes. He said that Dark Takio would be defeated by Bei-Ju and Kisasa!

148
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,035
He also said that evil never wins over good.

149
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:42,935
Oh, but isn't it only natural that justice wins over evil?

150
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:46,635
But, Dark Takio is on their side since the previous movie!

151
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:49,035
He went against Dark Sahimu!

152
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:51,935
When he took off his skull mask, he was really good looking,

153
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,535
so I know he's a good guy!

154
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:56,435
I wonder why that man said so.

155
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,135
Maybe he's going to betray everybody again in this movie?

156
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,435
What?

157
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:05,435
He probably didn't see the previous Star Blade V.

158
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:08,735
Hey, don't look through other people's things.

159
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:12,235
See, there are two tickets for the preview of this movie three years ago,

160
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,735
unused in between the pages of his pocketbook.

161
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:19,935
Hey, the thing that's smeared on one side of the ticket...

162
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,835
It's probably bloodstain.

163
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:24,035
Although it looks pretty old.

164
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,435
Blood?

165
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,735
Don't tell me somebody had a bloody fight over those tickets?

166
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,935
What?

167
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,035
I don't know about that,

168
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,335
but I'm pretty sure that the owners of these two tickets are...

169
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,935
that man called Tatei that we saw a while ago

170
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:39,035
and the woman in this picture.

171
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:41,735
There's no mistaking that.

172
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,935
It looks like the picture was taken in a car.

173
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,435
The date on the picture

174
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,835
is the same as the one on the ticket bought three years ago.

175
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:52,035
I wonder why he didn't go to the preview.

176
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,235
I wonder...

177
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:55,735
The elevator?

178
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,035
Yes.

179
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:01,835
Go straight down that aisle and you'll see it on the left.

180
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,635
Thank you.

181
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:07,435
Hey, Narukawa! The elevator's on the left side of the aisle!

182
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:11,435
Hey, it's not that hard to find, is it?

183
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:14,535
Sorry, I'm really bad at directions.

184
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:17,235
"Film content" -Strange.

185
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,735
Something's strange?

186
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:21,335
It's just notes, isn't it?

187
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,835
Remember, that man called Tatei a while ago

188
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:27,135
ripped the page off his pocketbook

189
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:30,435
and put it inside his film case, didn't he?

190
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:32,835
When he did so, I first thought that he did that

191
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:35,935
so he wouldn't forget what he had taken,

192
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,335
but all the films are numbered

193
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,135
and the details of what are in the films

194
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:43,035
are written out in his pocketbook.

195
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:47,235
Besides, none of the other pages in his pocketbook are ripped off,

196
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:51,435
and all the other films that are completed are all in his bag.

197
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,435
Why only that film is not?

198
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:02,135
Come on, hurry up and show me the present you got for me!

199
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,035
Hold your horses.

200
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,735
I'll give it to you soon.

201
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,835
When we arrive at the right place.

202
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,035
Talking about film, there's something that's also bothering me.

203
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,035
What?

204
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,335
When I took a picture of him a while ago,

205
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:18,735
he rewound it right away.

206
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:21,735
But there were still 15 more films left.

207
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:24,235
Don't you think that's strange?

208
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:26,935
The film was taken out before it was all used up.

209
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,935
He deliberately ripped the page with Dr. Agasa's address on it

210
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,335
out of his pocketbook and put it away in his pocket.

211
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:34,635
The blood stained preview ticket of three years ago,

212
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:38,135
and a friend who is a fan of Star Blade called him...

213
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,035
Don't tell me that he's...

214
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,135
Hey, Tatei!

215
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,835
Can we come in here without permission?

216
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,935
This is the roof.

217
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,335
Do you remember, Narukawa?

218
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,335
What?

219
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,835
It was a fine day like today

220
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:57,035
when we met her, Ami

221
00:11:57,035 --> 00:12:00,435
at the preview of the movie, wasn't it?

222
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,635
I see! I got it!

223
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:06,235
That man is probably here on his job!

224
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,735
So, in order to separate the film from his work photos,

225
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,335
he took it out.

226
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:12,035
-Oh, come on... -What?

227
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,935
If he's here on the job,

228
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,435
he wouldn't have to stand in line like this, would he?

229
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,035
I guess so.

230
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,635
Maybe he has no intention...

231
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,435
of coming back here.

232
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:40,344
What?

233
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,544
Hey, hey, did you forget?

234
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,144
It happened only six years ago.

235
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:46,044
Of course I remember!

236
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,544
You mean the first time we met Ami

237
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:50,144
at the preview of Star Blade IV, right?

238
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,644
We found her holding her ticket and lost,

239
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:57,944
so we brought her here.

240
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,544
To this same place six years ago, didn't we?

241
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:05,644
And three years ago, it was this same place too.

242
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:07,544
Hey, don't tell me...

243
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:11,444
you're angry about the accident that killed Ami three years ago?

244
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:15,244
It's true that I was the one driving at that time,

245
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,044
but the police said so too, didn't they?

246
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:19,944
That the truck that rammed us was to blame!

247
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:24,444
That the driver doze off, ran the red light and crashed into us.

248
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,544
Darn.

249
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,744
It's true that back then I overslept

250
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,244
and was a bit flustered myself too,

251
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,644
but I wasn't speeding or anything like that.

252
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:38,544
Besides, why are you bringing such an old topic out

253
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,444
at a place like this?

254
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,944
What?

255
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,944
I'll give you a present from me to you.

256
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:50,044
This is the ticket to the preview of Star Blade?

257
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:52,044
You called and asked

258
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,244
if I had any extra tickets, right?

259
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,944
But, you said you didn't have any left last night.

260
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:57,944
I got urgent business to attend to suddenly

261
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,544
so I ended up not being able to go.

262
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:02,744
That's why I called you this morning.

263
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,744
Besides, I thought that if I gave it to you here,

264
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,044
it would also make Ami happy.

265
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:13,144
Remember? The accident happened right below here, didn't it?

266
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,244
Yeah, right.

267
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,544
Since that accident,

268
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,744
we haven't been comfortable with each other,

269
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,044
so this is a token of me making up with you.

270
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:28,044
Hey, hey, they'll be opening the doors in five minutes!

271
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:29,044
What?

272
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,144
If you don't hurry,

273
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,344
you won't make it in time for the event to be held before the movie.

274
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,844
No joke?

275
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,844
Okay, thanks Tatei!

276
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,844
Yeah. Go and watch the movie closely for me too!

277
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,744
Okay! I'll go watch really closely the actions of Dark Takio,

278
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:45,044
your favorite character!

279
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:46,944
Although I'm pretty sure Bei-Ju and Kisasa

280
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,944
are going to beat him up.

281
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:50,044
Yeah.

282
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,244
I'll treat you to something some other time in exchange for this ticket!

283
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,344
Yeah.

284
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,044
Ami.

285
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:10,644
I'm sorry to have left you all alone three years ago.

286
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:19,944
Hang on.

287
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:23,644
I'll head over to where you are from now.

288
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:27,644
No use.

289
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:33,144
Even if you jump off from there now...

290
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:35,844
It'll only look like any other suicide.

291
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:40,344
Because I'll testify that

292
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:44,144
I saw you jump over the fence by yourself!

293
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:48,644
You're the boy that was standing in line for the pre-screening.

294
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,944
You seem to be misunderstanding something,

295
00:15:50,944 --> 00:15:53,444
I was leaning over just to see the landscape.

296
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,944
The scenario you wrote goes like this...

297
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:02,244
First, you randomly chose somebody who was standing in line.

298
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:05,144
Befriend them by telling that you're a great Star Blade fan.

299
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,244
Then, you take pictures with that person.

300
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,844
Saying that you'd send the picture you took,

301
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:15,344
you'd have them write their name and address into your pocketbook.

302
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,744
You rip off the page

303
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:19,444
and put it inside the film case and put it into your pocket.

304
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:22,644
You probably then told your friend to call you when he arrives

305
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:25,144
and lured him out here.

306
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,744
When your friend calls you,

307
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,044
you shout his name as well as where he is,

308
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,744
and make the people that you have befriended remember both.

309
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:36,944
Then you leave the line, saying that you'd be right back,

310
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:39,644
meet your friend and take him to this roof,

311
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:40,944
then all you had to do was to give your friend the ticket

312
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:42,544
and jump from this roof.

313
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:48,344
Since we were chosen by you to become friends with you,

314
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:50,544
if you die and our picture, name and address

315
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,744
are found among your belongings,

316
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,744
the police will most naturally contact us.

317
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:57,444
If the police learns from us

318
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:00,944
how much of a fan of this movie you are,

319
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,244
and that the friend who called

320
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:06,344
really wanted your ticket for the preview,

321
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:10,144
and if he is found to be holding the preview tickets

322
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,744
with your fingerprints on it,

323
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,944
they would most probably think...

324
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:19,644
This friend of yours called you just before the preview

325
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:22,344
and pushed you off the roof

326
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:24,844
and stole the ticket from you.

327
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,144
By the way,

328
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,144
you deliberately asked where the elevator was

329
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,444
because you wanted to leave an impression that you were with a friend.

330
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,644
You also deliberately dropped your ticket

331
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:40,044
to get my friend's fingerprints on it.

332
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:44,844
After the preview, if among the tickets that the police collect,

333
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:48,344
they find a ticket with the fingerprints of your friend

334
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,744
and my friend fingerprints on,

335
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:54,844
it would serve as proof that when you met us today,

336
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:57,444
you in fact had that ticket with you.

337
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,644
You're a smart boy.

338
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,244
But, I wonder if the police will really believe the testimony

339
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:08,044
and deduction of just you alone.

340
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,744
They sure will!

341
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:12,944
He alone may not do, but...

342
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:16,144
-If there are five of us... -They'll believe us!

343
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:18,344
Besides, we passed the man

344
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:20,744
that looked to be your friend just a while ago,

345
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:22,544
but I think he's already left the building

346
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:25,644
and headed for the movie preview.

347
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,144
So, even if you were to jump off now,

348
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:31,544
there would be a time discrepancy and your trick would go to waste.

349
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,644
Too bad.

350
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,144
Darn.

351
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:37,244
You don't understand a tinge of how I feel.

352
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:39,344
In fact we do.

353
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:43,244
Your motive for doing this is because three years ago,

354
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:46,144
your girlfriend died of a traffic accident,

355
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:49,644
in which this friend of yours was driving, right?

356
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:51,444
How did you find out about it?

357
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:55,444
You had a ticket and picture stuck inside your pocketbook, didn't you?

358
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:59,344
It was the preview ticket of Star Blade V three years ago,

359
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,344
and the picture was of you and your girlfriend

360
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:04,944
sitting in the backseat of the car.

361
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,244
The one who took the picture was probably the driver

362
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,744
and a friend who agreed to take your picture.

363
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:13,444
Moreover, there was blood on one of the tickets,

364
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,944
and the date on the picture was the same

365
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,344
as the date of the preview three years ago,

366
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:18,644
so it's not hard to deduce.

367
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:22,844
An accident that prevented you from going to the preview occurred,

368
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:25,944
and the one who was to blame for it was that friend of yours

369
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:28,544
that you tried to set up as a killer for murdering you,

370
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:32,544
as well as the one who was most probably driving the car.

371
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,644
Yeah, exactly.

372
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:38,844
If he didn't over sleep that day...

373
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,744
If only he had come to pick us up at the appointed time...

374
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:43,444
We wouldn't have had to run into that hateful truck

375
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,444
with the driver sleeping at the wheels!

376
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,344
But, that's...

377
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:53,044
Holding a grudge against the wrong person, isn't it?

378
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:59,144
Yeah. I thought so too and held back my feelings.

379
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:03,144
But, after a long absence of three years he calls me and says,

380
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:07,244
"Do you have any extra tickets for the preview of Star Blade VI?"

381
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:10,344
And after taking the ticket from me,

382
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,744
he headed happily towards the theater.

383
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,644
As if he'd forgotten about what happened three years ago.

384
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,444
All he was thinking about

385
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:20,844
was the confrontation of Dark Takio against Bei-Ju and Kisasa.

386
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,344
Those two are not going to fight!

387
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:26,944
Dark Takio is now on Bei-Ju and Kisasa's side!

388
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,344
I see.

389
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:32,444
Neither he, nor his friend hasn't saw Star Blade V.

390
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:36,444
But, his friend still wanted the ticket, which means...

391
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,644
Is the site of the accident that happened three years ago near here?

392
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,044
Yeah.

393
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,744
That's why I was going to jump off from this building.

394
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,244
Please take me there.

395
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:53,644
He's the man we passed a while ago in the building.

396
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:56,444
But, that's not where the theater is.

397
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,144
Narukawa?

398
00:20:58,144 --> 00:20:59,944
Where's the site of the accident?

399
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,444
Over there.

400
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,444
She was dragged blown over by the truck

401
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:05,844
and crashed into that guard rail.

402
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,844
Something's stuck here.

403
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,044
Just as I thought.

404
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,544
What's that?

405
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,944
The ticket for the preview of Star Blade VI.

406
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,344
What?

407
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:24,044
The ticket of three years ago is stuck on this side.

408
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:26,344
It's all beat up from wind and rain though.

409
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,844
But, why would he...

410
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,544
What an idiot!

411
00:21:30,544 --> 00:21:32,844
He wanted your girlfriend to see the preview!

412
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:37,844
If he offers it here, it may reach the heavens, right?

413
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:43,244
Besides, since he said nothing about it to you,

414
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:48,844
I'm sure he liked your girlfriend too.

415
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:51,144
Almost as much as you did.

416
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,044
There's only three minutes to go

417
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:24,544
till the event before the preview starts.

418
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,644
What?

419
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:29,044
Why don't you come to the preview with us too?

420
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:32,444
Watch it closely, and tell your girlfriend about it!

421
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,344
The fact is, we have one extra ticket.

422
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:37,944
It's Pops' ticket because he decided not to come.

423
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,244
Thank you.

424
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:42,744
But, I don't think so.

425
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:44,944
Because I didn't see Star Blade V yet.

426
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:49,344
And, as for Star Blade V and VI,

427
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,644
I'll buy the DVD

428
00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:52,644
because I want to watch it with him at his house.

429
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,244
They're late.

430
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:17,044
The mini cars, dolls and books that were lined out on the shelf

431
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:20,144
almost all of them are upside down.

432
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:22,044
How come?

433
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:29,444
Next Conan,

434
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:33,344
"Result of the Tumble (Part 1)"

435
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:51,644
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:53,344
"Collection"

437
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:54,844
Collector appears in the next episode!

438
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,644
Haibara, what are you collecting?

439
00:24:56,644 --> 00:24:57,944
It's a secret.
