1
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.740
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom!

2
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.640
Flower viewing at a shrine is great too, isn't it?

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.140
Really, the weather's nice too.

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.340
It's indeed a day for flower viewing.

5
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.040
My stomach is indeed ready for having lunch!

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.740
Geez Genta.

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.840
It's indeed a case of dumplings over flowers.

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.640
Then, Doc.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.540
We'll go draw some oracles

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.340
so will you save a place for us and spread out the sheet for us as well?

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.940
Okay.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.840
Okay, let's go!

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.240
-Thank you! -Conan, let's go!

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.440
Yeah.

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840
-What is it? -Huh?

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.640
Are you looking for something?

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
Oh, no. Not really.

18
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

19
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.940
are slashed by the light of deduction.

20
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.840
Information gets complicated under the cherry blossom tree.

21
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
A queer case and the FBI.

22
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.169
"In Reminiscence of Jodie and the Trap of Flower Viewing"

26
00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.269
"Bad Luck"

27
00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.369
Of all days, why today?

28
00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.369
It says I'm lucky.

29
00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:14.969
Mine says medium lucky!

30
00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.969
Mine says least luck, so well...

31
00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.569
Then let's go tie the oracles!

32
00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.969
-Okay! -Hey.

33
00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.069
Huh?

34
00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.269
You drew yourselves good oracles so take them home!

35
00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.569
You tie oracles in order to leave bad luck behind

36
00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.169
and change your day to lucky.

37
00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.769
It seems that recently a bad custom of tying all oracles

38
00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.169
have become prevalent.

39
00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.869
So, the only one who has to tie the oracle is Conan?

40
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.869
She snuck a look at mine.

41
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.369
And, what did you draw?

42
00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.069
Oh, do you want to know?

43
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.869
Not really.

44
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.169
If you want to know that badly, why not?

45
00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.769
Super lucky?

46
00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.169
-Wow, Ai! -How lucky!

47
00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.369
Will you change it with mine?

48
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.769
But I hear that super bad luck is rarely drawn,

49
00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.569
so it actually means good luck.

50
00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.769
Don't let it depress you, cool kid!

51
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.769
Jodie!

52
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.769
Jodie!

53
00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.969
Hi.

54
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.469
Did you come to view flowers too?

55
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.769
Oh, yes! I love cherry blossoms, you see!

56
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.069
I see?

57
00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.469
You called Jodie over so that you could

58
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.769
talk in secret with her, didn't you?

59
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.269
Huh?

60
00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:39.869
They say that parks and shrines

61
00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:44.069
are often used by spies to exchange information.

62
00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.469
Okay, everybody. Let's go elsewhere.

63
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.869
It seems they want to talk in secret, just the two of them.

64
00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:52.869
Okay.

65
00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:55.069
But, well, it's a place

66
00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.469
where the security police are on the lookout too.

67
00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.869
Take care.

68
00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:03.069
Okay.

69
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.369
And? What is it you want to talk to me about?

70
00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:11.769
Well, you said before that

71
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.069
you saw Mr. Akai who had a burn, didn't you?

72
00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.869
Yes.

73
00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:20.069
During that bank robbery case.

74
00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.669
Shu?

75
00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.769
Hey, hold it!

76
00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.269
Shu!

77
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.569
Oh, sorry.

78
00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.169
Shu...

79
00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.669
Are you Shu? You're Shu, aren't you?

80
00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.769
Tell me that you're Shu!

81
00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.869
A burn scar.

82
00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:09.069
That...

83
00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.569
That wasn't Mr. Akai

84
00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.969
but one of the members of the men in black,

85
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.369
Bourbon in disguise.

86
00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.069
Huh?

87
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.769
In order to check if Mr. Akai really died or not,

88
00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:24.469
he was going around people who knew Mr. Akai

89
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.369
under that disguise.

90
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.969
Because if the FBI were faking his death,

91
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.769
they'd be able to tell by the way you react.

92
00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.769
Well, back during the Bell Tree Express incident,

93
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:36.269
it seems that Vermouth herself, was disguised as Mr. Akai,

94
00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:37.569
although she was the one who made

95
00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.769
Bourbon disguise himself as Mr. Akai.

96
00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:44.369
Bell Tree Express?

97
00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:48.069
That train explosion was their doing too?

98
00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:55.969
Yep. It seems so.

99
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.669
Hold it.

100
00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:02.369
If that man with the burn was one of them...

101
00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:06.769
then, Shu really is...

102
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.669
Then, the next time that man with the burn appears,

103
00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.669
I'll nab him and peel off his disguise,

104
00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.269
then expose his identity.

105
00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:19.969
I know his identity!

106
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:21.169
Huh?

107
00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.669
-As well as his whereabouts too! -What?

108
00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.569
He goes by the name Toru Amuro,

109
00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.869
and part-times at the coffee shop Poirot

110
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:30.969
below the Mouri Detective Agency.

111
00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:33.669
-Why? -I wonder.

112
00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.369
That's why I had you come here.

113
00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:39.469
I want the FBI to check on it.

114
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:43.069
On why he's still at Poirot despite having achieved

115
00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:45.469
what he had to do.

116
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:46.769
Achieved what he had to do?

117
00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:48.269
Yeah, that's...

118
00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:50.169
Huh?

119
00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.569
Aren't you the non-Japanese woman

120
00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.469
who was held hostage with me during the bank robbery?

121
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:58.769
Huh?

122
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:02.869
I was diagonally behind you back then,

123
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:05.769
and the one who taped your eyes and mouth with masking tape

124
00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:07.769
was my wife.

125
00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:09.769
Don't you remember me?

126
00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:13.869
Yes, sort of.

127
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:17.369
Then, was that man with the burn scar

128
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:20.369
who was next to you back then your boyfriend?

129
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:23.369
No. What's with you?

130
00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.769
Oh, no.

131
00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.869
If not, it's okay.

132
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:29.369
I saw him two or three days ago, you see.

133
00:08:29.369 --> 00:08:33.169
-Huh? -Where? Where'd you see him?

134
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.169
-Answer me! -Huh?

135
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.369
Pickpocket! There's a pickpocket!

136
00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:42.469
Ouch.

137
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:44.969
-Are you all right? -Are you okay? Madam?

138
00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:46.469
Yes.

139
00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:49.369
Somebody put his hand into my bag,

140
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:51.069
so I was sort of flustered.

141
00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:52.869
It's true that there are a lot of pickpockets

142
00:08:52.869 --> 00:08:54.469
around in crowded places like these.

143
00:08:54.469 --> 00:08:55.869
Yes.

144
00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:01.069
Yes. It's very true.

145
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:04.069
We've got to be careful.

146
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:06.669
Goodbye, then.

147
00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:21.369
No, Genta!

148
00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:23.269
You're not supposed to drink that water.

149
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:25.169
Huh? Oh?

150
00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:26.469
You're supposed to just rinse your mouth

151
00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:28.869
and spit it out on the ground!

152
00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:31.769
And? You can't remember yet?

153
00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:33.769
Where you saw him?

154
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:37.569
No. I was knocked out in bed because of a cold yesterday

155
00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:38.869
so my memory's...

156
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:43.169
Your voice is really hoarse.

157
00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:46.669
Then, maybe you should gargle your mouth with this water too?

158
00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:50.669
No, thanks. I don't want to give my cold to anyone,

159
00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:53.069
and I already cleansed my hands a while ago.

160
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:54.969
Could it be that you saw him

161
00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:58.369
in front of a coffee vending machine somewhere?

162
00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:00.869
Canned coffee? Does he like it?

163
00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:03.169
The man?

164
00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:06.069
Yes. He used to drink a lot of it.

165
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:09.769
Yes, even back when those guys were about to

166
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:11.469
attack the hospital.

167
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:15.969
Shu.

168
00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:18.369
Doesn't he look familiar?

169
00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:21.069
He's one of the men who was added to the investigation team.

170
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:22.669
Beats me.

171
00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:25.169
As for those on the same team.

172
00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:28.469
I don't forget the faces of enemies, though.

173
00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:32.169
Well, it's only natural that he looks familiar.

174
00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.869
He's an FBI agent after all.

175
00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:36.569
Yes.

176
00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:41.269
But, when I look at him, I sense something dangerous.

177
00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:55.069
Shu.

178
00:10:56.569 --> 00:11:01.269
He must've been tired to have dropped the canned coffee.

179
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:02.969
Rather, an attack?

180
00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:05.269
Oh no, no!

181
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:07.169
That man and the man with the burn scar

182
00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:09.369
are two different people.

183
00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.269
Never mind already!

184
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.669
If you recall something, contact me here, will you?

185
00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:15.969
Yes, I will.

186
00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:18.569
Strange.

187
00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:20.769
In the Bell Tree Express,

188
00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:25.669
Bourbon said that he was convinced that Mr. Akai died, and yet...

189
00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:29.569
Why does he still need to disguise himself as Mr. Akai?

190
00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:33.469
What on earth for?

191
00:11:47.156 --> 00:11:51.456
No, Genta! You shouldn't ring it so hard!

192
00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:55.656
But, Dad told me that I should do things like this energetically.

193
00:11:55.656 --> 00:11:57.456
Exactly!

194
00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:06.856
That bell is to let god know that you've come here.

195
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:08.756
That's why you have to ring it many times

196
00:12:08.756 --> 00:12:10.956
or else god may not notice you've come.

197
00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:13.356
-Oh. -I didn't know that.

198
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:15.356
Okay!

199
00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:18.456
I'll ring it with all my might then!

200
00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.556
-Hey. -Huh?

201
00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:23.756
The man you were talking about a while ago,

202
00:12:23.756 --> 00:12:26.356
that man called Akai, who is he?

203
00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:27.556
Why?

204
00:12:27.556 --> 00:12:32.556
Somehow he sounds like someone I know.

205
00:12:32.556 --> 00:12:35.256
Maybe not.

206
00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.256
Besides Mr. Akai is already...

207
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.456
Huh, dead?

208
00:12:40.356 --> 00:12:42.156
-No joke? -Yeah!

209
00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:45.156
There's a big fuss behind the restroom!

210
00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:46.756
Let's go look!

211
00:12:50.656 --> 00:12:52.856
Doc? What's up?

212
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:56.256
Bad news, Shinichi! It's a homicide!

213
00:12:56.256 --> 00:13:00.056
I seem to have witnessed a murder!

214
00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:03.556
What? You witnessed a murder?

215
00:13:03.556 --> 00:13:05.556
At any rate, rush over here, will you!

216
00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:07.856
They're a lot of spectators here already.

217
00:13:07.856 --> 00:13:10.356
I'm sure you'll find the place right away!

218
00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:16.256
Over there!

219
00:13:19.156 --> 00:13:21.956
And, did you see the perp?

220
00:13:21.956 --> 00:13:24.356
I only got to see the silhouette,

221
00:13:24.356 --> 00:13:26.056
but the perp was flinging a stick about 30cm

222
00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.756
and hitting the victim repeatedly.

223
00:13:28.756 --> 00:13:32.256
A stick about 30cm long? Slugged to death!

224
00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.756
Hey.

225
00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:38.956
Out of the way, move!

226
00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.856
This person.

227
00:13:48.056 --> 00:13:49.156
No joke?

228
00:13:49.156 --> 00:13:52.356
She's the one that bumped into Jodie a while ago.

229
00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:54.056
Why?

230
00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:57.856
Not much time seems to have gone by since she was killed.

231
00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:02.456
A 5 yen coin painted black with a Sharpie.

232
00:14:02.856 --> 00:14:04.756
'Kurobei'!

233
00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:06.356
'Kurobei'?

234
00:14:06.356 --> 00:14:08.156
The nickname of this pickpocket.

235
00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:10.056
She's called by that name because

236
00:14:10.056 --> 00:14:12.956
she sneaks three black 5 yen coins into the pockets

237
00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:14.556
of those she pickpockets.

238
00:14:14.556 --> 00:14:16.456
Why do something like that?

239
00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.456
It's rumored to be a play on words.

240
00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:19.956
The five (go) for a 5 yen coin,

241
00:14:19.956 --> 00:14:23.156
the black (kuro) color of the Sharpie, and 3 (san) coins

242
00:14:23.156 --> 00:14:25.556
make up the word "gokurosan" (Thank you).

243
00:14:25.556 --> 00:14:27.756
In other words, thank you for earning money for me

244
00:14:27.756 --> 00:14:30.356
to pickpocket from you.

245
00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:32.756
Officer, this way, this way!

246
00:14:32.756 --> 00:14:33.756
Doc!

247
00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:36.356
Huh? Who are you children?

248
00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:38.156
Get away from the corpse!

249
00:14:38.156 --> 00:14:43.556
I'm an FBI agent Jodie Starling!

250
00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:45.556
FBI?

251
00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:48.556
Block the entrance and exit of this shrine immediately!

252
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:52.056
-Get the police detectives. -Yes, ma'am!

253
00:14:52.056 --> 00:14:55.256
Then, the perp is that person called Kurobei?

254
00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:56.356
No.

255
00:14:56.356 --> 00:14:59.256
Since the coin purse that she had on her

256
00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:02.956
was filled with black painted coins.

257
00:15:02.956 --> 00:15:07.156
She's probably Kurobei herself!

258
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.156
-Huh? -This pack of bills

259
00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:14.156
that's bundled together with a rubber band inside her wallet.

260
00:15:14.156 --> 00:15:15.456
Inside it...

261
00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:18.056
This is a GPS transmitter.

262
00:15:18.056 --> 00:15:19.756
Transmitter?

263
00:15:19.756 --> 00:15:22.156
If a cell phone is used with only a discrepancy of five meters,

264
00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:23.256
the location can be specified.

265
00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.056
If a thing like that were inside the wallet

266
00:15:26.056 --> 00:15:29.056
wrapped inside a pack of bills of a pickpocket...

267
00:15:29.056 --> 00:15:33.556
Yeah. The one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei

268
00:15:33.556 --> 00:15:35.456
is probably the killer!

269
00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:43.456
We give out the orders, Jodie.

270
00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:47.856
You may be a FBI agent but this is Japan, you know.

271
00:15:47.856 --> 00:15:52.256
Moreover, you're here on vacation, aren't you?

272
00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:54.156
With you going around giving out orders on your own,

273
00:15:54.156 --> 00:15:56.956
we'll lose face.

274
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.556
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:01.356
My usual habit took command of me.

276
00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:05.056
But, this site is far from the entrance or exit of the shrine.

277
00:16:05.056 --> 00:16:10.256
Not too much time had passed since the victim was killed.

278
00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:12.856
So by closing off the entrance and exit of the shrine,

279
00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:15.356
I'm sure the perp has been contained.

280
00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:18.556
Right, Conan?

281
00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:21.856
Well, it's true that you did the right thing,

282
00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.356
and it helped us out but...

283
00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:26.556
But, is it true?

284
00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:28.756
That this woman who was slugged to death

285
00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:29.756
was who the 3rd investigation division's

286
00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.356
been pursuing all these years,

287
00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:33.456
that she's the pickpocket Kurobei?

288
00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:35.456
I think there's no mistake about it.

289
00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:38.856
In the coin purse that she had on her,

290
00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:42.956
there were a lot of black painted 5 yen coins.

291
00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.356
It seems that Kurobei actually did leave

292
00:16:45.356 --> 00:16:48.056
three black painted 5 yen coins in the pockets

293
00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:50.056
of those she pickpocketed but...

294
00:16:51.356 --> 00:16:52.756
And?

295
00:16:52.756 --> 00:16:54.856
Is it true that you witnessed Kurobei

296
00:16:54.856 --> 00:16:57.556
being slugged to death, Dr. Agasa?

297
00:16:57.556 --> 00:16:59.356
Yes.

298
00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:02.656
I happened to witness it when I came out here

299
00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.756
after using the restroom.

300
00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:06.756
Since this place is in the shade of the tree and dark,

301
00:17:06.756 --> 00:17:10.856
at first I thought that someone was just hammering something.

302
00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:12.756
Did you see the perp's face?

303
00:17:12.756 --> 00:17:15.856
It was mostly all silhouetted.

304
00:17:15.856 --> 00:17:18.256
What I'm sure of is that the perp was wearing a hat,

305
00:17:18.256 --> 00:17:22.856
and also was holding a thin stick about 30cm long.

306
00:17:22.856 --> 00:17:26.356
I see. So, that's the murder weapon.

307
00:17:26.356 --> 00:17:28.956
Any other characteristics of the perp?

308
00:17:28.956 --> 00:17:30.756
Let's see.

309
00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:33.856
Oh, come to think of it, when the perp left,

310
00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:36.556
he was dragging his leg a bit!

311
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.656
So, I called out to ask if he was okay.

312
00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:41.656
Dragging his leg?

313
00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:43.756
And, what about the perp?

314
00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:46.156
He ignored me and left.

315
00:17:46.156 --> 00:17:51.056
By the time I found out that the perp had slugged a woman,

316
00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:52.856
he had already disappeared into the crowd.

317
00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:54.856
I see.

318
00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:55.956
Inspector.

319
00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:58.856
If the perp wanted to get out of here as fast as possible

320
00:17:58.856 --> 00:18:01.256
and the perp was dragging his leg...

321
00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:04.156
It doesn't seem to be an act

322
00:18:04.156 --> 00:18:06.656
to make it off the suspect's list.

323
00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:11.056
But, with only that to go on, it'll be more than difficult

324
00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.756
to figure out who did it from among this crowd of flower viewers...

325
00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:16.756
That's close to impossible to do.

326
00:18:16.756 --> 00:18:19.556
I think you can narrow down the target a bit more.

327
00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:24.156
There was something strange in that lady's wallet too.

328
00:18:24.156 --> 00:18:25.356
Something strange?

329
00:18:25.356 --> 00:18:28.656
A GPS transmitter wrapped inside the bills!

330
00:18:28.656 --> 00:18:30.856
Why would something like that be...

331
00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:34.456
If that pickpocket Kurobei was never caught,

332
00:18:34.456 --> 00:18:36.256
it would be impossible to identify Kurobei

333
00:18:36.256 --> 00:18:38.156
until the 5 yen coins painted black

334
00:18:38.156 --> 00:18:40.656
are put into the pocket of the person who was pickpocketed!

335
00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:43.156
So, by making Kurobei deliberately pickpocket

336
00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.656
a wallet with the GPS transmitter inside, the perp,

337
00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.956
after locating the whereabouts of Kurobei using a cell phone,

338
00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:49.956
waits for Kurobei to go to a lonely place

339
00:18:49.956 --> 00:18:51.556
then slugs her to death!

340
00:18:51.556 --> 00:18:55.656
Then the one who was pickpocketed by Kurobei's the perp?

341
00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:58.756
But, pickpockets frequently work in groups too.

342
00:18:58.756 --> 00:19:02.456
So it could be that they got into a fight and...

343
00:19:02.456 --> 00:19:03.856
True.

344
00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:06.656
I think Kurobei worked alone.

345
00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:09.656
She herself, shouted, "Pickpocket!"

346
00:19:09.656 --> 00:19:12.056
Huh? Just what do you mean?

347
00:19:12.056 --> 00:19:14.256
It's a trick that most pickpockets use!

348
00:19:14.256 --> 00:19:15.856
When you hear that a pickpocket is around,

349
00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:18.956
most people check their wallets, don't they?

350
00:19:18.956 --> 00:19:20.956
That's how pickpockets figure out where their targets

351
00:19:20.956 --> 00:19:23.156
keep their wallets.

352
00:19:23.156 --> 00:19:24.656
And, if she had an accomplice,

353
00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:28.156
she'd make the accomplice do that part, right?

354
00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:32.656
That's why I think she also took your wallet, Jodie.

355
00:19:32.656 --> 00:19:35.856
Oh! My wallet's gone!

356
00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:41.256
She probably took it when you helped her up!

357
00:19:44.156 --> 00:19:48.556
But with the pickpocket dead...

358
00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:50.756
How on earth do we go about looking for the victims

359
00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.656
who were pickpocketed?

360
00:19:52.656 --> 00:19:55.056
As to that, I think that soon...

361
00:19:58.956 --> 00:20:01.956
Conan, we found it!

362
00:20:01.956 --> 00:20:04.956
Inside the trash can that was on the side of

363
00:20:04.956 --> 00:20:06.456
where the oracles are tied!

364
00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:08.956
I also found one!

365
00:20:08.956 --> 00:20:12.856
Inside the trash can near the place I drank the water!

366
00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:15.756
Oh! Found another one!

367
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.856
Inside the trash can of the place where the bell is rung!

368
00:20:18.856 --> 00:20:22.556
The shrine owner is taking it for me now!

369
00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.356
Here, it was inside the trash can a bit ahead

370
00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.456
of the toilet that was the crime scene.

371
00:20:26.456 --> 00:20:28.356
They were about to collect the trash,

372
00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:30.756
but I asked them to let me search the trash first.

373
00:20:30.756 --> 00:20:32.956
Okay, then bring the wallets you found

374
00:20:32.956 --> 00:20:35.056
without putting your fingerprints on them!

375
00:20:35.056 --> 00:20:37.256
-Okay! -Copy.

376
00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:39.256
Right, the wallets!

377
00:20:39.256 --> 00:20:41.056
Pickpockets remove only the money

378
00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:42.856
and dispose of the wallets,

379
00:20:42.856 --> 00:20:45.756
so if we search the contents of the wallets...

380
00:20:45.756 --> 00:20:49.556
We could maybe find the owners of the wallets.

381
00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:50.956
Yes!

382
00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:58.356
Are these four wallets all that you found in the trash cans?

383
00:20:58.356 --> 00:21:01.256
Yes, because the workers said they started

384
00:21:01.256 --> 00:21:02.756
collecting trash from the trash can

385
00:21:02.756 --> 00:21:04.556
that I was searching.

386
00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:07.556
Oh, that blue wallet is mine!

387
00:21:07.556 --> 00:21:10.156
Then, you're one of the suspects too.

388
00:21:10.156 --> 00:21:11.156
What?

389
00:21:11.156 --> 00:21:13.356
No, Jodie's not!

390
00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.356
She was with us right through

391
00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:17.656
after she bumped into that lady!

392
00:21:17.656 --> 00:21:20.456
She had no time to kill anybody!

393
00:21:20.456 --> 00:21:23.256
Oh, is that so?

394
00:21:24.456 --> 00:21:26.456
If so, the killer

395
00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:28.956
is highly likely to be one of the owners

396
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:31.556
of the three wallets that are left.

397
00:21:33.756 --> 00:21:38.056
Oh! Maybe the owner of this wallet can be found right away

398
00:21:38.056 --> 00:21:40.456
since there's a driver's license inside.

399
00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:43.656
Yeah! I saw this man a while ago.

400
00:21:43.656 --> 00:21:45.556
-Huh? -He's the one

401
00:21:45.556 --> 00:21:47.456
who came to talk to Jodie!

402
00:21:47.456 --> 00:21:50.256
He said he had a cold and was wearing a mask!

403
00:21:50.256 --> 00:21:52.256
I see.

404
00:21:54.156 --> 00:21:55.956
It seems that the only wallet with a driver's license inside

405
00:21:55.956 --> 00:21:59.056
is just this black wallet though.

406
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.256
A photo?

407
00:22:00.256 --> 00:22:04.156
I know her too!

408
00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.156
What?

409
00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:08.056
She taught us how to ring the bell!

410
00:22:08.056 --> 00:22:10.856
I think she's still around some place.

411
00:22:12.556 --> 00:22:16.756
In the last red wallet, the only thing inside

412
00:22:16.756 --> 00:22:19.756
is an oracle that says "little lucky".

413
00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.756
I guess the owner of this wallet won't be found.

414
00:22:23.756 --> 00:22:26.456
I think it's that old man's wallet.

415
00:22:26.456 --> 00:22:29.156
He said that lucky oracles should be taken home.

416
00:22:29.156 --> 00:22:32.056
Yes. Besides, I saw!

417
00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:33.156
He was in front of us

418
00:22:33.156 --> 00:22:35.256
and took money out from that red wallet

419
00:22:35.256 --> 00:22:36.856
to buy the oracle!

420
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.456
Oh! I saw it too!

421
00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:40.856
We thought it was a wallet

422
00:22:40.856 --> 00:22:43.456
that didn't match an old man like him!

423
00:22:43.456 --> 00:22:45.456
Do you know what he looks like?

424
00:22:45.456 --> 00:22:48.356
-Yep! -We'll go look for him then!

425
00:22:48.356 --> 00:22:49.856
Please wait for us to come back!

426
00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.856
Hey, all of you!

427
00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:54.256
The person may be a murderer, you know!

428
00:22:54.256 --> 00:22:56.856
Officer Takagi, you go with the children!

429
00:22:56.856 --> 00:22:58.656
Yes, sir!

430
00:22:59.756 --> 00:23:04.356
If one of the three has a stick about 30cm,

431
00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:05.856
then we got the perp.

432
00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:07.556
I think you'll be able to tell right away

433
00:23:07.556 --> 00:23:09.056
even if the perp doesn't have it!

434
00:23:09.056 --> 00:23:12.356
Just what do you mean, Conan?

435
00:23:12.356 --> 00:23:15.656
Because the perp left 3 painted black 5 yen coins

436
00:23:15.656 --> 00:23:19.156
near the corpse, as if to say, I'm paying you back!

437
00:23:19.156 --> 00:23:20.556
Huh?

438
00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:23.056
5 yen coins that are so unique

439
00:23:23.056 --> 00:23:26.156
are not that easy to prepare, are they?

440
00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:27.656
I get it!

441
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:30.556
So, the person that doesn't have the black 5 yen coins

442
00:23:30.556 --> 00:23:34.556
that Kurobei would've put into his pocket is the perp!

443
00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:36.656
Right!
