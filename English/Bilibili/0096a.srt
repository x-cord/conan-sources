1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,900
A racing second hand,
a shining comet!

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,100
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,480
Today is the first two-hour special!
Try your hand at the two cases!

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,150
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,280
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,990
His name?

7
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,663
"The Great Detective is Cornered!
Two Big Murder Cases in a Row"

8
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,069
Agasa Residence

9
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,329
C'mon! Hear me out, Shin-chan!
Agasa Residence

10
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,369
Yeah, yeah. I'm listening, Mom.

11
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,649
Yusaku left early this morning

12
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,439
Kudo Yukiko, Shinichi's mother and actress
and came home totally drunk again!

13
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,379
Oh, he makes me so mad!
Kudo Yukiko, Shinichi's mother and actress

14
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:00,589
He can't help it.
Dad's a popular novelist.

15
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,899
He has to socialize
with all kinds of people.

16
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,729
Whose lipstick is on his shirt, then?!

17
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:07,019
Oh, I'm so mad! I'm gonna cheat on him, too!

18
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,099
Kudo Yusaku, World-renowned mystery writer
Oh, I'm so mad! I'm gonna cheat on him, too!

19
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,729
Whoa, calm down!

20
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,709
Oh, I'm busy right now.

21
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:15,649
Wait! Shinichi!

22
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,189
What's wrong? I assume
that was Yukiko-san?

23
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,189
She was complaining
about her marital strife.

24
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,369
Dad coming home drunk,
dad cheating on her...

25
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,119
C-Cheating?!

26
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,479
It's just a misunderstanding.

27
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,399
All he thinks about is mysteries.
He'd never be that good-for-nothing.

28
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:41,129
Besides, their fights are almost
annual events. No point in worrying.

29
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,569
Yes. They're so close they argue a lot.

30
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,179
Incidentally, how are things with you?

31
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,929
With me?

32
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:54,139
You know, with Ran-kun.
Are you getting along well?

33
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,929
She gets mad every time I call her.
"When will you finally be back?!"

34
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:03,809
Even though we almost see too
much of each other every single day.

35
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,309
Now, don't be like that.

36
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:13,479
Why not take a break from your
cases and go somewhere with her?

37
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,129
Autumn is the season for love!

38
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,529
The season for love indeed...

39
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:23,589
Mori Detective Agency

40
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:25,859
I'm back!

41
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,089
You idiot!
I'm back!

42
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:27,099
You idiot!

43
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,639
Mind your own business!

44
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,289
What's with that tone?

45
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,019
Kisaki Eri, Ran's mother and attorney
What's with that tone?

46
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,979
Here I am, trying to give you another client.
Kisaki Eri, Ran's mother and attorney

47
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,479
As if I need your help!

48
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,849
Then do whatever you want.

49
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,239
But don't blame me when business
isn't going well, Great Detective.

50
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,949
Yes, thank you for worrying
about me, Great Attorney!

51
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,579
These two are having
their own marital spat.

52
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,289
Autumn's the season of love? Yeah, right.

53
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:03,599
Autumn's the season of hunger.

54
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,199
Hurry home, Ran. I'm starving...

55
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,799
I'm home!

56
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:11,889
Yeah.

57
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,599
Huh?

58
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,729
Looking for Conan?
He's asleep on the sofa.

59
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:17,809
Oh.

60
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,809
Sheesh! Dozing off in a place like this!

61
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:24,859
Hungry...

62
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,679
Yes, yes! I'll make something right now!

63
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:30,809
Sheesh! At least take
your glasses off when you sleep!

64
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:37,809
This face... I've seen
it somewhere, long ago...

65
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,889
Welcome back, Ran-neechan.

66
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,719
Huh? G-Give back my glasses!

67
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,099
Come to think of it, you're
always wearing glasses, Conan-kun.

68
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,479
Even when sleeping
or taking a bath. Why?

69
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,479
I-Isn't that obvious?
I have bad eyesight.

70
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,479
A-And I can't relax
without them always on!

71
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,699
Pardon me...

72
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,499
Might this be the
Mori Detective Agency?

73
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,709
Y-Yes!

74
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:24,809
I see. So you're the one
she shamelessly sent to me.

75
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:25,619
Huh?

76
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,509
Who's "she"?

77
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:31,009
Your mom, Kisaki Eri-san!
Right, mister?

78
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,309
Eh? No way!
Mom asked for your help?!

79
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:38,479
Oh! You're both getting along!

80
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,269
This means you're pretty
much back together, then!

81
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,649
You set this up, Ran.

82
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,429
I thought it seemed
strange that she'd call me.

83
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:53,659
Kids shouldn't be
meddling with adults' affairs!

84
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:58,749
What's so wrong with doing this?!
I want Mom to come back soon!

85
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,709
You've made things even worse.

86
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,959
So, what brings you here?

87
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:05,839
Yes.

88
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,709
Tsukumo Nanae (42)
Yes.

89
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,349
It's actually about my husband,
Tsukumo Nanae (42)

90
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,179
who died one week ago...
Tsukumo Nanae (42)

91
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,429
Died? You don't think
he was killed, do you?!

92
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:17,969
No. I think it was suicide...

93
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:19,769
You think?

94
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:20,679
Yes.

95
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:27,519
On that day, one week ago,
I left him alone at home.

96
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,729
I couldn't find him when I returned,

97
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,639
so I worriedly checked his
special room in the basement...

98
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:42,179
...where I found his cold
body lying on the ground!

99
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,539
He had swallowed poison...

100
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,679
What sort of poison?

101
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,127
A policeman called it
"aconitine," or something.

102
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,249
Aconitine?

103
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,449
As I recall, it's...

104
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,119
A type of poison that causes denervation.

105
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,669
It's found in the leaves
and roots of wolfsbane.

106
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,749
Just two milligrams is lethal.

107
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,129
It's a powerful toxin that causes
death minutes after ingestion.

108
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,379
B-But where would
you come across that?

109
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,889
Mountains are full of them!

110
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,459
Wolfsbane is used in Chinese medicines,
minus the poison, of course!

111
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,559
No! I mean you, Conan-kun!

112
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:20,289
Eh?

113
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,899
How do you know all that?

114
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,919
T-Television! A monster in Masked
Yaiba mentioned it the other day!

115
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,359
He said, "I'll kill you with this aconitine,
extracted from wolfsbane!"

116
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,909
He must've been a thoughtful
monster to explain the poison like that...

117
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,289
There's no such monster.

118
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,079
So, were you the only
one who found the body?

119
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,839
No. I was with my
husband's three pupils.

120
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,219
Pupils?

121
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:55,379
Umm, my husband
and I are both magicians.

122
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,179
My husband, Tsukumo Motoyasu,
was maybe even world-renowned.

123
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,129
Tsukumo Motoyasu?

124
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,789
I know him! He was on the news!
They said a great magician had died.

125
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:10,039
All you ever watch
is horseracing, mister.

126
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,709
Remember? We all went to
his magic show a long time ago!

127
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,449
Speaking of which, I think there's
a photo of us with Tsukumo-san!

128
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,999
It was at that show that I
met your wife, Kisaki-san.

129
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,169
Oh. So that's why you're here today?

130
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:32,419
Yes. Kisaki-san has been
our attorney ever since then...

131
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,429
Here we are! This is it!

132
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,929
Wait, could this be...

133
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,229
Did you find the photo?

134
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,709
No! I guess I was mistaken!

135
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,279
Say! You should ask
about those three pupils!

136
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,849
Would that be all right?

137
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,249
Yes.

138
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,039
First, is Sanada Kazumi-kun,
our magic troupe's ace.

139
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,789
They say he's to take over for my husband.

140
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:14,209
Next, is Miyoshi Mako-san.
She's strong-minded, but greatly skilled.

141
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,959
There is no better female
magician in Japan than her.

142
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,209
Lastly, is Momochi Yuji-kun.

143
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,829
He hasn't been a pupil for very
long and isn't as skilled as the others,

144
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,269
but he shows great promise.

145
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:30,709
They're all wonderful youngsters,
and all three live with us

146
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,319
and practice magic every day.

147
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:36,319
So, where were they that day?

148
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,169
They were with me at
a Beika Hotel dinner show,

149
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:43,499
doing magic for the audience.

150
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,919
My husband was
supposed to come too,

151
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,039
but he said he
didn't do cheap work...

152
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,289
But, those three were at home
before leaving for the show, right?

153
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:55,379
Wouldn't they have had
the chance to poison him?

154
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,549
H-Hey, now.

155
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:00,549
My husband died while the
show was happening, little boy.

156
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:04,059
But, couldn't they have secretly
given him the poison in a capsule?

157
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:09,499
If so, my husband would've called
for help after noticing the poison.

158
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,499
There was a phone in the basement,

159
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,069
and the door unlocks
easily from the inside...

160
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,829
What about sleeping pills?

161
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,129
Nothing like that was
found in his autopsy, of course.

162
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:25,329
There were no strangle marks,
everything in the house was locked,

163
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,079
and there were absolutely
no signs of entry or exit.

164
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,079
Then that means it
could only be a suicide.

165
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,209
Yes, that's true.

166
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,129
But I just can't imagine my
husband committing suicide!

167
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:39,839
By which you mean?

168
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:45,999
Tomorrow is our daughter,
Ayano's, birthday.

169
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,849
He even got her present a month ago.

170
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,689
He couldn't wait to give it to her.

171
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,379
Does that sound suicidal to you?

172
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,399
That's not the only unusual thing.

173
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,489
We found this on
his desk in the basement.

174
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:07,789
Oh? Cards?

175
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:11,209
The Ace of Spades
and a Jack are stuck together.

176
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,329
The police pulled them apart,
but there was nothing written inside.

177
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,219
I put them back
together to show to you.

178
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,009
Are you sure it
isn't just a magic prop?

179
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:28,079
But my husband never
really did card tricks,

180
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,519
and I've never seen
a prop like this before!

181
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,999
Hey! Let's just go to her house for now!

182
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,249
You're always saying, "Let's go!"

183
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:39,739
I'm the only one going.
You butt out, kid!

184
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,609
Oh, come on! Take Conan-kun!

185
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:48,459
He might be helpful!
He knows all sorts of unusual things!

186
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,079
Yeah, but...

187
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,959
Okay, Conan-kun?

188
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,379
Y-Yeah.

189
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,209
Fine! But you better behave yourselves!

190
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,709
We will!

191
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,599
With Shinichi at a magic show...

192
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,167
Wow!

193
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,747
What an impressive mansion!

194
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:27,777
Of course! The late Motoyasu-san
was a world-renowned magician!

195
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:29,787
Right, Conan-kun?

196
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:30,747
Yeah.

197
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,417
Now, where is the basement
room where your husband died?

198
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:35,047
Yes.

199
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,097
Hold it!

200
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,787
Momochi-kun.

201
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,167
Pardon me, miss.

202
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,667
M-Me?

203
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:45,167
You appear to be greatly troubled.

204
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,297
Momochi Yuji (25) Magician
You appear to be greatly troubled.

205
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:49,507
Eh?!

206
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:52,827
There's no use hiding it. I can tell.

207
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:56,497
After all, you have
a pigeon in your hair!

208
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,227
Wow! That's amazing!

209
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:02,567
Now, it's your turn!
Are you a new student?

210
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,207
Huh? Me?

211
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:07,367
No, this is Mori
Kogoro-san, a detective.

212
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,787
Eh?! The famous detective?!

213
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,787
But what is he doing here?

214
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:13,577
Oh? You can't tell?

215
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:15,277
He's obviously here to investigate

216
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,957
Miyoshi Mako (20) Magician
He's obviously here to investigate

217
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,517
Motoyasu-sensei's death.
Miyoshi Mako (20) Magician

218
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:19,417
Motoyasu-sensei's death.

219
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,827
Isn't that right, Mr. Detective?

220
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:23,697
Y-Yes.

221
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:24,647
Little boy...

222
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,747
...and buxom girl.

223
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:29,797
B-Buxom?

224
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,847
White...

225
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,207
Did you see?

226
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:40,357
See what?

227
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,397
You should at least
use that many pigeons!

228
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:44,957
Right.

229
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,247
But, what is a detective doing here?
Wasn't his death a suicide?

230
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,987
Probably because he
wasn't the type to commit suicide.

231
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,287
Then, there are those
strange cards. Or so I'd surmise.

232
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:57,167
Cards?

233
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,747
Yes, these.

234
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:03,787
These strange cards were on the
desk in the basement where he died.

235
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:10,497
Oh, the Ace of Spades and
the Jack that were stuck together.

236
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:15,497
But, isn't this just a prop?
Plus, the police said it was a suicide.

237
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:19,807
Yes, yes. There's nothing to find now,
even if you scoured the house.

238
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,557
Wait! What are you doing?!

239
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,497
All that's left...

240
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,367
...is the fact there is now

241
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,247
Sanada Kazumi (27) Magician
...is the fact there is now

242
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,067
only one genius here instead of two.
Sanada Kazumi (27) Magician

243
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,537
Why, you! You ripped up
important evidence!

244
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:37,997
It's all right. The real one
is in your jacket pocket.

245
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:43,037
Wait a minute. Aren't you...

246
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:47,367
It's him! The genius magician
who dressed up as the Kaito Kid

247
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:52,047
on that ship during the 60th
anniversary party of the Suzuki zaibatsu!

248
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:53,787
Oh, him!

249
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,917
Sanada Kazumi, at your service.

250
00:14:55,917 --> 00:15:02,997
It'd be wise to leave soon,
unless you want to tarnish your reputation.

251
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:07,117
Seems pretty indifferent to
the fact his magic instructor just died...

252
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:09,067
I wouldn't be so sure.

253
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:14,117
See? He used cards
with different patterns just now.

254
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:17,577
He'd never normally
do this. He's a perfectionist...

255
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:23,117
I guess Sanada-san's
taken this pretty hard...

256
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:26,587
Yes. He looked up to my
husband almost as a father.

257
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,787
These are the three pupils, huh...

258
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,707
Huh? Conan-kun?

259
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,667
Tsukumo Motoyasu's daughter
Aren't you in Class A?

260
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,007
What are you doing here? Are you here to visit?
Tsukumo Motoyasu's daughter

261
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,327
What are you doing here? Are you here to visit?

262
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,207
No, we have some business here.

263
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:39,097
What kind of business?

264
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,597
Oh. So this is her house.

265
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:49,607
I'm the one who has business
here. He just came along, miss.

266
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,667
Oh, in that case, want
to go shopping with me?

267
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,577
Eh?

268
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,617
Mommy and I are just
about to go buy an outfit

269
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,867
for my birthday party tomorrow!

270
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,957
You got my invitation too, right?

271
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,787
Yeah, so I did...

272
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,767
Come on! Let's go, Conan-kun!

273
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:06,537
W-Wait!

274
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:08,047
No!

275
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:13,177
Sorry! Conan-kun's busy right now!
Maybe some other time?

276
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:16,887
Come on.
Kids should play with kids.

277
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:23,307
Ayano. I'm sorry, but I can't
go shopping today, either.

278
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:26,287
But you promised,
Mommy! You're a liar!

279
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:32,247
Daddy is, too! My birthday
is tomorrow, but he's still overseas!

280
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:35,997
You're all a bunch of liars! I hate you!

281
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:44,957
Then, will you go with me?
I'll coordinate your outfit for you!

282
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:45,617
Okay!

283
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,127
I'm sorry to bother you, Mako-san.

284
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,667
Okay, everyone! Back to your cage!

285
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,587
Let's go!

286
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:59,117
You still haven't told her
her father is dead?

287
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:02,307
No. I told her he's
doing a show overseas...

288
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:06,557
Huh? This isn't my pigeon.
It's Mako-san's.

289
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:10,067
That's strange for her
to mistake her pigeons...

290
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:13,457
Her teacher's death
must be hard on her, too...

291
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:14,327
Sheesh!

292
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:19,617
And magicians are supposed to
be good at concealing themselves!

293
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:23,077
You're the only one who
doesn't seem any different!

294
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,787
I just recently became a pupil, so...

295
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,457
Well, I'm going to
get dinner ready now.

296
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,287
Oh, thank you.

297
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,457
Does he always make the meals?

298
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,497
Our custom is that the newest
pupil always makes the meals.

299
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,547
I see.

300
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:42,057
Now then, let us see the basement
room where your husband died.

301
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,417
So, what exactly is
this basement room?

302
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,757
It was my husband's special room.

303
00:17:55,757 --> 00:18:00,047
He would always hole up in
here and research new magic tricks.

304
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:03,077
His pupils seemed
to use it lately, too.

305
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:04,547
What are those photographs?

306
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,467
My husband's students.

307
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:10,787
Everyone, even those who set
out on their own or gave up...

308
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:14,717
Say, miss. Who's that guy
with the black hat?

309
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,467
Oh, that's Kinoshita-kun.

310
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:20,337
He was a genius among geniuses.

311
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:23,257
Unfortunately, he died in
his youth fourteen years ago,

312
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:25,477
in a training accident...

313
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,337
But why do you ask?

314
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:30,467
Well, it's the only
photo without dust on it.

315
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,477
I wondered if someone
had been taking care of it.

316
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:38,527
Oh, you're right. Was it my husband?
He was especially fond of him.

317
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:43,537
Oh, so this is where he
swallowed the poison and collapsed?

318
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,867
Yes. The room is still exactly as it was.

319
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:53,797
Those cards were in the pile of
cards on this desk. As was the glue.

320
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,757
This is an unusually thick wall.

321
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:08,337
Yes. He enjoyed classical music,
and always listened to it in here.

322
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:11,767
He had the room soundproofed
so he could play the music loud.

323
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:17,257
In short, nobody would be able to
hear shouts coming from this room?

324
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,277
Yes.

325
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:22,087
But the door can be easily
unlocked from the inside

326
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:25,237
even when locked from the outside.

327
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:30,217
He would've gone outside to get
help if he realized he was poisoned.

328
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:32,997
But, the fact that he stayed in the room...

329
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,257
Madam. Suicide is the
only possibility I can think of.

330
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,007
Oh...

331
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,507
I dunno...

332
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:42,217
See, look at the body mark.

333
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:45,717
His hands are by his side,
in a well-mannered way.

334
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,757
In tv and stuff, when
someone is poisoned,

335
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:52,257
don't they put their hands to
their throat or chest like this?

336
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,127
Come to think of it,
a policeman did say

337
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,777
the body seemed a bit odd
for someone who was poisoned.

338
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:02,967
When you found his body,
you're sure he hadn't been strangled?

339
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,007
Yes.

340
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:07,547
When all four of us found him,

341
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,337
we panicked and
hurried to call an ambulance,

342
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:12,497
but they said no one
had used rope on him at all.

343
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,257
Say, couldn't he have
been strangled with a thin thread?

344
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,917
You know, like what
they use in magic tricks.

345
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,507
Nonsense. Even if you couldn't
see it itself, it'd still leave a mark.

346
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:26,257
If there was such a mark,
the cops would've found it long ago!

347
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,097
Rings?

348
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:34,297
Say. When he died,
was he wearing these rings?

349
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:38,547
Yes. His best trick involved
using invisible strings on his rings

350
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:41,257
to make things seem alive.

351
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:44,867
He had probably been
practicing it that day.

352
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:48,757
But, he only had the rings on.
There weren't any strings.

353
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,867
Oh, then that's a relief.

354
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,047
Relief?

355
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:56,127
After all, if the strings
got tangled up behind him,

356
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,087
he wouldn't be able to move.

357
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:03,427
See? It's hard to get up if
you can't use your hands.

358
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,877
And using the
doorknob would be hard, too.

359
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:08,137
T-That's it!

360
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:12,417
Your husband had rings on both
hands tied with string or something!

361
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,377
His thumbs, most likely!

362
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:17,837
Evidence of this would
remain on the body, though!

363
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:20,007
But, by cutting that string
before the police arrived,

364
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:25,157
it would look like he had
ordinary ring marks on his fingers!

365
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:29,417
Your husband was poisoned
before you and the pupils left!

366
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:32,757
The string was cut by
someone when the body was found,

367
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:34,337
probably during all the commotion!

368
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,627
Then, you're saying my husband was--

369
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:40,377
That's right!
Your husband was murdered!

370
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:45,417
By one of the three
who found his body with you!

371
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,637
That can't be...

372
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,757
Then what do those cards mean?

373
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:52,377
You know, the Ace and Jack
that were lying over there.

374
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,967
Quiet! I'm trying to figure that out!

375
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,757
Plus, there was a phone in this room.

376
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:02,687
Even without thumbs, it shouldn't
be too hard to press the buttons.

377
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,087
Yeah, that's true...

378
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,857
Umm, speaking of the phone...

379
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:12,917
...when we found the body,
I rushed upstairs to call an ambulance

380
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:16,867
so I didn't notice it right away,
but this phone was buried in cards.

381
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,877
Buried?!

382
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:25,257
I get it! The killer hid the phone!
To keep the victim from using it!

383
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:29,637
But, wouldn't it still be easy
to find if you tried hard enough?

384
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:32,257
That's true.

385
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:35,267
This is the phone in question.

386
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:40,107
Hey, mister.
Let me see those cards.

387
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:45,567
See this symbol here?
It's the same shape as the cards!

388
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,317
The redial button...

389
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:51,337
That's it! These cards are a dying
message from your husband,

390
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,867
telling us to press the redial button!

391
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:57,577
If my guess is right, it should connect

392
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,797
to someone your husband
left a message with.

393
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,917
This number is not in use.

394
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:07,587
Huh?

395
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:12,417
The police found that number too,
but it was nonsense,

396
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,847
so we assumed it was
my daughter playing around.

397
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,347
What the...

398
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,847
What are these numbers?!

399
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,807
Hey, kid. What are you writing?

400
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,387
What's this? A code?

401
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:30,047
"One two six eight seven
one three two four eight nine..."

402
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:31,157
Don't get in the way!

403
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,027
Whose way?

404
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:44,247
Wait a minute!
Could these numbers mean...
