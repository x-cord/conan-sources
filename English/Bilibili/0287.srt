1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,324
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:03,324 --> 00:00:05,024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:06,524
The bright lights of Broadway,

4
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:08,024
Ran, mother and I work on a big case.

5
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:09,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:11,424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:13,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,011
After the case in Chinatown at Yokohama was solved,

9
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,811
Ran suddenly collapsed and in her delirium,

10
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,011
she recalls a case from the past.

11
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,011
The case was when Mom finagled us

12
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,611
into going with her to see a musical in New York.

13
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,511
Waiting for us in front of the theater was Sharon Vineyard.

14
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,511
A famous actress and also mother's very close friend.

15
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,211
She was going to give us the backstage tour

16
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,011
but as we walked through the wings before the show.

17
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,011
What's that on the ceiling?

18
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,711
Oh, that. They're stage costumes.

19
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,311
They have them suspended up there so it doesn't get in the way.

20
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,011
Look out!

21
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,111
Armor!

22
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,611
Ran!

23
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,811
Ran!

24
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:22,311
"Shinichi In New York (Part 2)"

25
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,511
Hang in there, Ran.

26
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,311
We're almost there.

27
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,911
We're almost at the hospital, Ran.

28
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,911
Ran!

29
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:51,911
Are you all right, Ran?

30
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,811
I knew it was me.

31
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:59,811
Somebody wants to kill me!

32
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,711
I don't think so.

33
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:04,511
The rope snapped because it was worn out.

34
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,311
All right, who did this? Who hung that thing up there?

35
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,811
Things could've been worse, though.

36
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,611
We were lucky that huge mirror over there didn't break.

37
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:18,711
You're right, that mirror's our guardian angel.

38
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:20,611
What are you girls talking about?

39
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,511
You don't owe that mirror or an angel any thanks.

40
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:25,711
You should thank her.

41
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:30,211
Thank you. I owe you my life!

42
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,211
It was nothing.

43
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:36,211
Hey, we should be getting ready by now.

44
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,911
We'll see you in our dressing room after the show then.

45
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,911
Okay.

46
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,711
I must've scrapped it.

47
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,111
Let's see, a bandage. Do I have a bandage?

48
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,411
Here.

49
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,711
I was right, there is no God, after all.

50
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,911
If there was, things wouldn't have turned out so unfairly.

51
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,211
Yukiko, I'm going home.

52
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,711
Weren't you going to watch the show?

53
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:07,311
Yes, I had intended to

54
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:10,011
but something important's come up.

55
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:14,311
Besides, I've heard it's going to storm tonight so I'm canceling.

56
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,511
This is great.

57
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,911
I knew you'd like it.

58
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:46,811
You don't see musicals of such grand scale in Japan.

59
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,611
But there seems to be one kid who doesn't feel the way we do.

60
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,511
Listen, you. We've come all this way,

61
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,511
the least you could do is pay attention to what's going on.

62
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,811
What's so great about this anyway?

63
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:03,511
They've just taken a Greek myth and fixed it up into a romantic comedy.

64
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:07,811
All right, then. What's the Greek myth it's based on?

65
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,811
The Golden Apple.

66
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:13,111
A long time ago, there were 3 goddesses.

67
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:15,611
Hera, Athena and Aphrodite.

68
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:18,211
They had been invited to a banquet

69
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,511
but there was another goddess named Eris who wasn't,

70
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:25,511
and filled with jealousy, she sent them a golden apple.

71
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,911
With a message reading "To the most beautiful goddess".

72
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,311
What? Isn't that just like...

73
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:37,211
Yeah, and the three goddesses

74
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:38,911
decided to let the prince of Troy

75
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:41,811
choose which one was the most beautiful.

76
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,011
And each vied for his vote by telling him

77
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,011
what they'd give him for choosing them,

78
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,711
that actor we just met,

79
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:53,811
playing the poor prince, he's the Prince of Troy.

80
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:58,811
The actress playing the rich man's wife is Zeus's wife,

81
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,811
Hera, the goddess of marriage who promised

82
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,711
to make him the most powerful man on Earth.

83
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,511
That headstrong looking Japanese actress

84
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,111
is Athena. The goddess of wisdom

85
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:12,611
who promised to make him victorious in battle.

86
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:17,311
That sexy actress is the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite

87
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,311
who promised to give him the most beautiful woman in the world,

88
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,511
and the gloomy-looking actress in the previous scene

89
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,611
is the one who was jealous of the three.

90
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,311
The one who sent them the golden apples,

91
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,811
Eris, the goddess of discord, even their names sound similar.

92
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,011
But in this play, money is power,

93
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,211
and work is the battle,

94
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:41,311
and romance is the beautiful woman,

95
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,211
and the golden apple has been transformed

96
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,011
into a necklace of jewels.

97
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,911
And then? So who did he choose?

98
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,711
Aphrodite, of course!

99
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:58,211
But that was what eventually caused the battle of Troy.

100
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:04,011
But that's a Greek myth, this musical is a little different,

101
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,611
you're going to be surprised

102
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,811
when you see who that sorry-looking poor prince really is.

103
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:14,911
Look! You poor souls.

104
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,011
My name is Michael.

105
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:21,311
Michael? Does he mean the angel, Michael?

106
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,311
He's got to be kidding.

107
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:26,911
You must heed my words.

108
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,211
What?

109
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,011
Heath.

110
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,611
It can't be...

111
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,711
You're right. He's probably playing...

112
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:30,411
No, he's not playing.

113
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,811
He's dead.

114
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:34,911
A gun?

115
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,211
Somebody shot him?

116
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,211
Yes, it looks that way.

117
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,711
I think it'd be best if we got away from here, too.

118
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,011
Mom, take care of Ran!

119
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,311
Shin!

120
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:52,811
Darn it.

121
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:54,811
I knew I'd be too late.

122
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,711
A bullet casing?

123
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:03,111
This is...

124
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,161
What in the world?

125
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:25,161
I never thought it'd be Heath who'd been shot.

126
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:28,361
Do you know him, Captain?

127
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,661
My wife's a big fan of his.

128
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,261
What happened?

129
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:36,061
The performers are waiting in their dressing rooms

130
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,561
but the audience all ran off.

131
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:41,661
He took a bullet in the chest,

132
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,661
it's embedded in the wings on his back.

133
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:49,161
The wings on his back? Oh, you mean this?

134
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,161
From the angle of the entry wound,

135
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:54,861
I'd say he was shot from above at a 40 degree angle.

136
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:58,461
40 degrees? That's pretty high up.

137
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,261
Of course it is!

138
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,361
The shooter was up there in the balcony seat.

139
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,361
And he used a laser sight.

140
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:10,161
Night Baroness.

141
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,261
Well, if it isn't Yukiko.

142
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:13,561
And why are you here?

143
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,961
I just happened to watch the show.

144
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:21,861
I never dreamed the musical would turn into a mystery, though.

145
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,961
He was shot during the climax where the angel appears,

146
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:29,861
the fireworks went off and smoke filled the stage.

147
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:34,661
The image of the angel in the mirror slides up and at the same time,

148
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,861
Heath, dressed as the angel rises up from behind.

149
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:41,961
It was meant to look surreal,

150
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,961
like he had actually flown out the mirror.

151
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:49,561
So what you're saying is the shooter shot him from the balcony

152
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,961
as he flew up from behind the mirror.

153
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:57,161
That's right. And then the shooter threw the gun onto the stage

154
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,661
to cause a panic,

155
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,161
that way, the shooter could get away in the chaos.

156
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,861
Are you sure about that?

157
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,361
About the shooter being in the balcony, I mean.

158
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,361
Of course I am.

159
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,961
Thanks to all the smoke on the stage.

160
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,561
I clearly saw a red beam

161
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:15,961
leading from the balcony to the stage.

162
00:12:15,961 --> 00:12:18,461
Besides, I think my son saw it, too.

163
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,561
Your son?

164
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:22,161
Yes, he's standing right beside you.

165
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:23,261
What?

166
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,961
He's the real thing?

167
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:33,161
Is this your son, Shinichi, the one you're always bragging about?

168
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,161
Yes, isn't he the splitting image of Yusaku?

169
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,761
And they're both so mischievous, too!

170
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,161
Captain, may I have a word?

171
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,661
What is it?

172
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,661
Shin, can't you behave yourself?

173
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,161
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:53,061
Yukiko, it seems you were right.

175
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,361
There was a suspicious person

176
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:00,261
who bought that seat a month ago in advance.

177
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,961
And it seems they couldn't distinguish whether it was a male or female,

178
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:05,861
Since the person wore a scarf and hat.

179
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:09,961
That's the shooter. No doubt about it.

180
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,661
But why that seat?

181
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:16,261
Is that a good seat? Is it expensive?

182
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,961
That seat's at an angle. It's not a very good seat,

183
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,161
that's why it's cheaper.

184
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,761
If someone came with their face hidden

185
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,961
and specifically requested that seat,

186
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,061
they'd leave a lasting impression.

187
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,061
That's exactly what the shooter would want.

188
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,261
I don't understand.

189
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:36,761
What are these two strange marks on the deceased's body?

190
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,661
Strange marks?

191
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:43,261
Yes, on his neck, don't they look like burn marks?

192
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,161
And there's blood on his right hand.

193
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:50,661
Maybe he got it when he grabbed his chest after he got shot.

194
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:56,761
No, what puzzles me is the blood on his palm is smeared.

195
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:58,361
It probably got smeared when he touched something

196
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:00,361
after getting the blood on his hand

197
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:03,161
but there's no blood on his clothes

198
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,361
and it wasn't possible for him to touch anything

199
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,661
while he was hanging in mid-air.

200
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:10,661
I don't think even you, Night Baroness can solve that riddle.

201
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,361
No, I can't, not yet.

202
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,261
Then, let's ask Yusaku.

203
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,761
I'm sure he'd know.

204
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:22,361
No, Yusaku's holed up in a hotel room in Los Angeles now.

205
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,161
That's too bad.

206
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,161
A famous actor's been murdered, what a mess.

207
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,961
The murderer got away

208
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,561
and on top of that, we don't have a single clue.

209
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,661
There's no telling what the people and the Chief will say,

210
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,961
not to mention my wife.

211
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,161
Excuse me.

212
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:42,061
Then, why don't you let Shinichi solve this?

213
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,161
Let Shin do it?

214
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,861
No way. Impossible.

215
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,561
He's still a child

216
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,561
and this is a real murder we're talking about.

217
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:55,561
But Shinichi solved the crime that happened in the airplane.

218
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,761
Sure, I'll bet that after the criminal was caught,

219
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:06,361
he whispered, "I knew it, it's just as I thought", didn't he?

220
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:10,861
No, he was involved in the investigation from the very start.

221
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,361
He was?

222
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:15,461
Yes, and in the end, he got all the suspects together

223
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:18,161
and smugly began to solve the crime,

224
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:20,761
he acted like he was Holmes or Poirot or something.

225
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,361
My Shin did that?

226
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:38,161
The murderer is one of those four actresses?

227
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,761
I don't believe it.

228
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,061
Right after the shooting,

229
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:48,461
I went up to the balcony seat and I found this bullet casing,

230
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:51,761
it wasn't hot, it proves someone Ieft it there beforehand.

231
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:54,161
But you saw it too, didn't you?

232
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,761
There was a red beam from that balcony seat to the stage.

233
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,261
Yes, that's what it looked like,

234
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,761
but there's no way we could tell

235
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:08,061
where that beam came from and where it was directed.

236
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:09,761
That's right.

237
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:15,061
That beam probably came from the stage. Not from the balcony.

238
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:20,061
It was to make us think it was coming from up there.

239
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,261
What I'm trying to say is,

240
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,761
the person who hid their face to reserve that seat

241
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:26,761
and the strange package that arrived

242
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:30,461
was all a ruse to make us think

243
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,561
someone was after the actresses.

244
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,461
Really?

245
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,161
I see.

246
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:40,161
And of course, this is part of it too.

247
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:46,361
This is where that suit of armor fell just before the show started.

248
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,561
Look at the floor.

249
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:52,361
There's thin fishing line tied to the nail,

250
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,361
and there are markings on the floor beside it,

251
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,961
it looks like something was cut.

252
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:01,061
And there's a fishing line on the suit of armor that fell, too.

253
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,661
Are you saying somebody did this deliberately?

254
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:06,461
That's right, the culprit probably had a blade

255
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:09,061
or some kind attached to their shoe and used it to cut the line

256
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,761
causing the armor to fall.

257
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,061
The culprit knew that Sharon's friends,

258
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:17,261
that's us, would pass through here

259
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:20,161
during our backstage tour.

260
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,561
Which means, the culprit

261
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,261
is someone who was here to drop the armor,

262
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:29,261
and was also one of the performers on stage with Heath,

263
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,861
that way she could aim the beam at the balcony

264
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,461
then shoot him.

265
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:39,161
Anyone of those four actresses could have done it.

266
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,661
But he's 6'3 tall.

267
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:47,461
All of them are under 6'.

268
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,161
How could anyone of them shoot him from overhead

269
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:51,861
when he is taller than them

270
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:53,861
and on top of that, he was behind the mirror.

271
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,961
Yes, he's right. Explain that, Shin!

272
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,661
I haven't figured that out yet.

273
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,661
I see.

274
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:16,561
Lila, where you telling me the truth just now?

275
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:21,261
Yes, Heath and I were seeing each other,

276
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:23,361
we had been for about 5 years.

277
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:27,261
Then you knew he was also going out with me, too.

278
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:29,461
Will you two calm down?

279
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,861
Must you talk about that today of all days?

280
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,861
Hey, now.

281
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,161
I'd think you'd be the most upset about this.

282
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,561
Your boyfriend has 2 other girlfriends.

283
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,561
You mean you too, Rose?

284
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,661
Were you dating him, too?

285
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,161
I see.

286
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,261
Those four do seem to have a motive for killing Heath.

287
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,361
Why?

288
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:58,961
I know he was dating the three of them,

289
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:02,561
but Everess doesn't seem to be involved with him.

290
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,161
Unlike the others,

291
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:07,861
she doesn't have a photo of him on her mirror.

292
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:12,861
The truth is Everess and Heath are married.

293
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,661
What?

294
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:17,261
Sharon told me secretly

295
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:20,361
when we were being given the backstage tour.

296
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:21,861
She said it was a secret

297
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:25,061
because his popularity would drop if it became public.

298
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,561
So that's why she hated him

299
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:30,061
because he was dating the other three?

300
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,861
But what we have to figure out is,

301
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:36,561
how he was shot from above?

302
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:40,961
Rose was the closest to the mirror,

303
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,161
but, she was on the ground, acting the part of a startled woman.

304
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:47,861
Everess was staggering.

305
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:51,261
Akane was on her knees praying.

306
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:53,461
The only one able to shoot him from above

307
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,561
was Lila who was standing and clutching her head,

308
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,061
but unlike the others who were hidden by the smoke,

309
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:02,961
Lila's hands were in plain view,

310
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:06,861
everyone would have seen her take a gun out.

311
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:09,961
Do you think it's possible Heath bent down?

312
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:14,561
I doubt it, those wings were foot operated

313
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,361
and rigged so he couldn't bend down.

314
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,461
Hey, Shinichi.

315
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:24,161
Have you come up with something?

316
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,461
Hey, Shinichi. Wait a minute.

317
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,861
You've figured it out, haven't you?

318
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,361
Don't keep me in suspense, tell me about it.

319
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:46,761
Hey, Ran. How tall you are?

320
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,761
160 centimeters.

321
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,861
That'd be 5'3.

322
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:55,361
This pamphlet is about 12 inches,

323
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,061
so that's one feet.

324
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,761
I hate to ask but can you put this on your head

325
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,061
and stand in front of the mirror?

326
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,461
What?

327
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:08,461
What's this supposed to prove, Shinichi?

328
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,861
What are you going to do?

329
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:20,361
Clues...

330
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,161
I'm looking for a clue.

331
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:23,161
A clue?

332
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:25,761
See, up over there.

333
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,661
There's a small crack.

334
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:31,761
That's strange. This mirror's been with the troupe for years,

335
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:33,261
it's their guardian spirit.

336
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:35,161
Sharon told me they took good care of it

337
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,361
because they thought it'd be bad Iuck if it got cracked.

338
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,061
Hey, what's this?

339
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:42,361
It looks like it's been patched!

340
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:45,361
Are you sure they took good care of this?

341
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:51,261
Don't you think this curtain's a little crooked?

342
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,561
Somebody might've bumped into it when they were trying to get to safety.

343
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:57,861
Hey, Shinichi, let's go back already.

344
00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:00,361
We're going to get scolded.

345
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,461
A feather?

346
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,461
How'd it get stuck here?

347
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,561
This cover of the floor isn't used for anything.

348
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,061
Blood.

349
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:22,961
I get it now.

350
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,461
The killer used that certain stage prop to commit the crime.

351
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:31,361
This bloody crime

352
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:35,261
was committed by someone like that sneaky goddess Eris.

353
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:09,161
"Next Episode" -From this position,

354
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,061
it doesn't look like

355
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,661
any of you four could have shot him from above.

356
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,861
Who turned the lights off?

357
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:21,261
The killer used that thing.

358
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,561
Are you saying the killer...

359
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,961
That's right.

360
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,561
There was only one person who could have done it.

361
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:31,561
Next Conan,

362
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:35,761
"Shinichi In New York (Part 3)"

363
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,446
Next Conan's Hint:

364
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,546
"Trap Door"

365
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,746
Ran, the next hint really burns me up.

366
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:45,346
I knew it, you've got animal instinct.
