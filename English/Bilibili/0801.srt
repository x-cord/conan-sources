00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,340
We accompanied Pops to Tottori Prefecture.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,740
We're finally here!

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,240
Yes!

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,140
But, why Tottori?

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,940
Why?

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,340
Well, it's because...

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,340
"Tottori Sand Dunes"

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,940
I'm going to dispose of you in the sand dune!

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,440
Conan!

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,740
The first Super Mystery Awards!

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,540
I decided to apply for this!

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,740
A suspense that describes

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,540
how a brat that is tied up and left behind all alone

15
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,040
at this sand dune makes it out safely!

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm here to come up with how he does it.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,040
I don't know why you suddenly came up

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,640
with the idea of wanting to write a novel.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,140
But I think that setting is not quite possible.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,240
Not possible?

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,340
Yes!

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,040
But it's for sure that someone would come to the rescue right away.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,940
-Right? -What?

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,440
This place is forever filled with tourists.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,440
This is going to be changed to an ordinary sightseeing trip as of now.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,140
First of all, let's go to the Sand Art Museum that's right over there!

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,140

Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,240
Love and cases come from the same origin.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
Like the sands of the Tottori Sand Dunes.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
The mystery of the robbery can't quite be grasped.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,440

Hey!

38
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,387
What's this?

39
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,987
It's nothing more than a clump of sand!

40
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:55,587
What a rip off taking money to see something like this!

41
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:58,187
Rip off...

42
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:01,287
This is a piece of art, you see.

43
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:04,987
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

44
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:08,087
It's late. That clock.

45
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,287
It shouldn't be.

46
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,487
1 hour...

00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,787
05 min.

00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,587
This clock is accurate, yes?

What's with her?

53
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,387
She looked like she was doing it on purpose.

54
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:29,487
Maybe she's just super stressed out.

55
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:37,887
Rip off, she says...

56
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:40,387
They sure can make unthinkable things by sand.

57
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:42,987
After they exhibit it for a year,

58
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:45,587
I hear they destroy it and make something new.

59
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:47,387
What a waste.

60
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,687
Maybe the transience is what's so attractive about it.

61
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:53,387
I'm so moved, that I'm getting hungry.

62
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,687
What?

63
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,787
Since we're in Tottori, that's known for its pears and shallots.

64
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:00,087
But nothing can beat...

65

68
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:08,287

00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,287
-I'll eat my heart out! -Yes!

70
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,387
But it's...

71
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,387
You get to see crabs, but don't get to eat them?

72
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:21,287
Seems so.

73
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,287
Shall we go to the place called Kurayoshi next?

74
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,787

Thanks for waiting!

77
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,687
I had them keep our luggage for us.

78
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,587
They say that there's a place up ahead where the storehouses

79
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,087
that were made during the Edo and Meiji periods are.

80
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,687
It's a historical town, don't you think?

Mr. Mouri?

83
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:09,087
We worked together during a joint investigation in the past.

84
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,487
It's when you were at MPD, right, Dad?

85
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:16,387
Thank you so much for everything back then.

86
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,687
-The famed detective. -Yes.

87
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,787
He's always talking about you.

88
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,787
What's up?

89
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,187
-Okamoto. -Yes, sir.

90
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,087
We got a report that there was a robbery.

91
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,587
What?

92
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:36,387
No answer.

93
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,787
May I look in, too?

94
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:40,887
Yes, sir.

95
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,987
Help me.

96
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,587
What happened?

97
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,087
I'm Yamane from the Kurayoshi Police Department.

98
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,187
Are you the one who called us?

99
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:15,987
I'm Shuko Kumado.

100
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:17,387
I'm the wife of the oldest son here.

101
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,487
And, the perp?

102
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:21,987
I was passed out, so...

103
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,287
He got away during that time.

104
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,087
Thank you for saving me.

105
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:29,587
The incense burner is gone?

106
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:31,587
The precious household treasure that was here!

107
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,587
So, that was stolen?

108
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,487
I... I've done something irreparable.

109
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,387
Please don't cry and give us the details.

110
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:47,687
There's something on the floor here.

111
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:48,987
What?

112
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:56,987
You idiot!

113
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:59,687
You mean you can't even watch the house, right?

114
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,887
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,987
Mr. Kumado.

116
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,687
He is the head of the household, Mr. Iwao Kumado.

117
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,287
This is the famed detective.

118
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,387
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

119
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:17,787
I happened to be nearby with my daughter and the boy, so...

120
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:23,787
Do I have to introduce my family to you, too?

121
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,787
She's my oldest daughter, Makie.

122
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:27,587
"Makie Kumado (35)" -She's divorced and lives here now.

123
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,987
You didn't need to say that.

124
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,887
He's my oldest son, Soichi.

125
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,087
He's helping me with my business,

126
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,187
"Soichi Kumado (32)" -but can't be relied on at all.

127
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:38,187
Father.

128
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,987
He's my second son, Junji.

129
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,987
He's a good-for-nothing that's just loafing around.

130
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,887
"Junji Kumado (28), second son"

131
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:45,887
I guess I can't retort.

132
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:49,987
And Shuko, Soichi's wife and Kazuma,

133
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,087
makes all six of you living here together.

134
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,887
Never mind that. Didn't you lock the house?

135
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,587
I did, but still...

136
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,087
At around 1:00 after putting Kazuma to sleep,

137
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,187
I came back to this living room and was suddenly...

138
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:13,987
Kazuma!

139
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:19,387
When I came to, I was tied up.

140
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,987
And I called the police on my cell phone.

141
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,887
So? When you realized it, it was already stolen?

142
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,987
Yes.

143
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:32,587
It seems that the incense burner was the only thing that was stolen.

144
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:36,387
The perp was only after that incense burner to begin with.

145
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:38,987
That's what's so strange.

146
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:42,687
It was placed where anybody could see it, right?

147
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,487
All that needed to be done was to make off with it right away,

148
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:48,987
so there was no need to tie Shuko up, was there?

149
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:52,987
And yet, I wonder why the perp went out of the way to tie you up?

150
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:56,187
I have no idea.

151
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:58,887
How are we supposed to know why the perp did what he did?

152
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,787
Brat, keep out of this!

153
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,087
Talk about a scary gramps...

154
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:07,587
Any idea on who the perp might be?

155
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,787
According to forensics, there are no traces of

156
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,987
the door in the front or back being forced opened.

157
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,687
Maybe the perp broke in using a spare key.

158
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:17,987
Spare key?

159
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:21,087
The perp was someone who was able to get that ready.

160
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,587
And this was found by the sofa.

161
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,987
It wasn't there when Shuko cleaned the room this morning,

162
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:29,987
so it could've been left behind by the perp.

163
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:32,687
I was a bit concerned.

164
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:37,787
Father, wasn't Naomi wearing a similar looking pendant yesterday?

165
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,187
Naomi was?

166
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:41,787
She was. I think it was yesterday.

167
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,387
Now that you mentioned it...

168
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,087
I remember, too.

169
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,587
Who is she, this person called Naomi?

170
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,287
Naomi Senda.

171
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,987
She was working as our housekeeper two years ago.

172
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,987
She suddenly came here from Tokyo yesterday

173
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,487
to ask if she could borrow money.

174
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,887
But Dad refused.

175
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:03,287
Why should I lend her money?

176
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,387
That ungrateful swine stole money from this house

177
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:06,787
when she quit and took off.

178
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,887
She stole money from you and split?

179
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,187
I didn't file a report because I thought it was a shame.

180
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:13,587
You mean she stole the household treasure

181
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,987
because you didn't let her borrow money.

182
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:19,387
That wench would do something like that!

183
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,287
If she used to work here as a housekeeper before...

184
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,287
She could've made a spare key while she was working here.

185
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,487
And where is she, this person called Naomi Senda?

186
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,787
I have her cell phone number.

187
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,337
What?

188
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:50,337
"Naomi Senda (30), former housekeeper" -This is Ms. Naomi Senda?

189
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:51,937
This is...

190
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,737
You lewd mustache jerk!

191
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:56,937
You were attacked by the robber at around 1:00?

192
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:58,937
No mistake about it.

193
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,937
Then, she's innocent

194
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:04,337
because just around that time we ran into her at the sand dune.

195
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,937
So, like I said, I know nothing about it.

196
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:09,137
But this...

197
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,337
I dropped it when I came here yesterday.

198
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:13,737
But when I cleaned the house this morning, it wasn't there.

199
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,737
How dare you lie like that?

200
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,737
-I tell you, stop lying! -Stop it!

201
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,237
Cut it out!

202
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:22,037
-Let go, I said! Get away from her! -Stop it!

203
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:24,637
Are you all right?

204
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:26,437
I'm not lying.

205
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:32,137
Yes?

206
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:33,437
A delivery?

207
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,537
I'll be right out.

208
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,437
No, I'll go.

209
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:48,137
Soichi, it's for you.

210
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:52,037
You never did like me.

211
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,937
That's why you're trying to frame me.

212
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,137
I would never.

213
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:59,037
Thanks all for ganging up and suspecting me!

214
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:00,837
I'll pay you back for all of this,

215
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:03,737
so just you wait and see.

216
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:13,037
I... I'm going to be killed by her.

217
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,237
What?

218
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:15,837
Don't exaggerate.

219
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,337
It's all because your remarks are so irresponsible to begin with!

220
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,537
This is where the real game starts.

221
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,937
About that person called Naomi Senda...

222
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:39,437
She's a violent wench, but she has an alibi

223
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,037
so has nothing to do with the crime!

224
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:43,437
Then, what about her pendant that was found on the floor?

225
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,137
That...

226
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,937
Quit asking for instructions on petty details!

227
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,437
What do you think you're getting paid for?

228
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,337
I got mail.

229
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,237
"From: Masked Pickled Shallot" -What, "Masked Shallot"?

230
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,537
It's from the perp!

231
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,037
"If you want the household treasure incense burner back,

232
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:11,637
get 10 million yen ready. I'll contact you tomorrow."

233
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,737
I thought you said that the incense burner was valued at 1 million yen.

234
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,637
That's also not the whole truth.

235
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:19,737
It's only worth at most 100,000 yen.

236
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,437
But it's been the token of the head of the household

237
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:23,837
of the Kumado family for generations.

238
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:26,337
It's invaluable!

239
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:29,037
Get 10 million yen ready by first thing tomorrow morning.

240
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,037
Yes, sir!

241
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,637
I see.

242
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,837
Will you all tell me what you were doing

243
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:38,537
and where you were around the time the crime took place?

244
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:41,637
What? Are you suspecting the people of this family?

245
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,137
Although the cash value of it is not much,

246
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,437
a great sum of money can be blackmailed.

247
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:47,237
The only ones who know of something like this

248
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:49,437
are the ones on the inside, correct?

249
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:53,537
And what's stranger is that unexplainable pendant.

250
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,937
The perp had kept the pendant

251
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,237
that Ms. Naomi Senda had dropped the other day.

252
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,837
And today, the perp snuck into the house,

253
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:04,337
robbed it and dropped the pendant

254
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,937
to make it look as if Ms. Naomi Senda committed the crime!

255
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,237
You would do it. Sis, wouldn't you?

256
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,937
Talk for yourself. I'll bet you needed money to loaf around!

257
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,037
If you're referring to money, you can't use freely,

258
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:17,237
the same goes for both of you, no?

259
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:20,637
Even so, why would I do something like that?

260
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:23,137
All three of you are starved for money.

261
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,637
Cut it out!

262
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,237
What privilege does a detective have

263
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,037
to butt his nose into our business to begin with?

264
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:31,237
I just want to help in solving the case.

265
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,737
But is it inconvenient for you?

266
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:37,437
Don't tell me that you suspect me, too?

267
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,337
Your circumstances are no different from these three, you see.

268
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:44,037
You're to blame for all this because you're such an idiot!

269
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:46,737
Thanks to you, I have to go through the trouble of being suspected!

270
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,837
What a jinx you brought home.

271
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:51,337
What a thing to say.

272
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,237
Shuko's a victim, you know.

273
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,037
So what!

274
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,737
Nothing.

275
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:00,237
I'll go prepare some tea.

276
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,937
Your role as a bride ended

277
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:06,637
since you given birth to Kazuma, heir to this family.

278
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,237
It must be rough.

279
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,937
Feeling like you don't belong here.

280
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:19,037
But I can't leave

281
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:22,937
because Father has his mind set on making Kazuma his heir.

282
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,737
I know he'd never let Kazuma go, no matter what.

283
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,337
If the alternative is to be torn away from Kazuma,

284
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:33,637
I've no choice but to stay here with the Kumado family.

285
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,537
Maybe, but...

286
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:39,237
Everyone has their own reasons.

287
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,137
And what a detective can do is

288
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:44,137
to find the robber, solve the case

289
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:48,037
and give Shuko some relief from being blamed.

290
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,237
Mr. Mouri...

291
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:53,237
Right.

292
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,337
"Daigakuin" -Then, the head of the household

293
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:03,337
came here to Daigakuin just around noon yesterday.

294
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:06,237
This is the grave of Tadayoshi Satomi, etc.

295
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:08,937
Who "The Eight Dog Chronicles" was modeled after.

296
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:13,837
He offers his services to the annual festivals associated with this

297
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:16,437
and came to chat over tea.

298
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:19,637
He was here for about 30 minutes.

299
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,737
Till about 12:30...

300
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:23,137
After that?

301
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:26,237
He mentioned looking in on the Akagawara Building 10.

302
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:27,337
"Akagwara building 10"

303
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,537
He came around 1:30?

304
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:32,237
Yes, I think so.

305
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:34,337
He came to offer advice on our merchandise.

306
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:37,237
He's passionate about revitalizing local business, you see.

307
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:41,537
His crucial alibi for the time around 1:00 is missing.

308
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:44,537
And his residence is just a stone's throw away.

309
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,037
"Special Express Yakumo"

310
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:49,037
"Yonago Station"

311
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:50,637
"Tottori Prefectural Flower Park"

312
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,437
She's an acquaintance of my older sister.

313
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,037
Ms. Makie Kumado.

314
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,937
That's why you know what she looks like.

315
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,337
She entered the park around 11:00

316
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:02,537
and left at around 3:00.

317
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:04,937
Which means, just as she was saying at around 1:00,

318
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,437
she was somewhere inside this Flower Park.

319
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:12,137
If she was really there, all the way from 11:00 to 3:00.

320
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,037
True.

321
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:15,637
"Kaike Hot Springs" -It was true too,

322
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,337
that the second son Junji was also here

323
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:20,037
from the night before spending the night over at Kaike Hot Springs.

324
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:23,137
The point is where he was yesterday morning

325
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,237
after he checked out of the inn.

326
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,937
"Yonago City Tourist Center" -He said that he stuck around here,

327
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:29,237
and also have people who can prove that too, but...

328
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:32,937
It's this guy from yesterday.

329
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:35,337
No doubt about it, it's this guy.

330
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,437
Watch out!

331
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:42,337
But that was about 3:00.

332
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,237
So, it's the same as Makie.

333
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,237
"Misasa Hot Spring" -So, their alibis...

334
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:48,037
are missing a chunk in the middle.

335
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:52,537
Yeah. Neither of them have alibis for around 1:00,

336
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:54,237
but I don't think they could've gone home once

337
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:58,037
and return to where they were before.

338
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,137
It takes 30 minutes on the Limited Express from Yonago

339
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,337
where Kaike Hot Springs and the Flower Park are to Kurayoshi.

340
00:19:04,337 --> 00:19:07,137
Which means all three aren't completely cleared yet.

341
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:09,137
You mean the head of the household, too?

342
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:11,037
Since he's locally an influential figure,

343
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:13,137
he's been visiting around here and there,

344
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,037
but all those places are near his residence.

345
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,937
If he wanted to, he could've.

346
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:21,637
The only one remaining is Shuko's husband, Soichi.

347
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:24,337
"Jinjo no Yakjata" -Isn't that the place he was talking about?

348
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,437
Yes, Soichi dropped by

349
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:30,137
saying he happened to be nearby around 1:00 yesterday.

350
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,637
He has a definite alibi.

351
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:37,337
It'd be too painful if her husband were the robber.

352
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:40,837
Come off it, you've got yourself all mixed up.

353
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,437
Yesterday at around 1:00,

354
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:46,437
you were eating Ra-don Noodles with me, weren't you, Tanaka?

355
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,937
Well, you see Soichi asked me to do him a favor this morning.

356
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:54,237
I'm being suspected of something by a detective.

357
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:57,137
But I don't have an alibi.

358
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:59,637
So, please help me, Tanaka. Please!

359
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,937
Why aren't they contacting us?

360
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:12,537
I'm sure the perp can't make a move.

361
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:14,237
Since the police are on their guard waiting

362
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:16,737
to arrest the perp during the exchange,

363
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,337
and moreover, even a detective's come to help out.

364
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:22,637
You insist that the perp is among one of us, then.

365
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,137
More so, since a person who had asked someone

366
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:26,737
to make a false statement for him is here.

367
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:30,437
Can't you recall anything about the perp?

368
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,437
He's back.

369
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:34,837
What're you talking about?

370
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,837
Nothing.

371
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,737
Dr. Yasunobu Kotani who died of

372
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,337
an accident in South Africa earlier this month,

373
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:45,537
have returned to Japan today.

374
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:50,537
Dr. Kotani is from the Tottori Prefecture.

375
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:54,237
That doctor who has been performing medical activities abroad.

376
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:56,537
He was from Tottori?

377
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,637
Do you know him, Shuko?

378
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,937
What?

379
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:02,937
We used to be classmates in intermediate school.

380
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:06,037
Who cares, at a time like this!

381
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:10,137
Kumado here.

382
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,837
Thanks for having me yesterday. This is Naomi.

383
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:14,837
May I speak to Shuko, please?

384
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:18,437
This is Shuko.

385
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:21,337
When you try to frame people, I'll show you what it's like.

386
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,837
You'll see hell.

387
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:30,537
Why's she doing this?

388
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,837
If you want, I could serve as your bodyguard.

389
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,237
What?

390
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,037
No, I think she's just harassing me.

391
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,137
Well, if you say it's unnecessary.

392
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:44,137
I wonder if she really has nothing to do with the case?

393
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,737
But she has an alibi.

394
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:49,437
Didn't her alibi sound sort of unnatural?

395
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:53,137
Heck. I wasted my time and money.

396
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,837
It's late. That clock.

397
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:58,137
Now that you mentioned it...

398
00:21:58,137 --> 00:21:59,737
It's just a coincidence.

399
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,737
When I got up this morning, I found this at the front door.

400
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:13,037
It's been returned.

401
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,937
What's going on?

402
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:16,837
Why did the perp return the incense burner

403
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,937
without even taking the money?

404
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:31,437
This case is probably not a mere robbery case!

405
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:55,837
"Next Episode" -Therefore, the perp is among you.

406
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:58,637
Well, since this was returned,

407
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,237
who cares at this point, who the perp is.

408
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:05,137
I wonder why the perp returned the incense burner?

409
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:08,037
Wait a sec. This robbery case...

410
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:09,937
Don't tell me...

411
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:12,137
What? She went to see Naomi Senda?

412
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:13,337
Oh, no!

413
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:17,537
Next Conan,

414
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:21,737
"Tottori Sand Dunes Mystery Tour (Tottori Edition)"

415
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,680
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,580
"Pendant"

417
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,380
How was the camel ride?

418
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,380
It was easy-camel-easy-go.

419
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,480
Hey! Doc!
