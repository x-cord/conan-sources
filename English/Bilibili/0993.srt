00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,490
Everyone, Happy New Year!

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,620
Thank you for all your support last year.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,750
Thanks to you, Case Closed
has been airing for 25 years.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,750
And the 1000th episode will be airing soon.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,120
We'll work together again this year
to produce an entertaining product.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,010
So we appreciate your continued support.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,860
Osu!

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,740
What's that?

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,850
From heaven, earth, and man,

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,280
the silent voices call.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,250
Kamen Yaiba!

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,630
Born in Japan.

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,420
Are you the ones who called me?

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,630
No matter the time or place, I,
Yaiba, shall defend justice...

15
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,220
Amazing the world!!
Azengers
Superhero Team

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,010
Azengers
Amazing the world!!

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,570
Amazing the world!!

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,140
That was great.
Amazing the world!!

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,770
Superhero Team Azengers
was as good as they say.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,090
Yeah,

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,020
although I was a little dumbfounded by
Kamen Yaiba's reason for joining them.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,400
You're right.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,900
After all, it was, "We want to
increase our Japanese audience."

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,530
It was so blunt, I laughed out loud.

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,550
If that movie were real, I bet
they'd recruit Makoto-san first.

26
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,170
Th-Thank you.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,740
I think Ran-kun and I
would be pretty good, too.

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,300
You think so?

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,050
When you think about it,
it really is a waste.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,800
What?

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,310
After all, you're Kanto's
strongest karate practitioner.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,560
A tomboy equally skilled in jeet kune do.

33
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,560
And a young martial artist with
a 400-0 undefeated record.

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,330
But you're just watching movies
and strolling around town.

35
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,820
What's wrong with that? It's peaceful.

36
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,150
This isn't a manga.

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,540
You can't expect incidents to
occur at your own convenience.

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,040
What?

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,610
Stay back!

40
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,910
I'll blow her brains out!

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,220
No!

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,500
I expect you to fulfill the
three demands I'm about to list.

43
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,600
First, I want a car.

44
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
Bring me a car so I can get out of—

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,380
What?

46
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,020
Are you all right?

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,600
Cut!

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,570
What?

49
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,360
Makoto-san!

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,400
Huh?

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,610
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

52
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,990
What?

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,820
Find the question that solves the mystery!

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,750
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

55
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,970
Kyogoku-san makes his acting debut?

56
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,310
Solving mysteries at a
filming location with Sera!

57
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,960
Always determining the one truth

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,870
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

59
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,220
his name is Detective Conan!

60
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,530
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part One)

61
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,720
"Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy, Part One!"
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part One)

62
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,930
Kyogoku Makoto the Understudy
(Part One)

63
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,310
I-I'm sorry.

64
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,130
I thought a woman was in danger.

65
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,510
Oh, Makoto-san.

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,320
Well, we were just watching
that kind of movie.

67
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,250
It's no use. He's unconscious.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,630
It's your fault for not
keeping an eye on the crowd.

69
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,040
Sorry.

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,200
I didn't think anyone would come running
from the other side of the street.

71
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:26,630
Tomioka Shigematsu (50)
Director

72
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,570
Give me a break.
Tomioka Shigematsu (50)
Director

73
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:29,830
He still has scenes left to shoot.
Tomioka Shigematsu (50)
Director

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,210
He still has scenes left to shoot.

75
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,330
Is there anyone who can take his place?

76
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,710
Since the role involves
wearing a full face helmet,

77
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,210
anyone can do it.

78
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,600
We can dub his lines in later.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,010
But finding an actor who can do action
scenes on such short notice will be difficult.

80
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,430
Odori Daisaku (48)
Assistant Director
But finding an actor who can do action
scenes on such short notice will be difficult.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,340
But finding an actor who can do action
scenes on such short notice will be difficult.

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,640
Now that I get a better look
at you, you're pretty fit.

83
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,360
Was that something special
that you did earlier?

84
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,890
Well, I know a bit of karate.

85
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, really? Really? You don't say.

86
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's do a camera rehearsal.

87
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,750
Ready, action.

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,950
Makoto-san, you're amazing!

89
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,180
Nice. Nice.

90
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,560
Huh.

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,600
He's the understudy?

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,480
He moves pretty well.

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,340
Tokuzono Saiya (34)
Actor
He moves pretty well.

94
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,900
I wish he'd do my stunts for me.
Tokuzono Saiya (34)
Actor

95
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,940
I wish he'd do my stunts for me.

96
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,470
You used to be able to
move like that, Nanako.

97
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,660
You mean when I just started.

98
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,070
I can't do that anymore.

99
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,980
Jinmei Nanako (29)
Actress
I can't do that anymore.

100
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,530
Plus, I'd hate to break a nail.
Jinmei Nanako (29)
Actress

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:46,910
Plus, I'd hate to break a nail.

102
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,400
I see.

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
I guess you're no longer a youngster.

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,250
You're a mid-level actress now.

105
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,190
Don't make me sound so old.

106
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,010
I'm still in my 20s.

107
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,530
Excuse me.

108
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,260
Anyway, I was hoping I could get
this famous actress' autograph.

109
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,500
My nephew is a fan.

110
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,170
What?

111
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,890
Sure, fine.

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,420
I can do that.

113
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,220
What's his name?

114
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,220
Ow!

115
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,020
What is this?!

116
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,440
A practical joke.

117
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,580
It produces an electrical current
when you press the button.

118
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,570
How stupid.

119
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,660
I bet you're the one who planted that whoopee
cushion on my chair in the makeup room.

120
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,570
Yeah.

121
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,950
It's what you get for leaving
those things lying around.

122
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,080
What things?

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Excuse me.

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,360
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,090
He might be talking about
your false eyelashes.
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

126
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,290
Aburai Hideka (26)
Makeup Artist

127
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,090
When two of them get stuck together,
they look like a centipede.

128
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,620
So you just mistook them for something else.

129
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,730
I'm asking you to be careful.

130
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,850
You know I don't like it.

131
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,770
Isn't it kind of pathetic for
you to be scared of bugs?

132
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,230
You're supposed to be a man.

133
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,120
Now that's inappropriate.

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,040
It's like you don't even realize
you're a famous actress.

135
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,930
He's infuriating!

136
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,470
Anyway, he sure is great.

137
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,700
He was quick to learn the fight scenes, too.

138
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
Yeah.

139
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,920
This only happened because
he jumped to conclusions.

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,550
Have we actually unearthed an
unbelievable diamond in the rough?

141
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,120
But he's just a meathead.

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,300
An actor's all about the face.

143
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,640
What?

144
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,410
Wait, what?

145
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,980
He's super handsome.

146
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,710
Maybe I'll scout him to play
a new police detective.

147
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,900
It's about time your character
died in the line of duty.

148
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,490
You can't be serious.

149
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,570
But even we could handle
those fight scenes, right?

150
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,740
Yeah.

151
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,040
What? You girls can do action scenes, too?

152
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,350
I guess.

153
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,170
Better than the average person.

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,670
Th-They're so cute!

155
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,180
In that case, maybe I'll have one
of you do Jinmei-chan's stunts.

156
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,430
I don't need a stunt person.

157
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,150
L-Let me do my own stunts.

158
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,600
What? Really?

159
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,780
What?

160
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,350
You were scouted to play a police detective?

161
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,720
Y-Yes.

162
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,190
I told them I don't have the time, though.

163
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,930
Why not give it a shot?

164
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,030
What kind of drama is this?

165
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,150
KEG48

166
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,350
It's called KEG48.
KEG48

167
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,350
It's a police drama people are talking
about for all kinds of reasons.
KEG48

168
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,750
KEG48

169
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,150
That show with 48 officers, so
you can't remember them all.

170
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,250
That's why it doesn't matter
much if they swap one out.

171
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,760
But doesn't that mean I might eventually
become the wife of an action star?

172
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,180
Huh? What about a wife?

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,810
Nothing. Just talking to myself.

174
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,690
Talk all you want, gold digger.

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,870
I can't ignore what you just said.

176
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,730
What?

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,950
Take it back.

178
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,020
It's fine, Makoto-san.

179
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,450
But...

180
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,460
Don't get into a fight before your debut.

181
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,130
Hey, there's a nail on the ground.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,800
Sorry.

183
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,590
That's where the carpenter flipped
his toolbox over earlier.

184
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,510
Hoegi Yota (26)
AD
That's where the carpenter flipped
his toolbox over earlier.

185
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,980
That's where the carpenter flipped
his toolbox over earlier.

186
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,510
Then clean it up.

187
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,380
What if I stepped on this and hurt myself?

188
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,770
S-Sorry.

189
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,190
It's because you're careless.

190
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,530
This is why the previous
AD died in an accident.

191
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,000
Unlike you ADs, us actors can't be replaced.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,250
Be careful.

193
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,610
The previous AD?

194
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,967
This is the last scene. Good luck.

195
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:24,697
Got it.

196
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:29,067
And give some thought to playing
the new police detective.

197
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,697
O-Okay.

198
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:34,017
I'll explain how the safety
tether works later.

199
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:36,107
Please head up to the fourth floor.

200
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,317
Understood.

201
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,377
Sonoko-san, excuse me.

202
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:42,747
Could you hold onto these?

203
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,167
Okay. Makoto-san, good luck.

204
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:49,957
Where's Tokuzono-chan?

205
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:52,927
He's supposed to kick our
future star off the building.

206
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,337
Tokuzono-san was looking for his phone.

207
00:11:56,337 --> 00:12:00,727
He said he couldn't find
his main girl's phone.

208
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:05,067
Aburai-chan, your allergies have
been going on for a while this year.

209
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,237
That's just what he said.

210
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:13,237
He's probably already up there talking
to his main girl on the phone.

211
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:16,467
Maybe he really is looking for it.

212
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:21,997
He keeps a different phone for each girl
but leaves them lying around all the time.

213
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:25,417
Are you speaking from experience?

214
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:29,587
No. He and I were never...

215
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,667
Uh, well...

216
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:34,967
Not that it matters.

217
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:40,637
Come to think of it, he asked me
earlier if I'd seen his phone.

218
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:43,937
Jeez. We're supposed to film soon.

219
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:47,567
Jinmei-chan, why are you short of breath?

220
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:53,007
Because I just filmed a fight scene
with the culprit on the fourth floor.

221
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,127
That was you?

222
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:56,497
Not the stunt woman?

223
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:59,097
What? Didn't I tell you?

224
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:01,097
What are you even talking about?

225
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,917
I'm joking, I'm joking.

226
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:08,447
If you yell too much, your
fake wounds will come apart.

227
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:09,927
I know that.

228
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:15,177
Sir, how's this for the camera angle?

229
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:17,427
Be right there.

230
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:25,217
Looks pretty good. It's got intensity.

231
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,807
So, has anyone seen Tokuzono-chan?

232
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:36,157
Hey, we're not ready ye—

233
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:46,717
Excuse me.

234
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:50,167
Is something wrong?

235
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,287
Makoto-san.

236
00:13:56,267 --> 00:14:00,557
The deceased is actor Tokuzono
Saiya-san, 34 years old.

237
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:03,397
While the staff was down here

238
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:07,187
preparing to film the next
scene for their TV drama,

239
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,827
Tokuzono-san, who had ascended
to the fourth floor,

240
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:13,067
shouted and fell.

241
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:16,587
He died when he struck the ground.

242
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,947
I see.

243
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,967
And at that time,

244
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,847
the only person on the fourth
floor with him was you,

245
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,867
Kyogoku Makoto-kun.

246
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:26,627
Yes.

247
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,517
You think Makoto-san did it?!

248
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,437
Why?!

249
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,507
Sonoko.

250
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:35,257
Was there really no one else there?

251
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:36,567
Yes.

252
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:42,407
Tokuzono-san came in while I was
visualizing the action scene by myself.

253
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,267
Did you notice anything then?

254
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:47,657
Come to think of it,

255
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:52,777
Tokuzono-san said he was looking for his
phone and called it using another one.

256
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:56,967
But I think I heard a strange
noise other than a ringtone.

257
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:59,317
Then I heard his scream.

258
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,657
When I turned around, he was gone.

259
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:02,957
A strange noise?

260
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,867
There was a sound just before he fell.

261
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:10,127
Then someone else must've set something up!

262
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,777
There's no way Makoto-san
would do something like that!

263
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:14,877
Sonoko, calm down.

264
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:19,467
Do you have any idea what
could have made the noise?

265
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:22,427
All that was in the fourth floor classroom

266
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:25,977
were the safety harness he was going to wear.

267
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,987
We'd finished filming the
scenes inside the classroom.

268
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:32,277
All we had left to film
was the culprit falling

269
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,727
from the fourth floor shot
from inside the schoolyard.

270
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,617
Once the actor playing the
culprit reached the fourth floor,

271
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,877
and the camera position was set,

272
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:42,907
I was supposed to head up there, too.

273
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:45,117
But then Tokuzono-san...

274
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,017
Is it possible that it was an accident?

275
00:15:48,017 --> 00:15:53,127
Could Tokuzono-san have accidentally fallen
while playing around with his harness?

276
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,747
He was looking for a phone
that was important to him.

277
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,867
I doubt that's what happened.

278
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:05,677
Although it is true that he
frequently pulled childish pranks.

279
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:09,297
Hideka-chan, you've been his
victim a few times, right?

280
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:10,807
Y-Yes.

281
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:17,237
He often pranked me with jack-in-the-boxes
and whoopee cushions.

282
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,607
He pranked us with some bleeding soap once.

283
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,617
That was intense.

284
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:30,437
The AD who fell for it
screamed like he was dying.

285
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:37,127
It made everyone in the studio
gather in the bathroom.

286
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:41,487
That AD went on to actually die later.

287
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,137
Because of those practical joke devices?

288
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:48,157
He got into a car accident on
his way to a filming location.

289
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,027
I see.

290
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:54,147
But weren't there staff members who
resented Tokuzono-san for his pranks?

291
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,387
Yes.

292
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,737
Some ADs even quit over it.

293
00:16:57,737 --> 00:17:01,747
And actors who quit after getting
into arguments about it.

294
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:06,367
Tokuzono-chan himself was
trying to break the ice.

295
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,457
He didn't have any malice.

296
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:11,337
Speaking of arguments,

297
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:16,337
that guy playing the culprit got into an
argument with Tokuzono-san just before he fell.

298
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:19,157
I guess he made fun of his girlfriend.

299
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:22,797
What?! That hardly qualifies as an argument!

300
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:25,137
Sonoko, restrain yourself.

301
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,997
In any case, let's head to
the fourth floor classroom.

302
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:35,017
Kyogoku-kun, director, and AD, come with us.

303
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,527
The rest of the staff will wait here.

304
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:45,597
After a fight, the culprit is kicked
out the window in this scene.

305
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:49,097
This is the safety harness you mentioned.

306
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:52,077
It seems fairly standard.

307
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:58,087
Could you call the last number the
victim called using his phone?

308
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,167
Got it.

309
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,447
It's over there?!

310
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,977
Huh? That's odd.

311
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:14,877
Nobody would forget their phone here.

312
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,607
C-Conan-kun?

313
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:22,747
Isn't it possible that something made
him drop it there after he found it?

314
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:27,117
But look. There isn't a
scratch on this phone.

315
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:30,137
In other words, it wasn't dropped or thrown.

316
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:35,357
It was carefully placed there by
someone other than Tokuzono-san.

317
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,627
That's right.

318
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,007
What are you kids doing?!

319
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,087
You, too, Sera-san?

320
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,507
I mean, after all, we're detectives.

321
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:50,587
Because of us, we now know that someone
may have used this phone to do something.

322
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,267
Jeez.

323
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:57,517
We don't know what their intention
was or who left this phone there.

324
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:02,997
After Tokuzono-san entered the classroom
and said he'd call his phone,

325
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,267
I heard the ringtone immediately.

326
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:08,937
I believe it came from the window.

327
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:14,067
That narrows down the time
when the phone was placed.

328
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,857
Did anyone else enter the classroom?

329
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,717
Everyone did.

330
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:24,547
We filmed the fight scene
in the classroom first.

331
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,337
All of the staff—camera, lights,

332
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:30,557
and makeup—were here in this room.

333
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:36,087
After that, we left to film the
falling scene from outside.

334
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:39,817
With all the equipment being
moved, things were busy.

335
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:47,067
So anyone could've taken advantage of that
to leave the phone outside the window.

336
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,517
We were up here watching them work,

337
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:53,197
so nobody was keeping an eye
on the window from the outside.

338
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:57,667
Sounds like we should ask who
was last to leave the classroom.

339
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,577
Indeed.

340
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,257
Please don't pick anything up until
forensics has a chance to examine the room.

341
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:11,427
My shoelace came untied.

342
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:14,937
What are you doing acting in a drama, anyway?

343
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:17,017
I-It's a long story.

344
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,097
He knocked an actor unconscious.

345
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:21,437
Not that he can tell them that.

346
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:26,697
What? Who left the fourth
floor classroom last?

347
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:29,537
How do you expect us to remember that?

348
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:32,097
We took a lunch break after that.

349
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,907
People were eating their
lunches all over the place.

350
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,957
It was about 30 minutes.

351
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:42,337
From down here, the fourth
floor is a blind spot.

352
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:46,607
In other words, it would've
been possible for someone

353
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:49,587
to return to the fourth floor
during that break and lay a trap.

354
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:54,847
Come to think of it, Jinmei-chan, you
were oddly short of breath earlier.

355
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,477
That's because I had an action scene.

356
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,727
But you had a 30 minute
break after filming ended.

357
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:07,737
Though it would make sense if you ran
up to the fourth floor at that time.

358
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,487
I haven't done an action scene
in a while, and I'm out of shape.

359
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,037
I run out of breath easily these days.

360
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:16,657
You did suddenly insist on doing it yourself.

361
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:21,577
In any case, someone placed the phone
outside the window during the break

362
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,837
between the time filming ended

363
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:26,667
and when Tokuzono-san and Kyogoku-san
returned to the fourth floor.

364
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:32,687
It's possible they were lurking nearby in
order to retrieve whatever trap they set.

365
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:35,557
Is there anyone who was
missing during that time?

366
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,697
We were about to start filming.

367
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,977
We would've noticed if someone disappeared.

368
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,117
Would you like to check the camera footage?

369
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:46,727
We happened to start filming
shortly before Tokuzono-chan fell.

370
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,067
I don't see you, director.

371
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:54,227
I was looking through the
camera to check the angle.

372
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,767
Hey, we're not ready ye—

373
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,367
See? That's my voice.

374
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:12,207
Sorry. This is an inappropriate time
for me to laugh about the past.

375
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:17,457
Only four people besides
Ran-san's group are visible.

376
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:20,017
And we can't see the fourth floor.

377
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,727
Odori Daisaku
Found the culprit [music]
