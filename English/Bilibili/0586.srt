1
00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:03,757
Giraffe's horn.

2
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:05,857
It is the amber horn of a giraffe statue that advisor

3
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:09,357
Jirokichi Suzuki found in the main building

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,157
of a mountain temple.

5
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:14,757
That Thief Kid who puts on airs is after this treasure

6
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,257
and sends Jirokichi a forewarning

7
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,457
letter of his intent to steal this.

8
00:00:19,257 --> 00:00:20,557
The advisor takes us,

9
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:22,357
the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

10
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,857
whom he figures Thief Kid cannot disguise himself as,

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:27,457
along with the TV crew,

12
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:29,757
and is all out to capture Thief Kid.

13
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:34,257
In order to get it you have to insert keys

14
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:35,757
into each pedestal that is in

15
00:00:35,757 --> 00:00:40,557
all four corners of the room

16
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,657
and turn the keys all at that same time.

17
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:51,657
Okay. Come whenever you like, Thief Kid.

18
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:56,157
I'm going to get you for sure this time.

19
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,557
Brooding over passing seasons,

20
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,457
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

21
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:21,257
The treasure that vanished and Thief Kid.

22
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:23,557
Youth Detective Squad, catch him without Conan's help.

23
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:25,157
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:26,957
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,257
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

26
00:02:56,862 --> 00:03:01,962
"Giraffe Horn that Vanished in the Dark"

27
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,562
-Okay, close it. -Yes, sir!

28
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,162
Like so... If you don't turn all four keys

29
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:22,362
of the four pedestal at the same time,

30
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:24,962
you cannot view the statue of the giraffe.

31
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:27,162
-What? -In other words, unless he

32
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,062
steals these keys from me

33
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:31,862
and split himself into four,

34
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,262
he can't take it away from me.

35
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:37,462
Don't tell me that the person who made this is...

36
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:39,962
Of course, the master of tricks during the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

37
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:43,362
Kichiemon Samizu, right?

38
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:44,662
Yes.

39
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:47,262
It's written at the foot of the pillar.

40
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:49,262
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

41
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,462
without using the correct method,

42
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,462
must move with the flow."

43
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,862
Kichiemon Samizu.

44
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,562
Did you figure out what this means?

45
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,662
No. Not yet.

46
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:02,362
So long as I have these four keys,

47
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:03,562
everything will be all right.

48
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,162
He can't steal them from me.

49
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,262
What an easy-going old man.

50
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:12,262
If three of his accomplices are among the people here,

51
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:13,362
and black this place out,

52
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:17,362
all they'd have left to do is to steal the keys.

53
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:18,662
That's true.

54
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,062
Thief Kid could black this make-shift lighting

55
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:24,662
out in no time at all.

56
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,162
Yes.

57
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,162
Even the electric shock current going through the pedestals

58
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:30,562
would be easily cut off

59
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,562
if we have only four people to guard

60
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:36,962
the keyholes of the pedestal in the dark...

61
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:39,062
But, I can't say for sure either when any of my men

62
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,262
would be switched with Thief Kid.

63
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:44,662
I can't trust the three TV crew either.

64
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,562
Darn! If there was only one keyhole,

65
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:50,462
I would guard over my dead body.

66
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:52,962
We'll guard it for you then.

67
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,962
Thief Kid can't disguise himself as us.

68
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,962
We can be most trusted.

69
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:04,962
And if we protect the treasure on our own,

70
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,662
we can show Conan that we're pretty good ourselves.

71
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:09,162
Right.

72
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,162
But, can you really handle it?

73
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,662
If you touch the pedestal before the electricity

74
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,562
is cut off, you'll get shocked.

75
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,662
We'll be fine.

76
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:19,062
So long as we don't mess up the order.

77
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,262
Each time it beeps,

78
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:21,962
it's suppose to cut off in the order of green, red,

79
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,062
white and black, right?

80
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:27,662
That's right, don't mess up.

81
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,462
So, it's only 10 more minutes to go

82
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,862
before the time Thief Kid promised he'll be appearing.

83
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,762
Will Thief Kid really show up in this mountain temple

84
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:36,162
where the members of the Youth Detective Squad await him?

85
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,062
Okay, we're all going to work together and capture Thief Kid!

86
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,862
Okay!

87
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,562
Conan and the others are really on TV.

88
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,262
How lucky.

89
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,362
You guys should've gone too.

90
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,962
Uncle Jirokichi told us not to come. He said,

91
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:53,262
"Only the children get to come over this time.

92
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:57,262
Since Thief Kid can disguise into both of you, don't come!" right?

93
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,762
Take Five.

94
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,162
We'll have to stand by from 3 minutes before,

95
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,162
so be ready, okay?

96
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,462
-Okay! -Got you.

97
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:09,862
We'll stand by too.

98
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,262
Right!

99
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,462
Hey! Where are you guys going?

100
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,462
We're going to guard the pedestal.

101
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,762
The problem is whether

102
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:19,662
or not you can guard the keys though.

103
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:22,062
No need to worry about that.

104
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,962
Since they're nailed onto the wall like this,

105
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,262
he couldn't possibly lay a hand on them,

106
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,962
so I win.

107
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,262
Black-out?

108
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,762
No need to fret.

109
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,762
A black out was expected to begin with.

110
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,462
Wind and rain, did someone open the window?

111
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,262
Is the camera rolling?

112
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:49,162
Yes, but it's so dark, practically nothing is in view.

113
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:51,862
-How's the sound? -I'm picking it up somehow.

114
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,662
It can't be.

115
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:08,162
What's this sound?

116
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,262
The pillar?

117
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,262
Conan.

118
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,662
Conan!

119
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,162
Get a hold of yourself!

120
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,762
Conan?

121
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:30,962
The giraffe's...

122
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:34,662
The giraffe's horn is gone.

123
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,862
Conan!

124
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,962
Conan.

125
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,562
Please open your eyes.

126
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,262
Conan.

127
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,662
What's taking you so long?

128
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,862
Can't you get the lights back on yet?

129
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:49,262
Cool it! Everybody stay where you are!

130
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,762
Hey, what is going on?

131
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,262
Is Thief Kid here or what?

132
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:54,362
I wonder...

133
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:57,662
There.

134
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,262
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,762
The giraffe's horn's been taken.

136
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:03,762
It can't be.

137
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:07,562
The four keys are still fixed to the wall.

138
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:09,362
How in the world...

139
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:12,162
I don't know how he did it yet but...

140
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,662
Either he or his accomplice ran around in the dark

141
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:18,262
during the one minute that the lights were out

142
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:21,462
and reached the four pedestals with the keyholes,

143
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:22,662
that's for sure.

144
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,762
This is...

145
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,262
Thief Kid's card!

146
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,462
Darn! Just when did he...

147
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:31,662
Inspector!

148
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:34,362
There's a card on the pedestal over here too.

149
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:35,862
Over here too.

150
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:36,962
This side too.

151
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:40,862
All four of them?

152
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,962
Inspector, the breaker of the main building

153
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,962
has been rigged in a strange way

154
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,062
and it's thought that the black-out was caused by it.

155
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,162
Inspector. Please come this way.

156
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,162
It seems that a tiny timer-type bomb

157
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:56,562
was set on to all the shutters of this building.

158
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,762
Darn, that Thief Kid.

159
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:01,462
He not only blacked the place out and threw us into the dark

160
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:02,762
but also blew away the windows,

161
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:05,662
let in the wind and rain in order to confuse us

162
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:08,862
and fled during all the chaos.

163
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:11,462
At any rate, I'm taking this brat

164
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,162
who was attacked by Thief Kid to the hospital.

165
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,162
Get me a car.

166
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,662
All the other remaining cars go after Thief Kid!

167
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:20,362
He couldn't possibly use his hand glider in this typhoon,

168
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:23,062
so shouldn't have gone too far yet.

169
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,862
But...

170
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:27,462
According to the information we received a while ago...

171
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:31,562
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide?

172
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:35,262
Hey, hey, if that brat was given poison or something...

173
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:38,562
It's not poison.

174
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:40,962
Look! It's a stun gun.

175
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,962
It seems he was knocked out by this.

176
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:45,662
I see.

177
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:48,562
That guy decided to put this little one,

178
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:51,162
who's most hard to beat to sleep first.

179
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:52,162
Sorry.

180
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,562
What do you mean, "I see".

181
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:58,162
I mean, it's all because you went and publicized

182
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,262
that jewelry that you just found last week to the media

183
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:03,262
even before we completed preparing or tight security.

184
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,962
That's why he walked off with the treasure.

185
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,162
It was a month ago.

186
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,862
I heard a month ago that the perfect amber,

187
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:11,762
the giraffe's horns

188
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,262
was laying asleep here at this temple.

189
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,262
I had them change the date of publicizing

190
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:19,362
because I was in the process of purchasing the treasure.

191
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,262
I wanted him to think that this old man

192
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:23,662
here got carried away at finding the perfect bait

193
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,762
to capture that thief...

194
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,962
Therefore, although security wasn't really prepared yet,

195
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,762
I lead him to think that I accepted his challenge.

196
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:35,462
Which means that the make-shift lighting...

197
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:39,862
Right, I knew he would be causing a black-out.

198
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:44,362
I also knew about that trick he used on the shutters.

199
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:47,462
The electric current I rigged on the pedestals

200
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:53,562
and calling the children were all strategies to lure him

201
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:56,162
to coming to this temple.

202
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,262
The lattice on the windows that with wood

203
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:00,062
that looks worn out and easy to break.

204
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,462
As well as the wall here that looks as if it would collapse

205
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,662
with the pound of a fist

206
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,362
are all made of steel on the inside.

207
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:07,562
Moreover, on one of the doors of the two at the entrance,

208
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,262
it is made so that it can be locked

209
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,762
and a sensor is built into it.

210
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,562
If the door is forced open,

211
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:17,162
a very noisy alarm is set to go off.

212
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,362
But since there were no such sound,

213
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:24,062
in other words, Thief Kid and his accomplices...

214
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:27,662
are still in here.

215
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:29,662
They are...

216
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,362
The Thief Kid is still in here?

217
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,462
Thief Kid?

218
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:47,526
So, Inspector Nakamori,

219
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:49,126
it's show time!

220
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,126
Check out all the faces of everyone here

221
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,226
excluding the children and...

222
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,826
There's something I'd like to make clear before that.

223
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:59,826
Let me explain how Thief Kid took the amber horns

224
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:03,026
from the statue of the giraffe.

225
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,426
Just before the black-out, unless you insert

226
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:10,126
and turn the white, black, red and green keys

227
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,826
that you nailed onto the wall of this room of the pedestals

228
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:16,826
that are in the four corners of the room

229
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,426
at the same time...

230
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:23,026
nobody could view the statue of the giraffe

231
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:26,126
that is hidden in the pillar in the center.

232
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:30,526
If by chance, Thief Kid got himself a spare somehow...

233
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:31,826
How in the world did he, in the dark,

234
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,626
where the pedestals nor the keyholes

235
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,126
were in view do what he did?

236
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,926
As for light, the little ones had it on them, didn't they?

237
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,526
The one on their watches!

238
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,626
Since they said they would be guarding pedestal,

239
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:47,426
Thief Kid probably used that light to do.

240
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,726
We didn't turn on the light!

241
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,826
It's true that we were covering the keyhole

242
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,926
like this though.

243
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,126
Because Ai told us not to turn on the light

244
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,126
even if the lights went out.

245
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,826
And, while you were covering the keyhole,

246
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,426
did anyone come?

247
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,726
-No! -What?

248
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:06,426
This keyhole...

249
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:07,726
Something's glowing.

250
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,726
What?

251
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,826
This is florescent paint.

252
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,726
Inspector, there's florescent on the keyhole on this side too.

253
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:18,826
Which means...

254
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,726
No way!

255
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,026
Just as I thought.

256
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:25,726
There's florescent paint on the tip of all four keys.

257
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,326
It probably got on there

258
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:29,926
when the key was stuck into the keyhole.

259
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,226
Which means, he was guided

260
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,326
by the slightest light of the keyhole.

261
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,626
Yes.

262
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,926
He gave all his accomplices the keys in the dark

263
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,826
and made them insert them into the glowing keyhole,

264
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:40,126
then turn all the keys at the same time,

265
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:46,026
then stole the horns of the giraffe, right?

266
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,026
Mr. Thief Kid!

267
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,726
What me?

268
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,926
Isn't it so?

269
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:55,526
It's an obvious fact that the keys

270
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:59,126
that were used weren't spare keys but these keys.

271
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:00,126
In other words,

272
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:05,926
you nailed the keys on very lightly

273
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:10,926
so that after using them you could put them back really easily.

274
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:13,626
Then, try pulling that metal out.

275
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,726
It won't come off that easily.

276
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:20,726
You probably nailed it back firmly when you returned the keys.

277
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,026
If you're going as far as to say that,

278
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,426
why don't you check my body?

279
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:26,426
If I'm Thief Kid, I should still have

280
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:27,926
the horns of the giraffe on me.

281
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:30,226
Yes, even if you don't tell me,

282
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:31,326
that's exactly what I'm planning to do...

283
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,726
Wait.

284
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:36,026
Will you let us, the Youth Detective Squad

285
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,826
do the body check?

286
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:41,326
If you, Inspector or the advisor is Thief Kid

287
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,226
and his accomplices,

288
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:46,126
you may fake checking and deceive us.

289
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,326
Exactly.

290
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:49,126
We can be trusted.

291
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:52,326
We're for sure not Thief Kid's accomplice.

292
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,326
That's true.

293
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,926
We'll be checking all the others too,

294
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:58,526
but that's okay, right?

295
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,526
Yes.

296
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:06,826
"We will be making some changes in the program.

297
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:09,526
Please wait a moment," it says.

298
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,526
This telop has been streaming from some time ago.

299
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:14,826
It's sure taking long for the program to restart.

300
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,926
I wonder what that strange sound was, though?

301
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:20,526
It was sure unpleasant to the ears.

302
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,326
What? Was there such a sound?

303
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:30,826
What?

304
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:34,226
You checked all the people in this temple building

305
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,226
but the giraffe's horn is nowhere in sight?

306
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:41,226
No. We thought that maybe it may secretly

307
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,726
have been put into our clothes and pockets too,

308
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:44,126
so we checked our clothes

309
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,726
as well as the pockets of Conan's clothes but couldn't find it.

310
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,626
It's strange.

311
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,326
The bars of the windows were made

312
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,726
with a width that the giraffe's horn couldn't pass through,

313
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,226
so even if his accomplices were to be outside,

314
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,726
he couldn't have given it to them.

315
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:57,826
That's why...

316
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,326
Thief Kid's already fled.

317
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,926
Open the door up right away so we can go after him.

318
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,826
No, but...

319
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:08,426
It's true. That since the treasure

320
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,226
that he was after is no longer here,

321
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:14,026
so it's most natural to think that he's gone,

322
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,126
but I just don't get it.

323
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:19,226
I wonder why he knocked Conan out.

324
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:21,226
Well, I guess getting rid of the one

325
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,326
who is thought to be most difficult to handle,

326
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,126
would make things way easier,

327
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:27,526
but doing so, would deprive Thief Kid of the pleasure

328
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,626
of feeling superior for carrying out what he'd done

329
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,626
right in front of Conan's eyes.

330
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:35,326
I wonder if he had some other reason?

331
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,226
And another thing that bothers me

332
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:38,626
is this phrase written by Kichiemon Samizu

333
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:41,026
that is carved on the pillar.

334
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,026
"One who desires to acquire the giraffe

335
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,126
without using the correct method,

336
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:47,726
must move with the flow."

337
00:16:47,726 --> 00:16:51,026
In other words, it means,

338
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,226
anyone who tries to acquire the giraffe's horn,

339
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:55,726
not using the proper method, must go with the flow.

340
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:59,926
The proper method probably refers to the keys,

341
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,626
but what is the flow?

342
00:17:02,926 --> 00:17:04,426
Wind?

343
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:06,426
The flow of the wind?

344
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,126
No. The wind is blowing now

345
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,426
because Thief Kid broke the shutters.

346
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:13,826
That's right, why did Thief Kid open the window

347
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,626
in the first place?

348
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,126
He caused a black-out

349
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,526
so it would've been meaningless for him to confuse us

350
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:20,926
by bringing in the wind and rain.

351
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,926
And, as Inspector Nakamori says,

352
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,226
if Advisor Suzuki were to be Thief Kid,

353
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:30,126
to take the keys that are fixed

354
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:33,126
to the wall in less than a minute, moreover in the dark.

355
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,626
In addition to pass it around to his accomplices

356
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:35,826
without using any light at all.

357
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:36,926
Then, without even giving a signal,

358
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,826
have everyone insert and turn the key at the same time.

359
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,726
And finally make the treasure vanish as if by magic,

360
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,226
I wonder if doing something like that is possible.

361
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,226
Besides, it's even dubious

362
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,626
that Thief Kid had any accomplices with him.

363
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:51,926
If he brought that many accomplices to a closed up place like this,

364
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:55,626
it's very likely that at least one of them would be caught.

365
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:58,826
I would avoid any such risk at all cost.

366
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,626
No good.

367
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:03,226
I'm not good at things like this after all.

368
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,426
I'm sure that this is what you'd say.

369
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,526
"You can't even figure out something as simple as that?"

370
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:11,626
Or, something to that effect.

371
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:12,626
You'd probably keep on going at it like a sparrow,

372
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,026
tweet-tweeting on forever,

373
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,426
lining all your know-it-all knowledge.

374
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,626
Sparrow...

375
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:24,826
Maybe the "sparrow" is some kind of hint to that phrase.

376
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:26,926
Why?

377
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,326
It's almost completely erased,

378
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:30,826
but the word "sparrow"

379
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,326
was carved on that red pedestal.

380
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,426
No joke.

381
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,626
Red sparrow...

382
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,726
"Vermilion Bird".

383
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:48,826
It's true. The word "sparrow" can be seen.

384
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:53,026
Then, maybe there was a statue of a sparrow here.

385
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,226
It's not sparrow.

386
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,326
Red is the vermilion color.

387
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:59,526
If the character written on top of the character sparrow

388
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,226
had been erase is the character "Zhu"

389
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,926
that symbolizes the vermilion color.

390
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,626
It is the legendary deity,

391
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,826
one of the four gods is the Vermilion Bird.

392
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:09,026
"Vermilion Bird"

393
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,626
The vermilion bird is...

394
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,826
The one that comes out a lot in games.

395
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:15,226
The red bird that looks like the Phoenix.

396
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:18,726
Yes. And the white pedestal

397
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:21,426
to the right of the red pedestal facing it,

398
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,726
is the White Tiger.

399
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:25,926
"White Tiger"

400
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:29,026
The black pedestal to its right on the side is...

401
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,626
the Black Tortoise.

402
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,526
"Black Tortoise"

403
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:35,226
And the one to the right on the side,

404
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,826
that is to the left of the first red pedestal,

405
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:40,326
on top of the green pedestal,

406
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:42,826
it may be safe and correct to say

407
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:44,526
that the statue of the Blue Dragon was there.

408
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:46,126
Please wait.

409
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:49,226
It's called the Blue Dragon, isn't it?

410
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:51,926
But, the color of the pedestal is green.

411
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,226
The word "green"

412
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,826
originally referred to the lush green

413
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,826
tree-line mountains, green trees and plants.

414
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:02,226
The true color of the dragon is said to be green.

415
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:06,826
The four deities each protect a certain direction,

416
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:08,326
The Vermilion Bird is the guardian of the South.

417
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:09,926
The White Tiger guards the West.

418
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:11,526
The Black Tortoise guards the North.

419
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,226
And, the Blue Dragon, the East.

420
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:16,526
And the one that is positioned in the middle is...

421
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:18,126
this giraffe.

422
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:22,926
So, the sentence that was written by Kichiemon Samizu

423
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:25,426
at the foot of the pillar means...

424
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:30,426
Well, it's a sort of after-care for in case

425
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:33,226
at a later time, the keys are lost or stolen.

426
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,226
The first part, "One who desires to acquire the giraffe

427
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,826
without using the correct method" means...

428
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,526
Anyone who wants to get a hold of the giraffe's horn

429
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:41,126
without relying on the keys.

430
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:45,726
That follows behind means

431
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:49,826
the flow of the moving of places and time.

432
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,126
In other words, it can also be interpreted

433
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,426
as to let things just be, but...

434
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,526
So, if we stay here and do nothing,

435
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,926
is the giraffe going to come out of the pillar?

436
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,126
No.

437
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,026
If the four pedestals that are placed in the four corners

438
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,726
of this room each stand for the Vermilion Bird,

439
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,526
White Tiger, Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon

440
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:09,926
it may have something to do

441
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,426
with the color each deity symbolizes,

442
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,626
as well as the direction.

443
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:16,026
Right. I think we're suppose to do something

444
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,426
to keep in the flow of the four pedestals

445
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,226
by doing something in a given order.

446
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:21,526
There is no order to the color.

447
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,626
Maybe we're supposed to do something

448
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:26,226
in the order of east, west south and north?

449
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:29,626
But, they have the "east-north".

450
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:30,626
Northeast district too.

451
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,026
Isn't the direction next to east supposed to be north?

452
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,326
I think north comes first.

453
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,826
Because north is located at the very top on every map.

454
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:39,926
I guess just the direction won't help us in figuring out

455
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:41,626
what order something should be done.

456
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,826
Be it clockwise or counter clockwise,

457
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:45,726
the flow is the flow.

458
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:48,226
True. I hope there is some kind of set order

459
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,026
to the Vermilion Bird, White Tiger,

460
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:52,826
Black Tortoise and Blue Dragon.

461
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:55,626
If it were Conan, he may know something.

462
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:58,626
He's been asleep for a while now.

463
00:21:58,626 --> 00:21:59,626
At any rate,

464
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:02,726
in order to make the giraffe appear from out of this pillar,

465
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:04,526
we've got no choice but to insert keys into the keyholes

466
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:07,426
of the four pedestals and turn them at the same time

467
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,626
or without using the keys,

468
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:12,226
do something to the four pedestals in a certain order.

469
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:14,226
There is no other possible way to do it.

470
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,826
It would be impossible for Thief Kid alone to do something like that

471
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:20,026
within the one minute of the time the place blacked out.

472
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,426
If he had any accomplices,

473
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:24,326
he would've had to give out some kind of signal.

474
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:26,526
Let's check on that, first of all.

475
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:29,126
Check on it, how?

476
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:30,526
They're here, aren't they?

477
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:34,726
The TV crew that is taking evidence

478
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:37,926
filled VTR shots.

479
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:41,726
Conan, I guess we have no choice

480
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,126
but to do what we can

481
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,726
on our own until you wake up.

482
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,526
Young staff were supposed to come today.

483
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,026
If you put it that way,

484
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:14,926
you, the cameraman is also suspicious!

485
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:17,826
Don't just sleep there forever,

486
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,126
and help us figure this out, will you?

487
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,126
White.

488
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,726
What?

489
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:27,126
Hurry up and unlock that door.

490
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:29,026
You're the one, aren't you?

491
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,426
The magician under the moon.

492
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,926
Next Conan,

493
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:36,225
"Thief Kid vs. the Detective Squad"

494
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:53,787
Next Conan's Hint:

495
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:56,487
"Genta's 10 yen size baldness"

496
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,887
There are times when Genta leads us to clues too.

497
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:00,387
That sure is a bald "bold" remark.
