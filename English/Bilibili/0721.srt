1
00:00:00.824 --> 00:00:03.624
We, who came to an Aso, Kumamoto sightseeing tour,

2
00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:05.524
got involved in a case in which

3
00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:07.224
the confidential data of Kumamon Foods was stolen

4
00:00:07.224 --> 00:00:11.024
and an amount of 10,000,000 yen was being demanded.

5
00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:14.124
The culprit had hidden the USB memory stick

6
00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:15.724
with the confidential data inside it

7
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.724
into the Kumamon stuffed doll,

8
00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:20.924
but from a queer turn of fate,

9
00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:24.324
that doll falls into the hands of Justin, who we ran into on our tour.

10
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.224
Going on the words that Justin had left behind as clues,

11
00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:32.324
we somehow managed to find him.

12
00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.624
But right after that, to our surprise Justin is kidnapped,

13
00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:40.224
stuffed doll and all, by the culprit right before our eyes!

14
00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:44.224
Is there a spy accomplice to the culprit among us?

15
00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:47.824
And who on earth is the culprit?

16
00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.024
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

17
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:04.824
are slashed by the light of deduction.

18
00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.624
The mystery gathers at Kumamoto Castle.

19
00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.824
The mystery involving the USB memory stick is disclosed.

20
00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:10.424
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.524
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:55.173
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Kumamoto Edition)"

24
00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:00.673
After that, we got no demands from the culprit

25
00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:04.473
and stayed overnight at a hotel in Kumamoto City.

26
00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:08.873
It sort of turned out to be a strange trip!

27
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.473
-What? -Hey, Genta!

28
00:03:13.473 --> 00:03:14.673
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:17.273
No, that's not what I meant!

30
00:03:17.273 --> 00:03:19.073
It's not your fault, Ayumi!

31
00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.473
So saying she'd be bothered about it either way, right?

32
00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:22.873
Yeah.

33
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.873
Mr. Mouri!

34
00:03:28.873 --> 00:03:30.473
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

35
00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:32.573
Did you get a call from the culprit or something?

36
00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:36.173
Yes, sir. Kumamon Foods got a call

37
00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:38.473
from the culprit telling them to bring 10,000,000 yen to Kumamoto City.

38
00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:40.673
Therefore, Mr. Kumada and the others have come here

39
00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:44.073
and are gathered in the conference room.

40
00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.173
Okay.

41
00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:47.073
Ran, take care of the children, will you?

42
00:03:47.073 --> 00:03:48.973
Yep.

43
00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:54.273
Huh? Conan?

44
00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:55.773
I'll go look for him.

45
00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:57.773
Okay, please do.

46
00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:14.973
Yes. I'm with the people from the police right now.

47
00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:17.373
What on earth shall I do?

48
00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:24.373
-Here. -Thank you.

49
00:04:28.173 --> 00:04:30.273
A child's been kidnapped?

50
00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:33.273
What on earth are the police doing anyway?

51
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.073
We're very sorry.

52
00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:39.573
Did the culprit specify the site of the deal?

53
00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:42.873
No, he just said he'd get a hold of me later.

54
00:04:42.873 --> 00:04:46.573
Why would a mere data of the company being stolen

55
00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:49.673
turn into a kidnap case?

56
00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:51.073
Hey, Inoue!

57
00:04:51.073 --> 00:04:52.973
Just what do you mean by "mere data of the company being stolen"?

58
00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:56.173
I'm sure you know how important that data is

59
00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:57.973
to our company too, don't you?

60
00:04:57.973 --> 00:04:59.273
But being the situation it is now,

61
00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:01.173
the child's life is above all priority, right?

62
00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:04.373
What? You dare stand against me or what?

63
00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:08.673
Well, well, let's not get all heated up.

64
00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:10.273
For the time being,

65
00:05:10.273 --> 00:05:13.973
let's wait for the next call from the culprit.

66
00:05:13.973 --> 00:05:15.373
What's this?

67
00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:17.973
Feeling of something not being right.

68
00:05:17.973 --> 00:05:20.973
The child's life is more important than the data...

69
00:05:20.973 --> 00:05:22.873
That's true, but...

70
00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:25.373
Conan.

71
00:05:25.373 --> 00:05:28.573
Ai. Don't scare me like that.

72
00:05:28.573 --> 00:05:30.773
I want a word with you.

73
00:05:31.973 --> 00:05:33.973
"Kumamoto Ramen shop"

74
00:05:36.973 --> 00:05:40.073
Three orders of Kumamoto ramen, please!

75
00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:44.473
Why do you want to take my Kumamon?

76
00:05:44.473 --> 00:05:46.973
Come on, tell me.

77
00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:52.273
Shut up and eat.

78
00:05:55.173 --> 00:05:57.373
No! Don't!

79
00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.673
This is Justin's!

80
00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:01.373
Just what're you doing to mommy?

81
00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.573
I'm going to turn anybody

82
00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:06.073
that does something bad to mommy to the police!

83
00:06:08.173 --> 00:06:09.473
Name card?

84
00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:12.073
Right, probably her husband's.

85
00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:14.273
The name "Naoto Takamori" was written on it, you see.

86
00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:17.373
Then, Jessica was placing a call to her husband?

87
00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:20.073
But, wouldn't she normally have her husband's number

88
00:06:20.073 --> 00:06:22.073
registered in her cell phone?

89
00:06:22.073 --> 00:06:24.373
I don't know why,

90
00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:27.173
but that name card was of Higo Foods.

91
00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:28.673
Higo Foods?

92
00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:30.373
If I remember correctly, wasn't that...

93
00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:34.173
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

94
00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:37.873
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

95
00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:40.473
we're finished!

96
00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:44.073
Justin's father is the president of Higo Foods.

97
00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:46.573
Could this be a mere coincidence?

98
00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.273
Or...

99
00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:52.873
Hey!

100
00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:54.773
Where are you guys going?

101
00:06:56.773 --> 00:06:59.473
We managed to make it through without Ran seeing us, you see.

102
00:06:59.473 --> 00:07:01.573
Just what do you think you're doing?

103
00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:02.573
Come on, let's go!

104
00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:04.673
So, where are we going?

105
00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:06.673
We, the Youth Detective Squad,

106
00:07:06.673 --> 00:07:08.973
are going to go look for Justin!

107
00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:10.973
That's dangerous.

108
00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:14.873
Oh, no! He caught us in the act.

109
00:07:14.873 --> 00:07:16.973
That wound on your arm...

110
00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:19.673
You got hurt when an accomplice of the culprit

111
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:21.873
hit you with the bag he had, didn't you?

112
00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:27.673
But next time, maybe you won't get away

113
00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:29.573
with just getting hurt, you know?

114
00:07:29.573 --> 00:07:32.773
Were you there back then, Mr. Inoue?

115
00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:35.573
President, did you call for me?

116
00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.573
You're late, Inoue!

117
00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:38.773
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:38.773 --> 00:07:41.173
But why are the police here?

119
00:07:41.573 --> 00:07:43.873
If I remember correctly, didn't you come here

120
00:07:43.873 --> 00:07:45.673
after the president called for you?

121
00:07:45.673 --> 00:07:47.773
I heard about it from the president,

122
00:07:47.773 --> 00:07:50.273
that a girl called Ayumi got hurt.

123
00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:52.273
You're Ayumi, aren't you?

124
00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:55.773
Yes, sir. But I'm to blame.

125
00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:59.973
Because I interfered.

126
00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:05.473
If you so insist, I'll go with you.

127
00:08:05.473 --> 00:08:07.873
After all to begin with, our company is to blame

128
00:08:07.873 --> 00:08:10.273
for getting our confidential data stolen.

129
00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:19.573
During the 2nd call from the culprit,

130
00:08:19.573 --> 00:08:22.373
I heard the sound of a tram in the background.

131
00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:26.473
But there are two tram lines in Kumamoto,

132
00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:31.073
with a total of 35 tam stops.

133
00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:33.373
With only that much to go on...

134
00:08:35.673 --> 00:08:37.173
"Found lost stamp book"

135
00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:38.873
That's...

136
00:08:38.873 --> 00:08:40.873
It's this.

137
00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:44.073
No doubt about it. This is Justin's stamp book!

138
00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.273
He deliberately left it behind a while ago,

139
00:08:46.273 --> 00:08:48.573
to let us know his whereabouts, right?

140
00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:51.473
Was he with someone else?

141
00:08:51.473 --> 00:08:54.273
The thing is... He was with a suspicious looking man

142
00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:57.173
who was wearing sunglasses and a mask.

143
00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:59.673
I wonder if that was his father?

144
00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:03.173
Which means he's still with the culprit.

145
00:09:03.173 --> 00:09:06.473
And, would you have any idea which way they went?

146
00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:08.573
If I remember correctly, it was...

147
00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:10.373
"Shimotori Arcade" -They walked through the arcade

148
00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:12.373
and went toward the castle.

149
00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:17.673
Oh, no. She found out.

150
00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:19.773
Hello, Ran?

151
00:09:19.773 --> 00:09:21.873
Hey, Conan. Where are you?

152
00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:22.973
Is everyone else with you too?

153
00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:25.573
Just what do you brats think you're doing, going off on your own?

154
00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:27.273
We're not only going around on our own.

155
00:09:27.273 --> 00:09:29.273
Mr. Inoue's here with us, too.

156
00:09:29.273 --> 00:09:30.573
What?

157
00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:31.773
-I don't care who you're with. -That American-Japanese boy

158
00:09:31.773 --> 00:09:33.373
that we just saw was really cute, wasn't he?

159
00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:37.173
-You can say that again! -That's why brats like you guys...

160
00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:39.473
Excuse me!

161
00:09:39.473 --> 00:09:43.373
The American-Japanese boy, what kind of a boy was he?

162
00:09:43.373 --> 00:09:46.173
It's him.

163
00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:47.773
It's Justin, after all!

164
00:09:47.773 --> 00:09:49.873
Where did you take this picture?

165
00:09:49.873 --> 00:09:51.073
A little ways ahead.

166
00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:52.773
Just about in front of the Karaoke shop.

167
00:09:55.173 --> 00:09:56.473
I see.

168
00:09:56.473 --> 00:09:57.873
He's not here.

169
00:09:57.873 --> 00:10:01.073
Maybe he already left to go elsewhere?

170
00:10:01.073 --> 00:10:03.173
Excuse me.

171
00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:08.073
Didn't you see an American-Japanese boy about our age?

172
00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.573
-We did! -We did!

173
00:10:09.573 --> 00:10:12.173
We saw him around that convenience store over there.

174
00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:14.873
He even winked at me, you know!

175
00:10:14.873 --> 00:10:16.473
He was awesome!

176
00:10:16.473 --> 00:10:18.073
Is he a child model?

177
00:10:18.073 --> 00:10:19.373
Just as expected.

178
00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:20.873
Yeah.

179
00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:23.473
He's doing all this deliberately

180
00:10:23.473 --> 00:10:26.573
to let us know where he is.

181
00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:28.673
He's pretty sly.

182
00:10:37.823 --> 00:10:38.923
"Bronze statue of Seishoko"

183
00:10:38.923 --> 00:10:41.923
Hey, look, look. Take a look at him!

184
00:10:41.923 --> 00:10:44.323
He's so cute!

185
00:10:44.323 --> 00:10:45.823
He's so adult-like.

186
00:10:45.823 --> 00:10:47.523
My, he's cute!

187
00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:48.923
Really!

188
00:10:48.923 --> 00:10:50.523
Awesome!

189
00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:54.823
Just what do you think you're doing, brat?

190
00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.123
We're standing out too much!

191
00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:02.523
"Josai Garden"

192
00:11:05.223 --> 00:11:07.623
Stay still and play over here.

193
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.423
Don't you dare do anything funny.

194
00:11:09.423 --> 00:11:11.323
I'm keeping my eyes on you, understand?

195
00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:13.123
Okay.

196
00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:21.423
Did you get the money ready?

197
00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:23.123
Yeah! It's right here!

198
00:11:23.123 --> 00:11:24.423
Listen well.

199
00:11:24.423 --> 00:11:26.423
Put the bag of money

200
00:11:26.423 --> 00:11:28.523
under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle!

201
00:11:28.523 --> 00:11:31.423
If I even get a glimpse of the police,

202
00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:33.623
I won't guarantee the child's life, get that?

203
00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:36.823
I'm sure that they'll...

204
00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:41.323
Let me go! What do you think you're doing?

205
00:11:44.623 --> 00:11:46.023
Watch out!

206
00:11:50.223 --> 00:11:52.523
I'm sure that they'll...

207
00:11:56.923 --> 00:11:59.123
Kumamoto Castle?

208
00:11:59.123 --> 00:12:01.523
I was told to put the bag with the money

209
00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:03.523
inside under the large gingko tree of Kumamoto Castle.

210
00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:06.123
This'll probably be our last chance.

211
00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:09.423
We've got to nab the culprit no matter what, this time!

212
00:12:09.423 --> 00:12:13.023
But if the culprit was where we goofed on the previous deal

213
00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:15.423
and watching from close range,

214
00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:18.823
there's a possibility that all of our faces have been seen.

215
00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:19.923
Yeah.

216
00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:23.723
If he finds out that we're keeping watch from close by,

217
00:12:23.723 --> 00:12:26.123
the child's life will be endangered.

218
00:12:26.123 --> 00:12:28.023
I've got one!

219
00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:29.823
An idea!

220
00:12:29.823 --> 00:12:34.123
Why not let I, Kogoro Mouri take care of this?

221
00:12:34.123 --> 00:12:36.723
Hey, wait. Are you going to be all right, dad?

222
00:12:40.423 --> 00:12:43.123
I hope you find your friend soon.

223
00:12:43.123 --> 00:12:44.623
Thank you.

224
00:12:44.623 --> 00:12:47.523
Like the woman at the ramen shop was saying a while ago...

225
00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:51.323
Could the kidnaper of the child be his father?

226
00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:54.123
The kidnapper of the child?

227
00:12:54.123 --> 00:12:56.023
Conan!

228
00:12:56.023 --> 00:12:59.723
There was a person who saw Justin at Wakuwaku-za!

229
00:12:59.723 --> 00:13:01.123
Wakuwaku-za?

230
00:13:05.723 --> 00:13:07.723
Where are we headed for next?

231
00:13:07.723 --> 00:13:09.223
Shut up and come with me!

232
00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.023
There he is!

233
00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.523
The kidnapper's with him, too!

234
00:13:12.523 --> 00:13:14.623
He's not getting away!

235
00:13:15.823 --> 00:13:17.423
What took you guys so long?

236
00:13:20.223 --> 00:13:22.323
Stay away!

237
00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:25.423
Don't move! Or else, I'll...

238
00:13:30.523 --> 00:13:31.523
Darn! Hold it!

239
00:13:32.723 --> 00:13:34.323
Pass!

240
00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:37.523
Give it to me!

241
00:13:37.523 --> 00:13:39.223
Conan!

242
00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.223
You brats!

243
00:13:48.323 --> 00:13:49.523
Ai!

244
00:13:49.523 --> 00:13:51.023
No, I'll get it!

245
00:13:51.023 --> 00:13:52.423
Stay out of my way!

246
00:13:56.923 --> 00:13:58.923
Too bad!

247
00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:11.523
Darn it!

248
00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:15.823
Leave the rest to me and go after the culprit, Conan!

249
00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:18.023
Okay, I'm counting on you, Ai!

250
00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:21.723
"Kumamoto Castle"

251
00:14:23.223 --> 00:14:27.723
"Honmaru Goten"

252
00:14:40.323 --> 00:14:41.823
All of you!

253
00:14:44.323 --> 00:14:47.123
Intruder! Nab him!

254
00:14:47.123 --> 00:14:49.923
Aye...

255
00:14:56.623 --> 00:15:00.023
I'm the boss of this castle!

256
00:15:00.023 --> 00:15:02.623
One word from me and this is what you get!

257
00:15:02.623 --> 00:15:06.823
Officer Kosugi helped you out by showing his police badge, didn't he?

258
00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:09.023
Darn it!

259
00:15:09.023 --> 00:15:12.323
Don't you care what happens to the kid or what?

260
00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:14.923
He's only bluffing!

261
00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:18.423
I'm over here!

262
00:15:18.423 --> 00:15:19.423
Justin!

263
00:15:19.423 --> 00:15:20.923
Mommy!

264
00:15:25.723 --> 00:15:27.323
Darn it!

265
00:15:27.323 --> 00:15:28.723
That voice...

266
00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:31.423
You're Mr. Koda, aren't you?

267
00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:34.523
Don't!

268
00:15:34.523 --> 00:15:36.423
Koda?

269
00:15:36.423 --> 00:15:39.323
I received mail from you saying that you wanted me to contact you

270
00:15:39.323 --> 00:15:41.123
when we figured out Justin's whereabouts and so I did.

271
00:15:41.123 --> 00:15:45.423
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

272
00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:49.723
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

273
00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:52.223
Mt. Daikanbo?

274
00:15:52.223 --> 00:15:53.223
I see!

275
00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:55.823
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

276
00:15:55.823 --> 00:15:58.523
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

277
00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:01.023
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

278
00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:02.323
That's...

279
00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:04.423
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

280
00:16:04.423 --> 00:16:07.123
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

281
00:16:07.123 --> 00:16:09.923
I've got to let Mr. Koda know!

282
00:16:11.723 --> 00:16:15.423
I had no idea that you were up to something like this.

283
00:16:15.423 --> 00:16:17.923
I needed money!

284
00:16:17.923 --> 00:16:20.223
I lost a great deal of money gambling

285
00:16:20.223 --> 00:16:22.923
and had a large debt borrowing from a loan shark.

286
00:16:22.923 --> 00:16:25.223
I had to make ends meet!

287
00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:26.823
I was stabbed with a knife

288
00:16:26.823 --> 00:16:28.723
saying that they won't be lenient with me just because I'm a cop.

289
00:16:28.723 --> 00:16:30.223
They threatened me saying that the next time around,

290
00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:31.523
they won't spare my life.

291
00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:35.023
So that's the truth of why you were stabbed by a thug.

292
00:16:37.523 --> 00:16:39.723
Who's the culprit?

293
00:16:39.723 --> 00:16:41.923
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

294
00:16:41.923 --> 00:16:45.123
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

295
00:16:45.123 --> 00:16:48.123
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

296
00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:49.423
Who cares which it is!

297
00:16:49.423 --> 00:16:52.923
You're the officer who went after the man that fled back then.

298
00:16:52.923 --> 00:16:56.323
I get it. Everything's clear now!

299
00:16:57.723 --> 00:16:59.423
Ai, can you hear me?

300
00:16:59.423 --> 00:17:02.223
Why'd you dare rob our company?

301
00:17:02.223 --> 00:17:04.723
How'd you know about the confidential data?

302
00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:08.423
Maybe somebody else stole it.

303
00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:12.023
Because on the day that Kumamon Foods was robbed,

304
00:17:12.023 --> 00:17:15.223
Mr. Koda was still hospitalized, right?

305
00:17:17.623 --> 00:17:21.123
Then where's the confidential data for the new product?

306
00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.823
Where'd my Kumamon go?

307
00:17:23.823 --> 00:17:26.423
As to that, we know where it is.

308
00:17:27.623 --> 00:17:30.323
Come with me!

309
00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:32.123
I found it!

310
00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:33.823
Really, Ayumi?

311
00:17:33.823 --> 00:17:38.023
See. The memory stick is intact right here, too!

312
00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:39.523
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:41.123
Well done, Ayumi!

314
00:17:41.123 --> 00:17:42.823
You did it!

315
00:17:42.823 --> 00:17:46.423
Thank you! You've saved our company!

316
00:17:46.423 --> 00:17:48.423
Yep! Here you go!

317
00:17:48.423 --> 00:17:52.123
No! Don't give it to him yet.

318
00:17:52.123 --> 00:17:54.123
Just what do you...

319
00:17:58.123 --> 00:18:01.223
The great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

320
00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:02.823
Off I go!

321
00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:11.423
Dad?

322
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.823
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

323
00:18:15.823 --> 00:18:20.123
Mr. Inoue, I have a question I'd like to ask you.

324
00:18:20.123 --> 00:18:21.623
What could it be?

325
00:18:21.623 --> 00:18:26.523
Isn't this case something you yourself planned and acted out?

326
00:18:30.423 --> 00:18:33.223
Just what do you mean by that?

327
00:18:33.223 --> 00:18:36.523
I'm asking you whether you're the one

328
00:18:36.523 --> 00:18:41.423
who stole the confidential data of Kumamon Foods, Mr. Inoue.

329
00:18:41.423 --> 00:18:43.923
Just what do you think you're saying?

330
00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.623
I heard from Conan

331
00:18:45.623 --> 00:18:49.123
that you weren't at Cuddly Dominion,

332
00:18:49.123 --> 00:18:51.423
the site of the deal yesterday.

333
00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:57.223
And yet you knew about the culprit throwing the bag at her.

334
00:18:58.523 --> 00:19:00.823
You seem to have said that

335
00:19:00.823 --> 00:19:02.923
you heard about this from President Kumada?

336
00:19:02.923 --> 00:19:05.823
However, President Kumada had mistakenly thought that

337
00:19:05.823 --> 00:19:09.523
Ayumi Yoshida was Ai Haibara,

338
00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.823
and remembered one for the other.

339
00:19:13.123 --> 00:19:15.323
So you're the one who was at Cuddly Dominion

340
00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:18.323
when a girl called Ai got in the way and...

341
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.323
No. The girl's name is Ayumi.

342
00:19:21.323 --> 00:19:22.723
Who cares which it is!

343
00:19:23.623 --> 00:19:27.523
That's why if you really heard about it from President Kumada,

344
00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:30.023
you would have heard, "A girl named Ai got hit

345
00:19:30.023 --> 00:19:31.823
by the bag the culprit threw at her."

346
00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:34.423
But you asked not Ai Haibara,

347
00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:37.523
but Ayumi Yoshida whether she was okay.

348
00:19:37.523 --> 00:19:39.923
That's because back then...

349
00:19:45.323 --> 00:19:47.823
You were also at the scene of the crime!

350
00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:51.723
To get the money that the executer of the crime

351
00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.323
was supposed to give you.

352
00:19:53.323 --> 00:19:56.423
But the plan failed!

353
00:19:56.423 --> 00:19:58.123
Since you were urgently called

354
00:19:58.123 --> 00:20:01.123
by President Kumada to explain the situation,

355
00:20:01.123 --> 00:20:04.223
you made it look as if you rushed over just now

356
00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:06.923
and appeared before us.

357
00:20:07.823 --> 00:20:10.023
Isn't that right?

358
00:20:10.023 --> 00:20:13.923
I don't remember telling you anything like that!

359
00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:15.323
It's true that on that day

360
00:20:15.323 --> 00:20:17.823
I was at the scene where the deal took place.

361
00:20:17.823 --> 00:20:19.723
I admit that.

362
00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:23.123
But that's only because I was concerned about the deal!

363
00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:25.323
If you so insist...

364
00:20:25.323 --> 00:20:26.923
Officer Kosugi!

365
00:20:26.923 --> 00:20:31.523
You have a USB port on your tablet, don't you?

366
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.223
Yes, there is.

367
00:20:34.223 --> 00:20:36.523
Then, you can confirm right now

368
00:20:36.523 --> 00:20:40.123
what's inside the USB memory stick that was retrieved, can't you?

369
00:20:40.123 --> 00:20:42.223
Well, not really.

370
00:20:42.223 --> 00:20:43.623
What's wrong?

371
00:20:43.623 --> 00:20:46.023
If that's really the data that was stolen,

372
00:20:46.023 --> 00:20:48.623
wouldn't you be able to view it right now?

373
00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:51.123
If it's confidential,

374
00:20:51.123 --> 00:20:54.723
I don't mind you showing it only to President Kumada, you know.

375
00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:57.723
How about it, Inoue?

376
00:20:57.723 --> 00:20:59.923
Be it something that you planned and acted out yourself,

377
00:20:59.923 --> 00:21:03.723
you couldn't bring yourself to steal the real data.

378
00:21:03.723 --> 00:21:05.123
In other words,

379
00:21:05.123 --> 00:21:09.123
confidential data was never stolen to begin with!

380
00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:18.623
I couldn't stand the president's overbearing

381
00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:19.923
and haughty attitude towards me,

382
00:21:19.923 --> 00:21:22.123
treating me like his henchman.

383
00:21:22.123 --> 00:21:25.923
So, all I wanted to do was give him a little trouble.

384
00:21:25.923 --> 00:21:28.323
But the police turns up

385
00:21:28.323 --> 00:21:32.023
and partway it switches to a real kidnap case.

386
00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:34.123
Since gradually start getting more and more serious,

387
00:21:34.123 --> 00:21:37.423
I couldn't make myself come out and tell the truth anymore.

388
00:23:04.523 --> 00:23:09.623
"Hosokawa Gyobu Mansion"

389
00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:16.923
It seems that Justin's father had already passed away.

390
00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:20.423
It seems that the phone call that Jessica was making

391
00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:24.923
was to discuss the case with a colleague of her father.

392
00:23:29.023 --> 00:23:31.423
That's why his name wasn't registered

393
00:23:31.423 --> 00:23:33.023
and she was looking at the name card.

394
00:23:33.023 --> 00:23:36.023
Now I understand why Justin was trying to protect his mother

395
00:23:36.023 --> 00:23:37.523
anytime something came up.

396
00:23:37.523 --> 00:23:42.423
He probably felt like he had to do his father's share, too.

397
00:23:42.423 --> 00:23:44.823
Yeah. Because after all to him...

398
00:23:47.923 --> 00:23:51.023
Mommy is number one.

399
00:23:53.723 --> 00:23:56.523
"Next Episode" -I'll never forgive you if you leave now!

400
00:23:56.523 --> 00:23:58.423
Ai.

401
00:23:58.423 --> 00:24:01.423
They're important witnesses.

402
00:24:01.423 --> 00:24:03.423
Don't get chicken!

403
00:24:03.423 --> 00:24:06.623
He could never make a sound!

404
00:24:06.623 --> 00:24:09.623
Can't make a sound?

405
00:24:11.623 --> 00:24:13.023
Wait a sec.

406
00:24:13.023 --> 00:24:15.923
If I remember correctly, this cat...

407
00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:18.323
I see! There's one other way.

408
00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:23.723
Next Conan, "A Sweet, Cold Courier (Part 1)"

409
00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:42.023
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:43.823
"Receipt"

411
00:24:43.823 --> 00:24:45.323
That was a close call, wasn't it?

412
00:24:45.323 --> 00:24:46.823
I guess it's my turn next.

413
00:24:46.823 --> 00:24:48.623
Let's see what happens in the next episode.
