1
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,840
Today's stage is a pet shop.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
Something happens in Tokyo and Gunma.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,640
What connects the two incidents?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:59,025
The other day, I found a cute one here.

8
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:01,325
A pet shop?

9
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,825
A cute one?

10
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:06,025
I wanted to show it to you guys.

11
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,625
It looks to be their day off.

12
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,225
True.

13
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,625
So, here it is.

14
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,725
Huh?

15
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,825
I told them I'd be coming at 10 am, and yet...

16
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:20,025
Hey, it seems like they're opening the shutter.

17
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,325
What?

18
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,825
Yeah.

19
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,225
Excuse me! My name is Ninomiya.

20
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,225
Is anybody in?

21
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,425
There he is! He's the one! This one!

22
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:48,025
-What? -Genta, you mean this?

23
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,525
Yeah.

24
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:52,425
How ugly!

25
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,025
What's this sound?

26
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:58,325
Maybe something got away, like a snake or something.

27
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,625
What?

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,425
-Snake! -Snake!

29
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,325
It's a beetle!

30
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,725
I got it.

31
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,625
Why is a beetle in a place like this?

32
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,425
Furthermore, at this time of season.

33
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,525
What?

34
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:32,625
What's up, Conan?

35
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,325
-What is it? -Talk about messy.

36
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,825
Stay away!

37
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:45,025
"Mysterious Spring Beetle"

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:50,125
The victim is the owner of the pet shop, Mr. Minoru Shirai, age 41.

39
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,325
There are traces of strangulation.

40
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,625
The murder weapon hasn't been found yet.

41
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,625
Yes, sir. Okay.

42
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:00,025
There were traces of him having been strangled

43
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,825
with a thin thread-like thing.

44
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,625
He seems to have been killed elsewhere

45
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,225
then brought here.

46
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,925
How can you tell?

47
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,525
If he died here, his legs should be stretched straight

48
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,125
due to postmortem stiffening.

49
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,225
I see.

50
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:17,925
Mr. Ninomiya.

51
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,725
You were scheduled to come here at 10 am?

52
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:25,425
Yes. I was told to call the shop at 6 pm last night

53
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:29,825
to check if it came in or not, so I called.

54
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:32,425
Did you notice anything strange back then?

55
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:36,425
Nothing in particular, except for that frog croaking.

56
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:38,125
Croaking?

57
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,325
Hey, what were you planning on buying?

58
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,625
What? Oh, a beetle.

59
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,225
A beetle?

60
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,325
You mean they sell it in this season?

61
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes. I was told something about a place in Gunma

62
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,625
where you can get beetles all year round.

63
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,925
Gunma?

64
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,525
Please tell me where were you yesterday?

65
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:03,225
I was sleeping till noon and from 3 pm to 10 pm,

66
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,925
I was working at a family restaurant.

67
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,225
Beetle?

68
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,025
What's that?

69
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,525
This is it!

70
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:17,325
Yes! Mr. Shirai probably went here.

71
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,425
Gunma...

72
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:23,925
Officer Sato, we found this in the victim's pocket.

73
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,225
-There was nothing more inside? -No, madam.

74
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,225
Where's the lid?

75
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,425
The thing is, we can't find it.

76
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,125
But why would something like this be here?

77
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,225
Hey, stay still!

78
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:37,925
Hey! What's that?

79
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:40,325
Isn't that a beetle?

80
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:43,225
I found it walking there a while ago.

81
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,325
Big, isn't it?

82
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,425
How dare you all just come in like that?

83
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:47,825
Go on home!

84
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,825
We're sorry!

85
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,225
Gosh. If she chases us out,

86
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:57,225
we won't be able to investigate, you know.

87
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,325
Sorry, sorry, but...

88
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,125
See? Here's the flyer that Conan was looking at a while ago.

89
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,625
I guess we can go to...

90
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,525
The insect pavilion in Gunma for now.

91
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,625
Let's go!

92
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,125
But, how do we get there?

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,725
That's true.

94
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,525
You guys...

95
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,825
Hi there, kids!

96
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,825
-Officer... -Takagi.

97
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:24,525
Huh?

98
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,425
What's with all of you?

99
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,925
Hurry, Officer Takagi!

100
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,425
Hurry, to where?

101
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,025
We've found a clue!

102
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:39,025
-What? -Hurry, hurry!

103
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,025
Where do you want me to go?

104
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,025
Straight! Straight ahead!

105
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,025
What?

106
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,725
Straight...

107
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,125
Hey, it's dangerous! Keep your eye on the road!

108
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,725
Yeah. But straight ahead is...

109
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,325
the expressway.

110
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,025
Hey, hey. Where are we headed for?

111
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,625
Isn't it about time you guys tell me?

112
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:04,625
You'll be surprised out of your wits.

113
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,225
To the Gunma Insect Museum!

114
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:10,225
Let's see what's on today.

115
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,325
Gunma Insect museum...

116
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:15,025
I see, a museum.

117
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,825
What? Gunma!

118
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,125
Gosh! You gotta be kidding!

119
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,925
We're heading back! We're going home!

120
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,225
But...

121
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,525
So, there was such an incident.

122
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,025
Then, the more so, we've got to head back and investigate.

123
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:34,225
But we've already come a long way.

124
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,225
Isn't it almost Gunma?

125
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,925
Well, no problem is there? It's your day off, right?

126
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,025
But...

127
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,525
Isn't it a bit cold?

128
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,225
I'm sorry. This car doesn't have a heater.

129
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:49,625
What? I didn't know such a car existed in this day and age.

130
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,125
-Junk. -Well, I'm so sorry!

131
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:58,925
Huh? Don't tell me that, you're who I think you are,

132
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,225
but don't tell me it's you, Conan?

133
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,125
Officer klutz of the Gunma Prefectural Police Department.

134
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,225
He's...

135
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:08,625
The officer that goofed and let a murderer get away some time ago.

136
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,725
You know what...

137
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,225
Mr. Mouri is not with you today?

138
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:16,125
Nope.

139
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,025
That's too bad. If Mr. Mouri were here,

140
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:23,025
we could've maybe seen the Sleeping Kogoro deduction show.

141
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,225
Well, but I guess a mere beetle theft

142
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:31,025
doesn't warrant an appearance from the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

143
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,125
Beetle theft?

144
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,425
Is this the truck that was stolen?

145
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:42,625
Yes, sir. No mistake.

146
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,025
The beetle...

147
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,525
Isn't there a beetle there?

148
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,825
The thief probably took it away

149
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:56,225
with another car that he had prepared here.

150
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:02,125
Gosh, that's too much! Who would do this?

151
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,325
When was it stolen?

152
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,625
About 7 pm last night.

153
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,325
This is Mr. Araki of this museum here,

154
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,725
and he is beetle researcher, Mr. Haruna.

155
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,925
After loading the beetles onto the truck,

156
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,925
they went into the museum for a brief moment, and it was during this time,

157
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,425
somebody stole their truck from them.

158
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,825
I didn't think that yesterday after I went home,

159
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,425
the precious beetles would be stolen.

160
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:30,125
He is the editor of an insect magazine, Mr. Ishida.

161
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,325
"Takashi Ishida (25)"

162
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,725
I'm sure glad that at least the truck came back.

163
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,925
Mr. Haruna, let's deliver the beetles

164
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,125
we promised to the children once again.

165
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,625
Yeah, let's do that.

166
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,425
Why do you have beetles at this museum even if it's not summer?

167
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,525
Mr. Haruna succeeded in finding a way

168
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,525
to make them emerge into adults all year round.

169
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,725
The larva that has been preserved

170
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:59,425
at 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C is put into another container

171
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,925
and the temperature is raised to 28 degrees C.

172
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,325
Then the larva starts to grow.

173
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,025
Adjusting the temperature is crucial.

174
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,325
But, isn't it cold when you transport them by truck?

175
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,425
That's nothing to worry about.

176
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,825
This truck is equipped with an air conditioner

177
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,925
in order to enable temperature adjustment.

178
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:20,825
When we transport adult beetles,

179
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:23,525
we keep the temperature at 28 degrees C.

180
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:27,325
The beetles are "richer" than you, Officer Takagi.

181
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:29,025
Yeah, yeah.

182
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,925
Conan, could it be that the beetle

183
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,525
that we saw back at Mr. Shirai's place was also...

184
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,825
Huh? Mr. Shirai?

185
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:39,125
Mr. Shirai of the pet shop. Do you know him?

186
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,525
Yes. He came to ask us to sell him a beetle.

187
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,225
He was extremely persistent.

188
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,325
All that man is ever concerned about is money.

189
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:51,225
I didn't continue my research on beetles all this time for money.

190
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,925
Did Mr. Shirai do something?

191
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,425
Don't tell me he's the one who stole it?

192
00:10:56,425 --> 00:11:02,225
No. Well, this morning, he was found killed at his shop in Tokyo.

193
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,725
-Huh? -Killed?

194
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,925
But if he was killed in Tokyo,

195
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:10,025
why did you all come out to a place like this?

196
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,225
Oh, well...

197
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:14,225
Where were all of you last night?

198
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:17,125
You mean we're under suspicion?

199
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,625
No! This is just to be on the safe side.

200
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,725
I contacted the police and had them come right away

201
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,925
so I couldn't have murdered Mr. Shirai.

202
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:30,925
I was looking all night for the truck,

203
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,725
but ended up finding nothing after all.

204
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,725
-All by yourself? -Yes, sir.

205
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:39,325
I was doing some interviews until 6 pm yesterday,

206
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,725
and then returned to Tokyo.

207
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,325
I had appointments for a continuation for an interview today too,

208
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:47,125
but I'm not involved

209
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,825
because I don't even know this Mr. Shirai at all.

210
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:54,025
Did you find something?

211
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,025
Soil?

212
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,325
Yeah, that's hum.

213
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,625
Hum?

214
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,125
It's used to raise larva.

215
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,925
That's...

216
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,125
It looks like the lid of something.

217
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,725
No, no! Don't touch it!

218
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,725
What happened?

219
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:14,425
I wonder if this was here before?

220
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,725
I don't think so.

221
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,525
Mr. Shirai was transported on this truck.

222
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,025
Officer Takagi?

223
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:37,325
Yes!

224
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,425
Officer Sato?

225
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:45,225
What brings you here?

226
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,725
Well...

227
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:52,925
All of you!

228
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,025
We beat you to it.

229
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,925
I want to keep a beetle, too!

230
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:08,425
If you want one, I'll give you one.

231
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:10,625
What? Really?

232
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,725
But you've got to raise it so that it lives as long as it can.

233
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:18,525
Why do you think we're researching beetles?

234
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,225
That's because through getting to know beetles,

235
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,525
we want to relay to everyone the importance of life.

236
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,925
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:32,525
Your cell phone doesn't have a strap, does it?

238
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:36,525
Huh? What happened to your museum strap?

239
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,425
You had it hanging around your neck yesterday.

240
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,025
I gave it to a child of my acquaintance.

241
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:44,825
You mean there's a strap of the insect museum?

242
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,625
Yeah. Would you all like one, too?

243
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,225
Yes, we'd like one, for sure!

244
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,725
Well, well, what a surprise!

245
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,525
To think that a mere insect theft

246
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:00,925
may be connected to a murder case.

247
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:04,625
Just a minute! He is not a "mere" insect theft!

248
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,225
I'm sorry. My tongue sort of slipped.

249
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:10,225
Officer Sato. When was Mr. Shirai murdered?

250
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,925
The estimated time of death was between 9 pm to 10 pm.

251
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:17,525
-Right, Officer Sato? -Yes.

252
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,625
I just found out a while ago.

253
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,025
Between 9 pm to 10 pm...

254
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,925
And this morning at about 5 am,

255
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:27,225
the sound of the shutter of the pet shop being opened

256
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,525
seems to have been heard.

257
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,425
5 am? Strange.

258
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:34,325
If he was murdered between 9 pm to 10 pm,

259
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:36,025
why would such a sound be heard at that hour?

260
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:39,225
Could it be Mr. Shirai's ghost?

261
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,425
Considering his time of death,

262
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:45,425
his body temperature was greatly decreased.

263
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,325
I see. So, that's the story.

264
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:53,025
That's why the killer waited until daybreak

265
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,725
to transport the corpse that he had on him.

266
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:59,325
Which means that the killer is among the three.

267
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,646
Straps!

268
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,446
-Look, look. -See? Great, isn't it?

269
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,446
I got one, too!

270
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:11,646
Hey, hey.

271
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,846
Here! This is yours, Conan.

272
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:18,046
Thank you.

273
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:20,646
-We all have one. -Yeah.

274
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:24,446
According to my deduction,

275
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:27,846
I think that the one who killed Mr. Shirai is Mr. Haruna.

276
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,246
What?

277
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,746
Mr. Haruna. After the truck was stolen,

278
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:35,446
you said you were driving around looking for it, didn't you?

279
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:37,246
But...

280
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:40,346
Back then! You found Mr. Shirai.

281
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:42,746
You took revenge on him for stealing your beetles and...

282
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,946
Wrong! It's not Mr. Haruna!

283
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,446
Right, right!

284
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:56,746
Mr. Haruna is researching beetles to relay the importance of life,

285
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,646
so he would never do something like that!

286
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:00,246
Right!

287
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:03,546
Well...

288
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:16,946
You do know what's going on, don't you?

289
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:19,546
Just as would be expected of members of the Youth Detective Squad.

290
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,146
If so, who is the real killer?

291
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,146
What is going on with him?

292
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,346
We'll leave that aside for a while

293
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:30,646
and think about the theft first.

294
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,846
The one who stole the truck with the beetles in it

295
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,746
was Mr. Shirai, who was killed.

296
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,646
But according to what Mr. Ninomiya,

297
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,446
the one who was the first to find Mr. Shirai says,

298
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:42,346
Mr. Shirai was at his shop at 6 pm.

299
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,646
The truck was stolen at 7 pm.

300
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:47,846
Wouldn't it have been impossible for Mr. Shirai to steal it?

301
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:53,446
No. Mr. Shirai used Mr. Ninomiya to make up his alibi.

302
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,946
He told Mr. Ninomiya to call him at 6 pm,

303
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,546
then had the call transferred to his cell phone.

304
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:01,046
He then made Mr. Ninomiya hear

305
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,546
the croaking of the frog that he had in the bottle,

306
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,046
saying that it's the croaking of the frog

307
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:07,746
that he is selling at his shop or something to that effect.

308
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,346
Then, I'll see you tomorrow at 10 am.

309
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,646
That's why Mr. Ninomiya thought that

310
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:17,646
Mr. Shirai was at the shop yesterday.

311
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:21,246
Besides, he did see the frog in the shop this morning, too.

312
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:26,446
However, the one who stole the beetles was not Mr. Shirai alone.

313
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,746
What?

314
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:33,646
On the way transporting the beetles, Mr. Shirai and the other thief

315
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,246
for some reason got into an argument.

316
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,046
At that time, the killer whose cell phone strap was cut

317
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,546
strangled Mr. Shirai with that strap

318
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,346
and killed him.

319
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,546
I'm sure that the fingerprints of Mr. Shirai

320
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:55,446
are on the killer's cell phone.

321
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:58,746
If he didn't wipe them off himself, that is.

322
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,946
The killer after killing Mr. Shirai figured

323
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,346
that he would make it look as if the shop had been robbed,

324
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:08,746
and took the body to the shop at 5:00 in the morning,

325
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,146
because he heard Mr. Shirai tell Mr. Ninomiya

326
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:14,046
that he would be at the shop.

327
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,146
The killer decided to use Mr. Shirai's alibi trick

328
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:19,546
to his own advantage.

329
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:23,046
But why did he move the body at daybreak?

330
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:26,046
Where was the body for 7 to 8 hours before that?

331
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:29,446
In the truck that we just saw!

332
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:33,146
There was a lot of hum spilled all over the bed of the truck,

333
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,046
and a lot of that hum was attached to Mr. Shirai's hair.

334
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,646
Besides, the lid of the bottle that was in the victim's pocket

335
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:42,146
was found on the bed of the truck.

336
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:47,046
The bed of the truck is made so that the temperature can be adjusted.

337
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:50,546
After unloading the beetles, the killer turned on the cooler

338
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,046
and set the temperature to winter temperature.

339
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,746
Under normal conditions, the temperature of dead bodies decreases

340
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:59,046
at a rate of about one degree C an hour.

341
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,846
But if the body is left in winter temperature,

342
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:04,346
the temperature will go down faster than usual.

343
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,546
By doing so, the killer was able to make it look as if

344
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,846
the estimated time of death was as early as 6 pm.

345
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:14,646
That's why something about the temperature of the corpse was unnatural.

346
00:19:14,646 --> 00:19:17,446
Yes, then he messed the room up

347
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,846
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

348
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:23,246
If it looks as if Mr. Shirai was killed at his shop in Tokyo

349
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:27,346
and the killer gets back to Gunma by 6 pm,

350
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:31,346
he figured he would've created an alibi for himself.

351
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:35,646
But the estimated time of death between 9 pm to 10 pm

352
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:38,946
was figured out on a basis other than the body temperature.

353
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:41,146
How dare you make light of the police?

354
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:45,046
And the killer who had promised to come here today

355
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:47,946
drove the truck and abandoned it in the mountains

356
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,146
where it was found a while ago.

357
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:53,246
Which means...

358
00:19:55,346 --> 00:20:00,046
Mr. Ishida, you knew Mr. Shirai, didn't you?

359
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,546
No...

360
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:05,646
When Mr. Ninomiya came to Mr. Shirai's shop,

361
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:08,246
he seems to have used the map that was in the magazine

362
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,046
that you work as editor for to find his way.

363
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,946
Oh, another person...

364
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,146
Someone else was in charge of it.

365
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,746
The mail that you got just a while ago...

366
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:21,346
Wasn't it from one of your clients, Mr. Ishida?

367
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,746
"Sold out of males."

368
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,946
I heard that this is what you wrote in your reply.

369
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,546
I was able to read the kanji characters.

370
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,846
It was written "Sold out".

371
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:34,646
You conspired with Mr. Shirai and stole the beetles!

372
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,646
Furthermore, you killed him!

373
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:40,546
The cell phone strap.

374
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:45,946
The same one as this was also on your cell phone yesterday, wasn't it?

375
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:48,046
I'm pretty sure that it will match

376
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,946
with the traces left on Mr. Shirai's neck.

377
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:53,746
This strap!

378
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:57,346
Mr. Shirai seems to have pulled extremely hard.

379
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,946
Because the same traces of the strap

380
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:01,346
that was found on the late Mr. Shirai's neck

381
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:04,946
is also in view on the back of your neck, too.

382
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,846
Mr. Ishida.

383
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,246
That jerk!

384
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:17,246
Well, I guess you get 10% of the total this time.

385
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,746
Because you virtually did nothing.

386
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,046
What?

387
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:25,246
All you ever do is follow me from behind.

388
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:28,346
You're lucky that I even give you a share each time.

389
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:30,746
You gotta be grateful, man.

390
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:32,746
What'd you say?

391
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:36,746
All he ever did was look down on me!

392
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,246
Comfortable! Really comfortable!

393
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,546
This is the way cars should be!

394
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,546
Officer Sato.

395
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:16,446
If you're planning to date Officer Takagi,

396
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:18,946
I'd advise you not to go driving.

397
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,846
Huh?

398
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:22,946
Why do you say that?

399
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:29,846
Shoots. Nobody's riding with me.

400
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,446
Huh?

401
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,046
Why are you in here?

402
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,546
Where on earth am I headed?

403
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,546
I'm going back to Tokyo!

404
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,746
What?

405
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,946
-Hey, stop! Please let me off! -No, I can't!

406
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,946
-Let me off! -We're on the freeway!

407
00:23:46,946 --> 00:23:50,246
Huh? I wonder what's going on with Officer Takagi?

408
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:51,846
How dangerous!

409
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:53,746
I wonder what Officer Takagi's doing anyway.

410
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:56,146
Maybe he just wants attention.

411
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:58,246
Drive safely, man.

412
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,446
"Next Episode" -2 years ago is before I enrolled.

413
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:14,346
My grudge has not yet vanished.

414
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:18,346
The soil is muddy with rain.

415
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:21,446
The thing that's supposed to be here is not here.

416
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:29,546
Next Conan, "Teitan High School Ghost Story (Part 1)"

417
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,873
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,573
"Desk"

419
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,573
The next episode is a ghost story.

420
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,073
-The science room. -The mirror in the corridor.

421
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:38,773
Hanako!
