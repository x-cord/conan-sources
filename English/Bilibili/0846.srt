1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,670
I awoke

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,070
to find myself in the dark.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,070
I was on my way to go to buy

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,770
a new game software together with Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,770
when I witnessed a person in a certain office cracking a safe open.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,270
However, I was attacked

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,270
and of all things locked inside a coffin.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,970
At the same time, Pops was investigating on

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,470
the chairman of a certain industrial group who had died 3 years ago,

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,770
called Mr. Gotaro Karahashi, because the will that he had written was stolen

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,170
and Pops was asked to look for it as well as to find the perp who stole it.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,770
Just when I got to use my Detective Squad badge

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,570
and got hold of the members of the Detective Squad,

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,770
the darkness I was locked up in began to move.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,570
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,970
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,870
Trapped in the dark.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,270
There seems to be no escape.

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,270
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:55,811
"Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 2)"

23
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,411
What's the matter, Edogawa?

24
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,711
Edogawa!

25
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,411
It's a car.

26
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:03,711
This coffin is in a car.

27
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,011
I'm inside a hearse.

28
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,811
-A hearse? -A hearse?

29
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,211
Yeah.

30
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,211
I smell incense

31
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,811
and the cold air of dry ice.

32
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,911
No doubt about it.

33
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,511
I'm in a double bottom coffin

34
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,511
and above me...

35
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,211
is someone else's corpse.

36
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,311
Let's go look for him right away!

37
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,811
I'm sure we'll find it right away if it's a hearse!

38
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,011
Yes, I think so!

39
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,211
I wonder about that.

40
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,111
Nowadays,

41
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,611
there are only a few old-fashioned type hearses

42
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,811
and more of the regular sedan-type ones.

43
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,411
So, maybe it won't be all that easy to find.

44
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:45,211
I think we should contact the police after all.

45
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,411
Wait, Haibara!

46
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,911
Even to contact them, you'll need more information.

47
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:53,811
9 out of 10 the place is a funeral hall, so...

48
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:56,011
Okay. I'll check on it.

49
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:00,111
"Beika-cho Funeral Halls"

50
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,911
Let's split up and look for him.

51
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,111
If we and find a place that just finished the funeral ceremony...

52
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,311
I see!

53
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:12,111
Conan would be in the hearse that took off from there!

54
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:16,111
But if that's true, he'd be heading for...

55
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,111
Yes. The crematory.

56
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:20,211
Crematory?

57
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:22,511
Conan's going to be cremated?

58
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,711
So, we've got to rush and search for him!

59
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:36,211
No good.

60
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:37,511
This side too.

61
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,611
All of you.

62
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,511
Ran.

63
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,811
I'm sorry, can you wait here a while?

64
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,211
I was worried about all of you.

65
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,711
Where's Conan?

66
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,011
We found him!

67
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,111
Really?

68
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,811
He's in a hearse now!

69
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:59,411
A hearse?

70
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,911
"Asada Law Firm" -Oh, this is...

71
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,311
A will?

72
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,911
"Will" -What? The Sleeping Kogoro's client?

73
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:11,911
Attorney Asada is?

74
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,311
Right. Dad came here early this morning.

75
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:19,311
Could it be related to the burglary that Conan was talking about?

76
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,411
I guess so.

77
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,711
But he just called a while ago

78
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:28,311
to say that he may be attending a funeral together with Attorney Asada,

79
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:32,211
so to bring his funeral clothes over.

80
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:33,711
-A funeral? -A funeral?

81
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,711
The place is over here.

82
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,811
Right, it's this funeral hall.

83
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:40,111
What?

84
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:41,911
What's wrong, all of you?

85
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,011
Ran, hurry!

86
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,711
Hurry, please!

87
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,311
We're going without you!

88
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,511
What?

89
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:54,211
Conan is in a coffin?

90
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:56,811
The will is in there too?

91
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,811
Are you sure?

92
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:01,111
Conan said so!

93
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,811
He says it's in a small paulownia box.

94
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:06,611
"Kimihiko Asada (55), Lawyer" -That's it! No doubt about it!

95
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,211
We did it!

96
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,611
And Dad, what about the funeral?

97
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,511
It just finished a while ago.

98
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:16,411
The hearse went off to the crematory together with the family too.

99
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,211
What?

100
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,611
-We thought so! -We thought so!

101
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,911
Oh, no.

102
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:22,211
No joke.

103
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,411
-Conan. -Excuse me.

104
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:28,211
You mean, the perp disposed of the corpse as well as the will.

105
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,111
If there is no will,

106
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:35,011
the three siblings will equally divide the total inheritance.

107
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:38,211
I see, who could the perp be?

108
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,111
What's with you, Dad?

109
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,511
Conan is our first priority!

110
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,111
I know!

111
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:48,611
That hearse seems to be the only one that left here today.

112
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,611
And, I phoned the crematory

113
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,711
and was told that they should have arrived already,

114
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,311
but are still not there.

115
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:58,011
Huh? What does that mean?

116
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:00,911
Where are you now, Edogawa?

117
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,411
Where am I?

118
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,711
I wish I knew.

119
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,611
It stopped again.

120
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,911
-Again? -Yeah.

121
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:13,211
This car's been stopping and moving slowly

122
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,311
at about one minute intervals from about a while ago.

123
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,211
Maybe they're late because they're stopping by places

124
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:21,511
where the deceased had connections with.

125
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,511
"Karahashi Group"

126
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,511
From big businesses to small local factories,

127
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,911
the chairman was a popular man.

128
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,711
Places he had connections with...

129
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:33,111
You mean like the branches and business partners of the Karahashi Group?

130
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:35,911
-Yes. -Check that out immediately!

131
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,811
I'll head directly to the crematory.

132
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,311
In that case,

133
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:41,911
we can easily beat them there!

134
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,611
Hello, Inspector.

135
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,811
Conan!

136
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,711
Please may we get there in time!

137
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,011
Can't you go faster, mister?

138
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,811
"Beika Funeral Hall"

139
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:05,711
All right, we made it in time!

140
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,411
But...

141
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:10,211
something's not right.

142
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:17,811
This is Mouri.

143
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,111
This is Asada.

144
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:23,211
Just as I thought, the chairman's hearse stopped over

145
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,211
at one of the branches.

146
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,211
However, since today is a holiday,

147
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,511
traffic could be bad,

148
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:32,911
so they canceled and decided to head for the crematory.

149
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,311
What?

150
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,111
Judging from the time,

151
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,511
I think it's about time that they arrive.

152
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,311
Take a look at this.

154
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:48,011
Isn't that it?

00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,611
"Beika Funeral Hall Annex"

156
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:58,711
"Beika Funeral Hall Annex"

157
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,911
Hold it!

158
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,411
Please wait!

159
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,511
Conan!

160
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,911
-Conan! -Conan!

00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:22,311
"Kozo Karahashi (38), Eldest Son" -Cancel the cremation?

162
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,411
"Eisuke Karahashi (28), Second Son" -What on earth are you talking about?

163
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:27,111
"Mitsuyo Karahashi (32), Eldest Daughter" -He's a third-rate detective.

164
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,411
Conan is in the...

165
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:32,411
A child is trapped in the coffin!

166
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,811
You look to have an idea of what I mean.

167
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,211
Don't be ridiculous!

168
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,111
There's no such thing like that here!

169
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,611
Yeah! There'd never be something like that here!

170
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,711
Okay then, please open the coffin for us.

171
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:51,711
I was waiting for you, Inspector!

172
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:53,811
I'm from MPD First Investigation Division.

173
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:57,411
This is an emergency because this could be an abduction case.

174
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,711
Officer Takagi and Chiba!

175
00:09:58,711 --> 00:09:59,911
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

176
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,211
Just because you're with the police,

177
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,411
it doesn't give you the right to do something like this.

178
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,411
Is there any reason why you don't want to comply?

179
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,311
No. Not at all.

180
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:17,911
Conan is under this wooden board.

181
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,611
-Excuse us. -Excuse us.

183
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:30,511
He's not here!

00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,511
Rather,

185
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:37,511
this coffin is not double-bottomed.

186
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,311
What?

187
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:41,211
No way.

188
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:52,178
What is the meaning of this, Mr. Mouri?

189
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,878
Well, that can't be.

190
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:57,478
Hey, just what's going on?

191
00:10:57,478 --> 00:11:00,278
How would we know?

192
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,078
Rather, isn't this a problem?

193
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,578
I hope you're taking responsibility for this.

194
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,578
Well, we'll get to that later.

195
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:10,878
Edogawa?

196
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,178
Where are you, Edogawa?

197
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,978
Edogawa!

198
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,178
You can't get through?

199
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,578
Where'd he go?

200
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,278
Conan.

201
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,878
Haibara? Haibara!

202
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,078
Darn.

203
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,378
Where the hell is this car moving along to?

204
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:35,478
Gee, this jalopy.

205
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:38,278
I've wasted a lot of time on the road.

206
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:45,378
I see.

207
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:46,778
Which means that maybe...

208
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:53,478
Haibara, can you hear me?

209
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,378
What?

210
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:58,678
A different car, a hearse?

211
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,878
Yep. She says Conan told her so.

212
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:05,878
The car was probably parked in the basement parking of the funeral hall.

213
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:09,178
What? Where'd they go?

214
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,578
Inspector!

215
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:12,478
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

216
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:20,278
Hello, is this the funeral hall?

217
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,778
No, you don't!

218
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:26,478
Where are you going?

219
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:28,778
-Officer Chiba! -Yes, sir!

220
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:30,378
We'll have to ask you to stay here

221
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:32,278
until we get a hold of the situation.

222
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:41,278
Inspector! There was another hearse after all.

223
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:42,778
Really?

224
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,478
Something about this morning,

225
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:49,078
an old type hearse that was to be scrapped

226
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,078
seems to have been parked in the basement parking.

227
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,478
I thought so.

228
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,578
Which scrap yard?

229
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,478
It seems that the person in charge is day off today.

230
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,278
Can't you find out?

231
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:05,678
Hello, Ai?

232
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,578
Where are you headed for?

233
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,878
What?

234
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:11,478
You're going after the hearse that Conan's on?

235
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,878
What?

236
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:19,278
I see.

237
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,578
This car was to be scrapped.

238
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:26,878
We just turned right.

239
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:28,878
Then a left right away.

240
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,978
Go straight.

241
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,778
Then a left again.

242
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,678
Turn right, then left.

243
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,378
Go straight, then left again.

244
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:41,878
Got that?

245
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:44,178
We're counting on you!

246
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,678
Right, that's why all the other things that were to be scrapped

247
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:50,278
like the incense, dry ice, cardboard boxes and the paulownia box

248
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:52,778
were loaded in that car too.

249
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:57,978
You weren't locked up in the bottom of a coffin.

250
00:13:57,978 --> 00:14:01,978
What seemed to be the car stopping over and slowing down at times...

251
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:05,378
The engine not working right because the hearse was a jalopy.

252
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,878
It was only a coincidence.

253
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:12,978
And so this was what was behind this case.

254
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,378
I'm starting to get the picture of this case.

255
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:22,278
Back then, over there, there were several people.

256
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,978
I see.

257
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,478
And that was...

258
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:26,678
What?

259
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:29,978
But they have alibis.

260
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:32,078
That's probably...

261
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,678
"In use" -And in the meantime...

262
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,178
They met each other at the scene.

263
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,378
A safe cracker?

264
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:03,578
Yeah, no doubt about it.

265
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,678
It stopped.

266
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:09,978
A pedestrian crossing.

267
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,178
After leaving the funeral hall,

268
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:16,678
you go through a tunnel.

269
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:19,178
Take a right, left and another left.

270
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:21,778
Up ahead there should be a pedestrian crossing.

271
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:25,678
It's quite a distance away.

272
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:26,978
It's started moving.

273
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:33,578
It's a railroad crossing.

274
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,278
A railroad crossing?

275
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,278
Railroad crossing...

276
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,678
This one!

277
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,778
I've figured out where they're headed!

278
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,578
All right!

279
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:50,878
I can cut the rope with this!

280
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,278
It stopped again.

281
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,378
No, he turned the engine off.

282
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,278
Which means this is...

283
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,478
They're headed for the scrapyard in Kuriniji-cho!

284
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:08,678
Hurry!

285
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:12,378
Huh?

286
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:28,978
I did it!

287
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,678
Conan?

288
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,878
Where are you?

289
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,478
Over there!

290
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:50,978
Oh, no.

291
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:52,678
Conan!

292
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:56,578
Conan...

293
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,678
Stop the machine!

294
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,078
The pressing machine! Stop it!

295
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,478
Please stop the machine!

296
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:12,278
Were we too late?

297
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,478
No... No way!

298
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:19,278
No.

299
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,578
No way!

300
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:29,578
No way...

301
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:31,678
No!

302
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:36,078
No. It can't be! Conan!

303
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:37,578
Conan...

304
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,178
I'll treat you to 10 bowls of eels over rice,

305
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,678
so come back to life!

306
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:46,178
I could never eat that much.

307
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:53,878
Genta!

308
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:57,278
Conan!

309
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,278
-Conan! -Conan!

310
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,878
That was close.

311
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:21,978
Now!

312
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,678
I've got to do it, now!

313
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:36,478
Where's the will?

314
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:39,978
Don't tell me it was scrapped together with the hearse?

315
00:18:39,978 --> 00:18:42,078
-Oh, no! -Where's Conan?

316
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:50,978
Hore-ara-hire. What happened to the will?

317
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,478
The will was found?

318
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:57,078
Really?

319
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:58,478
Wait.

320
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:04,678
The Sleeping Kogoro?

321
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,078
-Conan! -Yes!

322
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,078
-Here you go! -Thank you.

323
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:21,178
This is the will.

324
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:25,178
The newest one that the chairman rewrote.

325
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,378
Well, well.

326
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,978
How disappointing it is, Eisuke?

327
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,478
What?

328
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,478
You stepped on gum, didn't you?

329
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,078
Gum?

330
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,278
The smell of it

331
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:46,278
and stickiness is all over my phone, you see.

332
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:52,678
That's...

333
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:55,478
Kozo and Mitsuyo,

334
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,078
you two were there too.

335
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:03,678
You counted on us to assume that siblings who hated each other

336
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:07,378
wouldn't verify each other's alibis.

337
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:10,378
That's a pretty classic trick.

338
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,278
Where's the proof?

339
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,478
Right. Where's the proof?

340
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,878
Inspector.

341
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:21,178
Please check for fingerprints on the will.

342
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,678
If my deduction is correct,

343
00:20:23,678 --> 00:20:26,778
besides the fingerprints of the deceased, Mr. Asada and Conan,

344
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:29,878
the fingerprints of the three in question should also be detected.

345
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,378
Is that true?

346
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:39,478
Since they planned to get rid of the will or rewrite it anyway,

347
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,578
they touched it with their bare hands.

348
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:46,378
Because they wanted to confirm the contents as soon as possible,

349
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,878
Isn't that right?

350
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:51,478
It's most likely that

351
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:53,078
the three of you colluded on the condition

352
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:56,178
that the fortune be divided equally among you

353
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:59,278
or be rewritten in your favor.

354
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:02,478
You hid the will in an unused hearse together with Conan

355
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:06,278
who you eventually planned to release.

356
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:11,078
But the thing was, you didn't know it was going to be scrapped today.

357
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,578
It's all Dad's fault!

358
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,578
He's got to be kidding.

359
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:22,078
To want to give his entire assets over to his secretary.

360
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,578
Rather, his lover!

361
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,978
How can you forgive something like that?

362
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,778
You mean...

363
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:36,678
you dare risk the life of a child, of Conan just for something like that?

364
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:43,078
You're the ones who can't be forgiven!

365
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,278
Ran...

366
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:21,778
Pops was informed by Attorney Asada later that the inheritance

367
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:25,078
was handed over to the woman secretary,

368
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:28,078
but she donated it entirely to a charity organization.

369
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:31,378
It must've been tough

370
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:34,478
being locked up in a dark, cramped place like that.

371
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,878
Can you go to the restroom alone at night?

372
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:40,478
Would you like me to go with you?

373
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:43,878
I can handle it, Ran!

374
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:46,178
Come on, you don't be shy.

375
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:48,078
You can lay your head on my shoulder.

376
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,878
You got to be kidding?

377
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:53,078
I'm in high school, you know.

378
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:57,478
"Next Episode" -Are you asking me to search for an alien?

379
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,278
Yes! I definitely saw it with my own eyes.

380
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,778
An Unidentified Flying Object.

381
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,278
UFO?

382
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,478
This place is off limits!

383
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:08,878
Mr. Mouri?

384
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:12,478
And? What is that man saying?

385
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:15,378
That an alien who came down from the UFO

386
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:19,078
killed Mr. Nakatsu while afloat in the air.

387
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,478
Next Conan,

388
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:24,378
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 1)"

389
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,121
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,421
"Concrete"

391
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,721
Officer Chiba's the star of the next episode.

392
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,021
-The chubby Officer Chiba? -What?
