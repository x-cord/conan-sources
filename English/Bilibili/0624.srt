1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.740
A project to protect children from crime?

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.840
Yes. Because recently

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.440
cases of children being kidnapped in the city are on the rise.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.440
But...

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440
Why would you, Inspector Shiratori of the Metropolitan Police Department

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.840
come all this way?

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.040
Well...

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.840
I just happened to be in the neighbourhood investigating a case,

9
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.140
so I thought while I was at it, I may as well...

10
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.540
You suddenly had this urge to want to see Ms. Kobayashi too, didn't you?

11
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.040
Officer Chiba...

12
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.740
I just met him this morning when I handed him his lunch.

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.440
By the way, why'd you come with me?

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.940
Why not?

15
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.740
I'm a graduate of this school.

16
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.940
What? I'm also a graduate of this school,

17
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.340
but what year class were you?

18
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.740
I think I was here in the 20th year...

19
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.340
Then, you're two years younger than me.

20
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.140
Then, do you remember?

21
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.840
The cooking teacher, Skeleton Kunigami.

22
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.940
Yes. He's still here and the children fear him

23
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.640
calling him "Death" Teacher.

24
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Come on. Shall we head back then?

25
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.740
But...

26
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.540
It's been a long time since I came here,

27
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.640
so would it be okay for me to take a walk

28
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.840
around the school building?

29
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.340
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

30
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.540
you must be true to yourself.

31
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.140
An elementary school classmate.

32
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.540
Where will Officer Chiba's first love go?

33
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

36
00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:09.415
"Video Letter of First Love"

37
00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:10.715
"Year 1, Class B"

38
00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:11.815
What?

39
00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.015
Look for a crime prevention video?

40
00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:15.115
Yes.

41
00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:18.615
During lunch time the police brought me this leaflet.

42
00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.315
So for tomorrow's ethics class,

43
00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:22.215
I'm planning to show a crime prevention video

44
00:03:22.215 --> 00:03:23.715
in the audio visual room.

45
00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:26.715
But, why do we have to look for that video?

46
00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:28.915
If you know that it's in the warehouse of the audio room

47
00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:30.815
why not go look for it yourself?

48
00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.015
Well, you see...

49
00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:35.215
I have a teacher's meeting I have to go to right now.

50
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.415
Come to think of it,

51
00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.715
we never saw the video of our chorus contest

52
00:03:38.715 --> 00:03:41.015
before either, did we?

53
00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:42.915
In other words,

54
00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:46.015
you're not good at looking for things.

55
00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:47.415
Exactly.

56
00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:52.215
Because the number of video tapes in the warehouse is countless.

57
00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:54.915
The words on the labels are practically faded too.

58
00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:58.015
Many of the labels have been stuck on one on top of the other,

59
00:03:58.015 --> 00:03:59.915
so it's hard to tell which is which.

60
00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:02.315
So, she wants you,

61
00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:06.615
who are good at looking for things find it for her, right?

62
00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:07.815
I guess so.

63
00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.415
"Audio Visual Room"

64
00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:14.315
Talk about a lot...

65
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:18.015
Just like teacher said the words are almost faded

66
00:04:18.015 --> 00:04:20.915
and there are labels pasted one on top of the other.

67
00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:23.615
They're not organized by year,

68
00:04:23.615 --> 00:04:25.615
so it's going to be really tough looking for it.

69
00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.615
Let's forget about it, already.

70
00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:31.215
We, The Youth Detective Squad members are cautious,

71
00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:34.315
so we'll be fine not watching a crime prevention video.

72
00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.815
It's not bad to be on your guard.

73
00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:39.015
No matter how careful you try to be,

74
00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:40.915
a guy that you don't know at all

75
00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:42.815
who is after your life may secretly

76
00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.815
be sitting right next to you.

77
00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:48.415
Are you talking about Subaru or what?

78
00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:49.515
If you don't like him so much,

79
00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.315
maybe you should sleep over at the detective agency?

80
00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:54.015
No way.

81
00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:57.715
But, how are we going to look for the video?

82
00:04:57.715 --> 00:05:00.915
If we play all the videos and check the contents,

83
00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:03.315
I guess we'll eventually find it...

84
00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:05.715
What? You mean everything here?

85
00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:07.615
We don't have to do that.

86
00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.815
Since teacher asked us to do it,

87
00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:13.315
it means that she came to check it once,

88
00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:15.415
but couldn't find it.

89
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.715
Although the words on the label are almost faded,

90
00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:19.315
they are still legible.

91
00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:21.715
It's also unthinkable that anyone would stick another label

92
00:05:21.715 --> 00:05:23.415
onto the label of a video that is considered

93
00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:25.515
important enough to one day use in class.

94
00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.815
Then, why can't it be found?

95
00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:30.115
In other words, that video is not a VHS type

96
00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:32.715
that is lined out on the shelf

97
00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:35.715
but one that is put away somewhere.

98
00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:39.315
That is, it is most probably a BETA video tape.

99
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.915
See, found it. A crime prevention video.

100
00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:46.915
The school chorus contest video is also here.

101
00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:48.215
I see.

102
00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:50.815
Ms. Kobayashi's homeroom teacher

103
00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.115
used to use BETA videos.

104
00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:55.215
What's this BETA thing about?

105
00:05:55.215 --> 00:05:58.715
I heard that in the past there were VHS and BETA video tapes,

106
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:02.215
but BETA lost and disappeared from the market.

107
00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:04.815
But, why did BETA lose?

108
00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:05.915
Beats me...

109
00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:07.515
maybe it wasn't as good performance wise?

110
00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:09.715
-Not really. -What?

111
00:06:09.715 --> 00:06:13.915
Back then BETA had better image as well as sound than VHS.

112
00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.915
The size of the cassette was also smaller

113
00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:18.515
and was really popular among the video freaks.

114
00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:19.915
Officer Chiba?

115
00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:23.515
Well, but the recording time was shorter than VHS,

116
00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:26.215
so it lost in sales strategy I guess you could say.

117
00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:29.015
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.215
I brought along a crime prevention project leaflet

119
00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.515
and while I was at it

120
00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:35.115
I thought that I'd browse around the school building.

121
00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:39.115
I felt nostalgic because I'm a graduate of this school.

122
00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:42.115
But, that doesn't explain why you were hiding here

123
00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:43.915
in the audio visual room, does it?

124
00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:47.015
Well, actually...

125
00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:48.215
What?

126
00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:50.115
You were looking for the answer

127
00:06:50.115 --> 00:06:52.415
to a love letter you wrote 13 years ago?

128
00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:53.515
Really?

129
00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:56.715
Yeah. I was in the broadcast club.

130
00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:59.115
One day, we broadcast a mini drama

131
00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:00.715
that we recorded during lunch recess,

132
00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:02.415
and it really caught on.

133
00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:04.615
So, I suggested whether it's turned down or not,

134
00:07:04.615 --> 00:07:07.915
next time we should record an actual take of a drama

135
00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:10.415
and play it at the school drama club.

136
00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:12.815
Then a girl classmate of the broadcast club was all for it

137
00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.415
and all the other members also started to agree with her.

138
00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:20.715
As a result, the special SFX drama was somehow completed.

139
00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:23.815
So, I took it that she was also a SFX fan

140
00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:25.815
and talked a lot about the subject with her,

141
00:07:25.815 --> 00:07:27.915
but she didn't seem interested at all.

142
00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.815
I asked her, "Do you really like SFX?"

143
00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:35.815
What I like is not SFX but...

144
00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:40.815
Don't make me say it, stupid.

145
00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:43.815
She answered with blushed cheeks.

146
00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:47.015
So, the next day, I impulsively wrote her a love letter.

147
00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:49.715
But, maybe I just mistakenly thought so after all?

148
00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:51.915
No, I think she really had feelings for you.

149
00:07:51.915 --> 00:07:53.615
That's right.

150
00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:56.215
She also liked you, Officer Chiba.

151
00:07:56.215 --> 00:07:58.215
Really?

152
00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:01.315
And? Why is the answer to that love letter

153
00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:04.115
in the warehouse of this audio room?

154
00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:07.215
Did you lose the answer for the love letter you received from her in here?

155
00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:09.215
No...

156
00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:13.015
She did send me her answer in the mail soon afterwards,

157
00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.715
so I have it with me even now.

158
00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:16.915
You mean she didn't give it directly to you?

159
00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:19.815
She had to change schools all of a sudden,

160
00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.015
and I gave her my love letter

161
00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:22.915
on the day of her farewell party, that's why...

162
00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:25.915
She sent you the answer from the place she moved to.

163
00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:30.215
But, wasn't her answer written in that letter?

164
00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.515
I thought so too

165
00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:34.915
and my heart was pounding while I was reading it, but...

166
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.115
In the letter it said that

167
00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:39.215
"It would be easy to write how I feel in this letter,

168
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:41.615
but it may not really hit you so...

169
00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:45.915
I will save it once in the warehouse of the audio visual room.

170
00:08:45.915 --> 00:08:51.815
So that my feelings are carved onto your heart," she wrote.

171
00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.315
I see.

172
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:57.115
She hid that video somewhere in this warehouse

173
00:08:57.115 --> 00:08:59.315
where only you would probably look, right?

174
00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:00.315
Yeah.

175
00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:02.515
After reading her letter I came here right away

176
00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:04.315
and looked in every nook and cranny

177
00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:07.215
but didn't find anything that looked like a letter.

178
00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:09.915
Have you seen her since then?

179
00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:12.615
I haven't seen her even once in 13 years.

180
00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:15.615
She didn't come to the class reunion either.

181
00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:19.115
Then, why are you looking for something like that now?

182
00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:21.815
I got a call from her saying,

183
00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:25.715
"I'm going to the class reunion next week but are you coming?"

184
00:09:25.715 --> 00:09:28.515
I answered that I'm planning to go, then she asked me...

185
00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:31.715
"Since it was so long ago, you may not remember,

186
00:09:31.715 --> 00:09:35.115
but did you see the video with my answer?"

187
00:09:35.115 --> 00:09:36.415
Video?

188
00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:38.915
And? What did you answer?

189
00:09:38.915 --> 00:09:41.315
I answered that I didn't see it.

190
00:09:41.315 --> 00:09:45.215
Then, she mumbled, "Oh..." and hung up.

191
00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:47.415
Officer Chiba, how cruel of you.

192
00:09:47.415 --> 00:09:49.115
I couldn't help it, could I?

193
00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:50.715
Because I really didn't see it.

194
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.415
But, please wait.

195
00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:55.415
If she said video...

196
00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:57.015
She may have made a video letter

197
00:09:57.015 --> 00:10:01.515
and dubbed it onto one of the videos and left it for you?

198
00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:05.315
Yeah, I thought so too, so I came here.

199
00:10:05.315 --> 00:10:08.515
I didn't check the contents of the video back then either.

200
00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:12.115
And? Did you find it, that video letter?

201
00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:15.515
No. I tried looking through the videos that look to be it.

202
00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.515
I would pick up by fast forwarding it but...

203
00:10:17.515 --> 00:10:20.015
There're so many of them.

204
00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:23.515
And you all happened to walk in while I was doing this.

205
00:10:23.515 --> 00:10:25.715
Then, let's look for it together.

206
00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:29.915
But, it's a tough job going through all those videos.

207
00:10:29.915 --> 00:10:33.115
There's no need to look through them from beginning to end.

208
00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:35.715
If I were to make such a video letter,

209
00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:39.215
I would put it at the end of an originally recorded film,

210
00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.315
so it would be hard to find.

211
00:10:41.315 --> 00:10:45.915
I see! All we have to do is check the end of the video tapes.

212
00:10:53.015 --> 00:10:55.715
This is really exhausting.

213
00:10:55.715 --> 00:10:57.715
Not this one either.

214
00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.915
How many more are there?

215
00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:01.215
That's the last one.

216
00:11:01.215 --> 00:11:02.515
What?

217
00:11:02.515 --> 00:11:06.515
We didn't see the SFX drama that you made, did we?

218
00:11:07.515 --> 00:11:10.615
Mr. Kunigami took that video away from me.

219
00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:12.415
No way.

220
00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:16.715
Come to think of it, the advisor for the broadcast club was Mr. Kunigami.

221
00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:21.415
But, that's not a problem.

222
00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:25.115
But that SFX drama is carved deeply

223
00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:28.815
in my head as my memory with her.

224
00:11:28.815 --> 00:11:30.115
You see!

225
00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:33.615
Well, I've been thinking about it but...

226
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:36.315
Why were you opening the lid of the video tapes?

227
00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:38.915
This is a habit of mine.

228
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:42.815
My older brother used to part-time at a rental video shop

229
00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:45.915
and was told to check if the tape

230
00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:50.115
was rewound to the beginning by opening here.

231
00:11:50.115 --> 00:11:52.415
This became a habit of his

232
00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:54.315
and he used to open the lid of the video tapes at home

233
00:11:54.315 --> 00:11:55.715
after watching them too.

234
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.115
I thought it looked awesome, so I copied him,

235
00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:01.415
and before I knew it that became a habit of mine too.

236
00:12:01.415 --> 00:12:03.815
Since when did acquire that habit?

237
00:12:03.815 --> 00:12:06.715
From when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade of elementary school, I think?

238
00:12:06.715 --> 00:12:09.015
When did you take that SFX drama?

239
00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:11.215
Summer of 6th grade.

240
00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:14.515
After that she suddenly moved away.

241
00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:20.315
Ai, get me a writing brush and water in a cup!

242
00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:23.215
You guys pull out videos with labels

243
00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:24.615
that are stuck one on top of the other.

244
00:12:24.615 --> 00:12:25.915
What?

245
00:12:25.915 --> 00:12:30.415
Mr. Kunigami was known from before for being mean and stingy from before.

246
00:12:30.415 --> 00:12:32.015
So, I'm sure that he taped over the tapes

247
00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:35.315
that he confiscated right away and erased the original.

248
00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:39.215
Known from before? How do you know?

249
00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:41.515
You're only in 1st grade.

250
00:12:41.515 --> 00:12:44.215
Well, never mind that.

251
00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:52.615
There are quite a lot, aren't they?

252
00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.915
Are you going to check the contents of these again?

253
00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:56.415
No.

254
00:12:56.415 --> 00:13:00.415
If you run the writing brush dampened with water like this.

255
00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:04.315
The words of the label that is pasted below emerges.

256
00:13:04.315 --> 00:13:08.915
Bull's eye. This is the video you made, Officer Chiba.

257
00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:11.215
But Masked Baiya?

258
00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:13.515
This is just a copy of Masked Yaiba.

259
00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:17.015
But, the video letter is in here, right?

260
00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:20.915
No, if that girl knew of Officer Chiba's

261
00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:22.915
habit of opening the video tape,

262
00:13:22.915 --> 00:13:25.415
I'm sure that the message will be exposed

263
00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:27.915
when he opens here...

264
00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:31.815
Nothing's written?

265
00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:33.415
No joke?

266
00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:42.362
What's up, Conan? Nothing's written.

267
00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:44.162
Strange.

268
00:13:44.162 --> 00:13:47.762
I was almost really sure that the message would be written here.

269
00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:51.262
I'm sure that the video letter is in this tape.

270
00:13:51.262 --> 00:13:54.762
Yes. Let's try and play it.

271
00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:00.062
There was nothing in it.

272
00:14:00.062 --> 00:14:03.962
Maybe it was erased when something was taped over it.

273
00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:05.862
I don't think so.

274
00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:09.062
A little bit of the scene of the drama was left

275
00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:10.662
even after the tape over,

276
00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:13.662
nothing seemed to be inside after it.

277
00:14:13.662 --> 00:14:16.762
Come to think of it, she appeared a little bit

278
00:14:16.762 --> 00:14:19.162
during the final scene of the drama.

279
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:25.562
See, it's this girl!

280
00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:28.162
Thank you, Masked Baiya!

281
00:14:28.162 --> 00:14:31.162
Cute!

282
00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.962
She is, isn't she? Her name was Naeko Miike

283
00:14:33.962 --> 00:14:36.562
and she was really popular among the boys in class.

284
00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:37.762
But...

285
00:14:37.762 --> 00:14:38.762
Nothing...

286
00:14:38.762 --> 00:14:41.262
To think that a girl who looks like an idol like this

287
00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:43.562
would fall in love you, Officer Chiba.

288
00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:44.662
Hey, hey...

289
00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:46.862
Did she really like you?

290
00:14:46.862 --> 00:14:48.462
Do you have any recollection

291
00:14:48.462 --> 00:14:50.762
of having done something to make her like you?

292
00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:54.662
The thing is, I have no such recollection.

293
00:14:54.662 --> 00:14:57.662
I did make her cry just once though.

294
00:14:57.662 --> 00:14:58.862
Were you mean to her?

295
00:14:58.862 --> 00:15:00.062
How dare you!

296
00:15:00.062 --> 00:15:02.462
No, I wasn't mean or anything,

297
00:15:02.462 --> 00:15:04.062
she just suddenly started crying.

298
00:15:04.062 --> 00:15:05.662
If I remember correctly,

299
00:15:05.662 --> 00:15:07.062
we went home a bit late

300
00:15:07.062 --> 00:15:09.562
because of things that we had to do at the broadcast club.

301
00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:12.462
When we got to the crosswalk, she suddenly started to cry.

302
00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:17.862
You dumb-dumb! I hate you!

303
00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:20.562
After saying so, she ran home.

304
00:15:20.562 --> 00:15:23.962
It seems that she wanted to go home early that day.

305
00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:25.662
Then maybe she wanted you to stop her with force.

306
00:15:25.662 --> 00:15:27.862
And, kiss her or something?

307
00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:28.962
What?

308
00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:31.662
I would never do anything like that.

309
00:15:31.662 --> 00:15:34.462
If so, you must've said something to her.

310
00:15:34.462 --> 00:15:37.262
Don't you remember what you said back then?

311
00:15:37.262 --> 00:15:40.562
Back then...

312
00:15:40.562 --> 00:15:43.962
I chased her and fell

313
00:15:43.962 --> 00:15:47.562
and deeply cut the palm of my hand.

314
00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:51.362
I see. And she treated your wound for you.

315
00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:52.562
No.

316
00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:55.462
She ran off not knowing that I fell.

317
00:15:55.462 --> 00:15:56.762
Is that so?

318
00:15:56.762 --> 00:15:58.262
But...

319
00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:00.062
the cut that I got back then

320
00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:03.162
is still left like a carving here on the palm of my hand.

321
00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.362
Carved?

322
00:16:05.362 --> 00:16:07.662
Come to think of it, he mentioned that

323
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:10.262
it was also written in her letter.

324
00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:14.762
"So that my feelings are carved onto your heart,"

325
00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:16.562
Directly carve on means...

326
00:16:16.562 --> 00:16:18.362
Somewhere on the body.

327
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.162
I see... That's what it was!

328
00:16:27.562 --> 00:16:29.362
Conan, did you figure out?

329
00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:30.962
You figured it out, didn't you?

330
00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:32.762
Yeah, I figured out that...

331
00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:35.362
Officer Chiba used to...

332
00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.762
sweat a lot since he was a child!

333
00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:38.762
What?

334
00:16:38.762 --> 00:16:41.662
It's true that I sweat a lot.

335
00:16:41.662 --> 00:16:43.262
Although I wasn't as bad Genta,

336
00:16:43.262 --> 00:16:45.562
I was pretty hefty.

337
00:16:45.562 --> 00:16:48.462
What's that got to do with anything?

338
00:16:48.462 --> 00:16:50.362
When you open this lid,

339
00:16:50.362 --> 00:16:53.962
you place your hand on this side video, right?

340
00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:57.862
That's where she wrote the message with a water-based pen.

341
00:16:57.862 --> 00:16:59.162
She did so, because that way,

342
00:16:59.162 --> 00:17:01.962
the words would rub off

343
00:17:01.962 --> 00:17:03.762
on the sweaty hands of Officer Chiba.

344
00:17:03.762 --> 00:17:05.562
Moreover, she wrote it in mirrored words

345
00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:07.462
that you would be able to read it too.

346
00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:10.462
See. On my hands that I used to open the lid,

347
00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:13.462
there's red ink, isn't there? That's the proof.

348
00:17:13.462 --> 00:17:14.862
I see.

349
00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:17.662
Even if you write on the black side of the tape with red ink,

350
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.962
it would not be visible.

351
00:17:18.962 --> 00:17:20.762
On top of that, it's written in a place that no one else would touch,

352
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:23.362
so she didn't have to worry about anybody else seeing it too.

353
00:17:23.362 --> 00:17:26.862
But, it's already been 13 years, so I wonder if it's still legible?

354
00:17:26.862 --> 00:17:30.362
Don't worry. You rip the paper up like this

355
00:17:30.362 --> 00:17:32.462
and wet it with water.

356
00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:35.362
You paste it on like so on the side of the video,

357
00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:37.262
then peel it off.

358
00:17:37.262 --> 00:17:41.062
The message put here 13 years ago is revived.

359
00:17:41.062 --> 00:17:43.162
"I like you too"

360
00:17:46.762 --> 00:17:49.362
I like you too, is written here!

361
00:17:49.362 --> 00:17:51.162
You both liked each other!

362
00:17:51.162 --> 00:17:52.662
Amazing!

363
00:17:52.662 --> 00:17:55.162
When's the reunion that she's coming to?

364
00:17:55.162 --> 00:17:57.362
Tonight.

365
00:17:57.362 --> 00:17:59.762
Then, maybe you should go?

366
00:17:59.762 --> 00:18:03.262
But, I wonder about telling her at this point that I got her message.

367
00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:06.062
No! You should go!

368
00:18:06.062 --> 00:18:09.862
Her feelings finally reached you after 13 years, you know?

369
00:18:09.862 --> 00:18:12.362
Of course she'd be happy.

370
00:18:12.362 --> 00:18:14.362
Ms. Kobayashi?

371
00:18:14.362 --> 00:18:17.662
I'm sorry. I overheard you.

372
00:18:22.862 --> 00:18:26.562
What I like is not SFX but...

373
00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:29.662
Don't make me say it, stupid!

374
00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:34.362
What? Ms. Miike's not here?

375
00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:36.862
No, she says she came up with an urgent matter.

376
00:18:36.862 --> 00:18:40.362
She seemed really happy saying that she finally got together

377
00:18:40.362 --> 00:18:42.662
with the one she really cared for after hoping for so long.

378
00:18:42.662 --> 00:18:44.362
She got together?

379
00:18:44.362 --> 00:18:47.362
I wonder. Maybe she got married or something?

380
00:18:55.362 --> 00:18:57.962
What should I tell the children?

381
00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:04.562
No way, a parking violation.

382
00:19:04.562 --> 00:19:05.862
I was planning to come back

383
00:19:05.862 --> 00:19:07.662
and re-park the car as soon as I saw her.

384
00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:10.362
But, I was plodding along from shock.

385
00:19:10.362 --> 00:19:12.262
Excuse me...

386
00:19:12.262 --> 00:19:16.162
Don't worry about it, I haven't sent the data yet.

387
00:19:16.162 --> 00:19:18.062
You left the engine on so you

388
00:19:18.062 --> 00:19:20.162
were planning to come back right away, weren't you?

389
00:19:20.162 --> 00:19:21.462
Yes...

390
00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.062
Besides, being a police detective

391
00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:25.462
there are times you may have to inevitably park, so...

392
00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:26.962
No.

393
00:19:26.962 --> 00:19:28.462
No matter if you're an officer or not,

394
00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:30.062
a parking violation is a violation.

395
00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:31.962
You've got to do your job.

396
00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:37.562
Well, it's not like I came for an investigation or anything besides.

397
00:19:37.562 --> 00:19:40.262
Then, I'll go pay for the violation

398
00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.762
so will you give me the violation ticket?

399
00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:44.062
Yes, sir.

400
00:19:48.262 --> 00:19:50.562
I tried to act cool,

401
00:19:50.562 --> 00:19:54.162
but the charge for violation 15,000 yen sure isn't cheap.

402
00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:58.362
But, I wonder how she knew I was a police detective?

403
00:19:58.362 --> 00:19:59.662
What's the matter?

404
00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:01.062
Did that guy who got the parking violation

405
00:20:01.062 --> 00:20:02.762
give you trouble or something?

406
00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:04.462
No...

407
00:20:04.462 --> 00:20:06.562
By the way, is it really okay?

408
00:20:06.562 --> 00:20:08.362
Not attending the reunion?

409
00:20:08.362 --> 00:20:09.462
Yes.

410
00:20:09.462 --> 00:20:12.562
I haven't gone to the reunion for some time now,

411
00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:15.862
so I think I'd feel uncomfortable even if I went anyway.

412
00:20:15.862 --> 00:20:17.062
And...

413
00:20:17.062 --> 00:20:20.862
I got to see the person that I really wanted see too.

414
00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:26.262
Well, it seems that he had forgotten all about me though.

415
00:20:26.262 --> 00:20:28.062
Are you talking about...

416
00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:29.462
the childhood friend of yours that is a police detective

417
00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:31.962
at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department?

418
00:20:31.962 --> 00:20:33.062
Yes.

419
00:20:33.062 --> 00:20:34.362
I'm going to be transferred to the

420
00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:36.862
headquarters of the Police Department soon,

421
00:20:36.862 --> 00:20:39.062
so I'll be able to work with him.

422
00:20:39.062 --> 00:20:41.862
I was planning to tell him how I felt at that time,

423
00:20:41.862 --> 00:20:43.962
if I met him and he remembered me but...

424
00:20:43.962 --> 00:20:46.562
I guess life just doesn't work out that way.

425
00:20:46.562 --> 00:20:50.062
Gosh, to forget a great lady like you.

426
00:20:50.062 --> 00:20:53.562
He's probably not worth anything, forget him.

427
00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.962
It's not that he's not worth it.

428
00:20:55.962 --> 00:20:58.762
He's as cute and childish looking as ever.

429
00:21:00.062 --> 00:21:01.262
Besides...

430
00:21:01.262 --> 00:21:03.962
I was the youngest child in the family

431
00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.762
and was really pampered by my parents and was never scolded.

432
00:21:06.762 --> 00:21:09.262
But, back then he...

433
00:21:09.262 --> 00:21:11.362
I'll go home ahead of you.

434
00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:13.562
Because I have a TV program I want to watch.

435
00:21:13.562 --> 00:21:15.362
Don't cross now.

436
00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:18.562
The traffic light's red.

437
00:21:18.562 --> 00:21:24.262
Who cares? There are no cars and nobody's watching.

438
00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:28.662
I'm watching. And you're watching too.

439
00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:31.262
If you pamper yourself and break a rule,

440
00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:33.262
it can turn out to be a habit.

441
00:21:33.262 --> 00:21:34.762
A habit is something you can't break

442
00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:36.262
even if you want to, you know?

443
00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:38.762
You mean you don't even know something like that?

444
00:21:47.962 --> 00:21:51.962
Really... he hasn't changed a bit, Mr. Chiba.

445
00:23:12.562 --> 00:23:14.262
What?

446
00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:15.562
You were brushed off?

447
00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:18.962
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

448
00:23:18.962 --> 00:23:20.162
No joke.

449
00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:22.962
I guess she was too high on the pedestal after all.

450
00:23:22.962 --> 00:23:25.562
-Hey... -What're you doing?

451
00:23:25.562 --> 00:23:27.762
We'll resume investigations.

452
00:23:27.762 --> 00:23:29.462
Yes, sir.

453
00:23:29.462 --> 00:23:31.562
This is a secret, all right?

454
00:23:31.562 --> 00:23:33.062
Okay...

455
00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:36.062
That's good to hear.

456
00:23:36.062 --> 00:23:37.662
I'm going to tell Miwako about it.

457
00:23:37.662 --> 00:23:38.962
About that...

458
00:23:38.962 --> 00:23:41.262
If he was brushed off,

459
00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:43.162
that means he's not taken anymore, right?

460
00:23:43.162 --> 00:23:45.562
Yes... well, sort of...

461
00:23:45.562 --> 00:23:48.962
What's your name?

462
00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:51.362
I'm Naeko Miike,

463
00:23:51.362 --> 00:23:53.762
who was transferred from the Haido Station.

464
00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:55.062
Nice to meet you.

465
00:23:58.862 --> 00:24:00.662
Go inside this haunted mansion

466
00:24:00.662 --> 00:24:03.362
and check out how well the zombies are made?

467
00:24:03.362 --> 00:24:06.962
Ran, you can't tell Shinichi that you like him,

468
00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:08.162
the way you are.

469
00:24:15.062 --> 00:24:16.862
I'll take Anna to the hospital...

470
00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:18.562
Don't touch her!

471
00:24:18.562 --> 00:24:21.262
She could've drunk potassium cyanide poison!

472
00:24:21.262 --> 00:24:23.062
Poison?

473
00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:28.425
Next Conan, "Screaming Operating Room (Part 1)"

474
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:31.331
Next Conan's Hint:

475
00:24:31.331 --> 00:24:33.631
"Scratch Wound".

476
00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:35.031
What's with that wound?

477
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:36.731
A cat in the neighbourhood meowed at me and...

478
00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:38.310
-I wonder about that. -Well, it's true.
