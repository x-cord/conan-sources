1
00:00:01.322 --> 00:00:05.490
We, the members of the Detective Squad head for the Teimuzu River,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.505
in hopes of winning an award at the kite-flying contest.

3
00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.221
The song that Ai's listening to?

4
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:17.741
Yep. She sometimes hums the tune looking happy.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.073
Maybe it's an anime song or something?

6
00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:25.665
It sounded like Yoko Okino's new song.

7
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:28.912
Why don't you just ask her?

8
00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:33.942
Of course, I did, but she said, "It's a secret".

9
00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.439
Nothing to be concerned about.

10
00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.224
It's probably some dumb song that's popular now.

11
00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.152
Well, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:44.623
It's some dumb song that's popular now.

13
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.488
Haibara...

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.146
Why don't you stop keeping them in suspense and tell them already.

15
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.440
I want to know too.

16
00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:00.402
No way. Absolutely not.

17
00:01:02.498 --> 00:01:05.935
No. There's still a way.

18
00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:11.328
We'll just wiretap.

19
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.705
After this and that's the kite-flying contest begins.

20
00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.357
They, the man on the team next to us falls into the Teimuzu River.

21
00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:21.254
"Renno Ryota (39), Participant"

22
00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:26.429
-An accident? -Dear?

23
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:29.832
What's up, Dear? Dear?

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.561
Hey, answer me! Dear?

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:34.966
No, this is...

26
00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:37.276
not an accident.

27
00:01:42.187 --> 00:01:44.198
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

28
00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:45.903
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

29
00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:49.703
Even kites are connected by a string. How about human relationships?

30
00:01:49.823 --> 00:01:51.504
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:53.224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:55.624
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:42.375
"Teimuzu River Kite-Flying Case (Part 2)"

34
00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:47.106
What?

35
00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.950
You're saying that I lured Renno to where the rope was cut

36
00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:51.494
and made him fall into the river?

37
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.682
You gotta be joking!

38
00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:57.294
I'm the one who warned him not to go too far, you know.

39
00:03:57.414 --> 00:03:59.583
You boys were watching too, weren't you?

40
00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:04.522
Yeah. He was shouting just before that man fell into the river.

41
00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:06.766
Hey, what're you doing?

42
00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:09.182
If you move back any farther...

43
00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:13.259
He looked to be really worried.

44
00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:17.967
But, we're not sure whether Mr. Renno heard him or not.

45
00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:24.050
Others were shouting out loud, giving instructions to their teammates too.

46
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.232
Because we were some distance away.

47
00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:29.152
-Is that so? -Yes.

48
00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:32.652
I thought he could hear to some extent, though.

49
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:37.027
But after that, I walked backwards and pulled away from him.

50
00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:40.170
But even if your voice couldn't be heard,

51
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:44.175
you could've gestured and given instructions to Mr. Renno.

52
00:04:44.312 --> 00:04:46.812
No, I didn't do such a thing.

53
00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.662
If you think I'm lying,

54
00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:51.448
go take a look at the video that the event administrator took

55
00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:54.313
to prevent cheating.

56
00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:58.242
But, why did you have to stand so far apart?

57
00:04:58.362 --> 00:05:02.273
That's because by watching how the kites were flying,

58
00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:05.397
I could see that the wind was stronger higher up.

59
00:05:05.517 --> 00:05:09.734
I thought I could send our kite shooting up by standing far apart.

60
00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:13.251
Each team had a limited amount of time to fly their kite,

61
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:15.722
so we had to get it in one try.

62
00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:16.992
I see.

63
00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:20.358
By the way, what is your relationship with Mr. Renno?

64
00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:24.923
I work at the cafe that Mr. Renno manages.

65
00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:26.645
So today

66
00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:30.955
we came to win the class award by using our kite with our cafe logo on it.

67
00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:33.549
The winners' kite will be displayed in the city hall

68
00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.689
and that would be a great advertisement.

69
00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.389
We can act big when we attend the community meetings too.

70
00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:41.870
I see.

71
00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:46.969
Yeah, I talked to Renno a bit

72
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:50.058
before he fell into the river.

73
00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:52.063
What did you talk about?

74
00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:57.601
Despite being married, that guy had an affair with my sister

75
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.185
and drove her to commit suicide.

76
00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:03.232
I told him to come and talk after this event is over.

77
00:06:03.352 --> 00:06:06.669
He was probably punished by heaven and fell into the river.

78
00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.630
Which means you had a motive to make Mr. Renno fall into the river.

79
00:06:11.953 --> 00:06:15.962
As for motive, same with Yatsukoshi.

80
00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.898
He's been head over heels over my younger sister since high school.

81
00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:23.375
Of course when I was talking to him about his affair with my sister,

82
00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:27.995
his wife was super pissed. I'm sure she has as much motive too.

83
00:06:28.498 --> 00:06:33.942
Does Mr. Renno really on the phone with his wife all that time?

84
00:06:34.062 --> 00:06:37.068
Yeah, looks like it.

85
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:42.532
That's why if I tried to lure him to fall into the river...

86
00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:46.542
His wife who was on the phone with him, would've heard me, no?

87
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.682
Well, we're both classified in the same kite-flying class.

88
00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:54.481
I don't think he'd listen to advice from a rival.

89
00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:58.402
But, you were watching Mr. Renno fall into the river, right?

90
00:06:58.522 --> 00:07:00.760
Didn't you think of stopping him?

91
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.512
I was pretty far from him when he fell.

92
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:07.560
Besides, I thought he approached the river to dispose of trash.

93
00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.032
Dispose of trash?

94
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.920
He was carrying an empty PET bottle under his arm.

95
00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:19.962
By the way, what's your relationship with them?

96
00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:24.042
Renno and Yatsukoshi were juniors of my high school baseball club.

97
00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.802
Even after I graduated,

98
00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:29.327
I visited the club and helped them out.

99
00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:33.627
That's how I know Yatsukoshi despite our age difference.

100
00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:36.422
Hey, wait a sec!

101
00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:39.492
Why do I have to be suspected?

102
00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:41.772
I was at home and on the phone, you know?

103
00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:43.820
Moreover, I was using the cordless at home.

104
00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:47.822
But you're the only one who could've

105
00:07:47.942 --> 00:07:50.120
lured him between the posts by phone.

106
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.635
If you lived in a skyscraper,

107
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.735
and you had a good view of this area.

108
00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:59.012
What? I live in a 2 story ordinary house.

109
00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:03.068
But, if you use a TV telephone, you'd be able to what's going on, right?

110
00:08:03.188 --> 00:08:04.782
Like the location of the posts.

111
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:08.412
What makes you think he'd listen to me give him instructions

112
00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:13.057
like go farther back or move a little more to the left

113
00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:15.422
from his wife, that's calling from home?

114
00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:17.222
True...

115
00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:22.048
Then did you hear Mr. Kakura's voice over the phone?

116
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.223
Yes.

117
00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:26.089
He's the older brother of the woman my husband is flirting with, isn't he?

118
00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.299
I heard him loud and clear.

119
00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:34.822
Well, I knew that my husband was flirting with his younger sister, though.

120
00:08:34.942 --> 00:08:38.759
Back then, did he make any remarks to lead your husband to the posts?

121
00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.592
No.

122
00:08:40.712 --> 00:08:44.116
My husband was desperately defending himself.

123
00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:49.116
But maybe they were talking secretly to each other.

124
00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:53.048
Because he pulled the phone away from him once and said, "Hold on".

125
00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:55.485
Maybe it was a call-waiting?

126
00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:58.165
I didn't hear the hold music for call-waiting.

127
00:08:58.632 --> 00:09:02.797
I did hear the sound of my husband doing something right through, though.

128
00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:07.282
Then did he get mail from somebody while on the phone?

129
00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:11.887
Since he was on the phone with me he couldn't have read it.

130
00:09:12.007 --> 00:09:17.177
I threatened to divorce him if he hung up on me.

131
00:09:22.534 --> 00:09:24.672
Like Mr. Yatsukoshi said,

132
00:09:24.692 --> 00:09:27.241
he's not making any overt movements.

133
00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:30.541
Yes. He's just drinking his beverage.

134
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.851
Hey, what're you doing?

135
00:09:33.192 --> 00:09:35.874
If you move back any farther...

136
00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:42.902
Mr. Kakura who was there just after Mr. Renno fell is also on-screen.

137
00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:47.482
Like he also said, they're standing pretty far from each other.

138
00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:50.872
He couldn't have lured him between the posts.

139
00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:54.072
Then the only one left is his wife who was on the phone.

140
00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:58.700
Just as she said, I think it's not possible.

141
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.842
This means there may be another perp besides those three.

142
00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:07.438
No, everything's clear now.

143
00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:09.262
No mistake about it.

144
00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:12.382
The perp is that person among the three.

145
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:17.527
But, there's no evidence to back it up.

146
00:10:17.647 --> 00:10:20.003
Having a tough time.

147
00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:22.940
-You eavesdropper. -What?

148
00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:26.521
Yeah, Ayumi spilt the beans.

149
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.845
Because...

150
00:10:27.965 --> 00:10:30.530
Well, but it serves you right,

151
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.452
since your cell phone's lost.

152
00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:37.592
No joke. Ayumi, you don't have it?

153
00:10:37.712 --> 00:10:41.752
I think I dropped it in front of the toilet and somebody picked it up.

154
00:10:41.872 --> 00:10:45.902
-Why don't you try calling it, then? -Well...

155
00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:48.302
Of course, we tried calling it but...

156
00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:52.142
At first, it was ringing, but then cut off.

157
00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:55.592
After that, it seems to have been switched off.

158
00:10:55.712 --> 00:10:58.522
We can't get through no matter how much we try.

159
00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:03.492
We can't track it by GPS with the switch turned off.

160
00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:07.194
Don't you remember who was near you when you dropped it?

161
00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:08.542
Well...

162
00:11:08.772 --> 00:11:13.642
Someone was tripping behind me, but I didn't see their face.

163
00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:19.619
So, we think they took it thinking it was theirs.

164
00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:24.892
Doc, when was the first time you called?

165
00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:27.712
After the ambulance left.

166
00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:31.966
We forgot about your cell phone because of this commotion.

167
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.192
I see.

168
00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:36.872
Then it may still be left on the device.

169
00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:40.492
The voice of the one who used this primitive trick.

170
00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:43.746
The voice of the devil.

171
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.846
That's why I've been telling you over and over again

172
00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.235
that we can't make Renno fall into the river!

173
00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:02.535
Just like you say, detective,

174
00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:07.580
maybe the rope on the posts were rigged by somebody.

175
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.590
My husband may have been holding a kite and walking backwards...

176
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.442
We couldn't have possibly skilfully lured him between the posts

177
00:12:14.562 --> 00:12:16.840
and make him fall into the river.

178
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.517
But the rope seems to have been rigged quite recently, you see.

179
00:12:22.637 --> 00:12:26.630
I can only imagine it was done to make Mr. Ryota Renno fall into the river.

180
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.218
Just how did we make him fall then?

181
00:12:29.338 --> 00:12:31.060
Explain it, will you?

182
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.683
The way in which we lured Mr. Renno between the posts!

183
00:12:34.803 --> 00:12:38.346
I teamed with Mr. Renno and was flying the kite...

184
00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.937
but when he fell,

185
00:12:40.003 --> 00:12:42.946
I was so far away from him that he couldn't hear my voice.

186
00:12:43.407 --> 00:12:47.216
I didn't try to lure him using big gesture either, did I?

187
00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:51.575
I was pretty far away when he fell in too.

188
00:12:51.922 --> 00:12:53.950
He was on the phone,

189
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.811
if I shouted at him, his wife should've heard me, isn't it?

190
00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:02.724
I was on the phone with my husband, right through, until he fell.

191
00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:06.093
But I was calling from home and wasn't here at all.

192
00:13:06.313 --> 00:13:08.950
I couldn't have manipulated him at all, right?

193
00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:12.550
So why you're still suspecting me?

194
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:18.440
But I'm sure there must be some way...

195
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.000
-I don't think there is. -What?

196
00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:25.734
Maybe they could if they use psychic powers or something but...

197
00:13:25.854 --> 00:13:28.861
Psychic powers?

198
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:35.215
Then, after you undergo a body check,

199
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:37.081
you may go for today.

200
00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:38.981
You gotta be kidding!

201
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.536
Why do we have to undergo something like that?

202
00:13:41.656 --> 00:13:44.000
After all, it's not like somebody died.

203
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.025
It's voluntary, isn't it? The body check.

204
00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:49.923
-Then, I refuse. -What?

205
00:13:50.043 --> 00:13:51.891
Me too, then.

206
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:53.940
I'm not doing it either.

207
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.519
Wait...

208
00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.020
Well, it'll be okay.

209
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.708
When Mr. Renno regains consciousness...

210
00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:04.907
we'll know who the perp is right away.

211
00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:10.785
-Is that for real, Conan? -Probably.

212
00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:15.694
He probably tells us how he was lured between the posts too.

213
00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:19.102
But what if he doesn't regain consciousness?

214
00:14:19.222 --> 00:14:21.390
Then, we're done for.

215
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.422
There seems to be no clue either so...

216
00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:28.946
Talking of no clue, anything on your cell phone, Conan?

217
00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:30.305
No, not yet.

218
00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:33.950
Maybe the one who picked it up threw it away someplace?

219
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.510
If it's in the river, that's trouble.

220
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.884
No problem. It's completely water-proofed.

221
00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:43.090
I think we'll find out who threw it away too.

222
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.915
Because that cell phone was set on record.

223
00:14:46.035 --> 00:14:50.082
The voice of the one who picked it up would be on it.

224
00:14:50.202 --> 00:14:53.979
But what if the person takes it home and breaks it?

225
00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:57.490
-I'll find it before that's done. -How?

226
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.300
There's a special built-in transmitter in the phone that Doc put in for me.

227
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.737
We will know where it is after checking the computer at Doc's house.

228
00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.444
Right, Doc?

229
00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:10.480
What? Yeah.

230
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.342
I don't remember inserting such a transmitter, though.

231
00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:18.130
But what if the recorded data is erased?

232
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.726
No worry about that either, because it's locked.

233
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:27.931
Well, it's a four-digit number that you guys would never figure out.

234
00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:34.857
Is it "This is Conan" written in numbers as 5794?

235
00:15:35.165 --> 00:15:37.195
-Nope. -I know.

236
00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:39.537
You're a Thief Kid killer,

237
00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:43.576
so it could be his criminal number 1412, isn't it?

238
00:15:43.696 --> 00:15:46.942
-No, wrong. -It's 110.

239
00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:49.527
Because you always say, "Call the police".

240
00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:51.742
I said it's 4 digits.

241
00:15:51.995 --> 00:15:55.773
I hope it's not 4869.

242
00:15:56.119 --> 00:15:59.111
-Because you're Sherlockian. -What?

243
00:15:59.756 --> 00:16:02.627
No way.

244
00:16:02.747 --> 00:16:05.957
-So, that's the number? -I'm telling you it's not.

245
00:16:14.464 --> 00:16:15.877
Darn.

246
00:16:17.038 --> 00:16:18.646
What's going on?

247
00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:21.666
It's not 4869?

248
00:16:22.642 --> 00:16:25.158
"Enter Passcode"

249
00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:27.563
It doesn't unlock.

250
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.898
That brat...

251
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.640
Don't tell me he...

252
00:16:34.018 --> 00:16:35.448
Oh, no!

253
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.834
I'm coming out now!

254
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.525
I've got no choice.

255
00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:52.840
I'll take it home and crack it to pieces with a hammer.

256
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.730
So, it was you after all.

257
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.000
Mr. Takeshi Yatsukoshi.

258
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.190
Just what're you talking about?

259
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.610
You have Conan's cell phone on you, don't you?

260
00:17:14.796 --> 00:17:16.352
You mean this?

261
00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:19.307
I picked it up thinking it was mine.

262
00:17:19.427 --> 00:17:21.998
The model and color's the same as mine, you see.

263
00:17:22.118 --> 00:17:26.307
I can't activate the passcode, and I thought I didn't bring my phone today,

264
00:17:26.427 --> 00:17:28.967
so I thought it was strange.

265
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.998
So, is that all?

266
00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:35.173
No, everything's clear now.

267
00:17:35.293 --> 00:17:39.223
You're the one who made Mr. Renno fall into the river.

268
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.245
That is, you're the perp.

269
00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.367
Just what're you talking about?

270
00:17:47.487 --> 00:17:52.810
Like I just told you, it's impossible for me to lure Mr. Renno.

271
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.010
I made no large gestures and yet how would I manipulate

272
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.695
somebody so far away that can't even hear me?

273
00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.844
You called him, didn't you?

274
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.878
Call?

275
00:18:04.998 --> 00:18:08.727
Because that way you can talk to somebody who's far away, right?

276
00:18:08.847 --> 00:18:13.623
So back then, Mr. Renno was on the phone with his wife

277
00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:15.790
and there was no call-waiting either.

278
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.000
Not that phone.

279
00:18:20.942 --> 00:18:25.140
Hello, Ayumi! Can you hear me?

280
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.260
Yes, yes. I can hear you.

281
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.197
A string phone.

282
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.070
The things needed to make a string phone were all there.

283
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:41.160
A long string to connect and a PET bottle to serve as the receiver.

284
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.160
Each party tie a string onto the PET bottle.

285
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.367
You pretended to drink a beverage and gave Mr. Renno directions.

286
00:18:50.645 --> 00:18:54.597
A little more to the left. Move left, right.

287
00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:57.420
Farther back. More!

288
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.857
-Like so. -Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:19:00.977 --> 00:19:06.464
How can I use a string phone when I can't even hear him?

290
00:19:06.584 --> 00:19:09.209
You agreed on an easy sign to begin with.

291
00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:13.469
Like, if I pull the kite string twice, it means to use the string phone.

292
00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:16.881
Back then, Mrs. Renno mentioned.

293
00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:21.612
But maybe the two were talking in secret.

294
00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:25.754
He told me to hold on and pulled away from his phone once so...

295
00:19:26.049 --> 00:19:30.190
You gotta be kidding! Just where do you have that kind of proof?

296
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.944
To the right, the right.

297
00:19:33.498 --> 00:19:36.418
Can you go backwards about 10 steps?

298
00:19:36.538 --> 00:19:41.310
Thanks to you for having kept my cell phone in your chest pocket,

299
00:19:41.738 --> 00:19:43.210
everything could be heard loud and clear.

300
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.510
Hey, what're you doing?

301
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.000
If you move back any farther...

302
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.247
What?

303
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.230
The devil's voice.

304
00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:56.127
Go to hell.

305
00:20:03.798 --> 00:20:06.078
Hey, somebody fell into the river!

306
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.285
A voice pattern profile will reveal whose voice it is immediately.

307
00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:16.074
Well, it seems that Mr. Renno regained consciousness a while ago,

308
00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:19.444
so we can ask him directly too.

309
00:20:19.564 --> 00:20:21.646
I suspect that your motive had something...

310
00:20:22.048 --> 00:20:26.438
to do with Mr. Kakura's younger sister too.

311
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.113
It's incredible, don't you think?

312
00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:41.746
Conan.

313
00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:45.847
We were able to solve the case thanks to him.

314
00:20:46.452 --> 00:20:49.780
I suspected him from the start.

315
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.470
-Right. -Really?

316
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.920
Well, the trick was a string phone.

317
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.897
I'd say t's a uniquely childish idea.

318
00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:02.920
So, what's your passcode?

319
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.373
I'm not telling you.

320
00:22:26.091 --> 00:22:27.509
I see.

321
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.450
So, you never found out what Ai's favorite song is, after all.

322
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.580
Nope.

323
00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:39.320
Be quiet. Yoko's being interviewed.

324
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.455
We have a special video message from someone for you.

325
00:22:42.575 --> 00:22:44.719
Who? Who is it?

326
00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:49.517
What? My type? In terms of celebrities?

327
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.686
No one in particular,

328
00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:56.281
but there's a song that I often listening to when I do warm-ups,

329
00:22:56.401 --> 00:22:59.367
but I'd like to keep it to myself.

330
00:22:59.487 --> 00:23:03.828
I'll tell you. It's Yoko Okino's new song, "Dandy Lion"!

331
00:23:03.948 --> 00:23:05.318
Takahiro!

332
00:23:05.438 --> 00:23:09.406
This bearded old man actually listens to idol songs.

333
00:23:09.526 --> 00:23:11.290
What a guy.

334
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.480
I see. Mr. Higo, you're a fan of Yoko's?

335
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.962
Oh, well. We went to the same high school.

336
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:23.582
So I thought I'd give listening to her music I try, then I got hooked.

337
00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:25.995
It peps me up.

338
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.139
It makes it easier to visualize my shots.

339
00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:31.719
The lyrics remind me of dandelions.

340
00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:33.203
I see.

341
00:23:33.323 --> 00:23:36.680
It's called the "Dandy Lion" because it sounds like dandelions.

342
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.121
How witty!

343
00:23:39.241 --> 00:23:41.375
Get lost!

344
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.630
So, this is it.

345
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.721
"Next Episode" -Juri, I don't agree.

346
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:54.651
Split up with him.

347
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:58.451
