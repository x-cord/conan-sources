1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,224
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:05,324
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:07,124
The mysterious case using a vase.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,124
Reenacting the scene of the Case.

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:12,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:15,124
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,237
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:03,537
end up helping Mr. Morita look for the lost wristwatch

10
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,837
in place of Pops.

11
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:10,637
While we were looking for the wristwatch at Mr. Morita's condo,

12
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:15,737
Ms. Eiko Idezuki, a resident of the same condo comes over

13
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:18,437
and starts watching a movie in the audio room.

14
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:22,837
In the meantime,

15
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:26,837
we found the wristwatch in the washing machine!

16
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,437
Just then...

17
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:33,937
We heard the flower vase crack from the audio!

18
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:38,537
We rushed over to see what happened

19
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:41,437
and found Ms. Idezuki hit on the head with the flower vase

20
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:43,237
and killed!

21
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,937
The killer is most likely Mr. Morita.

22
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:51,537
However, he has an alibi

23
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,537
and it would've been impossible for him to commit the crime.

24
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:57,237
How did he do it?

25
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:02,337
And, there's one more thing that bothers me.

26
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:08,637
It seems that someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

27
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,737
We found that the investigation records

28
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:16,937
that Mr. Mouri handled up within town were all disappeared

29
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,437
from the police department.

30
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:23,537
And, when did the papers disappear?

31
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,137
I think it was...

32
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:30,837
the day when you and the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

33
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:37,137
No, the one they're after is not Pops,

34
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:39,537
but maybe...

35
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:44,537
And maybe they are...

36
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:55,637
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 2)"

37
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,237
Shinichi, what did Officer Takagi say?

38
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,337
It's nothing important.

39
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,437
Just as I thought,

40
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:10,037
you refuse to tell us anything.

41
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:14,037
Come off it, the same to you.

42
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,037
I guess so.

43
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:19,037
What's this? Are you hiding something after all, Shinichi?

44
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:22,437
No, that's not it.

45
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,737
Although he doesn't think of what will happen

46
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:29,137
when he is pushed forward by justice and pursues only the truth at times,

47
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,737
he yet at times, takes on all the pressure alone,

48
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,437
so as not to hurt anybody.

49
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:39,537
That character of yours, boyish and dangerous.

50
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:43,137
It's extremely interesting.

51
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:46,137
But I wonder if you're at all aware

52
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,237
that the pure fragrance of yours

53
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:50,537
is binding all the girls, including me

54
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:55,537
as well as yourself up in an isolated and dangerous fragrance.

55
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,237
Kudo.

56
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:02,337
Hey.

57
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:05,237
Don't you smell something odd?

58
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:08,237
Now that you mentioned it, it does smell like something is burning.

59
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,937
Maybe it's the microwave oven over there?

60
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:17,037
There's no mistake about it, the smell's coming from in here!

61
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,437
But, there's nothing inside.

62
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,437
Conan?

63
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:34,137
This is dried flower, isn't it?

64
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:38,637
Or it was thrown away because it withered.

65
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:42,237
If so, that should be somewhere near here.

66
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:45,737
Darn, where is it?

67
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,937
It's impossible to hide anything so conspicuous away so easily.

68
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,837
Don't tell me it's in another room?

69
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,537
There are some more sandwiches left!

70
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,137
May I eat this?

71
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,937
Gosh, Genta, you're such a pig.

72
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,937
Sandwich?

73
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:05,937
Wait a second.

74
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:07,437
Maybe...

75
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:10,337
I found it!

76
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:14,337
I found it! This was a trick after all!

77
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:17,237
Which means that inside the audio room...

78
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:22,737
What is it, Conan?

79
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:27,937
I was playing flying a paper plane in the afternoon

80
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,237
and it went on top there.

81
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,437
Where?

82
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:33,237
Behind the curtain above the television!

83
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,737
Will you please get it for me, please?

84
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:38,537
Okay... I'll get it for you now.

85
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,737
Gosh. Sometimes he acts really intelligent,

86
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,737
but sometimes he acts like any other kid.

87
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,137
There's nothing here, Conan.

88
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:50,237
There's no sign of an airplane anywhere.

89
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,937
It's full of machines!

90
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:54,237
It's amazing!

91
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:55,637
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

92
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:56,637
Put him down quick!

93
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,537
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,937
You sure have a lot of decks, don't you?

95
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,737
Yes, I put all the decks that have gotten old

96
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:08,737
and out of use on the top shelves.

97
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,137
Conan?

98
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:11,337
A timer?

99
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:14,237
Come down, Conan!

100
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,437
I see. So that's what it was.

101
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:27,237
Ms. Idezuki was watching unaware whatsoever

102
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:30,837
that this would be the last movie that she would be watching.

103
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:33,237
That she was going to be

104
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:36,137
a part of the ruthless story

105
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,437
that Mr. Morita had schemed.

106
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:43,237
"Mouri Detective Agency"

107
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,337
It's strange.

108
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:55,337
They didn't mention about going out or anything.

109
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:58,937
Hey, I told them!

110
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,437
Okay, and what did Inspector Megure say?

111
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:04,337
He says it's an interesting deduction,

112
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,437
so he'll cooperate!

113
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:09,637
Okay! Next, it's you guys then!

114
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:12,437
Do exactly as I told you, now!

115
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,237
Okay...

116
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:23,437
You sure look worried.

117
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,937
You're worried about your precious girl, aren't you?

118
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:33,337
It's okay. I don't know what Officer Takagi told you,

119
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,937
but just make sure that you don't blow your cool

120
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:39,537
and reveal your identity or anything about the organization to her.

121
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:42,137
Well, I can see that your feet are off the ground

122
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:45,237
after receiving chocolate from her because after all you are a guy.

123
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:49,837
Come on! My feet are not off the ground.

124
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:53,537
I haven't told her a thing.

125
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:54,937
What?

126
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:58,937
But Shinichi, you accepted the chocolate from Ran, didn't you?

127
00:08:58,937 --> 00:08:59,937
Yes.

128
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:04,537
Then you must've something in return for it...

129
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,537
She would want to see me.

130
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,737
If I say anything now,

131
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,937
she is going to miss me even more.

132
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:18,037
The hateful guy is just one-sidedly telling her

133
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,537
to wait for him

134
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:24,237
and can't even appear before her.

135
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,837
I don't want to see her cry anymore.

136
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:34,837
Even if it means blotting my existence out of her.

137
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:40,237
I'm so childish, what a laugh.

138
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:46,837
It hurts, doesn't it? The feeling's mutual.

139
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:51,937
What? Something was stolen?

140
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:53,237
Really?

141
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:54,837
It's true!

142
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,837
A strange thing disappeared!

143
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:00,537
The killer was actually a thief!

144
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:03,737
Please come to the kitchen.

145
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,237
Let's go, Mr. Morita.

146
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,937
Yes.

147
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:24,737
And? What is it that was stolen?

148
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,237
It's this!

149
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:27,637
A bowl?

150
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:31,537
No! It isn't the bowl that was stolen

151
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:33,137
but the bottom of the bowl!

152
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:35,037
See!

153
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:38,537
The bottom of the bowl with the same pattern of that bowl is there,

154
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,737
but the bottom of this bowl is gone, right?

155
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,637
True.

156
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:46,737
The bottom of that bowl was gone when I bought it.

157
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:49,337
It seems to have been a detective item.

158
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:52,837
Inspector! Everything's ready!

159
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:54,237
Ready?

160
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,737
If it's okay with you, we'd like you to stand witness too!

161
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,237
It's just a simple on-site investigation.

162
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,737
What? Okay.

163
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,737
Shall we go then?

164
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:07,437
To the audio room where Ms. Idesuki was struck to death

165
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:09,437
with the flower vase.

166
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,787
Please go ahead inside.

167
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,187
Yes.

168
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,787
The switch...

169
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:34,887
The switch of the video deck is on?

170
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,887
Is something wrong with the video deck on the shelf?

171
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,987
No, it's not the deck,

172
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:45,087
it's the stack of video tapes in front of it.

173
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:49,087
Excuse me. I put it there!

174
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:52,687
Because there're so many of them.

175
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:58,987
Well, the victim Ms. Idezuki rewound the video after watching it.

176
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:01,187
When she took it out of the deck,

177
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,787
she was attacked from behind by the killer, right?

178
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,587
Yes.

179
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:08,287
So, shall we use the video like she did

180
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,587
and replay the scene of the crime?

181
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:10,987
What?

182
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:13,787
Officer Takagi, you play the role of the killer.

183
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:17,487
Dr. Agasa, please play the role of the victim.

184
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,887
Well...

185
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,887
What? Anything?

186
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,287
Well, you see...

187
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,287
I... I'll do it!

188
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,687
Since Ms. Idezuki used to watch the video a lot in this room,

189
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,687
I think that a person who is familiar with this room is more appropriate.

190
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,487
It's that right!

191
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,987
Then, please do, by all means!

192
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:42,987
First, you insert the video tape into the video deck on the very bottom.

193
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:47,187
The victim sits in the chair and watches the movie all alone.

194
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,287
Is that right?

195
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,187
Yes.

196
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,187
Then the victim who finishes watching the video

197
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,987
rewinds the tape.

198
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,087
What's the matter?

199
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,087
Please rewind the tape!

200
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,487
Yes, sir!

201
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:06,787
While the tape is being rewound, the killer sneaks up behind her

202
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,687
with the flower vase that is at the front entrance.

203
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:15,187
And, as she is about to take the tape that is rewound out of the deck...

204
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,687
The killer flings up the flower vase.

205
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,287
Mr. Morita, quick, please take the tape out!

206
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,787
Yes... Yes!

207
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,187
Okay.

208
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,487
Well...

209
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,187
Why don't you use the remote controller?

210
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:37,587
-What? -Look!

211
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,487
The remote controller that you're holding

212
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,887
has an eject button!

213
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,487
That's...

214
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,287
I'll eject it for you then!

215
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:05,487
The video tape won't come falling

216
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,587
because the code number for the remote controller

217
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:11,587
for the video deck on the top shelf had been switched.

218
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,187
In other words, Mr. Morita,

219
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,187
this is how you committed the crime!

220
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:25,587
You rigged it so that the video deck you've been using on the lower shelf

221
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,487
and the video deck on the upper shelf

222
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:31,187
would operate with the same remote controller.

223
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:35,287
Then you put the tape in the video deck on the upper shelf.

224
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:38,587
Then you put the vase with the flower and water in it

225
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:42,187
in front of the eject slot of that tape deck.

226
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:47,287
Of course, you made sure it would fall by putting a tape under it!

227
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,787
After that, all you had to do

228
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,587
was close the curtain of that shelf to complete the scheme!

229
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,987
Then you showed Ms Idezuki the video

230
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:56,687
that she had been wanting to see

231
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,987
and lured her into this room.

232
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,787
If you tell her to rewind the tape

233
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:04,487
and return it to the video shop,

234
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,287
you knew that after she finishes watching the video,

235
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,787
she would use the remote controller to eject the tape

236
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,087
and at the same time,

237
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,887
the tape on the top shelf would also be ejected

238
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,787
and push the flower vase forward...

239
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:17,087
Just when she pulls the tape out of the deck,

240
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:21,487
the flower vase would come falling towards her.

241
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,687
In other words, so long as you were aware of her actions

242
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:27,587
when she frequented this room,

243
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:28,987
it wouldn't be difficult for you to set the timing right

244
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:31,287
so that the flower vase would fall on her!

245
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:33,587
Like so!

246
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,787
And the video deck on the top shelf had a function

247
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:46,787
that would push the tape back into the deck.

248
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,287
If it bumps into something,

249
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:49,887
so if you pre-record something into that tape

250
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,887
and break off the pin to prevent further recording,

251
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:54,487
the tape will automatically start to play.

252
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,087
Therefore, right after the flower vase falls on her,

253
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,587
the sound of footsteps of someone running

254
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,687
and the door closing would be heard,

255
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:06,887
making it look like someone from outside committed the crime!

256
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,887
We heard it very clearly

257
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,887
because she was watching the movie full blast.

258
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,587
You made her use the deck on the very bottom

259
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:20,387
to get the vase to fall from as high a distance as possible.

260
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,787
You rigged it so the video deck on the top shelf

261
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:26,287
would switch off with a timer

262
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,687
so that when the police opened the curtain,

263
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,487
you wouldn't be suspected, right?

264
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:38,087
I guess you already know that we've seen through your scheme.

265
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,587
But, the flower vase that you had at the front entrance...

266
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:42,087
It was this bowl!

267
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,887
You glued it together like sandwich

268
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:45,987
and put it on the counter of the front entrance, right?

269
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:48,787
You carried it secretly over to the kitchen

270
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:50,687
when you went to make the sandwiches,

271
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,287
disassembled it and hid it between the bowls!

272
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,487
These are the flowers that were inside the vase.

273
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:01,287
You dried it using the microwave oven and threw them away.

274
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,687
Poor thing, after your wife decorated the flowers there.

275
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,887
My wife didn't arrange those flowers.

276
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,787
Those flowers are out of place flowers

277
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,087
that the woman brought to my wife's funeral.

278
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:21,187
We didn't even have the money to buy flowers in this house anymore.

279
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,587
Stocks.

280
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:28,287
That woman urged my wife to do stocks behind my back.

281
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:32,387
She was eventually buried in debts and was driven to death.

282
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:35,487
Which means your wife's car accident...

283
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,287
Yes, the day after she told me about the stocks,

284
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:43,287
she ran in front of car and got run over.

285
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:47,087
That wristwatch was wrapped in a letter that she had written to me.

286
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,587
It said, "I don't want this to destroyed,"

287
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,087
"so I'm leaving this behind."

288
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,087
So...

289
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:57,387
Who cares whether the flowers that woman gave me

290
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,587
are withered or burned?

291
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:07,687
We'll hear the rest of your story out at the station.

292
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:12,487
But, I feel sorry for them nevertheless.

293
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:15,487
They were so beautiful

294
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:18,487
and flowers have such short lives.

295
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:22,387
They were forced to wither before their time came.

296
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:24,487
Yes.

297
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,887
I'm going to head on home then!

298
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,587
Yes,

299
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:34,087
flowers are fragile and short-lived.

300
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,087
No matter how much we try to protect them

301
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,787
from rain and wind and build fences around them,

302
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,987
flowers will wither in want of the sun.

303
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,687
If a storm comes,

304
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:49,087
a fragile fence cannot act as a shield at all.

305
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,487
Do you understand this, Kudo?

306
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:58,587
Darn! How come nobody's answering the phone?

307
00:18:58,587 --> 00:18:59,887
Darn!

308
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:10,787
Ran, Pops!

309
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,987
Help!

310
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:20,787
I got you!

311
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,587
-Help! Somebody! -Right, it's dinner time.

312
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,587
-Nobody's going to come to help you! -They may be at home upstairs.

313
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,387
Ran!

314
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,287
Ran!

315
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:48,587
Dinner made part way.

316
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,887
The television in the office is left on.

317
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,987
Don't tell me that...

318
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,487
It seems that someone is secretly checking up on Mr. Mouri.

319
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,787
Don't tell me that...

320
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,787
the person...

321
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:52,187
Who is it?

322
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,387
Ran.

323
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:55,987
Bingo!

324
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:59,487
Hey... Where were you?

325
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,687
I went to the supermarket on second street!

326
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,587
Dad had a big win with the horse race!

327
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,087
A big win?

328
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,887
Dad was elated and said,

329
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:13,587
"We're having steak tonight! Go buy the meat and sake!"

330
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:15,887
That's why I left everything part way

331
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,987
and rushed over to go shopping!

332
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,487
Because unless I go right away,

333
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,187
the sell-out of meat all the time.

334
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:25,087
Where's Pops?

335
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:28,987
I think he's going around the neighbourhood boasting about his win.

336
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,887
Hold on just a while longer, Conan.

337
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,887
I'll make you a steak that's even more delicious

338
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,887
than that of first rate restaurants!

339
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:41,987
Ran.

340
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,287
What?

341
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:47,087
Well...

342
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:49,287
The man wearing a black knitted cap

343
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:51,987
maybe an acquaintance of mine.

344
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,787
What is it?

345
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,287
Black...

346
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,287
Black...

347
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:11,887
Don't burn the meat black.

348
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:13,887
How rude!

349
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:15,987
You can count on me!

350
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:24,987
I don't believe she knows him.

351
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:54,887
"Mouri Detective Agency"

352
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:08,987
"Next Episode"

353
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:13,987
What?

354
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,587
Something is on the envelope.

355
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,787
A circle, cross and a triangle.

356
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,487
58 possible suspects.

357
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:26,987
The only hint is circle, cross and triangle.

358
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:29,887
How interesting!

359
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,587
Next Conan,

360
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:35,308
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 1)"

361
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:38,405
Next Conan's hint:

362
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:40,105
"Circle, cross and triangle"
