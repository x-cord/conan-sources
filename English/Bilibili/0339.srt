1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.640
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.740
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.540
Ai gets messed up in the Porsche case.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.440
Jodie, Araide and Vermouth appear.

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:54.668
"Four Porsches (Part 2)"

9
00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:03.468
The victim is Mr. Yukiya Banba, age 41.

10
00:02:03.468 --> 00:02:05.568
The cause is death by suffocation.

11
00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:08.568
From the traces left on his neck,

12
00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:11.668
it seems he was choked by a string-like object.

13
00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:14.168
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Moreover, it seems...

14
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.068
he was choked with quite some strength.

15
00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:21.568
And? Who is the one that found the corpse?

16
00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.068
He's the one.

17
00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:25.968
He seems to have gone golfing with the victim

18
00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.368
and stopped by here on their way back.

19
00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:33.768
Who are the two people standing behind you?

20
00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:37.068
Oh, yes. They are also golf friends.

21
00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:39.468
As well as Porsche friends.

22
00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:41.568
Conan?

23
00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:43.968
You're also Porsche friends, right?

24
00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:45.668
How did you know?

25
00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:48.368
I came to this department store with Dr. Agasa and got off the car.

26
00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.668
Then I saw them park their cars too,

27
00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:52.668
and I talked to them a bit.

28
00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:54.868
Where's Dr. Agasa then?

29
00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:58.068
I think he's still shopping upstairs.

30
00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:00.168
And, Conan...

31
00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:03.968
Will you give me more of the details back then?

32
00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:05.568
It was about 1:00 in the afternoon.

33
00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:08.968
4 people came on this white Porsche

34
00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:10.868
and only 3 got off.

35
00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.968
They were saying that they were going to shop here

36
00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:16.068
until that man's booze wears off.

37
00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:17.268
It seems as if

38
00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:21.168
they were going to leave after a while on their own cars.

39
00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.668
Which means that these 4 Porsches are yours?

40
00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:25.868
Yes.

41
00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.168
Inspector Megure.

42
00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:29.268
A moment.

43
00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:31.268
Did you find anything?

44
00:03:31.268 --> 00:03:32.368
Yes.

45
00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:37.968
Thank you.

46
00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:41.768
It seems that the suspects have been

47
00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:44.368
narrowed down to you three.

48
00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:45.868
What?

49
00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:47.168
As a result of the autopsy,

50
00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:50.468
the estimated time of death is around 13:00.

51
00:03:50.468 --> 00:03:53.468
Just about the time you all got here.

52
00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:54.468
In other words,

53
00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:56.268
it is extremely likely that one of you

54
00:03:56.268 --> 00:04:01.168
strangled Mr. Banba when getting off the car.

55
00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:04.068
Well, it may be a different story

56
00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:05.868
if you left the car unlocked when you got off.

57
00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:09.068
I locked the door for sure!

58
00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:12.368
He was still alive when we got off.

59
00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:13.368
What?

60
00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:17.168
Mr. Hotei, Ms. Taiyama. Is it true?

61
00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:20.868
Yeah. He was wasted and talking in his sleep.

62
00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:24.068
Saying something like "Another OB".

63
00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:28.068
Besides, we all got off at about the same time,

64
00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.768
so nobody had time to strangle anybody.

65
00:04:30.768 --> 00:04:34.968
Well, please tell us more in detail.

66
00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.568
Please give me your names

67
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.468
and your relationship with Mr. Banba who had been killed,

68
00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:41.368
the order in which you got off the car

69
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:44.668
and which car you own.

70
00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:48.268
I'm the first one who got off.

71
00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:50.168
My name is Yoshihito Kureko.

72
00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:54.268
I got to know Mr. Banba at the Porsche new car exhibition.

73
00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:57.668
My car is this Porsche 911 here.

74
00:04:57.668 --> 00:04:59.668
When we go golfing, I park my car here

75
00:04:59.668 --> 00:05:00.868
and all four of us get on this car

76
00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.868
and head off together in one car,

77
00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.068
just like that boy mentioned.

78
00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.268
We got off in order to wait for Mr. Banba's booze to wear off

79
00:05:07.268 --> 00:05:11.068
and decided to kill time at the department store.

80
00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:14.768
But I realized that I had left my cell phone in the car

81
00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:17.868
so I came back to get it, only to see how I found him.

82
00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:19.668
Which means,

83
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:21.768
you're the only one who could've killed him

84
00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:24.468
without being seen by anyone.

85
00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:29.268
No! I came back to the car about an hour later though.

86
00:05:31.168 --> 00:05:32.568
What is this?

87
00:05:32.568 --> 00:05:35.168
This box in the dashboard compartment?

88
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.868
A music box.

89
00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:39.668
The pin broke, so I was thinking of sending it out for repair.

90
00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:41.668
But I had completely forgotten it was here.

91
00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:45.968
It seems to be working okay.

92
00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:48.768
I guess you can't strangle somebody using something like this though.

93
00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:53.568
I'm the one who got off after him. My name's Eiji Hotei.

94
00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:57.468
I used to car race with him on mountain roads.

95
00:05:57.468 --> 00:06:00.468
That is when we were young.

96
00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:03.268
I'm into antique-like cars recently,

97
00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:08.868
and bought a Porsche 356A that was made 50 years ago.

98
00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.568
Excuse me.

99
00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:16.768
Huh? There's something in the backseat.

100
00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:17.868
There.

101
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:21.268
Those are my fishing goods.

102
00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:23.968
I'm kind of into fishing lately.

103
00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:26.968
You've even got an electric reel.

104
00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:31.468
If this is used, you could choke his neck automatically.

105
00:06:31.468 --> 00:06:33.368
Cut out that talk!

106
00:06:33.368 --> 00:06:35.968
The reel was in the bag, wasn't it?

107
00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:39.368
I came back here after I received call from Mr. Kureko

108
00:06:39.368 --> 00:06:41.568
and haven't even touched the car yet.

109
00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:45.068
I'm Kaoru Taiyama.

110
00:06:45.068 --> 00:06:47.968
It's true that I was the last one who got off,

111
00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:50.168
but do you think that a woman like me

112
00:06:50.168 --> 00:06:52.068
would be strong enough to strangle a man to death?

113
00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:56.368
Besides, after golf, my gripping strength is weakened as is.

114
00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:57.568
And?

115
00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:00.268
What is your relationship with Mr. Banba?

116
00:07:00.268 --> 00:07:01.768
Nothing special.

117
00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:05.268
I just got into talking with him about Porsches on the golf course

118
00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:08.568
and started making rounds with him.

119
00:07:08.568 --> 00:07:11.268
This Boxter that I got right after it came out on the market

120
00:07:11.268 --> 00:07:13.368
caught Mr. Banba's eyes.

121
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:19.168
You have something in the passenger's seat, too.

122
00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:22.668
Oh, that. It's a gift for the son of my cousin.

123
00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:25.268
It's a radio controlled Porsche.

124
00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:29.668
I could never strangle someone's neck with it, could I?

125
00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:32.868
And besides, after getting off the car to go shopping,

126
00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.868
I came back here after I got a call from Mr. Kureko

127
00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:37.468
saying that something awful had happened to Mr. Banba.

128
00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:39.568
But I haven't touched a thing!

129
00:07:42.468 --> 00:07:45.168
Hey! Why don't you look at that?

130
00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:48.368
-A surveillance camera? -I see!

131
00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.168
I'm pretty sure we can find out if someone is lying.

132
00:07:51.168 --> 00:07:53.568
-Okay, to the security room! -Yes, sir.

133
00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:55.968
Will all of you please come with me, too?

134
00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:58.268
-What? -I guess we don't have a choice.

135
00:08:11.568 --> 00:08:13.368
I told you to stay still!

136
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:17.168
But Ai doesn't look too good.

137
00:08:17.168 --> 00:08:18.668
I figured we should take her to the doctor.

138
00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:20.068
We can't leave her like this.

139
00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.168
I guess we have no choice.

140
00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:27.368
Just to be safe, maybe we should ask Officer Takagi

141
00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:29.668
to secretly let us out with his police car.

142
00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:33.168
Because they may be ambushing us outside.

143
00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:35.268
Hi!

144
00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:37.568
Who are they?

145
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.568
Conan, you were mixed up in this case after all.

146
00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.368
Well... Yes.

147
00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:47.168
But, how did you get in here?

148
00:08:47.168 --> 00:08:48.368
Only those from the police

149
00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:51.668
and those who are involved in the case are let in, right?

150
00:08:51.668 --> 00:08:55.768
We told them that we came to pick you up, then they let us in.

151
00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.568
-Right, Ran? -Right.

152
00:08:59.168 --> 00:09:00.768
Huh?

153
00:09:00.768 --> 00:09:02.868
Ai is here, too?

154
00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:08.768
Come to think of it, you're some detective, aren't you?

155
00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:12.468
We're going to the security room to look over the surveillance camera,

156
00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:13.968
so won't you come along?

157
00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:16.968
Come on, let's go.

158
00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:21.168
Okay, Sonoko?

159
00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:25.568
Hey! Jodie, you too.

160
00:09:25.568 --> 00:09:27.168
Let's go!

161
00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:29.168
Hey, Conan.

162
00:09:30.668 --> 00:09:32.268
Reddish...

163
00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.568
Brown hair.

164
00:09:42.968 --> 00:09:44.968
What're you both doing?

165
00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:48.368
Ms. Taiyama and Mr. Hotei?

166
00:09:48.368 --> 00:09:51.168
After you got off the car,

167
00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:53.268
both of you have gone back to your cars.

168
00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:56.668
I just went back to get my wallet.

169
00:09:56.668 --> 00:10:00.668
Mr. Kureko always paid the golfing charges ahead of time, so...

170
00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.768
So after this, all three of you

171
00:10:03.768 --> 00:10:05.568
went into the department store together to shop,

172
00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:09.568
and until Mr. Kureko went back to get his cell phone an hour later,

173
00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:12.468
nobody went near the car?

174
00:10:12.468 --> 00:10:14.168
So, didn't I tell you that

175
00:10:14.168 --> 00:10:16.868
it was impossible for us to commit the murder?

176
00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:19.468
It's unreasonable to think

177
00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:22.768
that they would call the police knowing that they'd be suspected.

178
00:10:22.768 --> 00:10:27.268
Besides, all three of them got off the car at about the same time.

179
00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:29.768
There wasn't anything strange about their moves.

180
00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:32.668
I can't make it out.

181
00:10:32.668 --> 00:10:35.368
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba

182
00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.568
and how they retrieved the murder weapon?

183
00:10:38.568 --> 00:10:41.468
Gosh! I've got to solve the case

184
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.468
and get Ai out of here...

185
00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.668
as fast as I can.

186
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.390
Inspector Megure.

187
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.290
The pictures of the interior of the cars of all three suspects are ready.

188
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.490
Thank you. Please leave them there.

189
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.790
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.390
This is it!

191
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.090
Sonoko, did you figure it out?

192
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.990
Maybe all three of them strangled him

193
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.890
before getting off the car.

194
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.790
-Or... -Hey.

195
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.790
Why don't we go back to where the car is?

196
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.990
We could figure something out.

197
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.190
Inspector.

198
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.790
I guess so.

199
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.690
Like they say, check the scene of the crime out 100 times.

200
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.590
Let's go back.

201
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.190
She's the girl who was wearing the red hood

202
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.890
in the bus that was hi-jacked.

203
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.890
The girl who was lying down in the car.

204
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.990
Don't tell me that...

205
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.490
It can't be.

206
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.590
Shinichi said don't move,

207
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.290
but if I leave Ai as she is...

208
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.590
I've got no choice.

209
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.490
I'll call Dr. Araide once more although he may not be in.

210
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.290
"Araide Clinic" -Yes, this is Dr. Araide.

211
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.990
Dr. Araide?

212
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.290
I take it that you're Dr. Agasa, from your voice?

213
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.090
I'm in luck!

214
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.390
It seems that you weren't in when Conan called.

215
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.290
Conan did? That's strange.

216
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.990
I was home all day today.

217
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.890
What seems to be the matter?

218
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.790
I see.

219
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.190
So, you can't move from there because there's been a murder?

220
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.790
Yes, sort of.

221
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.690
Why don't we do this then?

222
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.090
I'm here at the scene of the crime.

223
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.690
Have you noticed anything?

224
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.590
No, not really.

225
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.490
Why don't you have Sonoko check everyone's car?

226
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.190
Who, me?

227
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.490
You're a great detective,

228
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.090
so you may come up with something.

229
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.290
First from Ms. Taiyama's car that's at the very edge.

230
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.490
Will you lend me your key?

231
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.890
Sure.

232
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.790
Here, Sonoko.

233
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.490
Okay.

234
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.390
I can tell that it's an expensive car,

235
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.490
but there seems to be nothing strange about it.

236
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.490
Don't tell me...

237
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.990
Don't tell me Sonoko...

238
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.990
You mean it's come?

239
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.790
Yes. I've figured it all out.

240
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.590
The way Mr. Banba was strangled to death

241
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.490
while sitting in the passenger's seat,

242
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.390
and who did it, too.

243
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.690
Really?

244
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.490
If at all possible,

245
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.590
I wish she'd explain why she's explaining

246
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.490
while pretending to be asleep like Mr. Mouri does.

247
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.590
But have you really figured out the case

248
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.990
when all you did was get into the car and sit down?

249
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.790
I touched it when I sat down.

250
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.290
Touched it?

251
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.190
You see that little groove on the top side of the window glass?

252
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.690
When my finger touched it, it dawned on me.

253
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.690
That Ms. Taiyama, the owner of this Porsche Boxter.

254
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.590
You are the killer.

255
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.590
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

256
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.290
Ms. Taiyama did?

257
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.090
Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.790
Please sit in the passenger's seat of the Porsche 911

259
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.490
where Mr. Banba's corpse is,

260
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.190
and play the role of the victim.

261
00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.990
Okay.

262
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.890
Conan, proceed with what I told you earlier.

263
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.390
You mean this fishing line that you told me to go buy?

264
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.790
But can you really do something like that with this?

265
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.890
Never mind, just do as I told you to, okay?

266
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.990
Then, everything will become clear.

267
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.490
Okay.

268
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.090
First, hook the fish line around Officer Takagi's neck,

269
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.490
who is sitting down.

270
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.790
Then pull the string through behind the head rest.

271
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.890
Get off still holding the string and close the door.

272
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.990
Hold both ends of the string

273
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.590
and pull it through the Porsche 928 that is in between.

274
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.790
Go back to Ms. Taiyama's car

275
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.890
and hook it on to the groove on the window of the driver's seat side,

276
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.590
that was made beforehand, and then go back into the car, right?

277
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.190
But the marks left on Mr. Banba's neck

278
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.890
showed signs of him being strangled with great strength.

279
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.090
You probably want to say

280
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.990
that the string was pulled secretly from inside the car,

281
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.090
but I don't think it's possible with the strength of a woman.

282
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.390
Right. That's why Ms. Taiyama used...

283
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.990
The strength of the power window.

284
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.990
Ms. Taiyama probably wrapped

285
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.790
the string around the neck of Mr. Banba who was asleep,

286
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.890
like Conan just did.

287
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.990
Then she got off the car,

288
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.790
pretended to go get her wallet and got into this car.

289
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.890
She then opened the door

290
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.090
and tied the string pulling it tight,

291
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.790
then tied it onto the transmission lever or something.

292
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.890
All she had left to do was push the switch of the power window

293
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.390
and close the window.

294
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.390
The string would be pulled by the strength of the power window and...

295
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.190
This way, she can choke his neck

296
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.990
even if she's at a distance from him.

297
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.590
Hey, Sonoko!

298
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.490
And since this parking lot is dark to begin with,

299
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.390
it's hard to see the string.

300
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.090
If the key is stopped at the first level,

301
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.690
she can move the power window without having to turn on the engine,

302
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.990
so there would be no loud sound.

303
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.290
Okay, I have a question.

304
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.890
How did she retrieve the string?

305
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.090
That's easy,

306
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.890
if she uses this radio controlled car.

307
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.190
She leaves the string that is tied beforehand

308
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.990
to the axle of the rear tire

309
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.390
of the radio controlled car outside the box,

310
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.890
cuts the string that had finished strangling his neck,

311
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.490
then ties one end of the string to the string that is outside the box,

312
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.190
and left the radio controlled car running inside the box,

313
00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.390
and left the car.

314
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.790
It's true that if left that way, the string would automatically rewind.

315
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.190
But if she left the car running,

316
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.090
I would have heard the sound of the motor running

317
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.790
when I checked this car.

318
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.390
Oh, don't you know?

319
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.090
The battery of a radio controlled car keeps only for about 10 minutes.

320
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.490
By the time you got here, it would've been stopped.

321
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.090
Why don't you try checking out the radio controlled car?

322
00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.690
I'm sure you'll find the string wrapped around the axle.

323
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.290
If it's just to roll up the string,

324
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.290
it would be possible to do so using Mr. Hotei's electric reel, too.

325
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.390
But I knocked him off the suspect's list because...

326
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.390
Because of the power window.

327
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.590
Out of the three of us,

328
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.390
my Boxter's the only one with the power window, right?

329
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.290
I thought I did a pretty good job.

330
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.990
But I didn't think that such a cute detective

331
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.690
would see through my trick.

332
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.590
So, you're the one who killed him after all.

333
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.490
But, why?

334
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.490
Why?

335
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.390
I'm sure that he's thinking so in the world beyond, too.

336
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.390
He's probably wondering, "Why was I killed?"

337
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.490
I'm sure you've heard from him before

338
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.790
that he competed with a yellow Ferrari at a mountain path before?

339
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.690
Come to think of it, yeah, some time in the past.

340
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.990
But he said the driver of the Ferrari picked on him.

341
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.290
That's a lie.

342
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.890
He's the one who picked a fight.

343
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.290
I guess all he wanted to do was tease a couple.

344
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.990
But the one driving was my younger brother.

345
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:52.090
After a heated battle, our car went over the cliff.

346
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:57.090
I was saved 3 days later by a person who happened to pass by.

347
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.990
But my younger brother didn't make it.

348
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.490
I couldn't remember the number plate of the man.

349
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.890
But I remembered his face

350
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.790
and that his car was a red Porsche 928.

351
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.790
I remembered that he had a golf bag in his car.

352
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.790
So, I bought a Porsche

353
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.790
and searched around the golf courses, finally found him

354
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.290
and was waiting for a chance to take revenge.

355
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.990
Why didn't you report the incident to the police?

356
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.090
I had no mind of telling the police about it.

357
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.490
Because my younger brother was also at fault

358
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.490
for being provoked into competing.

359
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.390
And my purpose for meeting him was not revenge to start with.

360
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.590
What?

361
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.090
If that man had called the ambulance right away for us back then,

362
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.290
my brother would've been saved.

363
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.590
I wanted to know why he didn't call the ambulance.

364
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.190
If he said that he was afraid of getting caught

365
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.290
or if he said that he still regrets that day,

366
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.290
I was going to forgive him.

367
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.890
But he continued to play golf after that too,

368
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.390
just as if nothing had happened.

369
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.890
That's when I decided to take revenge.

370
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.990
Make sure that all you guys make speed rounds only

371
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.590
with your golfing and never with your cars.

372
00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.490
Okay, the case has been solved.

373
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.090
I've got to contact Dr. Agasa right away

374
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.090
and get Ai out of here fast.

375
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.990
Quick, quick, hurry!

376
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.390
Ran, where's Jodie?

377
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:27.790
She went home

378
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.190
saying she had something urgent to attend to.

379
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.290
What?

380
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.090
Conan!

381
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.090
What?

382
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.690
Dr. Agasa and Ai are both gone!

383
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.590
Don't tell me...

384
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.090
No way!

385
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.290
Oh, I've been waiting for your call.

386
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.790
What do you mean you've been waiting?

387
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.390
I told you not to move and yet why'd you go back home?

388
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.390
You don't have to shout.

389
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.790
This is Dr. Araide's suggestion.

390
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.190
Dr. Araide?

391
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.890
Is he there?

392
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.490
Yeah. Ai is being examined now.

393
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.590
You said that he wasn't in,

394
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.690
but when I called him, he was at home.

395
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.290
I told him that we can't seem to move

396
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.390
from where we are since there was a crime,

397
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.390
he said, "The police know who you are, and moreover,

398
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.890
with a sick child, if you ask them to let you out,

399
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.590
I'm sure they'll let you out."

400
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.890
They gave us a lift in the police car and helped us get out.

401
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.890
But just when we got out of the department store,

402
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.390
she happened to pass by.

403
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.990
Hey. Don't tell me that she's...

404
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.690
Hi! I cut a lot of fruit.

405
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.590
Vitamin C is best for colds!

406
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.990
She just fell asleep.

407
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.090
Sorry.

408
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.890
Jodie.

409
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.990
She's the one who brought us here.

410
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:17.090
Thank God, she had parked her car in a different parking lot.

411
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.390
It seems that Ai has just come down with a cold,

412
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.790
so there's nothing to worry about.

413
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.190
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

414
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.790
Ready or not...

415
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.190
Are you ready?

416
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.390
Here I come.

417
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.290
I'm going to go look for you.

418
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.090
I see you.

419
00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.090
I've found you.

420
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.090
"Next Episode"

421
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.690
Doc!

422
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.890
Next Conan,

423
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.790
"Secret Hidden in the Toilet (Part 1)"

424
00:24:23.358 --> 00:24:25.458
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:27.758
"Ai's older sister, Akemi Miyano"

426
00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:29.058
The next broadcast is on a culture day!

427
00:24:29.058 --> 00:24:30.058
-Reading. -TV.

428
00:24:30.058 --> 00:24:31.358
-Movies. -Mystery.

429
00:24:31.358 --> 00:24:32.804
Put them all together and you get me.
