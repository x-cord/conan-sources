1
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,740
Tonight's stage is in Kagoshima.

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
Pops goes wild over a rare distilled spirit.

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,940
Rice malt is the aroma of human relationship.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,325
"Kagoshima Nichiuri TV" -Well, when one wants liquor the first thing

8
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,725
that comes to mind is beer.

9
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,925
Super cold beer drank in one gulp,

10
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,425
there's nothing better than it.

11
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:11,125
What's so good about it, is of course the bitterness.

12
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:15,325
No, rather, what I want to ask you about is not beer.

13
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:19,125
I thought I was summoned to talk passionately about liquor?

14
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,225
"Yuka Tokuzumi, Kagoshima Nichiuri TV Announcer" -Yes, sir.

15
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,625
But about the most popular type of liquor

16
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,725
that is going around now.

17
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:30,325
Well, when it comes to the charm of wine,

18
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,225
-one cannot talk about it without mentioning -It's not wine... but...

19
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:33,425
the amount of polyphenol that it contains...

20
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,125
This is an important commemorative event for our program

21
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,325
"Yousuke Kondo, Shogo Yoshidome" -and what's with all the gibberish.

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,925
Well... we asked him to come because he is quite well known

23
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,225
and loves to drink.

24
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,925
I mean, it's so obvious when Kagoshima comes into the picture

25
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,225
and it's about liquor.

26
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,025
The announcer's crying.

27
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,725
Dad, come on.

28
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,925
What's this threatening feeling I sense

29
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,925
after coming all this way to Kagoshima?

30
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:58,425
Kagoshima...

31
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,225
Drinking in Kagoshima brings to mind...

32
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:03,025
"Distilled spirits"

33
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,325
Oh, no.

34
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:09,525
Well, beer is good.

35
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:12,225
And wine is also good, but the fact is,

36
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,825
I like distilled spirits best.

37
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,625
Actually, I didn't want any of you out there to realize,

38
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,425
more than you already have, how delicious distilled spirits are.

39
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:25,025
That's why you went out of your way to talk about other liquors?

40
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,625
-Oh, so that's what it was! -Oh, so that's what it was!

41
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,825
But, I, Kogoro Mouri can deceive you no longer.

42
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,025
Among all the distilled spirits,

43
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:37,025
this Kagoshima made genuine distilled spirit of Satsuma...

44
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,525
is the best!

45
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:43,325
Viva! Kagoshima!

46
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,925
All right, Mr. Mouri! Good job.

47
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,225
We were right to invite him over, weren't we?

48
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,625
He somehow made it through.

49
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:55,525
He's an expert at that for sure.

50
00:03:56,525 --> 00:04:01,725
"Takakuma", you mean the rare spirit?

51
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,325
Yes. Since the manufacturing of it is completely limited,

52
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:07,525
it is very hard to get a hold of and is the gem of all liquors.

53
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:10,625
You mean I get to drink that?

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,025
We asked the brewery and they answered,

55
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:14,825
"If for Mr. Mouri they'd be more than glad to."

56
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,025
We'll cross the Gulf of Kagoshima on the ferry

57
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,225
and go to a place right opposite it called "Tarumizu."

58
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:24,725
I get to drink it, the spirit of my dreams, the rare spirit "Takakuma."

59
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,625
It's nothing to cry over.

60
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:36,425
This is how we ended up getting involved with that devastating case.

61
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:44,025
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma! (Part 1)"

62
00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:48,125
Takakuma Sake Brewery, so this is where it's being made.

63
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,825
I thought it was going to be a much bigger place.

64
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,625
But, it's beautiful.

65
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,725
The sea is right in front too.

66
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,325
Mr. Mouri, here is the head of the family.

67
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,525
I'm sorry to intrude on you suddenly like this.

68
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:02,425
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

69
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:05,325
"Satoshi Shiraishi (30)" -Thank you so much for coming, I'm Shiraishi.

70
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:07,225
We've heard a lot about you.

71
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,025
"Fumiko Shiraishi (27)" -I'm Fumiko.

72
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,025
This is my daughter, Ran.

73
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,525
And he's a freeloader...

74
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,525
Oh, come on, Dad.

75
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:16,725
-He's Conan. -Hello.

76
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:21,725
I guess a sake brewery is no fun for you, is it, sonny?

77
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,225
That's not true, right?

78
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,025
I like it very much.

79
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,025
That is Takayama.

80
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:33,825
I see, that's where you got the name of your brewery from.

81
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,325
Please come this way to the office.

82
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,325
Do come along.

83
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:40,625
Thank you.

84
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,025
If you will excuse me...

85
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,525
How do you like the Takakuma?

86
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:58,125
It's delicious. There's no other word for it.

87
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,325
It's only sake.

88
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,025
No, no, this is the gem of all sake.

89
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,225
It's splendid.

90
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:08,425
But, it is our pride and joy to make that "mere sake."

91
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,825
Preparation for making sake

92
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:16,025
starts with steaming the washed grains of rice.

93
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,825
Rice malt is then mixed in.

94
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,725
The rice malt mixture that is completed is put into a vase,

95
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,225
then water and yeast is added, and let stand to ferment.

96
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,725
Add steamed Statsuma potatoes into the mixture

97
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,025
and ferment even more.

98
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,725
The temperature must be kept stable

99
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,825
and the contents must be stirred constantly with a stick

100
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,625
to prevent the propagation of unwanted bacteria.

101
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,025
Then, it is left to mature,

102
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,525
which after, an appropriate amount of water is added,

103
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,625
and the process is finally complete.

104
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,525
There are companies that are mass producing using machines,

105
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,125
but as for us, we have stuck to hand-making the sake.

106
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:55,325
Limited production,

107
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,525
may sound of the quite nice.

108
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:00,725
But the thing is we can't make more than we are now

109
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,425
if we insist on making something genuine.

110
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:05,125
Right. The genuine made by hand.

111
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,725
It's no wonder it's delicious.

112
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:10,125
Yes?

113
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm Maezono from Weekly Entertainment

114
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,625
that asked for an interview the other day.

115
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,725
Interview?

116
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,025
No, I know nothing about it.

117
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,025
"Hitomi Maezono (25)" -I talked to a clerk

118
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,525
"Journalist" -called Mr. Tatsumura.

119
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,125
What's the change over the moment the name Tatsumura was mentioned?

120
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:33,925
I came here to film the preparation process.

121
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,025
The preparation process?

122
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,625
Did Mr. Tatsumura give you permission to do that?

123
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,425
"Seiichi Orita, Daisuke Kosugi" -Just what the heck is on his mind?

124
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,825
How can he make such a stupid promise on his own.

125
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:46,725
I'm sorry to say that we cannot show anyone the preparation process.

126
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,125
You can't? But...

127
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,725
The greatest enemy for the sake making process

128
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:53,925
is bacterial contamination from outside.

129
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,225
So, no one other than the one who makes the sake

130
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,125
is allowed inside during the process.

131
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,425
I guess so.

132
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,125
It's true that people are carriers of various bacteria.

133
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,125
That's common sense.

134
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:10,825
I'm sorry, I took on the interview because I love distilled spirits,

135
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,125
but how ignorant of me.

136
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,125
We're not angry at you.

137
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,825
We're pissed at Manager Tatsumura.

138
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:21,425
Hey, what's all the shouting about, Kosugi.

139
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:22,925
-Mr. Tatsumura. -Mr. Tatsumura.

140
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:25,025
"Shinsuke Tatsumura (45)" -Well, well, it sure looks like

141
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,725
"Takakuma Brewey Manager" -I'm not very welcome here?

142
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,925
Are you Ms. Maezono?

143
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,925
Yes.

144
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,525
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

145
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:38,625
You see, the physical exam took longer than I expected...

146
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,425
I'm sure you're surprised at how small our brewery is.

147
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:43,025
Oh, sort of...

148
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,625
But, we're thinking of re-building it,

149
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,425
so that we can mechanize everything in order to mass produce.

150
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:51,925
You mean, Takakuma?

151
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,525
Mass produce...

152
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,025
Mr. Tatsumura, I've told you time and again

153
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,625
that we're not thinking of doing something like that.

154
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,025
Mass production will surely bring down the quality of its taste.

155
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,925
As you can see, we've got a stubborn president.

156
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,525
Distilled spirits is the "in" thing now.

157
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,525
If we don't mass produce now and make big cash, what's in it for us.

158
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:14,025
I think it's not a very good idea to mass produce.

159
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:20,025
I'll think about whether I really want to interview this situation.

160
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,925
Goodbye.

161
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:24,025
Wait, I figured it would have advertising benefits

162
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,325
and I was counting on it too.

163
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:30,025
Why don't you try to love the liquor of your brewery a little more?

164
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,025
You're not even thinking

165
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,425
about possibility of the taste of Takakuma being spoiled.

166
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:35,125
I can't allow that!

167
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,225
Okay, shall we all go back to work too, then.

168
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,425
Even if it's not brought in from the outside,

169
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,225
unwanted bacteria is already inside from some time in the past.

170
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,825
Unwanted bacteria, talking about me.

171
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:49,925
I tell you, you're all the same.

172
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:54,425
I'm against mechanizing the making of hand-made sake too.

173
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,525
Who are you?

174
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:58,925
Thank you for everything today.

175
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,925
Wait up, if I remember correctly...

176
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:09,825
That's right! You're the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri!

177
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,325
You're just the guy.

178
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,125
Wait, please wait!

179
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,025
An image character to advertise the product?

180
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,925
I was looking for someone

181
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,925
who would match the image of our product.

182
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,125
If you agree to accept to do it,

183
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,925
I'll send you as much sake as you want.

184
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,325
You mean that Takakuma?

185
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,325
Dad, don't tell me that you're going to?

186
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:34,225
Well, but, you see...

187
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:38,425
When it comes to sake, he's got super weak will power.

188
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:41,925
That's right, I'll take you around tomorrow.

189
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,425
It's my day off,

190
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,425
so I'll treat you to some place good to eat.

191
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,925
Please do accept my offer, okay, okay?

192
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,925
Mr. Mouri, let me do that for you.

193
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,225
Mrs. Shiraishi.

194
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,825
It's a token of my gratitude for you liking our sake so much.

195
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,125
Please let me take you around.

196
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:05,325
Well, I guess a woman guide is more enjoyable.

197
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,925
I guess I'll leave it up to Mrs. Shiraishi then,

198
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:11,125
and relax as I was planning to anyway.

199
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,025
Mr. Mouri, I'll be waiting for a good answer.

200
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,325
Dad!

201
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,925
Why didn't you refuse him flatly?

202
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:32,825
It's Takamori Saigo, awesome!

203
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,925
Goodness, you always avoid things you can't handle.

204
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:40,525
But for some reason I don't like that man called Mr. Tatsumura.

205
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,125
The others don't seem to like him much either.

206
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:47,225
It is more than that.

207
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:49,325
He utterly despised.

208
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:53,725
But why do Mr. and Mrs. Shirashi keep him as a staff?

209
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:02,247
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

210
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,947
The winds on Sakurajima are blowing quite strongly today.

211
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:09,447
They even forecast the direction of the wind in Kagoshima.

212
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,847
Oh, yeah.

213
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,147
I wonder for what, though?

214
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,447
Because ashes come falling.

215
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:19,647
-Good morning. -Good morning.

216
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:23,647
The ashes of Sakurajima ride the wind and fly,

217
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:25,647
so hanging the laundry out when the wind is blowing

218
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,947
would be a disaster, right?

219
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,647
So that's why the direction of the wind is a problem.

220
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,447
I wonder if ashes will come flying today too?

221
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,147
Nobody knows,

222
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:36,847
because the wind's capricious.

223
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:40,347
Wow, how'd they write it?

224
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:44,147
-Mrs. Shiraishi? -Yes?

225
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:48,747
How come the man called Mr. Tatsumura doesn't get fired?

226
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,547
What the heck's the matter with you, brat?

227
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,847
Conan!

228
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:55,247
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:58,547
I guess even a child would think there's something strange about it.

230
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:01,547
But, we can't fire him

231
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,347
because we owe a lot to him from the past.

232
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,147
Owe a lot to him from the past?

233
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:09,947
Our brewery has a history.

234
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:13,347
But, we're a small brewery without a name to begin with,

235
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:16,347
so our product didn't sell too well...

236
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:20,747
If things were left as is, we would've been out of business long ago.

237
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,247
We somehow made it to where we are now,

238
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:25,747
thanks to Mr. Tatsumura who is in charge of sales

239
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,447
going all out selling our products.

240
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,247
Still, we are unable to face up

241
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,847
to the major manufacturer's production ability

242
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,747
of low profit high sales way of business.

243
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:42,347
We were finally faced with going out of business 10 years ago,

244
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,647
that was 5 years before I got married.

245
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,347
Back then, my father-in-law, the predecessor, and my husband,

246
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:53,347
who was still an apprentice, came to a decision...

247
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:56,447
If this was to be it,

248
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,347
they decided to do as they really wished to do.

249
00:13:58,347 --> 00:13:59,947
And that was to be really particular about the ingredients

250
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,647
and the method the sake is made.

251
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,647
They decided to close the Takakuma Brewery

252
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,547
only after they made the best liquor they could ever make.

253
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,547
And that's the Takakuma.

254
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,047
Yes. And,

255
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,147
it was recognized as "genuine".

256
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:15,247
Everybody's waiting for the real thing.

257
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,747
But, in winter of last year,

258
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:18,347
because of his long years of strain from worry,

259
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:19,547
the predecessor passed away...

260
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:24,247
Don't you forget what we decided on 10 years ago.

261
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,247
Yes, sir!

262
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:29,147
That's about when a change came about Mr. Tatsumura.

263
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,547
What? Mass production?

264
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,847
Customer's come asking for the brand name Takakuma.

265
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,947
They wouldn't know the difference if the quality of taste drops a little.

266
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:40,147
Business! Business!

267
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,547
What a thing to say.

268
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,247
Are you going to allow him to talk like that, president?

269
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,847
He's going to spoil our liquor.

270
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:47,447
We'd better drive him out of here.

271
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,047
Dear.

272
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:54,047
I can't. We were rescued from going out of business thanks to him.

273
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:57,047
We're obliged to him and I will never forget that.

274
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,947
You sure are stubborn.

275
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:03,147
My husband is not really all that good at getting ahead.

276
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:04,947
He never forgets what someone has done for him.

277
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,547
He sure is a man of Statsuma.

278
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,047
He's fantastic.

279
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:14,147
Mr. Mouri, please refuse what Mr. Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday.

280
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,247
If a famous person like you, Mr. Mouri

281
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:20,847
cooperates with advertising the product, he can't lose.

282
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,247
I'm sure that he will force his way through

283
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,847
to mechanizing the process and start mass production.

284
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,547
I see.

285
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:30,447
You decided to take over showing me around

286
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:33,247
to ask me not to listen to him.

287
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,647
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,547
Well, I was planning to refuse anyway!

289
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,847
Of course, from the very start...

290
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,547
Isn't it?

291
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,547
Mr. Tatsumura lives in Kagoshima city.

292
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,647
I'm glad, he seems to be home.

293
00:15:58,147 --> 00:15:59,947
6:00 pm.

294
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,947
Does Mr. Tatsumura have a family?

295
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:04,947
No, he lives alone.

296
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,547
It's open.

297
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:12,047
I'll go check inside.

298
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,747
Mr. Tatsumura, this is Fumiko.

299
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,047
Doesn't something feel sandy?

300
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,947
Now that you mentioned it...

301
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,447
It's probably the ashes.

302
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,847
Oh no.

303
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,647
His car's not here.

304
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:33,047
Mrs. Shiraishi!

305
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:35,647
What's the matter?

306
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,147
This is...

307
00:16:46,747 --> 00:16:47,847
It's blood.

308
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:50,647
Don't tell me it's... Mr. Tatsumura's?

309
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,147
I can imagine just about what happened.

310
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,947
When Mr. Tatsumura was relaxing on his day off...

311
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,147
Judging from the circumstances,

312
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,447
this is a case of kidnapping.

313
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,447
And, when you all came here,

314
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:26,247
the fact that the lights were on

315
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,747
means that he was taken away some time after sundown.

316
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:32,047
I can give a more exact time.

317
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:36,447
When I confirmed the time, the blood stain wasn't dry yet.

318
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,747
That means the time of the murder

319
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:41,047
was right before 6:00 when we found him.

320
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:44,747
I see, Ohatakeyama, pursue the car on the double.

321
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:45,747
Yes, sir!

322
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:53,147
Weren't you a nurse at the Chuo Hospital before?

323
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,147
Yes. I was, until 5 years ago when I got married.

324
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,447
So you are the nurse I saw back then.

325
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,447
-Hurry up and get going! -Yes, sir!

326
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,347
"Shiroyama Grand Hotel"

327
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:11,247
I'm sorry I got you messed up in something bothersome.

328
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,047
You must be worried.

329
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,047
He may have been a bit of trouble,

330
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,747
but after all Mr. Tatsumura did help you out so...

331
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:22,147
If the kidnapper is after money,

332
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:24,647
he'll surely call to demand ransom.

333
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,747
When he does, we'll nail him...

334
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:32,247
However, there was no contact from the kidnapper the following day.

335
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,547
I wonder why the kidnapper's not making contact?

336
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:40,547
And, another day went by...

337
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:43,447
The prefectural police received an anonymous call,

338
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:47,447
saying that Mr. Tatsumura, would be found at Terayama Park in the city.

339
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,747
Mr. Tatsumura!

340
00:18:55,747 --> 00:19:00,347
This is not a place where people would normally set foot in.

341
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,047
The caller was probably the killer.

342
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,347
The voice seems to have been a made-up voice,

343
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:06,147
in which you could not make out the gender.

344
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:09,347
Kidnap and murder... what a guy.

345
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,247
Dead for two days?

346
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,447
Yes, according to the result of the autopsy,

347
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:18,047
he was killed two days ago, that is on that day.

348
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,647
Two days having past,

349
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:23,147
it's hard to determine an accurate estimate,

350
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,547
but there seems to be no doubt that the time of death

351
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:27,447
is between sundown to night that day.

352
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,047
The cause of his death was from a blow to the back of his head

353
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:32,847
and he seems to have died instantly with one blow.

354
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,547
What?

355
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:38,347
The figurine that was on the floor of the living room,

356
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:41,847
the traces on the figurine and his head matched perfectly

357
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,747
and the blood stains that were found

358
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:48,747
were Mr. Tatsumura's so it's no doubt that it is the murder weapon.

359
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,247
Wait a minute.

360
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,247
If Mr. Tatsumura died instantly with one blow to his head,

361
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,347
it means that the killer didn't strike him

362
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,847
and pass him out,

363
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,747
then take him away but...

364
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,447
killed him on the spot, took him away

365
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,347
and abandoned his car at the park, dead body and all.

366
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:08,247
Then, two days later today, the killer,

367
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:09,947
calls from his side to notify the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

368
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,747
That's the story.

369
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,547
There must be some reason why the killer

370
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,847
went out of the way to carry Mr. Tatsumura out of the house.

371
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,647
Moreover, the killer notified the police of Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

372
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,847
But, why?

373
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,647
And, according the report by the forensic officers,

374
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,447
all the doors and windows of Mr. Tatsumura's house

375
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:30,447
had no traces of being forced opened.

376
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,947
Besides, the locks to his house were all special types

377
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:36,447
that spare keys could not be made.

378
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:39,947
If so, how did the killer make it into the house?

379
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,947
There is only one way.

380
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,447
That is, the killer and Mr. Tatsumura knew each other.

381
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,047
As to this case,

382
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,747
no cash had been stolen, so it is not a case of robbery.

383
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:56,047
The only thing thinkable is a grudge.

384
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,847
Somebody hated him enough to want to kill him.

385
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:01,147
And, moreover, it was someone who was around him.

386
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,447
Which means...

387
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,747
What? The killer is among us?

388
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:14,147
We can't find anybody who had a grudge against Mr. Tatsumura

389
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,047
other than the people of this brewery.

390
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:20,247
Then, why do I have to be suspected too?

391
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:22,847
We know that you held ill feelings against Mr. Tatsumura

392
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,747
from the information we got asking around.

393
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,247
No.

394
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:31,247
Of course we had a grudge against him. We all did, but...

395
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,647
He was killed at sundown the day before yesterday, right?

396
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:38,947
Then, all of us here were in the brewery working.

397
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,947
I thought I already told you

398
00:21:42,947 --> 00:21:44,347
that everyone was working and...

399
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:49,947
It could be that you're all matching your story up together too.

400
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,447
And, Ms. Maezono,

401
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,147
since you say that you were in your hotel room alone,

402
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,147
your alibi hasn't been backed up yet.

403
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,347
We don't want to suspect any of you,

404
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:05,947
but what Officer Shinfuku is saying abides to logical reasoning.

405
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,147
Dad!

406
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:11,247
It's true that no one here has a definite alibi.

407
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,747
And, everyone hates Mr. Tatsumura.

408
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,947
I'll bet Mrs. Shiraishi is in agony,

409
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:20,747
being that everyone close to her is being suspected.

410
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,247
But...

411
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:30,747
I'm sure the killer is among the people here.

412
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,847
"Next Episode" -Sake is a "living creature."

413
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:03,147
Once you start preparing it,

414
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,347
you can't take your eyes off it.

415
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:07,447
That's why you can't do something

416
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,347
like leave the brewery to go kill someone.

417
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,047
You can't do something like that, can you?

418
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:12,747
Getting right to the point,

419
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:15,047
that stuff was not found on his clothes at all.

420
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,347
Well... so the killer is...

421
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:22,747
Pops, this is your chance to show everyone your real ability.

422
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,147
I guess.

423
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:25,547
Next Conan,

424
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,547
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma (Part 2)"

425
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:32,374
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:34,674
"Physical examination"

427
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,874
In the next episode, the case in Kagoshima is solved.

428
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:39,374
-Can I still drink? -Dad!
