00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:10,899
From the pictures that Mitsuhiko and the others took,

5
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:15,099
we were able to figure out that Ran was accompanying a little girl.

6
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,699
In that same picture, there was a silhouette of

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,899
a suspicious looking figure following their tracks too.

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,799
We are told by Heiji Hattori who we coincidentally run into

9
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:25,299
that the girl is Haruna Tabuse

10
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:27,999
that he had been asked to search for.

"Haruna Tabuse (8), daughter of the president of a restaurant franchise"

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,699
The day before, a sculpture called...

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,899
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -the "Rainbow Child" was stolen

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,199
from the art museum that Haruna's father owns,

15
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:38,499
and Haruna disappeared along with it.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,999
We learn from Dolphin Trainer Yui, an acquaintance of Haruna,

17
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:47,699
that the sculptor of the "Rainbow Child"

18
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:50,699
is actually Haruna's mother who is living apart from her now.

19
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,699
Using the letter from her mother as a clue,

20
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,299
we pursued our search for the two girls.

21
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,899
But, at about the same time...

22
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,299

but Ran was nowhere in sight,

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,020
nor was the suspicious man found.

36
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,520
Sorry, Ran.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,120
If I could only move the way I wanted to...

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,820
We went to the police over here just in case.

39
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,420
Mr. Tabuse and the others went to the hospital.

40
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,720
I see.

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm sorry this happened despite me being there.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,320
Don't be. I should've realized earlier myself.

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,820
The reason Haruna didn't go to

44
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,320
the Kinosaki Literary Art Museum was probably

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,220
because of the letter from her mother that had written,

46
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,220
"I ran into my best friend at Kinosaki Literary Art Museum,"

47
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,320
but she couldn't read the words "Kinosaki Literary Art Museum".

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,320
But she was able to read the word "straw".

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
So she used that as a hint

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,720
and headed for the Kinosaki Traditional Straw Craft Museum.

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,720
She went to the ropeway station at the top of the mountain

52
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
for the same reason too.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,020
Haruna could only read the word "station"

54
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,320
of the "Kinosaki Hot Spring Station" that was written.

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,620
So she put the work "mountain" that was written nearby together,

56
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,420
and thought it read mountain top station.

57
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,920
We were staking out at Kinosaki Hot Spring Station,

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,220
so were late getting to the mountain top station.

59
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,520
I tell you children do things that you can't figure out.

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Heiji, nothing was in Haruna's knapsack was there?

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,120
No, but it's hard to believe that

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,320
the culprit got hold of the "Rainbow Child" either.

63
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah. If so, he wouldn't have had to kidnap Ran.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,820
Haruna probably hid the "Rainbow Child" somewhere.

65
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,020
So, it's most likely that Haruna's the one

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,720
who took the "Rainbow Child" from the museum.

67
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,220

What brings you here?

70
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm good friends with the hospital head here,

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,420
so he let me know.

72
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,020
How's Haruna?

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,220
I took the "Rainbow Child"?

74
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,720
Don't be ridiculous!

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,620
I would never do something like that!

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,920
Please be quiet.

77
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,620
This is a hospital, you know.

78
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Where were you all this time?

79
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
At Michiko's...

80
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,620
Mother.

81
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,520
At any rate, I want the "Rainbow Child" back!

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,920
That belongs to our art museum!

83
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,220
I just told you I didn't take it!

84
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
Please cut it out!

85
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,420
Shut up! It's none of your business!

86
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,820
It sure is my business!

87
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,320
My daughter got messed up in this too, you know?

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,820
Just what do you mean?

89
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,420
Would you tell me a little about what happened?

90
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,620
It can't be...

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,420
Shoots!

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Please! Wait, Haruna!

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Gee, you still insist on following me?

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,520
I switched off the phone like you told me too,

95
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,720
and won't tell anybody about you.

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,420
I'll take you home,

97
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,120
so let's go home to where your mom and dad are.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,720
There's nobody at home.

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,020
Huh?

100
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,620
Mother got divorced and left leaving me behind!

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,320
Dad is all work day after day too

102
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,220
and probably doesn't care at all about me.

103
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,920
I see. As for me,

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,720
my mother and father has been living away from each other

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,620
-since I was little, you see. -Huh?

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,520
I think I kind of understand a little of how you feel, Haruna.

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
So...

108
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,120
So, if you don't do as I say,

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,420
this lady here is going to get it.

110
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
Ran.

111
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,620
Bingo! Haruna's moving!

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Okay! Heiji, I'm counting on you, so don't lose her!

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,020
If the culprit kidnapped Ran

114
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,420
because he couldn't get hold of the "Rainbow Child",

115
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,720
Haruna will sure move just as the culprit tells her to!

116
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Just as we deduced!

117
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,320
She seems to have seen us!

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,820
Driver.

119
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,320
It's starting to look like work for we,

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,220
the Youth Detective Squad, isn't it?

121
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,020
We'll rescue Ran!

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Huh?

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,320
My badge is gone! I don't have it!

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,220
Maybe you dropped it at the hot spring?

125
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,020
What? Oh, no!

126
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Somebody... Somebody help me!

127
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,420
This... Ayumi dropped it.

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,120
The Youth Detective Squad badge.

129
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,220
-My badge... -Who is it from?

130
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,820
It's Conan?

131
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,720
Maybe it's my badge?

132
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,520
Wait!

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,220
I hear something.

134
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,120
The sound of drums is heard from the badge?

135
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
Maybe it's Ran.

136
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,620
Right! If I remember correctly...

137
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,620
13:00... This is it!

138
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,420
Mirage!

139
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,220
"Mirage" -They sound the drums to tell time at 13:00!

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,720
Ran is probably in Izushi!

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,620
"Izushi"

142
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,620
Mother and child stone statue?

143
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,520
Haruna went to pray there?

144
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,020
Yeah, I don't know what you really call it,

145
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,220
but it's a shabby looking old stone statue

146
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,620
and it's carrying a baby in its arms.

147
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,520
At Kinosaki, Haruna was praying to

148
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,320
the goddess of child birth and children.

149
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,420
And at the mountain top ropeway station

150
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,520
is the Benevolent Mother Guyanin.

151
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,120
And this time, it's the stone statue of mother and child.

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,920
Could it be that...

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,620
It seems that you're thinking the same thing I am too, Kudo.

154
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah. Then Haruna's purpose is...

155
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Just what're they talking about?

156
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,920
"Sukyo Temple"

157
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,820
"Izushi Meiji Museum"

158
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,420
"Izushi Chief Retainer's House"

159
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,920
"Playhouse"

160
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Shoots!

161
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
-Go around the back! -Okay!

162
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,420
You lost her?

163
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,420
What? Just what do you guys think you're doing?

164
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,620
Pops, calm down!

165
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,020
Those stone stairs were really tough as expected, weren't they?

166
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
Really!

167
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,720
My calves are all swollen.

168
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,320
I wonder how many steps those stairs have?

169
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,820
Hey, look, look.

170
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,220
It says the place we just went to is called "Gonbei-san"!

171
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,520
Gonbei?

172
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,020
How interesting.

173
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,420
Gonbei-san?

174
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,120
What is it? Do you hear something?

175
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,620
Do you want to go to Gonbei-san?

176
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,120
-Driver, do you know Gonbei-san? -Yes.

177
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
-Please take us there! -Sure.

178
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Ran, hang on!

179
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,420
I see! This is it!

180
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I've finally figured out the truth of this case!

181
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,426
"Izushi Castle Ruins"

182
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,626
I can't go any farther.

183
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,326
I'm starved and can't move.

184
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,826
You two are have no guts!

185
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:34,526
"Kannoden"

186
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,026
This is Kannoden!

187
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,126
Why is this called Gonbei-san?

188
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,326
That's because this Kannoden is dedicated to

189
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:50,026
an ancient Izushi feudal lord named Gonbei Hidehisa.

190
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,526
That's why it's called Gonbei-san.

191
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:55,026
Maybe that detective agency daughter is somewhere nearby.

192
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:59,726
Shoots!

193
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,226
What's with her?

194
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,726
It's those women again?

195
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,226
What is it?

196
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:11,826
Move out of the way, please!

197
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,526
-Move out of the way! -Just what do you think you're doing?

198
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,126
Get in!

199
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:21,726
-Where's Ran? -Hurry!

200
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:31,626
He got away!

201
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,626
After that car!

202
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:42,926
Move! Move out of the way, please!

203
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,326
I've got no choice but to go!

204
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,526
Hey!

205
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:52,126
I won't let you get away!

206
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,426
Where's the brat...

207
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,626
Where'd he go?

208
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:30,926
"Michiko Sagara (35), straw craft craftsman"

209
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,526
Aunty!

210
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,226
Haruna?

211
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,226
Aunty!

212
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,526
You've got the thing that mother asked you to keep for her, right?

213
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,726
From Natsuho?

214
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:43,626
You mean this?

215
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,726
I finally found it!

216
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:58,726
-Were you looking for this? -Yep!

217
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,026
What's that?

218
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,626
I told you to take me where the "Rainbow Child" was!

219
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,326
Just who are you?

220
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,826
You can't separate them!

221
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,826
If you're going to take it away,

222
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,026
I want you to take this one with it, too!

223
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,326
What is she talking about?

224
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,626
Exactly what she just said.

225
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,026
You're...

226
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:22,226
Haruna, you were looking for it all this time, weren't you?

227
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:26,226
I'll bet it's a pair with the "Rainbow Child" statue?

228
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,226
Who are you?

229
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,226
Conan Edogawa.

230
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,826
A detective.

231
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:36,726
A detective? You've gotta be kidding!

232
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,626
Michiko, I'm taking a break...

233
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,326
Yui!

234
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,526
Wait!

235
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,226
I finally found you!

236
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,026
Sorry, we took a while.

237
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,126
Ran, are you okay?

238
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,526
Darn it! Let me go!

239
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:10,526
Let go! You brat! Let me go!

240
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:12,126
Conan!

241
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,126
Darn it!

242
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,226
Oh no!

243
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:16,326
Hold it!

244
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:31,426
Are you all right, Conan?

245
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:33,426
Yep. Ran, how about you?

246
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,126
Yep, I'm fine!

247
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,426
I guess you are.

248
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:39,226
Ran...

249
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:40,426
Dad!

250
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:43,326
Ran! Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?

251
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:44,626
Yep.

252
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,426
I'm glad! I'm really glad!

253
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,226
Dad.

254
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,426
Don't cry.

255
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:54,526
What's going on?

256
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,726
Ko-chan?

257
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,326
Ko-chan, just what do you think you're doing?

258
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:05,226
I mean, I was looking for you all this time!

259
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,926
Hey! Say something, will you?

260
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,626
Ko-chan...

261
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:14,126
I'm very sorry!

262
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:16,126
I'm sorry for trouble he caused!

263
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,026
You're so stupid!

264
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,326
How can you do something like this,

265
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:20,726
be it that you have to pay back debts!

266
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:22,626
I'm sorry, Yui.

267
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,126
He may be stupid, but he's not a bad guy!

268
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:30,026
So, please let him go, just this time! Please!

269
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:33,626
Why'd you do something like this?

270
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,526
The fact is, I was asked to do this.

271
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:39,426
Mr. Mouri refused to let me have a close up interview with him,

272
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,726
and I was at a loss what to do.

273
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:47,826
That person you're talking about, isn't it Mr. Kamaike?

274
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,326
Huh? How do you know?

275
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:53,526
Mr. Kamaike? You mean the head of the museum?

276
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:58,626
Isn't it about time you come out? Mr. Kamaike!

277
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,326
I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:03,926
Mr. Kamaike!

279
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:08,826
I had Mr. Yumoto write an article about the museum.

280
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,626
But I just happened to pass by here.

281
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,026
Mr. Kamaike.

282
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,626
The man in this picture isn't Mr. Yumoto!

283
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:20,626
Because Mr. Yumoto was doing a close up interview of Pops at that time.

284
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,426
This is you, right?

285
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:25,526
Stop making ridiculous stories up!

286
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:29,026
Mr. Kamaike, I'll bet you knew about it

287
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,426
from the materials in the reference museum or something.

288
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,826
That there was a statue of a mother

289
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,226
that was to paired with the "Rainbow Child."

290
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:38,426
And, also that Haruna was trying to bring together

291
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:40,826
the "Rainbow Child" statue with that of the mother statue.

292
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:42,626
So you deliberately made it easy for her to steal the statue

293
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:44,726
when you re-decorated the exhibited items.

294
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:48,326
You lured Haruna into stealing the "Rainbow Child" statue.

295
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,526
Then you followed Haruna

296
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:54,926
and found the statue of the mother.

297
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,926
But when Pops came together with Heiji,

298
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,826
you got flustered, right?

299
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,426
So, he tried to get you, Mr. Yumoto

300
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,026
to at least get a hold of the "Rainbow Children".

301
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:12,226
Right! But Haruna didn't have the "Rainbow Child".

302
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,826
And that's why I kidnapped that girl.

303
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:18,826
Will you cut it out?

304
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,726
Or, do you have some kind of evidence or something?

305
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,726
What's that stain on your slacks?

306
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:27,626
What about this?

307
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,726
Genta, you bumped into the man wearing sunglasses, right?

308
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:32,826
Yeah.

309
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,126
He's the one who spoiled my crab ice!

310
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:37,926
What about it?

311
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,126
Mitsuhiko, your badge is so dirty

312
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,326
Yeah, the ice melted and spilled.

313
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:46,826
That stain, maybe it's...

314
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,626
What?

315
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,426
That's indeed the smell of my crab ice!

316
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,226
Perfect match!

317
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,526
In other words, it means that

318
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:03,026
you're the man wearing sunglasses that bumped into him!

319
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,826
Admit it already.

320
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:11,926
I embezzled money from the art museum and used it.

321
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:14,726
So I was planning to sell off the "Rainbow Child"

322
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,826
and the "Mother" statue that was still not made public

323
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,826
and get rid of the deficit!

324
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:24,826
The "Rainbow Child" statue was hidden

325
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:27,326
in the coin locker of Kinosaki Hot Spring Station

326
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,926
from the time Haruna had come to Kinosaki.

327
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,426
How nice!

328
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:39,126
It's fantastic!

329
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,026
You can say that again.

330
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:49,926
-How splendid! -Yep!

331
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,126
You go and tell her things you don't have to,

332
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,626
that's why she ends up doing something like this!

333
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,826
Speak for yourself.

334
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,626
You don't take care of her like you should, that's why...

335
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,726
What? You're to blame for leaving home capriciously!

336
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:01,626
That's because you never listen to what I have to say!

337
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,126
Please stop!

338
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,026
Don't you still see

339
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:09,826
why Haruna took the "Rainbow Child"?

340
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,626
She was lonely

341
00:21:12,626 --> 00:21:14,526
because she was living away from her mother

342
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:17,326
and her father was busy with work everyday.

343
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,026
That's why she thought that by bringing the two statues together,

344
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:23,626
she could maybe bring her separated family back together again.

345
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:24,726
That's what she was thinking

346
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:27,326
while carrying the "Rainbow Child" around!

347
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,926
It's almost like...

348
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:33,926
Almost like a stork that brings along happiness.

349
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,926
Mommy! Daddy!

350
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:39,526
Haruna!

351
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:41,926
Haruna!

352
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,226
I'm sorry, Haruna!

353
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:46,626
Haruna!

354
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:48,826
Mommy...

355
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,726
Mommy!

356
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:57,826
Haruna, I'm sorry!

357
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,726
Daddy!

358
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,526
Daddy! Mommy!

359
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,626
Haruna.

360
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:34,526
"Misato Park of the Storks"

361
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:43,626
Hey, look! Daddy! Mommy!

362
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:46,826
They are so many of them!

363
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:50,226
I wish we'd be like that one day, too.

364
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,526
They're flying off!

365
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:09,026
"Next Episode"

366
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:11,626
No good! They won't make it!

367
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:16,126
The two cars we saw at the convenience store are both ruined.

368
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:19,826
The front part of this car is reinforced by a grill guard.

369
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:24,526
Come on, stop going here and there, Dad will scold you!

370
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:27,226
So, the case is closed!

371
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,526
I'm counting on you, Ran.

372
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:35,433
Next Conan, "The Intersection of Fear"

373
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:53,478
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:55,378
"Rainbow"

375
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,278
What? It's going to be aired at 18:00 on Saturday?

376
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,378
I mean, "rainbow".
