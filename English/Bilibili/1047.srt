00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:03,128
(Mouri Detective Agency)

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,422
Red Sheep?

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:09,000
( Ryouta Beppu (20) )
My girlfriend has been kidnapped by Red Sheep.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,650
Please save her, Detective!

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,050
Calm down, now!

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:17,450
Who or what is this Red Sheep?

7
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,519
This is Red Sheep.

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,980
Just what is it?

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't know their real identity.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,850
It's just that my girlfriend

11
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:31,114
once told me
her ex-boyfriend was a scary guy,

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,535
so it might be him.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,900
A threat?

14
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,540
"I have abducted Ami Takigawa."

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,150
The Ami mentioned in the threat
is my girlfriend.

16
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,213
She and I both work part-time
at a restaurant called La Mucho.

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,506
La Mucho?

18
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,220
"If you want Ami to return to you safely,"

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,725
"come alone to Beika Park
at 12 a.m. tonight."

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,400
"Absolutely do not inform the police."

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,605
"By Red Sheep."

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,607
Is that all?

23
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,608
Yes.

24
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,526
Did they ask for any ransom?

25
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,737
No.

26
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,406
No?

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,409
Red Sheep...

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,038
I feel like I've seen them a long time ago.

29
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,150
I'm pretty sure there was a Red Sheep

30
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,505
somewhere deep in my memories.

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,424
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

32
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,426
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,220
The kidnapper is the Red Sheep?

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,820
An ominous incident
behind the scenes of a video!

35
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,431
He sees through the one and only truth.

36
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,308
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

37
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,602
His name is Detective Conan!

38
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:30,900
"The Red Sheep's Ominous Game (Part 1)"

39
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,101
If the kidnapper didn't ask for any ransom,

40
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,520
what do they want?

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, no!

42
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,327
Ryota!

43
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
Ami?

44
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:13,127
Here's Ryota,
the guy who has come to save me!

45
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,840
Where's Red Sheep?

46
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,300
(Ami Takigawa (20), La Mucho employee)

47
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,150
(Ami Takigawa (20), La Mucho employee)
Who are you, mister?

48
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,931
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

49
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,808
A detective?

50
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,810
I was the one who hired him.

51
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,728
I'd be too scared on my own.

52
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,313
What?

53
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,108
But I wanted you to come by yourself!

54
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,111
Weren't you kidnapped?

55
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,560
That's right! I thought you were...

56
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,000
This is a game, Mr. Detective.

57
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,828
A game?

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,413
That's right!

59
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,207
It's the Red Sheep game,
designed to test a boyfriend's

60
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,209
courage and love for his girlfriend!

61
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,500
It's trending on social media right now!

62
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,410
Is that so?

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,340
Don't scare me like that, Ami.

64
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,300
Yeah!

65
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,721
I'm sorry, Ryota.

66
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,015
Okay.

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,101
- Are you angry with me?
- I'm not angry at all.

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,310
Will you forgive me?

69
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,600
Stop fooling around!

70
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,733
What kind of game is this?

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,319
I've been hard at work
with Ryota's feelings in mind!

72
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,238
I don't care if you are lovebirds!

73
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:29,329
What's so fun about toying
with other people's feelings?

74
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,008
This is bad! It's almost midnight!

75
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,135
Conan.

76
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,000
Where are you going this late at night?

77
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,937
I was just curious about Red Sheep.

78
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,700
What about you, Ran?

79
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,611
Actually, I was also curious about Red Sheep.

80
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,335
What is that?

81
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,904
What's going on, Conan?

82
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,504
Call the police and an ambulance!

83
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,139
Goodness!

84
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,904
Ran! Conan!

85
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,050
Dad!

86
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,150
Inspector, is it a murder?

87
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:36,400
Yes. Ran and Conan were the first to witness it.

88
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,541
Did you see the culprit?

89
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,127
I don't know if they were the culprit,

90
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,004
but we saw Red Sheep.

91
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,923
Red Sheep?

92
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,720
It's a costume.

93
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,300
We saw someone wearing a sheep costume
running away from us.

94
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,300
Don't you see the marks left
by the horns on the ceiling?

95
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,300
Have you identified the victim?

96
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,200
Tetsusaburo Wakabayashi, 45 years old.

97
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,236
(Tetsusaburou Wakabayashi (45) )
He was the owner and head cook of a restaurant

98
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,300
(Tetsusaburou Wakabayashi (45) )
called La Mucho.

99
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,531
La Mucho?

100
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,911
She and I both work part-time
at a restaurant called La Mucho.

101
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,300
Those two.

102
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,210
What's the matter, Mouri?

103
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,340
Inspector, please leave this case to me.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,133
Mouri?

105
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,304
It looks like the restaurant
where Mr. Beppu works part-time is involved.

106
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,807
(La Mucho)

107
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,601
(Temporarily Closed)

108
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,938
(Kokichi Mukai (45),
La Mucho assistant head cook)

109
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,902
(Daiki Kamio (25), La Mucho cook)

110
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,739
This is the knife that was used
as the murder weapon.

111
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,622
This is the head cook's knife, isn't it?

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,040
This is Wakabayashi's knife?

113
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,002
That would mean

114
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:09,632
Wakabayashi was stabbed to death
by his own kitchen knife.

115
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,300
And you are...

116
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm Hirasawa, one of the managers.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,603
( Motojirou Hirasawa (40) )
I'm Hirasawa, one of the managers.

118
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,600
( Motojirou Hirasawa (40) )
Is it true that Wakabayashi was killed?

119
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Is it true that Wakabayashi was killed?

120
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,520
Yes.

121
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,404
Excuse me, but where were you
around midnight last night?

122
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,400
I was working at the office.

123
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,260
I mainly work as an interior designer, so...

124
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,680
Were you by yourself?

125
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,622
- Yes.
- In other words,

126
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,150
there's no one to confirm your alibi?

127
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,838
Are you suspecting me?

128
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,830
No, we're asking everyone involved.

129
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,302
It was the same with Kamio and me.

130
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,350
Yesterday was a designated off day,
so we were both at home.

131
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,309
Both of us live on our own,

132
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,900
so it's not much of an alibi, is it?

133
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
That's right.

134
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:11,027
Were you riding around on your motorbike
all night again?

135
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,090
I was at home all day yesterday.

136
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,480
I haven't ridden my motorbike
since I had that accident.

137
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,827
Inspector Megure,

138
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,039
wouldn't it be a good idea
to ask them about Red Sheep?

139
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,207
Red Sheep?

140
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,921
Conan and I saw someone
wearing a red sheep costume

141
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,820
run away from the crime scene.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
Is something the matter, Kamio?

143
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,721
No, sir.

144
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,720
Red Sheep has been a popular topic
on video websites lately.

145
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,728
Video websites?

146
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,812
Yes.

147
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,815
Found it. Here you go.

148
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,320
Red Sheep

149
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,738
has been uploading videos of themselves

150
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,406
pranking couples that are on dates

151
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,400
for the last two to three weeks.

152
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,829
Who is behind this Red Sheep?

153
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,206
It's unknown.

154
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,500
The videos were uploaded anonymously, after all.

155
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,003
We saw the same sheep last night!

156
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,004
Isn't that right?

157
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,839
Yes.

158
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,100
It's the same colour and design.

159
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,570
But something is off.

160
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,906
Hey! What are you doing?

161
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,500
Just come in already!

162
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,500
Stop trying to resist!

163
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,510
It's you two.

164
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,139
Who are they?

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,516
They both work front-of-house
on a part-time basis.

166
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,519
Ryota Beppu and Ami Takigawa.

167
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,817
Around the time of the incident,

168
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,821
they dragged me into this Red Sheep game.

169
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,239
A game?

170
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,909
It's a lousy game
where the boyfriend is tested

171
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,900
by sending a fake email threat

172
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,914
so that he would come for his girlfriend.

173
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,410
That's right. It's just a game!

174
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,850
Why do you have to make such a big fuss?

175
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,050
You haven't heard of the incident, then?

176
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,508
Incident?

177
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,136
Wakabayashi, the head cook,

178
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,880
has been stabbed to death
with a kitchen knife.

179
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,514
What?

180
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,710
Red Sheep is the culprit!

181
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,810
That can't be.

182
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,229
Are you suspecting me?

183
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,370
Where were you at midnight last night?

184
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,403
I was at Beika Park
with this detective over here.

185
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,404
Pardon?

186
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
Are you two using me as your alibi?

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,400
No! Why would we kill
the head cook anyway?

188
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,706
Ryota's right!

189
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,417
We've never even talked to the chef,

190
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,710
and I don't think
he even knows what we look like!

191
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,422
Stop making up excuses!

192
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,216
You all work at the same restaurant,

193
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,150
so there's no way
you wouldn't know each other!

194
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,929
No, I don't believe they know each other.

195
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,807
There are more than ten part-timers
working front-of-house,

196
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,800
and Wakabayashi wasn't interested in
anything other than cooking.

197
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,160
He rarely ever went out of the kitchen, either.

198
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
See?

199
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:43,239
If that's the case,
how are Wakabayashi and Red Sheep related?

200
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,116
Why did he have to be stabbed to death?

201
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,204
Aren't you two involved in this after all?

202
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,040
I told you, we're not involved in this!

203
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,190
I was just imitating it
because it was trending on social media!

204
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,214
Is it possible that Mr. Wakabayashi also
received an email threat

205
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,133
saying that his girlfriend
had been kidnapped?

206
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,630
That's not possible.

207
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,929
Wakabayashi was devoted to his job,

208
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,900
and a girlfriend shouldn't be in the picture.

209
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,517
Don't butt in when others are speaking!

210
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,518
Inspector!

211
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,750
It looks like an email threat was sent
to Wakabayashi's home computer.

212
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,525
An email threat?

213
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,236
Yes. It was received at 10 p.m.

214
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,530
The sender was Red Sheep.

215
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,615
Red Sheep?

216
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,835
I have kidnapped Anri.

217
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,504
Bring the 50 million yen ransom to the tunnel

218
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,424
under Beika Bridge at 12 a.m. tonight.

219
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,718
50 million?

220
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,600
If you want Anri to return to you safely,

221
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,936
absolutely do not inform the police.

222
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,021
Do you understand?

223
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:05,821
Is this Anri person Wakabayashi's girlfriend?

224
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,350
I do not know.

225
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,130
It's my first time
hearing that he even had one.

226
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,820
He probably knew her from a dating app.

227
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,050
Dating app?

228
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,709
A month ago,

229
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,502
I recommended a dating app to the chef

230
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,500
because he didn't have any experience with women.

231
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,633
Did he tell you about Anri?

232
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,218
No, not a thing.

233
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,722
He might have wanted to keep it a secret.

234
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,500
So we're left with no clues.

235
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,438
But we now know
the full picture of the incident.

236
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,525
Wakabayashi's girlfriend Anri
was taken hostage,

237
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,237
and he was instructed
to bring a 50 million yen ransom

238
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,530
to the tunnel.

239
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,350
That's what happened.

240
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,412
Ran, the Red Sheep we saw
was carrying a black bag, right?

241
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,415
Yes, you're right.

242
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,560
Could the 50 million yen ransom be inside it?

243
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,131
So that means the culprit stabbed Wakabayashi

244
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,926
and left him to die
while they ran away with the ransom.

245
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,637
That would be extremely cruel of the culprit.

246
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,723
I wonder if Miss Anri is all right.

247
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:19,228
Kamio, what was the head cook to you?

248
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,229
Pardon?

249
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,023
From the way
you recommended a dating app to him,

250
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,734
I'd say you were rather close.

251
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,737
I wouldn't say we're close.

252
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,860
He scolded me every single day.

253
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,117
It was his fault

254
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,620
for sneaking his phone into the kitchen.

255
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,622
I only brought my phone into the kitchen
to record the recipes

256
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,920
because I couldn't memorise them completely!

257
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,127
Of course, that would get you scolded!

258
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,131
I thought he would become more lenient
if he had a girlfriend,

259
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,500
so I suggested that he find one.

260
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,134
I told him that these days,

261
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,303
you could even get married
to someone you met using a dating app.

262
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,432
The head cook was really into it.

263
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,436
When he showed us his profile,

264
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,730
we saw a photo of him
with a smile we'd never seen before.

265
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm pretty sure his display name was "Chef".

266
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,390
"Chef"?

267
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,860
The head cook actually wanted
to run a French restaurant.

268
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,630
So that was why he wanted to be called "Chef".

269
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,150
This restaurant flourished
because we served ethnic food!

270
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,620
I was also the one that decided
that his title should be "Head Cook"!

271
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,090
Wakabayashi should have understood that!

272
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,550
Please calm down.

273
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,600
Could you show me the video
from earlier one more time?

274
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,636
Sure thing.

275
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,517

277
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,231
Nothing.

278
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,400
Say, Ran,

279
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,529
didn't you say that
you saw Red Sheep somewhere a long time ago?

280
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,533
I did, but now I don't remember where I saw it.

281
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,619
How about you take a closer look?

282
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,329
One more time, please, Mr. Kamio.

283
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,206

284

291
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,330
I remember now.

292
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,541
Red Sheep was from back then.

293
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Are you okay?

294
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,629
I remember now.

295
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,132
I know what Red Sheep really is!

I'm Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

And while I'm here, I have something to ask.

317
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,405
I see, so you're investigating Red Sheep.

318
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,534
And here I thought someone was taking it out
of the storehouse again.

319

Taking it out again?

320
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
Yes. There are traces of someone taking it out

321
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,000
in the middle of the night
for the last two or three weeks.

(Beika Costume Rental owner)
by morning time,

324
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,390
so I was unsure
whether to bring it up with the police.

325
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,850
Was it only the red sheep costume
that was taken out?

326
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,806
Yes. It had never been popular
at all until recently,

327
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,500
but someone borrowed it once
three weeks ago.

328
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,650
Three weeks ago?

329
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,440
That's when Red Sheep
started appearing on social media, right?

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,236
It was properly returned the next day, though.

331
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,822
Do you know who borrowed it?

332
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,616
Yes. There's a record of it.

Hey, how did you know it was here?

334
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,412
What about you?

335
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,706
I remembered that

336
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,127
I saw a red sheep at a nearby festival
when I was in kindergarten.

337
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,420
So that's why we came here.

338
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,980
I thought so.

339
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,339
You thought so?

340
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,010
I was in kindergarten when it happened,

341
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,060
so it was before you were born, you know?

342
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,931
You're right.

343
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,811
But I thought I heard the teachers
talking about a festival at school.

344

Here it is.

345
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:02,900
She had invited me
to that festival at the time.

346
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,532

who borrowed the costume.

00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,613

360
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,824
Next Conan,

361
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,911
"The Red Sheep's Ominous Game (Part 2)"

362
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,637

00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,806
"Goat horns"

364
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,808
Now, whose horns are these?

365
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,101
What a mystery. Well, these horns are...
