(Yajima Residence)

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,540
Blown by storm winds, Mt. Mimuro's autumn leaves

5
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,650
have become Tatsuta river's richly hued brocade.

6
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,670
(Ooka, 11)

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,820
We met but for a moment, and I'm...

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,570
The same signature card as your instructor, eh?

9
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,160
This is all thanks to you,

10
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,960
Momiji Ooka.

11
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,160
I'll have to thank you

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,890
when I'm done recording today.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,730
Huh? Well, that was fast. Are they already here?

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,890
I-It's you!

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Why...

16
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,500
D-Don't tell me...

17
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,920
Ahhh!!!

18
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,970
After lying dormant all winter,

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,080
now the spring has come and the flowers are blossoming.

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,850
Now the spring has come and the flowers are blossoming...

21
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,260
On this journey, I have no streamers to offer up.
Instead, dear gods...

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,740
Yikes, the card has reached all the way here.

23
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,210
Oh, please don't bother yourself with it.

24
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,600
Oh, okay...

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Excuse me.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,870
She's so cute!

27
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,680
Father, quiet down!

28
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,110
- She's a beauty!
- She's like an idol!

29
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,040
The kimono looks good on her too!

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,370
Actually, why are we watching karuta here again?

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,390
It's 'cause Mikiko said so!

32
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,350
She told us to wait in the waiting room before the interview.

33
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,930
Still, you, Uncle...

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,250
You were lured in by the pretty lady

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
and entered the studio!

36
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,610
Who's Mikiko?

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,530
Didn't I just introduce her to you?

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,710
The girl in glasses who's playing with the pretty lady!

39
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,970
I'm also a member

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,580
as the president of the karuta club at Kaihou Academy!

41
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,520
You? A member?

42
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,650
Do you even play karuta, Kazuha?

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,390
Yeah, you don't know?

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,300
And what took you so long in the bathroom, Heiji?

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
Sorry 'bout that.

46
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,350
The door to the studio was closed.

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,940
I wasn't sure whether or not to open it.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
- Excuse me.
- Ah.

49
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,840
We're in the middle of a rehearsal,

50
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,550
so could you please keep quiet?

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,060
- Oh...
- Yes...

52
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,210
I thought I would give up my life to hold you in my arms...

53
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,250
- Wow, so cool!
- Hey, Kudo.

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,730
Has this nutcrack forgotten that he came to Osaka

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,290
for the interview?

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,050
Cut him some slack.

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,740
We brought the kids who were begging to see Osaka

58
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,970
because Professor couldn't come due to some business.

59
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,140
By the way...

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,080
what happened to that rich lady?

61
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,210
Oh, Sonoko?

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,230
She's stuck in bed with a cold.

63
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,790
I didn't know

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,900
you're part of the karuta club, Kazuha-chan.

65
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,760
I'm doing it side-by-side with the aikido club!

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,920
The karuta club was on the verge
of shutting down because of the lack of members,

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,220
so I signed up.

68
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,390
Occasionally, I drop by to help Mikiko practice.

69
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,270
Think of me as a zombie member.

70
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,770
A zombie member?

71
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,360
That's so funny.

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,730
You seem to be enjoying yourselves.

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,320
It's as if you're at a cafe.

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,800
Oh... We're sorry.

(Detective Conan
The Crimson Love Letter)

76
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm a high-school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

77
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,180
I went to an amusement park
with my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

78
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,310
and witnessed a suspicious transaction between two men in black.

79
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,070
I was so absorbed in watching them

80
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,780
that I didn't notice another of their group
approaching from behind.

81
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,740
I was made to drink poison by that man,

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,930
and the next time I woke up,

83
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,170
my body shrunk.

84
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,420
If they find out that Kudo Shinichi is alive,

85
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,050
they'll kill me again and put the people around me in danger.

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,970
I, who followed Professor Agasa's advice to conceal my identity,

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,680
was asked by Ran what my name was.

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,350
And I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa on a whim.

89
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,420
To get information on the men in black,

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,450
I moved into Ran's house

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,290
where her father is a detective.

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,650
He's Heiji Hattori.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,700
He's a high-school detective from the west.

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,240
He has the same deductive powers
as the son of the Osaka Prefectural Police Commissioner

95
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,620
and has solved multiple difficult cases.

96
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,700
He's one of the very few people who knows my real identity.

97
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,880
Kazuha Toyama.

98
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,500
She's Hattori's classmate and childhood friend.

99
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,300
Hattori's words

100
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,110
always make her anxious,

101
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,690
wondering what's going to happen next.

102
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,040
And then, the future queen enshrouded in mystery.

103
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,680
Just who is she?

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,810
Even though I’ve become smaller, my mind remains the same.

105

(Nichiuri TV)

108
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,250
Tsk, we went out of our way to go to a TV station!

109
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,620
But we got sent to the waiting room?

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,460
I wanted to watch the show in person...

111
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,430
We can't.

112
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,800
Uncle Kogoro got scolded, too.

113
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,890
Sorry.
(The World of Satsuki-Kai Karuta Kogoro Mouri-sama)

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,870
It's because I was too noisy.

115
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,980
Oh, yeah!

116
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,610
What do you say we buy souvenirs once everyone's back?

117
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,260
- Huh? - For real?
- Seriously?

118
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,190
Yeah, so behave until the taping's over, okay?

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,240
- Of course!
- Yes!

120
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,710
Let's all go shopping!

121
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,020
Hm? By the way...

122
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,560
where did Conan-kun go?

123
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,780
Oh, him?

124
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,940
He's looking after Dad in my place...

125
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,370
Hey, brat.

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
I told you to wait in the waiting room with the others!

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,080
But Ran-neechan

128
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,470
told me to check how the taping is going.

129
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,270
- Geez.
- Excuse me!

130
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,720
Please make way!

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,170
We're moving the karuta!

132
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,440
Oh, wow. The Satsuki-Kai karutas!

133
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,060
They're so ostentatious.

134
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,930
What are you talking about, Kazuha?

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,770
They're the traditional karuta

136
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,940
used in the finals of the national tournament

137
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,610
held by the Satsuki-Kai!

138
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,500
Oh! Wasn't it your dream

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,970
to play with them, Mikiko?

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,200
It's not just me. In the 20-year history of the Satsuki-Kai,

141
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,780
there's no one who doesn't love that tag.

142
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,680
Ah, even at least once.

143
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,760
I wish I could touch those legendary karuta at the finals.

144
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,750
Hey.

145
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,690
Why aren't they used anywhere else other than the finals?

146
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
They've been through a lot of matches,

147
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,660
so they've suffered some damage.

148
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,490
So, outside final matches,

149
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,240
they're usually put in that case

150
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,120
and being displayed in the museum.

151
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,470
Still,

152
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,930
isn't that security a little over-the-top?

153
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,950
No way!

154
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,800
After last year's Satsuki Cup,

155
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,650
there was a fuss about the karutas that have gone missing.

156
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,090
They were ultimately retrieved,

157
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,130
but apparently,

158
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,680
Yajima-san the champion

159
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,890
convinced Chairman Achiwa that security should be strengthened.

160
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,240
I see.

161
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,460
By the way...

162
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,400
Who were those two again?

163
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,160
Are you a dunce, Uncle?

164
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,600
They're your interviewees!

165
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,740
Is that so?

166
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,530
You never cease to amaze me, old man.

167
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,700
The person in this photo is the chairman, Kensuke Achiwa.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Huh?

169
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,740
He's the bigwig who built the Achiwa Real Estate in his lifetime.

170
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,040
He's also known as the real estate tycoon of Naniwa.

171
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay, but why is

172
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,890
a man like him involved in karuta?

173
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,710
It seems it's his only hobby.

174
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,980
I hear he's pretty good at it, too.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,710
Hmph.

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,110
But Achiwa-san himself

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,170
stated that he'd rather be a karuta reader than a player.

178
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,010
Oh! Who's the pretty lady?

179
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,300
That's Achiwa-san's wife, Satsuki-san.

180
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,570
She's already married? Boo.

181
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,280
The Satsuki-Kai was originally

182
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,520
created by Satsuki-san, who was the queen of the group.

183
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,940
Achiwa-san then took over as the chairman.

184
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,830
Another topic that could be brought up in the interview later...

185
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,860
Ah, don't you think this is interesting?

186
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,460
Achiwa-san said that whenever his wife

187
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,700
Satsuki-san  has an important game,

188
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,910
he always washes the car the day
before to make sure it's ready for the game.

189
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,080
He said that cleaning a car

190
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,290
is a sure-fire way to win.

191
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,810
So I'm supposed to have

192
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,690
a three-way talk with this couple?

193
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,020
- No.
- Hm?

194
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,550
Satsuki-san.

195
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,590
She passed away due to an illness three years ago.

196
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,500
Your only client

197
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,090
is Chairman Achiwa alone.

198
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,760
I-I see...

199
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,230
Um, what about this strong-looking person

200
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,010
who's always in Achiwa-san's photos?

201
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,220
Ah, he's

202
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,940
Dato Kaieda-san, Achiwa-san's ex-secretary.

203
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,050
He used single-handedly work

204
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,540
behind the scenes of Achiwa Real Estate.

205
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,860
I hear he's a sharp and able guy,

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,450
but he's quit his secretary job
now and his whereabouts are unknown...

207
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,570
Hey, Hattori-kun!

208
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,200
Will you stop saying such baseless things?

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,370
The Satsuki-Kai chairman doesn't keep secrets!

210
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,470
Yeah, Heiji!

211
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,870
Chill, they're just rumors.

212
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,370
The Chairman is coming!

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,960
It's Chairman Achiwa! I'm going to go and greet him.

214
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,450
Chairman!

215
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,300
We look forward to working with you today!

216
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,780
Yeah, likewise.

217
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,670
Yes, sir!

218
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,750
If I remember,

219
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,050
there's a demonstration from Yajima-kun and Momiji-kun

220
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,680
and then, an interview.

221
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,600
Yes.

222
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,220
On air, we recorded this tape

223
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
with the help of Yajima-san last week.

224
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,310
We will also include a special feature

225
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,080
on Satsuki-Kai karuta to promote the appeal

226
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,870
of karuta throughout Japan.

227
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,180
Oh, you've also put the Satsuki-Kai karutas

228
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,400
on display, eh?

229
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm counting on you.

230
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes, sir!

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,660
He's so dignified.

232
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,400
Yeah.

233
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,450
That's the real estate tycoon of Naniwa for you.

234
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,270
Excuse me.

235
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,710
Can any one of you get in touch with Yajima-san?

236
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,450
It's about time we start taping...

237
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,460
But I can't get in touch with her at all!

238
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,000
That's odd.

239
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,210
We told her to be present an hour before the program.

240
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,270
That punctual Yajima-kun is late?

241
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,260
Summon Sekine-kun as well just to be sure.

242
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,740
If something goes wrong, I'll ask him to fill in.

243
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Huh?

244
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,850
Ah!

245
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,400
N-No...

246
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,330
Guess we have free time till the shooting.

247
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
yeah.

248
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,710
Hey, Heiji. Where do you want to go for okonomiyaki?

249
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,370
When it comes to okonomiyaki, there's only one place!

250
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,490
Yeah! When it comes to okonomiyaki...

251
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,050
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,070
Are you all right?

253
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,890
You were the karuta player earlier...

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,760
It's fate...

255
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
Huh?

256
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,950
I thought I'd never meet you...

257
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Huh?

258
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,400
My future husband.

259
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,580
Future?

260
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,650
Husband?

261
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,030
Huh?

262
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,360
I'm free after my shooting today.

263
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,500
Damn...

264
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,750
Her boobs are huge!

265
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,610
W-What are you talking about?

266
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,480
Huh? Um, I...

267
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,510
Momiji-san!

268
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm sorry, but please return to the waiting room.

269
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,880
Huh? But I was getting to the good part...

270
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,920
Actually, Yajima-san is late.

271
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,340
Yajima-san is?

272
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,030
Well, he's the one who planned this show.

273
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,010
He must be busy with all sorts of things.

274
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,760
All right, Heiji-kun, see you later!

275
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah, later!

276
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,470
Who was that woman?

277
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,140
That cute lady earlier...

278
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,450
She's so pretty!

279
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,250
If I recall, her name's Momiji-san...

280
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,510
I'm telling you, I don't know!

281
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,820
But she knew yours!

282
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,850
Ran-neesan, let's go wait outside

283
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,510
- They look like they're arguing, anyway.
- Let's go!

284
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,020
What is she angry about?

285
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,250
T-That's...

286
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,210
Maybe we met somewhere?

287
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,140
Look who's talking!

288
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,530
So, you do know her!

289
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,890
I'm telling you, I don't!

290
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,500
I mean, she's so beautiful.

291
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,690
Once you see it.
How could I forget?

292
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,930
A woman as pretty as her?

293
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,930
Well, you're unforgettable in a different way.

294
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,150
Huh?

295
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,760
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

296
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,000
- Hey!
- Hmm?

297
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,140
Heiji-niichan.

298
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,980
You really don't know her?

299
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,070
Momoji... Ooka?

300
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,650
Two years in a row
Satsuki Cup High School Champion

301
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,530
Sophomore at Kyoto Senshin High School

302
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,920
To be a queen in the future.
It's a sure thing.

303
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,010
Momiji Ooka?

304
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,790
The future queen.

305
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,400
So this is the preview.
(Osaka Prefectural Police)

306
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,830
Yes... daytime television.
He just said he was gonna blow it up.

307
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,000
What is this karuta picture?

308
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,630
Here's the photo that was attached to the email.

309
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,440
Whatever that means. I don't know yet.
(I'll blow up Nichiuri TV.)

310
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,570
What of Nichiuri TV?

311
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,820
Do you know about this?

312
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,110
I did give you a heads-up.

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
What do you think? Heizo.

314
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,320
Just a prank.

315
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,240
A real bomb threat.

316
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,290
I don't know what to make of this email.

317
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,380
If this isn't a prank, it's a serious problem.

318
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,940
I just got a message from the Osaka Prefectural Police.

319
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,070
An emergency evacuation alert has been issued.

320
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,220
- We will suspend various work and recording.
- What the hell is this broadcast?

321
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,500
From a nearby fire escape.
Please evacuate.

322
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,590
- What the hell? Now it's an evacuation drill.
- Let me repeat that. Earlier...

323
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,590
- What's going on?
- They mentioned the police.

324
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,770
I wonder if they're recording a TV show.

325
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
paused.

326
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,960
From a nearby fire escape.
You need to evacuate.

327
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,510
Hey, go and check it out.

328
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,630
Oh, yes.

329
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
What the hell is going on?

330
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Kazuha.

331
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,620
We need to get to the fire escape now.

332
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Yeah.

333
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,110
What? Where's Heiji?

334
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,070
We need to find out what happened.

335
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,980
You need to get out of here first.

336
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,610
Wait...Heiji!

337
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
Geez!

338
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,790
- Kya!
- Look out!

339
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,460
Hey!

340
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,260
Brat! Where do you think you're going?

341
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,160
I forgot something in the studio.

342
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,190
Idiot!

343
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,630
Didn't you hear
the announcement just now?

344
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,090
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,400
This is a first for me too.

346
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,240
Same here.

347
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,790
Oh, my God. We need to evacuate now.

348
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,560
- Calm down.
- What's going on?

349
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,800
If we blow this place up.
He said there were threats.

350
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,640
What? Chairman Achiha.
Maybe it's gossip.

351
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,400
Until we know it's safe, let's take a pause.

352
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Oh, good idea.

353
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,900
Let's follow what the announcer said
and head outside!

354
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,990
- Hurry!
- Yes!

355
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,000
What are you doing, Mikiko-kun?

356
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,410
It's not safe here.

357
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,950
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Mr. Aciba.

358
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you dawdling around for? Hurry and go out!

359
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,670
Everybody, calm down.
Take action.

360
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,150
It's nothing. I'm fine.

361
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,840
Everybody stay put.
I'll wait here for you.

362
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,380
What? You're gonna wait again?

363
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,990
I still can't contact them.

364
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,350
I left my dad behind.
I hope he's okay.

365
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Ran!

366
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,890
Dad! Conan-kun!

367
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Hey, hey.

368
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,180
What in the world is going on here?

369
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,260
It can't be...

370
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,760
- Is this some kind of unannounced evacuation drill?
- Hey, Conan!

371
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,230
No. Earlier,
I talked to a guy at the TV station.

372
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,820
He said there's a bomb in this building.

373
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,880
Really? Come on now...

374
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,080
By the way, where are Kazuha-chan and Hattori-kun?

375
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,240
Huh?

376
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,170
Weren't they with you?

377
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Hm...

378
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm worried about them,
so I'll go look.

379
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,760
No, I'm going!

380
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,580
You guys stay put.

381
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,730
Okay?

382
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Hm...

383
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Geez.

384
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,190
This is a busy time for an evacuation drill!

385
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,820
Ah, Heiji!

386
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,390
Mikiko!

387
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,310
I told you to evacuate first!

388
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,190
Well, I'm worried about you two.

389
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,160
- Kazuha, I'm sorry.
- What?

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,760
As I thought, I can't leave those
karutas behind!

391
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Huh?

392
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,450
If I can pinpoint its location from the phone's GPS...

393
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,330
Huh?

394
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,300
What the? Hattori and the rest are still inside!

395
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Hey!

396
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
What are you doing?

397
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,380
Don't worry about that.
We need to evacuate now!

398
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,190
- For crying out loud...
- Mikiko!

399
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,510
Kazuha! Hattori-kun!

400
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,430
You guys...

401
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,230
I can't tell you how dangerous this is!

402
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,100
Sorry!

403
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,910
Sorry!

404
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Geez...

405
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,060
I have three people with me at the studio.

406
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,440
Mikiko.

407
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,500
You're really reckless.

408
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,410
Sorry.

409
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,760
If there's a bomb threat.
I mean, think about it.

410
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,140
It doesn't matter whether
it really exists or not.

411
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,910
We don't know when the bomb will go off.

412
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,850
We'll keep our distance.
I'll tell them to stand by.

413
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,930
Thank you.

414
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,080
The three who stayed in the studio have begun evacuating.

415
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,250
- Is that all of them?
- Yes.

416
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Okay.

417
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,720
We're gonna start looking for anything suspicious.

418
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,370
All teams, begin entry!

419
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,260
Roger!

420
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,010
- They're going in.
- Is there a bomb?

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,970
- Bet it's just a prank.
- Tsk.

422
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,370
Come on, hurry!

423
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,770
This way!

424
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Hm?

425
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,650
- Ah!
- Are you kidding me?

426
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,530
All hands, evacuate!

427
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,660
All right, everybody, back off!

428
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,790
We need to get away from the building.

429
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,130
- Ah!
- Chairman, hurry!

430
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,070
- Watch out!
- Kazuha!

431
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,380
Damn...

432
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,970
Stay back. It's dangerous!

433
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,140
Shit! Where are they?

434
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,250
It can't be...

435
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,480
I hope you didn't get
caught up in it, Hattori!

436
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,440
Kazuha!

437
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,950
You can't go there. It's not safe!

438
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,340
- Come on, let's go.
- Ouch!

439
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,200
Are you okay? Can you run?

440
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,200
Y-Yes...

441
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,780
All right, let's go. This way.

442
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,930
now that this is the case,
I can't go in there so easily anymore.

443
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,810
Yeah.

444
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,260
There's another person out there.

445
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,420
They must've been left out.

446
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,340
They said there were two more.

447
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Hehehe.

448
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,150
What?

449
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,670
Kazuha, over here!

450
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,030
Damn it!

451
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
Heiji!

452
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
That was close...

453
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Everyone, evacuate!

454
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,140
Hurry and run away!

455
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,990
I guess we can't go down.

456
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,320
Kazuha, this way!

457
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,410
- Climb!
- What do you mean?

458
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,910
Aren't we going down?

459
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,480
If we can't get out,

460
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
we first need to go someplace where we can breathe.

461
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,770
Hattori, don't tell me...

462
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,170
You're climbing?

463
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,730
Oh, shit. I can't get through.

464
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,810
Let's go, Kazuha!

465
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Kazuha!

466
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
This way!

467
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,380
I thought this roof was made of concrete.

468
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,400
Closer! Closer!

469
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,240
We can't! It's not safe to go any further!

470
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,120
I'm sorry. Please let me through!

471
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,360
Damn it!

472
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,130
I can't see with all this smoke!

473
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,590
I can't do this on my own.

474
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,300
If I were on my own, that is!

475
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,090
Kudo!

476
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
It's all or nothing...

477
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,570
I need to do this.

478
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,280
Go!!!

479
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,240
Oh, is that him?

480
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,590
Finally, an exit!

481
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Hattori.

482
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,570
Hey, Heiji, where are you going?

483
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,680
Come! This is the only way
we can go down.

484
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,390
Going down... How?

485
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,610
I'm here, Kazuha.

486
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,900
- Okay?
- Heiji!

487
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,350
He told us to go down from here...

488
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,270
No way.

489
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,230
Hey, ready whenever you are!

490
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,390
Same here.

491
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,570
- We don't have time for this. I'm gonna drop you all at once.
- Yeah!

492
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,620
- Kazuha!
- Are you sure we're jumping from here?

493
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,520
I can't see...

494
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,960
No way! Heiji!

495
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,080
Close your eyes
and hold on tight!

496
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,080
Huh? W-Wait...

497
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,270
Wait!

498
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,360
You've got to be kidding!

499
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,710
I'm sorry. I'll be waiting down below!

500
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah.

501
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,050
I'm scared!

502
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Kudo!

503
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,890
Damn it!

504
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
Kudo!

505
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,620
No way! Someone is over there!

506
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,730
Hurry!

507
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,650
Let me go!

508
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,830
Someone's here!
Someone, bring the stretcher!

509
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,190
Kazuha?

510
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Heiji.

511
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,730
Damn it...

512
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,800
It was the only place we could go down.

513
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
Think.

514
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,310
There should be
another escape route...

515
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,570
Huh?

516
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,910
A rescue helicopter!

517
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,020
No, that won't do.

518
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,690
All this fire and smoke

519
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,730
won't make it land, let alone come close to it...

520
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Wait.

521
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,390
There is a river next to this TV station.

522
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,400
If I jump till there...

523
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,730
All right!

524
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,310
Oh, no.

525
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,790
I can't accelerate on my skateboard
with the scaffolding around here.

526
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,150
Whoa!

527
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,710
Yikes.

528
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,990
With just a few breaths,

529
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,250
I feel like my lungs are burning!

530
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,900
I... I need to do something

531
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,710
and fast...

532
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,210
Ran!

533
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,210
As if I'm going to

534
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
give up here!

535
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,360
There should be a way.

536
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,690
A scaffolding where I can accelerate my skateboard...

537
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,870
Somewhere!

538
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
There it is!

539
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,820
What are you doing, Kudo? Get on with it...

540
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,330
Oh, is that him?

541
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,210
That's definitely Kudo.

542
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,420
But what is he doing?

543
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,840
I see. So, that's how it is...

544
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,370
Faster.

545
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,850
Faster...

546
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,640
I can't breathe!

547
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,360
A little more! Just a little more!

548
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,280
It's going to collapse!

549
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,840
Is this it?

550
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,030
Damn it! I didn't accelerate fast enough.

551
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,890
It's no use. I won't make it!

552
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,320
I've been waiting for you!

553
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,600
Gotcha!

554
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,070
Ya okay, Kudo?

555
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,060
Yeah...sort of.

556
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,110
Here. You dropped this.

557
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Thanks.

558
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,670
Still,

559
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,280
you are bringing that along...

560
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,910
Did you know they're blowing up Nichiuri TV?

561
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,240
You fool. No way.

562
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,880
It's just in case something happens.

563
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,750
Heh, maybe that something of yours also caused this.

564
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,160
Heh, maybe.

565
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,300
Kazuha-chan!

566
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,380
Ran-chan.

567
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,690
Are you okay?

568
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,260
Yeah. I don't remember much, though.

569
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,060
I just inhaled a bit of smoke

570
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,230
but I think I'm fine.

571
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,370
- I'm just glad you're safe.
- Yeah.

572
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,540
Looks like Ran dropped
the car keys.

573
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,560
- I'll try and look around for it.
- O-Okay...

574
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,490
What about Conan-kun?

575
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,780
I could've sworn he came
to this evacuation site...

576
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,420
Ah, it's Conan!

577
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,840
You're right. Conan-kun!

578
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,480
- Where were you?
- We were worried!

579
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,890
K-Kazuha...

580
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,460
Hey, Heiji.

581
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,250
Where have you been?

582
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,960
A-Ah, well, you know...

583
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,210
You too, Conan-kun.

584
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,920
We were worried sick!

585
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,170
I'm sorry.

586
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,800
That aside, where's Mikiko?

587
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,100
Well, it seems she injured her arm.

588
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,150
So, she was sent to the hospital.

589
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,420
Her arm?

590
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,590
I don't think it's anything serious.

591
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,160
I've already contacted the hospital she's at.

592
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,660
Why don't we go and see her now?

593
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,970
Yeah!

594
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,160
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

595
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,150
Heiji-san,

596
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,820
- Ootari-han!
- I'm glad you're okay.

597
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,460
Sorry, Kazuha.
Go on without me.

598
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,460
- What?
- I'll come later.

599
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,550
Geez...

600
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,560
- Let's go, Ran-chan.
- O-Okay...

601
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,740
Come with us, Conan-kun.

602
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,990
Oh, okay...

603
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't stray away again, okay?

604
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,940
Okay!

605
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,670
Bye, Conan-kun.

606
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,690
Ehehehe.

607
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,840
The police said
there's a bomb threat. Is it true?

608
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,550
This is the e-mail that the police received.

609
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,300
Huh. There's a karuta attached.

610
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,720
There may be a connection

611
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,930
with the karuta show.

612
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,730
I mean, look at what happened to Nichiuri TV.

613
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,690
Crime scene investigation

614
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,700
is going to take a while.

615
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
Yeah.

616
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,320
What does the culprit want?

617
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,000
(Naniwa Police Hospital)

618
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,160
Thank you for your help.

619
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,690
- Take care.
- Chairman.

620
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,840
How was it?

621
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,100
It was all right.

622
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,820
It's just a scratch.

623
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Thank goodness...

624
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,420
I wasn't expecting

625
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,500
this to happen before the tournament...

626
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,060
Yeah... It was unexpected.

627
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,110
This is the end of the Satsuki Cup.

628
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,220
We might have to call it off.

629
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,570
Please, no!

630
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,310
It's precisely because this happened

631
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,850
that we have to appeal to them and make the Satsuki-Kai prosper.

632
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,120
But the karutas used

633
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,020
in the Satsuki Cup have also been burned.

634
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,480
Worry not, sir.

635
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,740
The karutas are safe.

636
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,250
W-What?

637
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,630
What's that supposed to mean?

638
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,690
When we were evacuating,

639
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,840
Hiramoto-san brought it with her.

640
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,740
M-Mikiko-kun did?

641
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,240
Don't worry about the karutas being burned.

642
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,210
- They're okay...
- Really?

643
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,930
Are the Satsuki-Kai karuta
really safe?

644
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,720
Yes. With no damage. But just to make sure,

645
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,960
the museum staff took it back with them.

646
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Chairman.

647
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,940
The karutas are safe.

648
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,270
Please rest assured.

649
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,680
Yeah...

650
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,070
I thought they were gone for good... Thank goodness.

651
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,450
What about Mikiko-kun

652
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,390
who retrieved the karuta?

653
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,310
I heard she's in stable condition.

654
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,900
- Hm?
- She's still being interrogated.

655
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,690
I see.

656
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,940
Mikiko-chan is late.

657
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,240
The doctor said she only needs first aid.

658
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,630
Thank you very much.

659
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,720
Mikiko, your arm...

660
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,640
Yeah, it looks like it's broken.

661
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,830
Huh?

662
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,670
I guess it's my punishment.

663
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,890
No...

664
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,510
I went to retrieve the karutas

665
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,790
and put you and Hattori-kun in danger.

666
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,420
What are you talking about?

667
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,300
Thank you, Mikiko-kun.

668
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,570
You're the face of the Satsuki-kai.

669
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,550
You saved the karutas.

670
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,830
As a representative of the association,

671
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,420
I can't express how grateful I am to you.

672
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,740
But Chairman,

673
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,100
I can't participate in the Satsuki-kai anymore.

674
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Oh...

675
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,040
Someone as good as you not being able to participate...

676
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,110
is a regrettable thing for the Satsuki-kai.

677
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,570
You should focus on healing your injuries for now.

678
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,090
- Haa...
- By the way,

679
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,290
there's still a tournament next year, right?

680
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,990
- That won't do!
- Huh?

681
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,830
If I don't contribute enough

682
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,460
in the next Satsuki Cup,

683
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,580
the club will be disbanded.

684
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,090
I can't let the karuta club be destroyed in my place...

685
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,070
- Chairman.
- Hm?

686
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,880
The police are waiting.

687
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,700
- It's about time...
- Ah.

688
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,260
Cheer up, Mikiko.

689
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,680
I know, but...

690
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,100
Come to think of it, only you and I

691
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,610
are the decent members of the karuta club.

692
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,310
Oh, Kazuha!

693
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,020
- Why don't you participate!
- Huh?

694
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,000
On behalf of me as the Kaihou Academy representative.

695
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,130
But even if you tell me that out of the blue...

696
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,460
Kazuha-chan, have you ever participated in tournaments?

697
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,590
Not at all!

698
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,160
But don't you always accompany me during my practices?

699
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,790
- Well...
- Kazuha,

700
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,200
you're fit

701
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,470
and have good reflexes.

702
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,920
Steadfast and resilient, too.

703
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,040
You don't back down, no matter who your opponent is.

704
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,710
And... you also have a strange cheekiness to you.

705
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,490
Why do I feel like I'm not being complimented?

706
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,600
When is the tournament going to start?

707
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,150
Err... The day after tomorrow.

708
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,680
- Huh?
- Don't worry!

709
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,360
If you start training now,

710
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,800
you'll manage, Kazuha.

711
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,120
What kind of amateur enters a tournament and hopes to win?

712
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,800
Why don't we replace Hyakunin Isshu

713
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,060
with Iroha Garuta instead?

714
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,420
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

715
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,890
I'm always practicing,

716
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,610
so I know exactly what Kazuha is capable of.

717
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,450
She may have never been to a game before,

718
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,780
but she's definitely as good as an A-rank player.

719
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,900
Wow.

720
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,120
Her?

721
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,290
But you were with Heiji-kun.

722
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,710
I wonder what kind of relationship you have?

723
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,650
We've been together since we were little.

724
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,840
Heiji is my...

725
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,570
My...

726
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,220
- You love him, don't you?
- Huh?

727
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,300
We can tell.

728
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,570
It's so obvious!

729
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,910
Don't interrupt me!

730
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,310
But... you know...

731
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,850
Childhood friends playing with love,

732
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,820
how adorable.

733
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,830
Huh?

734
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,770
In that case, shall we do this?

735
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,310
The day after tomorrow, the winner of the tournament will be...

736
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,570
Heiji's first choice for a wife.

737
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,410
I'm going to confess first and get him.

738
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,860
How's that?

739
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,580
Hey... what are you talking about?

740
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,010
If you're serious,

741
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,160
you will be prepared to do that, won't you?

742
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,890
Kazuha, you don't have to take a match like this.

743
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,450
- Let me tell you something.
-Huh?

744
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,460
I am serious.

745
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,110
Wait!

746
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,890
I'll take you up on that.

747
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,060
K-Kazuha-chan...

748
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Seriously?

749
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
I hope

750
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,480
that momentum of yours could last until the tournament.

751
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Back at you!

752
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,150
Don't think you can beat me!

753
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,780
All right. Catch you later.

754
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,900
I still have an appointment at the nail salon.

755
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,670
I have to think of something to say to Heiji.

756
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,760
Ah.

757
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,790
- She scares me...
- Yeah...

758
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,370
That was something.

759
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,000
You really are amazing.

760
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,290
I can't believe Momiji said that.

761
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,110
- What to do...
- Huh?

762
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,920
I made a huge promise.

763
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
Woah!

764
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,980
Oh... thank you very much.

765
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,350
No, it's my pleasure.

766
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,840
Dad, did you find the keys?

767
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,140
No, that's the thing.

768
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,260
I've been looking everywhere for it... and I can't find it.

769
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,290
Huh?

770
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,980
We'll just have to make a duplicate key.

771
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,030
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

772
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,310
Looks like the lady dropped this.

773
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,780
What? Let me see.

774
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
It's really Momiji-san's.
(Momiji Ooka)

775
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,100
Dad, I'm going to return this.

776
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,190
Hey... Do you know her?

777
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,850
This is depressing.

778
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,470
What do you think I should do?

779
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,080
I don't know.

780
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,960
She was a little scary,

781
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,870
but still really pretty.

782
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,530
If someone like that confessed to me...

783
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,150
Heiji-san's going to fall in love with her...

784
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,010
But the person who suits him best

785
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,400
is you and you alone, Kazuha-san!

786
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,330
For real?

787
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,820
For real, for real.

788
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,210
This is no time for complacency.

789
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,120
We're gonna be training all night tonight.

790
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,360
I've never been to a hospital before.

791
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,000
It's a big place. I'd get lost.

792
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,990
Ran-neechan, over there.

793
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,130
Momiji-san!

794
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,330
Please wait!

795
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,490
Momiji-san! Wait!

796
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,520
Aw... She's gone.

797
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,690
What should we do with this?

798
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,830
We know her name and her school.

799
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,460
Wouldn't it be faster to look inside for contact information?

800
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,890
You're right.

801
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,190
Can I also see?

802
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,090
Huh? Sure.

803
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,840
Hmm, this is...

804
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,270
Oh, a picture...

805
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,040
Who's this person?

806
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,780
There's one more.

807
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,890
- Huh?
- Ah!

808
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,600
It looks like a picture of her when she was younger.

809
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,460
Is this Momiji-san

810
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,520
and Hattori-kun?

811
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,270
They're pinky swearing.

812
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,940
I wonder what did they promise?

813
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,900
A marriage promise, perhaps?

814
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,060
But they were still so young,

815
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,610
so there's no way.

816
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,680
No, he's rather lax.

817
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,200
It might be possible...

818
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,770
Oh, it's Heiji-niichan's bike.

819
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,190
Don't tell anyone about that picture.

820
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,720
Especially to Kazuha-chan.

821
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,740
Okay.

822
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,450
Did you two come here to meet me?

823
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
No...

824
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,900
What's up with her?

825
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Ran.

826
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,580
Did you return it to the owner?

827
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,820
Ah, yeah...

828
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,830
Hey.

829
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,370
- You're late.
- Hm?

830
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,620
Did you get anything out of it?

831
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,800
No, the Osaka Prefectural Police are still

832
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,320
in chaos.

833
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,810
Once the information is gathered,

834
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,210
Otagi-san is supposed to contact me.

835
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,440
- Chairman.
- Hm?

836
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,080
I was wondering if you could

837
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,210
pick up the phone, it's urgent.

838
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,770
Oh, sure.

839
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Geez...

840
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,400
- Huh? What is it?
- What's up with Ran?

841
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,170
From Kyoto Prefectural Police?

842
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Yeah.

843
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,970
So, what's this about Yajima-kun?

844
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,260
What? He was killed?

845
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,490
- Hattori!
- Yeah!

846
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,790
Hey!

847
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Hey, wait a minute!

848
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
Thank you for your hard work.

849
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,040
Hey, you guys!

850
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,570
You can't be in here.

851
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,990
We're from Kogoro Mouri's company.

852
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,890
- What a stupid thing to say...
- If it's them,

853
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,140
you can let them through...

854
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,120
Oh, okay...

855
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,290
It's been a long time, the two of you.

856
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,270
Inspector Ayanokoji!

857
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,920
The man who was killed was Toshiya Yajima-san.

858
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,880
He's the son of a sake brewery family

859
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,360
and used to live in this mansion all by himself.

860
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,510
Estimated time of death is early morning, around 6:00 a.m.

861
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,520
His body was found eight hours later at 2:00 p.m.

862
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,310
Ah, please watch your step.

863
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,300
It's messy all over.

864
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Oh, okay...

865
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,020
Robbery?

866
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,990
Judging from the situation at the scene,

867
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,150
I'm pretty sure it was robbery and murder.

868
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,910
Yes. We think so, too.

869
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,330
Somebody broke in here looking for money.

870
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,370
He said he ran into Yajima-san.

871
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,070
The culprit was too quick.

872
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,710
He beat him to death with a Japanese sword
he was trying to steal.

873
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,130
Then he took the money and ran.

874
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,840
What? Why?

875
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,010
From what I can see,

876
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,200
it looks like our victim was a karuta player.

877
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,450
You're right.

878
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,180
Huh?

879
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,340
Why are you guys coming in here?

880
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,700
You know, Inspector,

881
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,930
please let us take a look around.

882
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,810
Forensics is already done,

883
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,030
so feel free.

884
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,730
A-Are you sure?

885
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,950
However,

886
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,960
we're going to retrieve the murder weapon, the sword.

887
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,610
Sure, I don't mind.

888
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,900
Keep these kids company

889
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,860
- until they're satisfied.
- Yes, sir.

890
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,160
Okay, I'll wait outside.

891
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,370
Let me know if you find out anything.

892
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,390
Sure.

893
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,830
What do you think?

894
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,750
It's too early to tell.

895
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,100
This right hand.

896
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,500
Oh... you noticed too, Kudo?

897
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,700
Yeah.

898
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,760
It's like someone forced him to pull out
something that had blood on it.

899
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,390
If you say anything bloody in this room...

900
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,060
The karutas...

901
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,560
The killer noticed the dying message

902
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,020
and mixed it in with the scattered karutas.

903
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,310
It's going to be troublesome

904
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,770
to find that card in this mess.

905
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,720
Hm?

906
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,880
There's a guy who's really good at that kind of analysis.

907
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,730
Hm? What do you mean?

908
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,340
Look at the blood around that remote.

909
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,450
It was supposed to be right next to the victim.

910
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Excuse me.

911
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,550
Can I turn on the TV?

912
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,860
Sure, go ahead.

913
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Thank you.

914
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,030
If he had control of the remote right up
until the moment he was killed,

915
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,780
it might have been showing something.

916
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,360
It's Momiji Ooka.

917
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,760
Right before he was attacked, Yajima-san...

918
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,220
- was watching this?
- Hm?

919
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
What happened?

920
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,850
Seems like a match from before.

921
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,030
Yeah.

922
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,740
The 15th to the 20th

923
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,350
High School Students Satsuki Cup Contest

924
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,690
Why did Yajima-san use this footage?

925
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,310
Finals

926
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,530
are very high-level, after all.

927
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,700
From the game of skill to the way the cards are arranged.

928
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,450
I mean, just looking at it provides you
with so many references already.

929
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,760
I don't think this has anything to do with the murders.

930
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,880
What? But...

931
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,040
Shut up, no buts!

932
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,620
Come on. You, too.

933
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,480
- Hey, hey...
- Are you trying to play detective?

934
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,870
Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your patience.

935
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,260
- What? Yeah...
- Ojisan, put me down!

936
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,150
All right, all right. Get off me.

937
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, um...

938
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,810
And now for some news.
(Nichiuri TV, Bombed!)

939
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,030
- Today, around 1:00 pm...
- It's this news again...

940
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,450
How worrisome.

941
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,650
Ah, why did you turn it off, Ai-kun?

942
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,750
If you had to worry every time this news came out,

943
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,110
you wouldn't be able to stomach it.

944
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,340
But...

945
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,410
You've been in touch with the kids, right?

946
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,970
But I can't get a call back from Shinichi.

947
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Ah.

948
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,600
Ah. Look!

949
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,080
Speaking of the devil.
(Conan Edogawa)

950
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,000
Oh... you'll have to change later.

951
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,100
Yeah.

952
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,810
Hey.

953
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,460
What the hell have you been doing not calling us?

954
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,670
Professor is worried sick about you.

955
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Sorry, sorry.

956
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,840
I have a lot on my plate, too.

957
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,600
So what do you want?

958
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,850
I sent some pictures to your computer earlier.

959
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,830
I want you to check out the karutas in that picture.

960
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,680
Hm?

961
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,230
I thought you were involved in a bombing,

962
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,110
but now some bloody karutas?

963
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,460
I want you

964
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,430
to track down the cards that the victim
was clutching from among them.

965
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,110
You're good at being insistent, aren't you?

966
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,160
Insistent, huh?

967
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Ah.

968
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,700
There's one photo of a person in there.

969
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,890
Yeah.

970
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,210
And while you're at it, why don't you
find out a little bit about him?

971
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,220
Is he related to karuta, too?

972
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,250
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

973
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Hm.

974
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,050
Anyway, I'll give it a shot. Just give me some time.

975
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,150
Thanks, I'm counting on you.

976
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,770
- Bye.
- Ah, wait.

977
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,010
- Professor wants to...
- Huh? Ah...

978
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,800
How mean.

979
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,690
So, who's the target?

980
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,970
He's a key member of the Satsuki-kai.

981
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,370
Yeah, two of them.

982
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,150
I'll take care of Achiwa-san.

983
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,870
I believe we're staying at the same hotel.

984
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,820
I'm watching Momiji Ooka then.

985
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,730
Wait a minute.

986
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,030
What's with you?

987
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,740
I'm from the Satsuki-Kai.

988
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,800
Let me through.

989
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,450
Please wait, I'll have to confirm.

990
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
- Sekine-kun.
- Hm?

991
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,870
What were you up to?

992
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,040
I kept calling you countless times.

993
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,390
Sorry, Chairman.

994
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,250
I drank too much last night.

995
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,750
I didn't even know when my phone ran out of battery.

996
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,100
I've fallen asleep.

997
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,530
Geez...

998
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,130
The next time I woke up,

999
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,260
they're saying on the news that a TV station blew up.

1000
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,060
I contacted the association, and the chairman was at Yajima's

1001
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,640
and said you're looking for me.

1002
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,310
I came here in a hurry. what's this commotion?

1003
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,080
The police was here earlier.

1004
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,820
What happened to Yajima?

1005
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,530
Yajima-kun was...

1006
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,610
killed.

1007
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Huh?

1008
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,660
They think it was a robbery.

1009
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,700
He was killed by the sword in the passage.

1010
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,740
A sword? No...

1011
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,970
Achiwa-san.

1012
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
Who's he?

1013
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,580
Ah, I'm sorry.

1014
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,390
I'm a Satsuki-Kaicameraman.

1015
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,170
Koji Sekine, at your service.

1016
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,960
Sekine-kun was Yajima-kun's rival

1017
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,300
and has been battling

1018
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,380
for two years at the Satsuki Cup finals

1019
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,510
Well, in my two years in a row of losing,

1020
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,100
I was hoping this year would be different.

1021
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,430
But now, I can't have another match with him...

1022
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,910
So,

1023
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,770
Will the tournament be held as planned?

1024
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,330
Well, about that...

1025
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,990
we don't know what to do.

1026
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,610
Please don't give up, Chairman!

1027
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,940
With Yajima's death,

1028
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,200
cancelling the traditional Satsuki Cup

1029
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,680
won't make Yajima die in vain.

1030
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,060
It'd be like beating him up all over again!

1031
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,210
Careful with what you say, Sekine-kun.

1032
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,710
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1033
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,530
I'm with the Kyoto Prefectural Police.

1034
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,290
I'd like to ask a few questions.

1035
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,250
Do you have a moment to spare?

1036
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,880
Oh, I'll answer anything you want.

1037
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,180
- This way, please.
- Got it.

1038
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,790
- Mouri-san, I'm about to...
- Hey, Kudo.

1039
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,010
I think I know who did it.

1040
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,680
Me too.

1041
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,390
That person probably killed Yajima-san.

1042
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,380
But to think that he's targeting the Satsuki-Kai

1043
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,250
as well as being responsible for the TV bombing incident

1044
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,070
is still too early.

1045
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,070
Yeah.

1046
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,450
As for Achiwa-san and Momiji, it's safer to

1047
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,210
keep an eye on them as we agreed on earlier.

1048
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Yeah.

1049
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,950
(Hotel New Otani)

1050
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,490
- First.
- Second.

1051
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,830
You're both sneaky. Wait.

1052
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,880
Wow, it's a huge room.

1053
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,050
Sonoko reserved it for us.

1054
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,260
She was raring to go, too. Remember?

1055
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,610
That's why she booked the closest hotel

1056
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,890
to Nichiuri TV.

1057
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,100
As expected of Suzuki Group.

1058
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,430
Yeah.

1059
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,850
They're training all night,

1060
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,730
And get them some food for the night.

1061
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,900
I'm counting on you.

1062
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,820
Why do I have to do this, too?

1063
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,410
When I saw you, desperately

1064
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,320
supporting your friends...

1065
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,620
Oh, well.

1066
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,040
Let's start the training.

1067
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,750
We're gonna help you.

1068
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,390
If there's anything we can do, anything at all, just let us know.

1069
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,290
We'll back you up every step of the way!

1070
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,560
- Guys...
- Seriously? Thanks a bunch.

1071
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,010
Oh, it's a call.

1072
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,540
From whom?

1073
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,050
- From Professor.
- Ayumi wants to talk to him too!

1074
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,650
Let's all talk to him.

1075
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,930
Yeah, let's!

1076
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,190
Good luck with your training!

1077
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,120
We'll go over there to not disturb you.

1078
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,310
I guess this is what they meant by

1079
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,820
full backup...

1080
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,680
(Professor Agasa)

1081
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,360
Oh, it's on. It's on.

1082
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,820
Nothing has happened ever since, I presume?

1083
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,600
- Yeah!
- It was fine.

1084
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,250
We're at the hotel now.

1085
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,050
I see. Perfect.

1086
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,130
- Huh?
- No way...

1087
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,730
Ta-da! Thanks for waiting.

1088
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,860
Professor's Quiz Corner!

1089
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,520
Is that why you called us?

1090
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,180
Strike while the iron is hot!

1091
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,170
It is said that the unique style of competitive karuta

1092
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,010
is similar to traditional Japanese work.

1093
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,790
Which of the following is it?

1094
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,550
1. Tea harvesting.

1095
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,310
2. Kite flying.

1096
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,280
3. Mochi pounding.

1097
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,140
4. Rice harvesting.

1098
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,230
Well, since you take karuta and stack them,

1099
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,430
maybe it's one?

1100
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,750
Maybe two?

1101
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,300
I want takoyaki!

1102
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,900
You tend to touch the wrong card sometimes, so maybe three?

1103
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,010
Is that your final answer?

1104
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,740
The answer is rice harvesting!

1105
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,850
Ah... Ai-kun!

1106
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,220
Rice becomes a paddy field

1107
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,740
and you mow that field, so...

1108
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,510
- Oh!
- KaruTa (mow the field)!

1109
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Huh?

1110
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,890
How can you be such a party pooper...

1111
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,270
You guys...

1112
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:54,110
Just because you're traveling
doesn't mean you should stay up too late.

1113
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,350
Yes, ma'am!

1114
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,940
Okay, bye.

1115
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,280
Okay!

1116
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,510
I can't believe it's already this late.

1117
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,220
- So much has happened today!
- Dad's late.

1118
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,700
I wonder if Heiji is still with them?

1119
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,370
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call him?

1120
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,180
Oh...

1121
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,520
Y-You're right.

1122
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,030
What do you want, Kazuha?

1123
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,480
Don't 'what do you want' me!

1124
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,120
What the hell are you doing wandering around at this hour?

1125
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,780
What? Kyoto?

1126
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,130
What's going on?

1127
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,990
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't send you home today.

1128
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,290
Why don't you go on ahead and leave?

1129
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,920
What's that?

1130
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,810
I was going to ask you to train me in karuta.

1131
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:34,870
Special training?

1132
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,350
I'm participating in a karuta match

1133
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,650
in Mikiko's place.

1134
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,130
You've never been to a karuta match.

1135
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,760
That's why I'm training!

1136
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,680
Weren't you super good at karuta

1137
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,390
when you were a kid, Heiji?

1138
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,310
Ah, now that you mention it...

1139
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,210
When I was in elementary school, I participated

1140
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,250
in some karuta tournament.

1141
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,670
Then, you suddenly won.

1142
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,110
I was so shocked!

1143
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,730
It's from long ago,

1144
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,360
so I don't remember it well.

1145
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,820
I do.

1146
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:02,760
Hm?

1147
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,830
When Mikiko asked me to join the club...

1148
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,660
That's the first thing

1149
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,300
that popped into my head.

1150
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,540
I see.

1151
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,960
So? Are you done with the nostalgic story?

1152
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,390
I'm dropping the call.

1153
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,620
- What's with that tone of yours?
- Oh.

1154
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,310
Do you want to end the call with me that fast?

1155
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,980
That's not what I said.

1156
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,500
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. I'm fine without you, anyway.

1157
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,110
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

1158
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,390
Forget it, dumbass.

1159
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,100
What's with him? Sheesh.

1160
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,830
Haa...

1161
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,690
What's with her?

1162
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,690
Oh, well.

1163
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,570
Oh, it's me.

1164
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,700
I have a favor to ask.

1165
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,780
Sure.
(Ooka)

1166
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,790
Yeesh, I'm pooped.

1167
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,310
- Hmm?
- Welcome home, uncle.

1168
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,320
Yeah.

1169
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,830
I never expected to be

1170
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,420
involved in a case even here at Osaka.

1171
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,560
Huh? Dad, where's Conan-kun?

1172
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,310
He wanted to come home with us.

1173
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,720
I gave him a ride.

1174
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,710
I got to the hotel, and now...

1175
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,390
he said he needed to talk to Achiwa-san, so he left.

1176
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
Huh?

1177
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,350
Oh, Conan-kun...

1178
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,560
If the culprit is who I have in mind,
((High school students, Satsuki Cup Raffle Site)

1179
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,480
it seems unlikely that Achiwa-san
will be targeted tonight, but...

1180
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
Ah.

1181
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,360
What's wrong, Ran-neechan?

1182
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,120
Are you done with your business?

1183
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,340
Oh, yeah...

1184
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,120
Then come back to your room quickly.

1185
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,450
I'm worried after what just happened.

1186
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,680
Okay.

1187
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,710
I'll go soon.

1188
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
All right.

1189
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,550
I can still trace him even he goes out now.

1190
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,730
Huh?

1191
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,090
I'm pretty sure she's...

1192
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,850
Why is she here?

1193
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,060
I believed in you...

1194
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,900
Ah!

1195
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,800
Wow, you're incredible.

1196
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,340
I knew it. I can't be your training partner.

1197
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,410
Hey! That's dangerous!

1198
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,590
Just a bit more and...

1199
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,180
- I'm home.
- Ah, Conan-kun.

1200
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,690
I've got a great helper here.

1201
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
- What?
- Huh?

1202
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,650
Who are you?

1203
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,920
What? Heiji's aunt?

1204
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,290
I heard from Heiji

1205
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,960
so I came running.

1206
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,550
What? Why?

1207
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,010
To help you, Kazuha-chan.

1208
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,010
You're training for karuta, aren't you?

1209
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,720
Huh? Well, yeah...

1210
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,680
I'll be your partner.

1211
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,480
As a former queen, I may not be able to help you.

1212
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:40,980
Former Queen?

1213
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,170
It's a request from Heiji.

1214
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,150
I'll teach you

1215
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,990
everything I know.

1216
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,000
However, there isn't enough time.

1217
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:51,160
Your training will be hard.

1218
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,240
Are you sure you want to do this?

1219
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Yes!

1220
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,370
I'm in your hands.

1221
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,960
I knew you'd come.

1222
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,590
Inspector Ayanokoji.

1223
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,000
I guess we're all thinking the same thing.

1224
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,960
Yeah.

1225
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,430
Is the little detective

1226
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,890
not here?

1227
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,240
I'm having him look after Achiwa-san.

1228
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:18,370
I see.

1229
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,440
Nice teamwork.

1230
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,980
Yeah, but I regret choosing this one.

1231
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,990
I didn't know she lived

1232
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,780
in a house this big.

1233
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,090
Hm?

1234
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:30,950
Huh?

1235
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,450
Thank you for your service.

1236
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,590
Oh, yes.

1237
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,790
I work for Lady Momiji.

1238
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,500
My name is Iori.

1239
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,710
Would you like to take a break and have some tea?

1240
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,970
He came because he was worried about me.

1241
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,540
Future husband of mine.

1242
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,980
They are drenched, but even so, they have not lost their color...

1243
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
This is bad.

1244
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,580
Well, it looks like he didn't leave the hotel.

1245
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,510
Unlike the waves that approach...

1246
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,440
You're a hard worker.

1247
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,750
I honestly didn't think you'd make it this far.

1248
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,080
Let's just take a break here.

1249
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,050
I can still go!

1250
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,590
Breaks make great practice too.

1251
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,070
I'll

1252
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,600
have some porridge, if you don't mind.

1253
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:40,390
Ah, Kazuha-chan...

1254
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Ah...

1255
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,980
Are you okay?

1256
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,090
- Let her sleep.
- What?

1257
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,400
She didn't sleep a wink. She worked hard.

1258
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,650
How is Kazuha-chan?

1259
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,700
Better than I thought.

1260
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,840
The top four is a long shot.

1261
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,140
To be honest, it'll be hard to make it to the finals.

1262
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
No...

1263
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,720
Listen to people until the end.

1264
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,230
Just because it's hard

1265
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,950
doesn't mean it's impossible.

1266
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,470
The important thing in competitive karuta is

1267
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,720
mental strength and concentration.

1268
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,970
She has both.

1269
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,930
If she takes on the challenge with an undistracted mind,

1270
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,100
she has a chance of winning.

1271
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,390
If I show her this,

1272
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,020
I wonder if it would upset her?

1273
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,540
We'll end it soon.
(Conference Room)

1274
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,360
Please calm down and take a seat.

1275
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,570
Oh, man... we're gonna have to move soon.

1276
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,080
So? What do you want?

1277
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,440
It's about

1278
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,390
Yajima-san's murder.

1279
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,120
That was a robbery gone wrong.

1280
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,670
Am I right?

1281
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,480
Hm?

1282
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,370
My theory is that

1283
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,110
it was a cold-blooded, premeditated murder.

1284
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,190
Nonsense.

1285
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,800
Sure, Yajima wasn't that much of a good guy.

1286
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,040
But I didn't know there was someone
who hated him enough to kill him.

1287
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,220
- What about you?
- Don't be silly!

1288
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,210
- Why would I...
- Sekine-san.

1289
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,020
You've failed to win the Satsuki Cup two years in a row.

1290
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,980
Because you lost to Yajima-san in the finals both times.

1291
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,720
If Yajima-san's gone...

1292
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,810
maybe you...

1293
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,460
Stop this, it's ridiculous!

1294
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,320
Sure, I want to win, too.

1295
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,570
But to kill my rival

1296
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,280
is absurd.

1297
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,010
Besides, the police claimed it was a robbery.

1298
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,950
Why?

1299
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,090
- There are several reasons.
- Huh?

1300
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,950
First of all, for a robbery, the vandalism is uneven.

1301
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,970
The culprit is not a fan

1302
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,420
of anything related to karuta.

1303
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,530
- Hmph.
- Hm?

1304
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,200
If he killed a person,

1305
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,570
they must've been in a hurry.

1306
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:41,810
I see.

1307
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,390
I'm guessing

1308
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,650
the killer was so attached to the artifacts

1309
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,020
that he couldn't be bothered with them.

1310
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,520
Detectives

1311
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,440
sure can think of some crazy things, huh?

1312
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,500
Well, whatever you guess

1313
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,570
- is all up to you.
- Ah...

1314
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
In any case,

1315
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,710
- it's none of my business.
- Crap!

1316
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,980
Oh, yeah!

1317
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,140
Yeah what?

1318
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,290
The hallway's floor

1319
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,980
creaks a lot.

1320
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,320
Remember?

1321
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,500
What about it?

1322
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,300
With all that noise,

1323
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,630
they'd know right away if someone came into the house.

1324
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,840
But there were no signs of a struggle on the body.

1325
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:20,870
I see.

1326
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,220
You're suggesting Yajima knew the intruder.

1327
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,490
But I don’t believe that.

1328
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,890
Even with practice,

1329
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,270
Karuta requires a great deal of concentration.

1330
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,880
Once you focus,

1331
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,940
you won't notice even the slightest sound.

1332
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,200
Yajima didn't notice anyone coming in from the back.

1333
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,280
He was murdered.

1334
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,740
That's not possible.

1335
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,760
Yajima-san's fatal wound

1336
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,490
was right in the middle of his head.

1337
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,360
If he hadn't noticed the intruder

1338
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:47,240
and continued playing karuta,

1339
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,150
the wound would have been

1340
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,540
to the back or side of his head.

1341
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,890
In short,

1342
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,210
Yajima-san and the culprit

1343
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,710
must have known each other to get a wound like that.

1344
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,670
The culprit is familiar with karuta,

1345
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,680
an acquaintance of Yajima-san,

1346
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,970
has no alibi at the time of the crime,

1347
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,610
and stands to benefit from his death.

1348
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,960
Hmm...

1349
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,370
How odd.

1350
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,730
Everything's pointing to me.

1351
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,330
However,

1352
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,060
what you just said was all conjecture.

1353
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,260
If you want to incriminate me,

1354
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,740
you'll have to come up with proof.

1355
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,960
Sekine-sama, it's time.

1356
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,010
Please.

1357
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,530
Yeah, I'm coming.

1358
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,990
Too bad.

1359
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,160
It's already time. See you.

1360
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,000
Please let me ask one last thing.

1361
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,080
You're so persistent. What is it?

1362
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,920
One certain conversation bothers me,

1363
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,960
though I'm not sure if you still remember.

1364
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,690
If the traditional Satsuki Cup

1365
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,420
is cancelled,

1366
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,320
Yajima wouldn't have just died in vain.

1367
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,970
It would be beating him all over again.

1368
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,100
I do remember saying that, yeah.

1369
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,640
Normally, when you hear the murder weapon is a sword.

1370
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,940
You'd think it was a slashing or a stabbing.

1371
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,980
Despite that, you said "beating."

1372
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,530
Only the killer would know that the murder weapon, the sword,

1373
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,530
was rusty and couldn't be pulled out...

1374
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,490
So, how did you know he was beaten to death?

1375
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,570
W-Well... that's because I saw the body at the scene.

1376
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,410
- Have you had enough already?
- Right before you arrived,

1377
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,790
the body was covered.

1378
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,540
You never had a chance to see the body in person.

1379
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,220
W-Well...

1380
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,630
I just happened

1381
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,300
to think that he was beaten

1382
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,160
based on the splattering of blood.

1383
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
Anyway,

1384
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,200
I have nothing to do with the killing.

1385
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,140
What impolite fellas.

1386
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,600
With the way he stuttered,

1387
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,440
his actions from now on

1388
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,500
need to be surveilled.

1389
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,440
At the tournament venue?

1390
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,860
Yeah, I just checked.

1391
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,650
This is going to be one messy case.

1392
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,710
Still, this place is huge.

1393
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,780
Hmm? It's in the middle of a cliff.

1394
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,030
What is this building?

1395
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,330
The Satsuki Temple.

1396
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,810
Satsuki?

1397
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,780
Yeah.

1398
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,400
Achiwa-san built this place in memory

1399
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,570
of his late wife.

1400
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,750
So, he named it after her.

1401
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
I see.

1402
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,080
You're only allowed to come here once a year.

1403
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,180
And that too,

1404
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,470
just Achiwa-san, the reader, and the two winners.

1405
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,970
So, the tournament works in a way that

1406
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,860
the system uses cameras and microphones installed

1407
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,200
at the venue to deliver the information

1408
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,850
to a dedicated viewing area across the river.

1409
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:19,760
Sounds pretty grand.

1410
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,580
The temperature and humidity

1411
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,450
of the air conditioning system in the stadium are kept constant.

1412
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,700
The soundproof walls surrounding the building

1413
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,340
completely shut out external sound.

1414
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,690
It looks like they have the latest system.

1415
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,000
It's the best place to play karuta,

1416
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,460
since it was built with it in mind.

1417
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,130
Hmph.

1418
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,260
I'm starving.

1419
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,760
Let's go to the buffet.

1420
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,510
I want to eat cake.

1421
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,720
I'll be back in a bit.

1422
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,460
Enjoy yourselves.

1423
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,340
Okay.

1424
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,020
Ran-oneesan.

1425
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,520
- Let's go play!
- I'll see you later.

1426
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,520
- Later.
- Take care.

1427
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,870
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1428
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,860
The souvenirs will be sold out!

1429
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,990
Auntie, let's get back to practice!

1430
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,530
Wait a minute.

1431
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,450
You need to get more sleep.

1432
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,730
You're not strong enough for the show.

1433
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,030
I'm fine.

1434
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,830
N-No way, Kazuha!

1435
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,700
Are you being trained by

1436
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,460
the former queen, Shizuka-san?

1437
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,660
- Yeah, why?
- Wow!

1438
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,040
Maybe, just maybe...

1439
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,270
Come on, let's get you back to your room.

1440
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,670
We're resuming practice.

1441
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,130
If you want to practice so badly,

1442
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,430
would you like to play with me?

1443
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,440
I don't think she's going to make it to the finals.

1444
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,400
Say what?

1445
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,060
You go rest, Kazuha-chan.

1446
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,180
Auntie...

1447
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,730
I'll take care of it.

1448
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,820
You're not satisfied with me?

1449
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:48,520
Ah.

1450
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,650
You're the former queen, Shizuka Ikenami-san.

1451
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,160
Why are you doing this for her?

1452
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,380
So?

1453
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,280
Would you please have a game with me?

1454
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,370
If you insist.

1455
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,040
Please.

1456
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,170
What about Achiwa-san and Sekine?

1457
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,630
Apparently,

1458
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:10,130
they're going to the tournament venue, Achiwa Hall, after this.

1459
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,110
They're having a rehearsal tomorrow.

1460
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,940
They'll have a police escort on the move.

1461
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,280
It doesn't seem worrisome, but

1462
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,520
I guess the problem is after they enter the Achiwa Hall.

1463
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:20,910
Where's Momiji-san?

1464
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Don't worry.

1465
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,700
Her family's in Kyoto, too.

1466
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,520
They're moving together.

1467
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,610
Oh, sorry, I have a call.

1468
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,280
The man in the picture you asked me.

1469
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,700
I got an I.D. on him.

1470
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,240
Huh? Really?

1471
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,800
Yeah, it's a bit of a surprise.

1472
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,900
I sent you an email with the details.

1473
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,260
You can check it later.

1474
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,120
Thank you.

1475
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
Oh, yeah.
(Conan Edogawa)

1476
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,620
How's it going on the karutas?

1477
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,380
I just ran it through my analysis software.

1478
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,670
As expected of Professor,

1479
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,310
it should be down in an hour at most

1480
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,470
that we should be able to identify the card he was holding.

1481
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,070
All right, well, when you're done,

1482
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,400
let me know.

1483
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,650
Yeah.

1484
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,110
Geez...

1485
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,210
(Haibara
I'm sending you Nagoro's profile.)

1486
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,100
Shikao Nagoro...

1487
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,190
Ah.

1488
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,070
It's been a long time since I've been entertained.

1489
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:10,690
Thank you.

1490
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,440
Shall we go back, Iori?

1491
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,470
Yes.

1492
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,070
You sure have a lot of guts.

1493
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,940
Huh?

1494
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,550
I can't believe you're surprised by something like this

1495
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,460
and still think of participating.

1496
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,500
Remember this well.

1497
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,410
My name is Momiji.

1498
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,290
I'm not some leaflet like you.

1499
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,850
L-Leaflet?

1500
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,710
Let's leave it at that.

1501
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,470
No matter how of an amateur my opponent is.

1502
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,380
I don't cut corners.

1503
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,720
I've been caught off guard by amateurs before.

1504
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,510
I've been on the receiving end of some pretty humiliating losses.

1505
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,610
I don't ever want

1506
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,990
to go through that again.

1507
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,410
That's why

1508
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,600
I'll do everything to the best of my ability.

1509
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,610
B-Bring it on!

1510
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,650
Well... so much for the karuta.

1511
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,200
Are you sure you should be here?

1512
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,700
Isn't the Chairman worried about you?

1513
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,500
Thank you for your concern,

1514
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,370
but I am all right.

1515
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,820
After all, the detective of the west,

1516
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,570
Heiji Hattori- kun is protecting me.

1517
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,420
What do you mean?

1518
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,090
Oh, have you not heard anything?

1519
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,960
Heiji-kun is my bodyguard.

1520
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,240
What...

1521
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,220
He didn't sleep a wink last night

1522
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,970
just to stand guard in front of my house.

1523
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,390
All right, then. I have to go.

1524
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:30,980
-I'm looking forward to tomorrow's tournament.
-That was sly of Heiji.

1525
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,660
- Hey, Kazuha.
- Hm?

1526
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,690
- Are you okay?
-Heiji!

1527
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,490
I don't know what kind of relationship you have with her,

1528
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,570
but I will beat her to a pulp at the karuta tourn.

1529
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,990
Just you watch, Heiji!

1530
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,160
Yeah! Well said!

1531
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,420
Woah...

1532
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
What's the matter, Hattori?

1533
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,790
Well, I just don't get it.

1534
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,230
For some reason, I felt chill run down my spine.

1535
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,670
You got a cold?

1536
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,380
Cold? Hah, I wish.

1537
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,090
It's something more sinister.

1538
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,610
Oh, he's here.

1539
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,810
Chairman Achiwa!

1540
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,270
Momiji Ooka.

1541
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,980
And, Sekine.

1542
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,610
They're all here.

1543
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,550
It can't be...

1544
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,440
Sekine's car...

1545
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,290
(Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters)

1546
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,550
So? What's Sekine-san's condition?

1547
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,720
According to the hospital,

1548
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,020
he's still unconscious.

1549
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,690
I hear it's a 50-50 chance.

1550
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,610
Is Ooka-kun, who got caught up

1551
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,130
in the explosion, okay?

1552
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,150
It doesn't look like she was hurt.

1553
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,240
She's being checked up on at the hospital

1554
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,590
with Iori-san, the driver, just in case.

1555
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,120
Now that we're in this situation,

1556
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,910
let's hear exactly what happened.

1557
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,960
- Achiwa-san.
- Ah...

1558
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,120
We suspect that

1559
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,600
the Nichiuri TV bombing

1560
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,830
was also aiming for the Satsuki-Kai.

1561
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,020
Hm...

1562
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,360
- Hey, uncle.
- Hm?

1563
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,800
Who is this Shikao Nagoro-san?

1564
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,900
B-Boy...

1565
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,180
Where did you get that picture?

1566
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,760
With how flustered you look,

1567
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,430
you seem to know something,

1568
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,640
so why don't you

1569
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,600
tell us everything, Achiwa-san?

1570
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,600
There's a karuta society in Kyoto called Nagoro-kai.

1571
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,950
It was a small group

1572
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,030
of less than 20 members

1573
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,660
who practiced hard every month.

1574
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,450
Shikao Nagoro-kun is the leader of that association.

1575
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,810
His skills were quite good

1576
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,900
that they said it was only a matter of time

1577
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,340
before he would get the right to challenge the master.

1578
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,750
But he's so obsessed with the game that

1579
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,340
honestly, watching him play

1580
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,470
can't be called beautiful karuta.

1581
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,560
Hey, come on.
I was faster than you!

1582
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,970
Won't you give up that card?

1583
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,990
How was that the wrong card?

1584
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,890
Where are you looking?

1585
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,580
Five years ago, Nagoro-kun

1586
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,530
asked Satsuki, the chairman of that time

1587
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,420
to have a match with him.

1588
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,990
And if she lost, she'll have to disband the association.

1589
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,280
What the heck?

1590
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,920
But that's just like dojo-storming!

1591
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,810
But from Satsuki-san's point of view,

1592
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,930
there's no need to accept the match.

1593
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,860
To make sure Satsuki doesn't refuse his challenge, Nagoro-kun

1594
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,420
kept leaking information to the press

1595
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,120
that Satsuki-Kai was afraid of Nagoro-Kai

1596
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,800
and was avoid playing against them.

1597
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,110
I see.

1598
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,900
So he put her in a situation

1599
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,630
where she had to accept the challenge.

1600
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,470
So, how did the match end?

1601
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,720
- It didn't happen.
- Huh?

1602
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,610
Even though it was time to start the match,

1603
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:56,690
he didn't show up.

1604
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,640
In the end, it was deemed a forfeit.

1605
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,150
Satsuki was declared the winner,

1606
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,100
and Nagoro-kun fled

1607
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,800
on the day of the match,

1608
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,560
despite causing a media uproar.

1609
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,740
He became a disgrace to the karuta world

1610
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,240
and disappeared from the stage.

1611
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,470
So,

1612
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,040
how's Nagoro-san and the Nagoro-Kai doing now?

1613
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:20,500
Nagoro-Kai was disbanded due to their missing chairman.

1614
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:23,480
Even now, Nagoro's whereabouts remain unknown.

1615
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,470
No way. This case...

1616
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,680
Perhaps this is Nagoro's grudge on the Satsuki-Kai.

1617
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:29,990
I don't know.

1618
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,250
But at the time,

1619
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,430
the one who insisted on dissolving the Nagoro-Kai

1620
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,940
was the late Yajima-kun.

1621
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
What?

1622
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:40,410
We, the Satsuki-kai,

1623
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,580
tried to keep things quiet.

1624
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,190
But that didn't work out,

1625
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,570
either.

1626
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,410
So, what happened to the members of the disbanded Nagoro-Kai?

1627
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,520
Of course,

1628
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,410
I offered them to join Satsuki-Kai should they desire.

1629
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,540
Though, only two of them made that choice.

1630
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,040
By any chance, are those two...

1631
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:01,290
Yeah, Momiji-kun and Sekine-kun.

1632
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,090
The same two people who got involved in the recent bombing?

1633
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,830
Yes, especially Ooka-kun.

1634
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,010
She's been thoroughly trained in Nagoro-kun's techniques.

1635
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,390
As she improved his skills, she was able to play

1636
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,060
many of the same cards that he was good at,

1637
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,920
and the six cards with the scene of autumn leaves

1638
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,810
in the poems were exactly the same.

1639
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,270
She was the very definition of a disciple.

1640
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,990
Why does Nagoro's signature card
include autumn leaves in the poem?

1641
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,200
I heard it's because his name is Shikao.

1642
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,510
Venison?

1643
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,770
Isn’t venison also called momiji?

1644
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,490
It must be hard for Nagoro

1645
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,410
to see his beloved girl join the

1646
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,960
Satsuki-Kai and become active.

1647
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,540
Yeah, but why now...

1648
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:45,920
Besides...

1649
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:48,970
What's the reason behind them sending you
an apparent bomb threat?

1650
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,720
For five years,

1651
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,260
I still don't know why he's been silent.

1652
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,420
That e-mail was just to let you know that he's back.

1653
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:57,970
I think he's trying to appeal to you?

1654
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,930
So,

1655
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,290
this whole thing was started by a man named Shikao Nagoro.

1656
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,060
Should we investigate this as revenge against the Satsuki-kai?

1657
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,150
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

1658
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,610
Excuse me.

1659
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,570
Huh? Oh.

1660
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,960
I think we should

1661
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,920
set up a joint task force with Kyoto police.

1662
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,290
- Yeah...
- What?

1663
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,560
General Manager, I checked Sekine-san's phone.

1664
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:23,710
It seems there was a strange email just before the explosion.

1665
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,920
A strange email?

1666
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,670
The sender is unknown.

1667
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:30,220
But he received an attachment of a karuta card.

1668
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,130
What's on the card?

1669
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Oh...

1670
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,760
On this journey, I have no streamers to offer up.

1671
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,810
Instead, if it pleases you, take this maple brocade
of Mount Tamuke’s colors.

1672
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,390
It's Nagoro-kun's signature card!

1673
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,350
- Huh?
- What?

1674
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,150
What's wrong, Heiji-han?

1675
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,910
I need to see this right now.

1676
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,860
Momiji is in danger.

1677
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,080
Iori-san?

1678
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,840
You must be Hattori-sama.

1679
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,700
Yeah, hurry and check Momiji's phone.

1680
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,620
See if she's getting any e-mails from an unknown source.

1681
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,290
Mails?

1682
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,130
What's going on, Iori?

1683
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,120
Hattori-sama called you.

1684
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,670
Heiji-kun?

1685
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,040
Give it to me, Iori.

1686
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:09,390
Momiji?

1687
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,170
Check your email right away.

1688
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:12,580
Email?

1689
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:13,690
What's going on?

1690
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,340
More importantly,

1691
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,390
I'm so happy to hear from you, Heiji.

1692
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,870
Huh? What's this email?

1693
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,890
- Ah.
- Ah...

1694
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,390
There's only a file attached.

1695
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,600
Is it a picture of a karuta?

1696
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,040
Amazing, how did you know?

1697
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,690
What's the poem? Read it to me.

1698
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,040
Huh? Um...

1699
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:33,940
Blown by storm winds, Mount Mimuro’s autumn leaves have become...

1700
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:36,010
Ah, Momiji, listen!

1701
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,220
Never let yourself be alone at night.

1702
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,690
And don't go home.

1703
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,330
Come to the Osaka Prefectural Police right now, okay?

1704
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,530
Even if you ask me that,

1705
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,240
- I can't do it.
- Huh?

1706
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,210
I have to prepare for tomorrow's Satsuki Cup.

1707
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,850
Now's not the time for that!

1708
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,910
You could be a target.

1709
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,800
I'm fine.

1710
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:56,860
Because you're here, Heiji-kun.

1711
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,800
- Huh?
- You'll protect me,

1712
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,200
won't you?

1713
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
Huh?

1714
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:02,700
I haven't forgotten

1715
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,230
our promise.

1716
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,410
Promise?

1717
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,480
- See you.
- Ah!

1718
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,520
Damn it, she dropped the call.

1719
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,630
It seems she got a karuta mail.

1720
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:14,650
Yeah...

1721
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,660
Otagi.

1722
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,500
We need to reinforce the security of Momiji.

1723
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,470
Yes.

1724
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,020
Hmm...

1725
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,010
Now, this means that the karuta

1726
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,440
wasn't sent only to Yajima-san.

1727
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,290
The card was also found

1728
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,880
at the scene of Yajima-san's murder, right?

1729
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,240
In other words,

1730
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,590
the real culprit, Nagoro, left the scene of the crime

1731
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,220
after killing Yajima-san, leaving behind his own

1732
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,280
signature tag, but Sekine, who came after him,

1733
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,560
disguised his work even further.

1734
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,780
I see.

1735
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,780
Sekine, convinced by the message left at the

1736
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:48,700
scene of the crime that Nagoro killed him,

1737
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,830
ransacks the house to hide the crime of his

1738
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,200
former master

1739
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,980
to make it look like a robbery.

1740
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,500
Are you saying Sekine-kun

1741
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,910
was at the scene of the murder before the police?

1742
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,530
Yeah, that's very possible.

1743
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,560
In fact...

1744
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,370
I had a guy analyzing the crime scene photos for me.

1745
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,870
The direction and shape of the blood splatter on the karuta...

1746
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:12,970
We should be able to figure out how they were arranged

1747
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,310
at the time of the murder.

1748
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,670
Look at the TV.

1749
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,780
The right side of the tag was placed on the floor

1750
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,270
and was covered in Yajima-san's blood.

1751
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,030
Then there's a clean card

1752
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,260
on the left

1753
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,320
and a card with blood on it

1754
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:28,270
from being mixed in later.

1755
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,290
And judging from the faint warping

1756
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,940
of the blood on the card,

1757
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,400
Yajima-san was holding

1758
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,970
Number 32, Harumichi no Tsuraki.

1759
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,410
The weir that the wind

1760
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,780
has flung across the mountain brook

1761
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:46,630
is made of autumn’s richly colored leaves.

1762
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,780
I knew it. Yajima-san's place

1763
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,780
had Nagoro's signature card.

1764
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,170
Look at this.

1765
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,350
These are the cards that are involved in the crimes.

1766
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,130
From top left: Nichiuri TV
(Nichiuri TV)

1767
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,120
Yajima-san.
(Yajima-san)

1768
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,320
Sekine-san
(Sekine-san)

1769
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,390
And what we just got from Momiji-san.
(Momiji-san)

1770
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,110
These cards have one thing in common:

1771
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,680
they all mention autumn leaves.

1772
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:09,950
As I thought,

1773
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,400
these are all Namakoro's signature cards.

1774
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,900
Hm... As for the real killer,

1775
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,730
I think it's safe to say that it's Yoshio Nakamoro.

1776
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,490
I didn't think it was possible.

1777
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,530
I wasn't expecting Nagoro to be behind this...

1778
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,430
What's even worrying is that there's not just one.

1779
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,280
Cards with poems about the autumn scenery

1780
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,580
are six in total.

1781
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,760
What's the meaning of this?

1782
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,690
- That means you still have two cards left.
- Huh?

1783
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:37,560
If Nagoro is using the cards to show that he did it,

1784
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,610
he wouldn't leave

1785
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,780
two cards for no reason whatsoever.

1786
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,100
Don't tell me, Ooka-kun and the others...

1787
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,140
The problem is that the two remaining cards
have no corresponding targets.

1788
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,790
We've got to identify them fast.

1789
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,530
It's going to be hard to prevent Nagoro from doing this.

1790
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,550
Indeed.

1791
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,290
I'm sure you guys will be able

1792
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,250
to stop Nagoro before the police do.

1793
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,210
Yeah.

1794
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,940
But for that, I need more information.

1795
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:04,490
Hey, what happened between you and Nagoro-san five years ago?

1796
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,370
Well... that's...

1797
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,510
There must have been something.

1798
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,530
I won't let you say

1799
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,260
nothing happened.

1800
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,880
I couldn't mention this earlier,

1801
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,540
but it should be fine with you guys.

1802
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,290
After this, come to my room at the hotel.

1803
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,310
I'll tell you all that happened

1804
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,050
that day in detail.

1805
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,690
Okay, well, I'll see you all in a minute.

1806
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,870
I'll bring this to Momiji-san.

1807
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,340
- Okay.
- We'll be waiting.

1808
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,410
Yeah.

1809
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,560
My Lady.

1810
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,810
I just got a call from the police.

1811
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,390
They want to tighten the security at your house.

1812
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:37,100
Sure, no problem.

1813
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,330
Excuse me.

1814
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,150
You must be Momiji-san.

1815
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,190
It's Mouri. I called earlier.

1816
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,530
Oh, it's you.

1817
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,840
You came all the way out here to deliver it.

1818
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,530
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, no.

1819
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,880
Oh, this...

1820
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,410
This is yours, right, Momiji-san?

1821
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,530
Yes.

1822
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,680
Thank you!

1823
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:59,140
This is like a good luck charm for me. I don't know
what I'm going to do tomorrow without it.

1824
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,880
Now, I can manage.

1825
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,790
This

1826
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,200
must seem like

1827
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,180
sending salt to the enemy for you.

1828
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,610
Oh, no.

1829
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,200
She's been

1830
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,820
practicing too much. I hope she doesn't hurt her fingers.

1831
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,500
What pretty nails.

1832
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:18,100
Oh, these nails are for protecting my fingers.

1833
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,430
Karuta is all about fingertips.

1834
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,900
I wear it all the time when I'm not practicing.

1835
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,450
I see.

1836
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:25,940
Oh, and...

1837
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,410
I just wanted to get your contact information.

1838
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,640
- So I looked at your pass case, and...
- Ah...

1839
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,190
I saw the picture.

1840
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,340
Ah.

1841
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,450
Are you talking about this picture by any chance?

1842
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,390
The person in this picture

1843
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,060
is Heiji-kun.

1844
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,060
I thought so.

1845
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,980
This was at a karuta tournament when we were kids.

1846
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,760
This is a picture of me when I lost to Heiji.

1847
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:46,940
Heiji-kun

1848
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,260
said this to me...

1849
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,600
Don't cry.

1850
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,920
The next time we meet, I'll marry you.

1851
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,030
Wait for me.

1852
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,230
R-Really?

1853
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,660
Yeah.

1854
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,720
That's a promise.

1855
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,760
Huh?

1856
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,780
Did he really propose to you?

1857
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,990
That's why Heiji-kun is my future husband.

1858
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,340
Oh, but...

1859
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,030
It's a promise we made when you were kids.

1860
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:13,840
Child or adult, it doesn't matter.

1861
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,650
Once a man has spoken...

1862
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,600
they won't go back on their word that easily.

1863
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,890
- Am I wrong?
- Huh?

1864
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,460
There's no way I can

1865
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:23,710
accurately read the mind of a woman I like.

1866
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,580
I guess...

1867
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,230
Like water rushing down

1868
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,630
the river rapids, we may be parted by a rock,

1869
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,550
but in the end we will be one again.

1870
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,970
I believed that

1871
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,180
even if we are far apart,

1872
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,730
our hearts are connected.

1873
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,020
Please tell that to Leaflet-chan.

1874
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,400
Leaflet-chan?

1875
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:45,710
I

1876
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,150
am not going to let anyone take that card.

1877
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,080
That's what my instructor taught me.

1878
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,460
Momiji-san...

1879
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,390
-chan.

1880
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,470
Ran-chan.

1881
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,990
- A-Ah...
- What are you spacing about?

1882
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,270
Ever since we returned from Osaka,

1883
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,490
you've been weird, Ran-chan.

1884
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,600
Sorry.

1885
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,000
- Anyway, how's it going?
- What?

1886
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,600
Well...

1887
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,930
Winning the match against Heiji's mother is...

1888
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:11,340
I've been given a homework assignment
where I have to pick a card that I'm good at.

1889
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,840
I can't decide on the right card.

1890
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,310
Should you really worry about it that much?

1891
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,250
Huh?

1892
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:20,080
Many of the Hyakunin Isshu are love poems, right?

1893
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,440
Don't think about the competition

1894
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,610
or anything like that. Just pick the poem
that you feel most at home with.

1895
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,730
Love...

1896
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,990
I guess...

1897
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,500
I'd pick this.

1898
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,360
Just like the moon.

1899
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,240
That's Murasaki Shikibu.

1900
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,470
It's a poem about a friend you've just met who

1901
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,930
leaves before you know it.

1902
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,690
Yeah.

1903
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,330
Just when you think you've finally met him, he's gone.

1904
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,960
I've still got so much to tell him...

1905
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:49,550
Well... if that's the case.

1906
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,460
I...

1907
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,260
Though I try to keep it secret,

1908
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,140
my deep love shows in the blush on my face.

1909
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,390
Others keep asking me - ’Who are you thinking of?’

1910
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:04,150
A poem of love that can't be hidden.

1911
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,940
This may be perfect for you, Kazuha-chan.

1912
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:08,330
It was also obvious to Momiji-san, right?

1913
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,710
I wonder why she's so confident.

1914
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,470
- What?!
- She acts like she's Heiji's fiancée.

1915
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,530
Don't you think so, Ran-chan?

1916
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:17,780
Oh, yeah.

1917
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
I can't say it.

1918
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,080
When Hattori-kun was a kid,

1919
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,390
he proposed to Momiji-san...

1920
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,500
What?

1921
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,050
You think Nagoro came to fight Satsuki the day before the match?

1922
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,270
Seriously?

1923
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,800
Yeah, while I was gone,

1924
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,290
That article says that

1925
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,700
Nagoro ran away because he got scared

1926
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:39,510
of his match with Satsuki,

1927
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,950
but actually, he came the day before.

1928
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,810
But why the day before?

1929
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:47,500
Who knows? We'll never know unless we ask the person himself.

1930
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
Maybe

1931
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,470
his goal was to use the Satsuki-kai's karyta

1932
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:53,110
to defeat her.

1933
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,480
That's what Satsuki said.

1934
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,180
Those karuta cards

1935
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,370
are usually kept

1936
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,050
in the museum, right?

1937
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,390
There was no such thing as theft back then.

1938
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:05,970
I kept them at my place.

1939
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,980
But you can't play without a reader, can you?

1940
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,020
You see that pile of cassette tapes on the shelf?

1941
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,110
A long time ago, we used it to practice karuta.

1942
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,150
So, what happened to the game?

1943
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,470
The result was Satsuki's overwhelming victory.

1944
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:23,280
Nagoro said he couldn't do anything about it.

1945
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:25,440
I remember him running out

1946
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,220
of the front door

1947
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,610
with a pale face just as I got home.

1948
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,940
That was the last time I saw him.

1949
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,320
Why didn't you tell the police about that?

1950
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:41,410
If I had told them, it could be leaked
to the press and to the members.

1951
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,580
If they find out that

1952
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,540
I've been using venerable karuta to play personal games,

1953
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,120
there'll be a backlash from the association.

1954
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,250
Well, I can see where you're coming from.

1955
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,550
It's not that I don't trust the police.

1956
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,510
- Apparently, Nagoro...
- What is it? This doesn't feel right.

1957
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,230
Is it because

1958
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,180
Achiwa-san's car is different from now?

1959
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,350
I need you to stop Nagoro's crime
in its tracks as soon as possible.

1960
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,390
Yeah, I'm on it.

1961
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:12,610
- Ran-chan, two is not enough.
- What?

1962
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,610
Can you get me two more?

1963
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,570
My brain is craving something sweet.

1964
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,960
Sure.

1965
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,610
Did you hear that?

1966
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,510
This girl...

1967
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,120
Oh, no.

1968
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,820
I still can't use

1969
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,160
Kakoi-te and Watari-te quite well.

1970
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,680
I can't read the flow of the game, either.

1971
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,180
At this rate,

1972
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,030
Heiji will...

1973
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,660
Heiji will be taken by that woman...

1974
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,810
What is it, Kazuha?

1975
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,840
- Huh?
- You look so scared.

1976
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:38,190
Huh?

1977
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:39,360
Heiji.

1978
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,780
Are you fighting with someone?

1979
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:42,280
Shut it, fool.

1980
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,810
Aren't you her bodyguard?

1981
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,280
Just go home.

1982
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,360
What?

1983
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,780
I came all this way so that I could take care

1984
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,840
of you instead of that exhausted old lady...

1985
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,190
You've never beaten me at karuta.

1986
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,530
That was back in elementary!

1987
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:58,340
If you do this now, you're no match for me.

1988
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,700
Hey, Hattori-kun.

1989
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:02,570
That karuta tournament you went to in elementary school...

1990
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:04,070
You don't remember any of it?

1991
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,200
Or the girl you beat in that tournament.

1992
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,730
Oh

1993
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,520
That's right, Kazuha! The karuta tournament that time...

1994
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,180
The one where you jumped in and won?

1995
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,380
Ah, I think there was a kid bawling

1996
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,300
her eyes out cause she lost.

1997
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,550
That was Momiji Ooka.

1998
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,690
I see, her.

1999
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,640
So, Hattori-kun, you don't remember?

2000
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:25,690
What?

2001
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,730
I heard you made a promise to Momiji-san.

2002
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,060
I think I said something like, "Good luck next time."

2003
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,310
Anyway, Heiji, hurry back.

2004
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,610
You have to protect her, don't you?

2005
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:39,400
- No, the police will...
- Just go!

2006
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,950
If she gets hurt before the tournament...

2007
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:43,950
she won't be able to compete.

2008
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Is that so?

2009
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:47,790
All right. I will.

2010
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,040
I'll leave the rest to you.

2011
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,060
Yeah.

2012
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,090
Ah...

2013
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,040
Though I try to keep it a secret,

2014
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,130
my deep love shows in the blush on my face.

2015
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,420
Others keep asking me -

2016
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,010
"Who are you thinking of?"

2017
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:08,930
Nagoro-sensei...

2018
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,640
Please lend me your strength this year, too.

2019
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,240
Watch over me.

2020
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,260
Satsuki...

2021
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:30,840
(Kyoto)

2022
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,220
In Naniwa Bay,
(Achiwa Hall)

2023
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:39,000
now the flowers are blossoming.

2024
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:48,600
After lying dormant all winter,

2025
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,310
now the spring has come and

2026
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:59,020
the flowers are blossoming.

2027
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,530
Fair Yoshino,

2028
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:07,240
Kazuha-oneesan got it!

2029
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,420
She's dressed differently than the other players,
so it's easy to tell.

2030
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:11,180
Yeah!

2031
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,500
That's an aikido body suit, right?

2032
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,710
She doesn't have a choice.

2033
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:18,630
He said that he has a place he wants to go with Heiji-san.

2034
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:22,190
Oh, yeah! Let's send Conan-kun Genta-kun's picture

2035
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:24,190
from the gift shop!

2036
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,800
Oh, the one where he got scolded!

2037
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:29,020
The eightfold cherry blossoms from Nara’s ancient capital...

2038
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,460
Looks like it has started.

2039
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,390
Yeah.

2040
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,450
Well, with all this security,

2041
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,360
not even Nagoro will be able to get in around here.

2042
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,480
Yeah. Not just Nagoro.

2043
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,130
no one is allowed in unless they're

2044
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:42,400
registered with the staff beforehand.

2045
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,360
We've got a full investigation ahead of us.

2046
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,610
I won't let Nagoro do as he pleases.

2047
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,920
What's up, Hattori?

2048
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,780
No, it's nothing.

2049
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,160
Ah.

2050
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,430
Who's there?

2051
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,660
What, from Mitsuhiko?

2052
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,670
What the hell are you doing, Genta?

2053
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:01,960
Grabbing a handful of pickles like that.

2054
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,380
Oh... I see now!

2055
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:10,710
I believed in you with all my heart

2056

Wow.

2061
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,570
Momiji finished first as expected...

2062
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,410
- Where's Kazuha-oneesan?
- I guess it's not her turn yet.

2063
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,410
Oh, isn't that her?

2064
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,450
You're right. It's Kazuha-oneesan.

2065
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,480
Yay, Kazuha-chan!

2066
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,040
First round, through.

2067
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,340
You're off to a pretty good start.

2068
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,150
Ah... Sekine-san?

2069
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,150
Sekine-san!

2073
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,310
Thank you very much.

2074
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:44,520
Oh, I didn't know she made into the finals.

2075
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:45,600
I'm surprised.

2076
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,760
I didn't know there were still people that good.
(Contestant Profile: Kazuha Toyama)

2077
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,400
That's awesome!

2078
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:53,990
- Can she win?
- Of course!

2079
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,630
Way to go, Kazuha!

2080
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,620
She'll take the win at this rate!

2081
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,620
I wonder if Kazuha-chan knows?

2082
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,790
If she can beat Momiji-san

2083
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:04,040
she has to confess to Hattori-kun.

2084
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,460
She's doing great.

2085
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,490
Kazuha.

2086
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,620
Now it's her time to face Momiji-san.

2087
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,640
Yeah.

2088
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:11,860
- What?
- Hm?

2089
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,250
Sekine-san regained consciousness?

2090
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,460
Oh, really?

2091
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,510
I knew it. You were right.

2092
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:18,800
Okay.

2093
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:21,260
I'll leave this one to the Kyoto Prefectural Police
and be right back.

2094
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,990
Sekine-san woke up?

2095
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,350
Yeah, apparently.

2096
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,900
It looks like your guess was right.

2097
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,010
But why did Sekine-san go to Yajima-san's place?

2098
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,190
Recently,

2099
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,380
I heard Yajima-san's been asking around about Nagoro.

2100
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,240
Sekine-san noticed that

2101
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,340
and was hoping he could track down his former instructor.

2102
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,500
I heard he was spying on Yajima-san.

2103
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:42,720
And then,

2104
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,750
I noticed him acting strange...

2105
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,290
They found the body.

2106
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,560
I'm afraid so.

2107
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,550
I'll tell you more when I get back to Osaka.

2108
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:51,930
I'd like to hear it directly from Sekine-san.

2109
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,910
Yeah.

2110
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,070
Leave this to the Kyoto Prefectural Police.

2111
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,030
Okay.

2112
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,600
Oh, wait, I'm coming too!

2113
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,230
This is it.

2114
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,290
But why are you here?

2115
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,730
We need to dynamite the...

2116
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,260
What?

2117
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,240
- What is that smoke?
- A fire?

2118
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:16,460
No, if you do that, the fire prevention system will kick in.

2119
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:17,670
There's a bomb!

2120
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,370
Oh, come on! You've got to be kidding me!

2121
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,530
- What's with all the noise?
- What?

2122
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:24,150
What's in the woods to the west?

2123
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,450
T-There's...

2124
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,330
just an old shed.

2125
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:29,160
What about the security cameras?

2126
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,560
There are no cameras in there. It's off-site.

2127
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,690
What?

2128
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,260
Hey, is that smoke perhaps...

2129
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,860
Yeah, let's go.

2130
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,980
That's the satsuki hall we're heading for.

2131
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,240
Wow...

2132
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,690
What is this smell?

2133
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:50,810
Ah,

2134
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:53,690
I recently had the elevator serviced.

2135
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,400
That's what the lube smells like.

2136
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,430
Does it bother you?

2137
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,660
No, it's not like that.

2138
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,180
I must be getting excited.

2139
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:03,040
It is thrilling.

2140
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,610
What about you?

2141
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,870
Well,

2142
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,030
I never thought I'd make it

2143
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,170
this far.

2144
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,380
I'm nervous.

2145
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:11,800
I don't think you are.

2146
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,590
No, I feel like my heart is going to pop out of my mouth.

2147
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:15,790
Huh?

2148
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,720
I wonder how

2149
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,180
Heiji-kun will react to my confession.

2150
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,720
I'm so curious,

2151
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,730
I can't lose.

2152
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:25,930
I mustn't lose.

2153
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,480
You can't get any closer.

2154
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,200
What's going on?

2155
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,220
Inspector!

2156
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:34,400
- Did they bomb it?
- Yes.

2157
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:35,710
There was one victim.

2158
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,530
They're heavily injured.

2159
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:40,450
We're not in the position to identify them right now.

2160
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:41,840
I see.

2161
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,960
The question is when and how

2162
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:45,700
the bomb was planted.

2163
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,450
Well, given the circumstances,

2164
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,560
It's possible the victim brought the bomb with them.

2165
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,680
What?

2166
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:53,460
- You think Nagoro wants to misfire?
- We need to start the autopsy now.

2167
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,490
Okay.

2168
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:58,880
Yes, this is Ayanokoji.

2169
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,510
- Oh!
- What's the matter, Kudo?

2170
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:04,850
Hattori, look at that.

2171
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,280
Hm? What's this?

2172
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:07,340
A ring?

2173
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,010
Yeah, probably the victim's.

2174
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,400
What's wrong, you two?

2175
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,050
Look at this ring.

2176
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,400
It could be a lost artifact.

2177
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,180
That's a big ring.

2178
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,630
Oh... it's not that big.

2179
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,110
Big ring...

2180
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,170
Wait...

2181
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,320
- Dogo Kaieda!
- What? Kaieda?

2182
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,410
Achiwa-san's former secretary?

2183
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,830
Yeah, definitely.

2184
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,970
This ring

2185
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:33,080
is the one Kaieda-san wore on his thumb.

2186
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,120
That means

2187
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,980
Kaieda's the real culprit...

2188
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,550
No, if we don't find this ring,

2189
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,120
the body there could've been called Nagoro.

2190
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,150
I mean, this explosion

2191
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,900
is a cover to make it look like Nagoro-san is dead.

2192
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,570
Wait a minute.

2193
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:51,480
At this point, if we're going to pretend that Nagoro is dead...

2194
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,980
The remaining two cards...

2195
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:56,400
I think someone's already sent them.

2196
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:57,580
It's not two cards.

2197
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:00,360
I just got a call from Otagi-san.

2198
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:03,340
Let's go through Chairman Achiwa's email history again.

2199
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,090
I had my secretary to look into it.

2200
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,020
He got a text this morning with a karuta card.

2201
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,550
So there's only one card left.

2202
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,290
One left...

2203
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,040
The finals...

2204
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:17,060
I see!

2205
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:20,800
If the karuta card was already delivered to Achiwa-san...

2206
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,110
There's only one left.

2207
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,970
And the recipient of it

2208
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:26,800
hasn't been decided yet.

2209
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,100
Could it be...

2210
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:30,890
Inspector, check Kazuha Toyama's phone immediately.

2211
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:32,300
Huh? Okay...

2212
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,850
But what does that mean?

2213
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:36,560
I don't know why there was a last one left.

2214
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:40,820
That's because they didn't know who would make it to the finals.

2215
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,920
What... does that mean?

2216
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,170
The target is...

2217
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:46,550
The three people at the Satsuki Hall!

2218
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,160
I'm sorry, both of you.

2219
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,340
What's up?

2220
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,160
Both of you,

2221
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:55,170
give it your all and give us a great match.

2222
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,790
Let's have a great match.

2223
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,070
In Naniwa Bay,

2224
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:03,490
- now the flowers are blossoming.
- One, two... Good luck!

2225
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:04,340
After lying dormant all winter,

2226
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,140
Show us your true power, Kazuha-chan.

2227
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,210
How did it go?

2228
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,970
Was there any karuta mail?

2229
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,140
Yes, about fifteen minutes ago.

2230
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,640
Nakamoro's signature card.

2231
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:20,450
- I knew she was sent one.
- Huh?

2232
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,570
- We need to call off the finals immediately.
- Damn it!

2233
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,350
Okay?

2234
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,320
- This way, Kudo.
- Huh, where?

2235
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:27,030
The bike is faster!

2236
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,740
What? You're calling off the final?

2237
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,180
Yes, sir. Okay.

2238
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,760
I'll call the venue right away.

2239
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,420
Oh, what?

2240
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:42,550
An earthquake.

2241
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,770
This is the least of your worries.

2242
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,720
What? What's going on?

2243
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:51,300
Is it broken?

2244
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,470
- What now? We were just getting to the good part...
-The electric is off?

2245
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,230
No? The lights are on.

2246
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,550
No, it has already started!

2247
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,850
Yeah! Hold on tight!

2248
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:05,130
Okay!

2249
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,550
- How are we going to reach Satsuki Hall?
- Leave it to me.

2250
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:09,590
- I have an idea.
- You're kidding...

2251
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,650
Such beauty unheard of

2252
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:16,200
- even in the age of the raging gods...
- I knew it.

2253
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,140
Leaflet-chan didn't even move.

2254
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:20,830
She's discarding my signature card...

2255
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,340
Miserable...

2256
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:26,940
What?

2257
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,760
Why is it burning so vigorously?

2258
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,390
We think it's some kind of fuel that ignited.

2259
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:33,350
The firefighters aren't here yet?

2260
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,100
The road in the park is too narrow.

2261
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,120
They said the fire trucks couldn't get in.

2262
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,270
I'm pretty sure the fire protection system is down, too.

2263
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:41,450
Yes.

2264
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,900
Is it all over?

2265
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,910
Hattori.

2266
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,910
Do you still think Nagoro-san is the killer?

2267
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,240
No. Kaieda had already left the Satsuki-kai.

2268
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,230
The only one who can re-enlist

2269
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,060
as staff and give the bomb is him.

2270
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,730
Chairman Kensuke Achiwa.

2271
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,720
I think he's going to take them

2272
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,290
both with him and die.

2273
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:29,610
I won't let that happen!

2274
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:32,410
It's in the hardest spot to reach...

2275
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,320
Momiji-san also knows.

2276
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:37,160
That's my signature card.

2277
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,930
You want to get this, don't you?

2278
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,040
Yeah, but I can't give it to you.
Others keep asking me - "Who are you thinking of?"

2279
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,170
If I can keep this, I win.
I'll take it. I'll definitely take it.

2280
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,440
I must get it, at any cost!

2281
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,510
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2282
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,530
Get out my ears!

2283
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:58,990
What is it, Kazuha?

2284
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:00,520
You look so scared.

2285
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,310
Are you in a fight with someone?

2286
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:05,860
- Excuse me.
- Hm?

2287
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,080
Oh, yeah.

2288
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,500
We can't fight.

2289
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:11,940
No good.

2290
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:13,280
The sound of the air conditioner,

2291
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,160
the sound of one's kimono swaying,

2292
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,830
The sound of touching a card,
faint breaths,

2293
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,830
and... the beating of my heart.

2294
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,710
We're all friends.

2295
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,670
You can enter me.

2296
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,090
I'm sorry.

2297
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,720
I'll catch the real sound.

2298
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:37,860
If I hear that you pine for me,

2299
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:42,460
I will come straight home to you.

2300
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:45,200
Shh...

2301
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,260
Ah...

2302
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:49,940
Ah...

2303
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,410
The scenario that Achiwa-san drew up

2304
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,690
was to make us believe that

2305
01:31:57,710 --> 01:32:00,080
the whole series of incidents was all about

2306
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:02,250
Nagoro-san's revenge against the Satsuki-kai.

2307
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:03,690
Five years ago,

2308
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:06,640
Nagoro-san, who was supposed to have a match with Satsuki-san...

2309
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,810
For some reason, the night before that,

2310
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:10,210
there was a preliminaries match,

2311
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,440
and Achiwa-san said

2312
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,920
that Satsuki-san won.

2313
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:15,650
There's something odd about that.

2314
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,140
You know, the pictures from the article you saw at the hotel?

2315
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,930
Yeah, in Achiwa-san's introductory article,

2316
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,850
it said that he always polishes his car

2317
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,810
to a shine the day before Satsuki's match,

2318
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,850
but in that picture, it was dirty.

2319
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,770
The reason he didn't wash the car
the day before the important game

2320
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,280
was that he knew Nagoro-san wouldn't come.

2321
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,590
How cold the face of the morning moon is!

2322
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:39,320
I was faster than you.

2323
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:42,080
No, I was the one who was early.

2324
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,000
Only we ourselves

2325
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,790
know who was faster,

2326
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,020
no?

2327
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,390
It can't be...

2328
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:52,950
I never thought I'd see this one go down to the wire.

2329
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,090
Five years ago, an outpost was built.

2330
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,350
If Satsuki had lost...

2331
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,180
I think that's the motive.

2332
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:04,770
Yeah, to protect the honor of the Satsuki-kai,

2333
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,990
he stopped Nagoro-san from talking.

2334
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,100
And looking at the footage of karuta with the evidence,

2335
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:11,960
Yajima-san found out

2336
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,040
Achiwa-san's crime.

2337
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,430
But what evidence do you have on that karuta?

2338
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,050
What if you haphazardly grab a bunch of karuta

2339
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
with Nagoro-san's blood on it?

2340
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:22,830
I see. Fingerprints!

2341
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,580
I didn't even notice it until I saw a certain picture.

2342
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:27,740
I'm afraid the karuta...

2343
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,620
has Achiwa-san's fingerprints all over it.

2344
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,330
So, Yajima-san...

2345
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,390
approached the TV station to do a special on the Satsuki-kai,

2346
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,610
and had them record a video

2347
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,550
of the Satsuki-kai karuta as proof.

2348
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:41,430
Yeah, that's why they said they were gonna blow up the station.

2349
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:43,910
Yajima-san's murder took place at the same time.

2350
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,470
Yeah, I know, but why?

2351
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,260
What's the reason for

2352
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,710
dragging out the crime until the final match in

2353
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:51,830
in this Achiwa Hall?

2354
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:54,270
If Nagoro-san's body is in Satsuki Temple,

2355
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,170
where the final match is being held,

2356
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,110
it's certainly a perfect place to hide it.

2357
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,910
So this was all planned from the beginning.

2358
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,650
Even if they'd planned it

2359
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,120
perfectly and framed Nagoro-san for the crime,

2360
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,160
they'd be screwed if they

2361
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,940
found his body later.

2362
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,210
- I see it.
- Yeah.

2363
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:18,220
Is the course of love like this?

2364
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:23,010
- As the human heart’s so fickle...
- A blank card!

2365
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,390
Oh, no. The flames are all over the place.

2366
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,410
Hurry up and get out of here!

2367
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:29,310
But what do we do? We have to get rid of it first.

2368
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:31,170
We don't have time to wait.

2369
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,060
We just keep trying to figure out how to put out the fire.

2370
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,330
You can't be serious.

2371
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,320
No way!

2372
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:38,400
Let's go! Conan!

2373
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:53,110
Go!

2374
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,240
Huh?
-What was that?

2375
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,020
Okay, inflate!

2376
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,640
Hurry up. Please make it in time!

2377
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,770
- Ha!
- A fire?

2378
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,440
Don't come! Go inside!

2379
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,730
- Heiji-kun.
- Heiji! Why are you here?

2380
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,180
- Oh, the waterfall's flowing differently.
- It's a miracle.

2381
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,260
The fire's going out.

2382
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,300
What? What's going on?

2383
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,180
Phew...

2384
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:29,300
Looks like we managed to get there in time.

2385
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,200
Thanks, Kudo.

2386
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,330
Heiji-kun, what's going on?

2387
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,900
I told you to stay inside. It's not safe.

2388
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:38,380
What? Conan-kun?

2389
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,660
What's going on?

2390
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:40,860
What's wrong with you two?

2391
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,190
Wouldn't it be quicker to ask Achiwa-san about that?

2392
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,760
What do you mean?

2393
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,200
You two, get behind me.

2394
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:50,630
What? Why do you have to go down?

2395
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,120
Hey, Achiwa-san.

2396
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:55,100
Isn't it bad if they check this Karuta card?

2397
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,500
Hey, Heiji.

2398
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,660
What are you blabbering about this whole time?

2399
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,290
I thought I'd get some answers

2400
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,140
about this case with this old man.

2401
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:05,320
- What?
- The case started...

2402
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:06,800
just one year ago.

2403
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:09,540
That's when Momiji won here.

2404
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,700
At that time, the stack of cards that Momiji took

2405
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:14,640
was the one that her instructor, Nagoro-san, took.

2406
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:17,540
It's similar to the way the cards overlap in a certain match.

2407
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:20,330
Come to think of it, Nagoro-san did teach me

2408
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,670
seme-garuta, so our signature cards are the same.

2409
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:23,780
Though,

2410
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:26,180
unless there's a big coincidence,

2411
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,530
which there isn't, that coincidence just happened.

2412
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:32,100
The stain on the side of this Satsuki-kai karuta.

2413
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:34,330
The murdered Yajima-san realized

2414
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:37,830
that this stain had suddenly appeared five years ago.

2415
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,400
What are those black spots?

2416
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,770
The fingerprints of the person who grabbed

2417
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,940
the karuta with the hand covered in Nagoro-san's blood.

2418
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,320
Nagoro-senesi's blood?

2419
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:50,630
Nagoro-san, who was thought to have disappeared

2420
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,430
five years ago, was murdered.

2421
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,180
- Huh?
- N-No way...

2422
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:56,290
And the owner of that fingerprint

2423
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,210
is the real murderer of Nagoro-san.

2424
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,670
Heh. It's my loss.

2425
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:03,570
I'll confess to everything.

2426
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,880
In exchange,

2427
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:08,340
Don't use the satsuki-kai's karuta as proof.

2428
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:12,270
- It's for the Satsuki-kai...
- So this is what it was all about?

2429
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:12,890
Hmm?

2430
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,350
There's something I just can't figure out.

2431
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,080
Your attitude says a lot.

2432
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,350
The fingerprints on this karuta

2433
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:20,900
aren't yours, are they?

2434
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,040
No, they're mine.

2435
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,860
I'm pretty sure those are my prints.

2436
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:25,440
It's true

2437
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,450
that you and Kaieda

2438
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:29,340
are responsible for all these incidents.

2439
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,130
But you're not the one who started

2440
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,950
all this five years ago

2441
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,030
when you killed Nagoro-san.

2442
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:36,720
It was Satsuki-san, wasn't it?

2443
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,350
Looking at the scene

2444
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,300
made me realize everything.

2445
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,740
I've been using the cassette

2446
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,600
I kept for my readers

2447
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,530
to read about

2448
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:02,730
Nagoro-san's challenge and Satsuki's defeat.

2449
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,270
Do you know what this means?

2450
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:09,340
That's what Satsuki heard over and over again.

2451
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:12,540
One of many, of course.

2452
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,660
Satsuki knew the order

2453
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:16,700
in which the cards would be read,

2454
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,770
and she had a huge advantage.

2455
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:23,420
Despite all this, she still lost.

2456
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,270
Nagoro's abilities

2457
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,670
far exceeded our expectations.

2458
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,900
I wonder how much fear Satsuki must have felt.

2459
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:32,690
The next day at the game,

2460
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:35,820
We were sure to suffer a humiliating defeat.

2461
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,700
That fear

2462
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:40,520
is what drove her to commit the crime.

2463
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,570
Ever since then,

2464
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:44,560
Satsuki had lost all human emotions,

2465
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:48,440
and had gradually drifted away from running the Satsuki-kai.

2466
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,690
And two years later,

2467
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,700
she died from an illness.

2468
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,020
That's the truth.

2469
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:57,090
Hey, you gotta understand.

2470
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:00,010
- No!
- Don't do it!

2471
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,080
If that man hadn't

2472
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,920
humiliated Satsuki, none of this

2473
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,230
would have happened...

2474
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:08,170
- It's probably because he didn't want to humiliate you...
- Hmm?

2475
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,670
that Nagoro-sensei went the day before.

2476
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,590
What?

2477
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:15,180
I asked Nagoro-sensei once.

2478
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,170
Why does he treat

2479
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,230
the Satsuki-Kai like an enemy?

2480
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,140
An enemy, huh?

2481
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,650
I guess it does look that way from a distance.

2482
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,980
Well, I can't compete with her if I don't do this.

2483
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,870
It's just... it's great to win.

2484
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,610
I just want to be praised

2485
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,990
by my first love.

2486
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:38,830
F-First love?

2487
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,290
That's right. Namakoro-sensei

2488
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,470
started playing karuta out of admiration for Satsuki-san.

2489
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:45,730
But

2490
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:48,210
he was told by the doctor that he would
only be able to play karuta

2491
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,670
for one more year due to his eye disease.

2492
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,100
For that reason,

2493
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:54,010
I think he became such a forceful karuta.

2494
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,800
Sensei didn't have much time left.

2495
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,890
Then he had to show his strength

2496
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:03,230
in the previous day's game and tell everyone
that he was going to let Satsuki win.

2497
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,900
Without having to be taken care for,

2498
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,150
he wanted to give a reason

2499
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,360
for the Satsuki-kai to take in his disciples, including me.

2500
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,060
So Satsuki-san killed

2501
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,030
Nagoro-san without knowing it?

2502
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:19,490
N-No...

2503
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,470
What have I...

2504
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,220
What?

2505
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,920
Kazuha!

2506
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:39,830
Ah!

2507
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:43,980
- Kazuha!
- Ah!

2508
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

2509
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,790
But I can't stand right.

2510
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:55,170
Hurry and get inside the elevator, everyone!

2511
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:57,370
- Let's go, Momiji!
- Huh?

2512
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,370
Come on, get up. Let's go.

2513
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,740
I'm good. You can leave me.

2514
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,950
Don't be stupid!

2515
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,250
I can't let you die yet.

2516
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,860
Momiji-san, get in!

2517
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,240
Okay!

2518
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:11,590
Kazuha!

2519
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:13,310
He's coming up this way.

2520
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,660
- Yes.
- Come on!

2521
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,210
Damn it!

2522
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:18,260
Just a little more.

2523
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:20,690
All right!

2524
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:23,880
What?

2525
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,680
Please!

2526
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,200
Don't fall yet.

2527
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,690
Damn it!

2528
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,240
What?

2529
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,080
I won't let you!

2530
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:08,130
You okay?

2531
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,570
- I'm coming!
- Hey!

2532
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,600
That was close!

2533
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,340
Hattori!

2534
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,740
No, it's gonna collapse.

2535
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:20,010
Get out of here!

2536
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,610
Huh?

2537
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:28,540
Huh? What?

2538
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,370
Wait. Don't leave us!

2539
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:31,940
Heiji!

2540
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:32,970
Kazuha, get on!

2541
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:34,100
This way!

2542
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,150
Hattori, Kazuha-chan...

2543
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:39,720
Please, you have to get out of there.

2544
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,130
Heiji, over there!

2545
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,410
Yeah!

2546
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,480
What's wrong, Heiji?

2547
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:52,450
Hold on tight.

2548
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:53,980
Don't tell me

2549
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:56,470
you're going to jump till the other wall!

2550
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,170
That's exactly what I'm going to do!

2551
01:42:58,260 --> 01:42:59,440
You're kidding!

2552
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,980
What are you thinking?

2553
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:02,280
There's a huge distance between us.

2554
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,080
Hey, Heiji.

2555
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:05,760
Isn't it better to

2556
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,200
- jump in the pond?
- It's impossible.

2557
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,740
If I jumped from this height,

2558
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:11,250
the surface of the water will be as hard as concrete.

2559
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,420
Hold on tight, Kazuha.

2560
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,890
If you let go of that hand...

2561
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,030
I'll kill you.

2562
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:19,830
Okay.

2563
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,380
I won't let you

2564
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,720
die in a place like this!

2565
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:36,230
Hattori!

2566
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,770
There are still

2567
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:40,330
so many things I haven't told you!

2568
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:44,660
That bike...

2569
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:50,510
Please make it!

2570
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,250
Heiji!

2571
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,530
Kazuha!

2572
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,220
Are you okay?

2573
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:18,510
Kazuha...

2574
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,570
Yeah.

2575
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:24,280
I've had enough of these break-outs.

2576
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,410
Geez, those guys...

2577
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:33,330
You know, for a while there, I thought I had it all figured out.

2578
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,120
- By the way, Heiji.
- Yeah?

2579
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,520
What is it that you have to tell me?

2580
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:39,670
H-Huh? What are you talking about?

2581
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:41,460
You told me earlier.

2582
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,890
That you wouldn't die unless you told me something.

2583
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:45,890
- You sure you didn't just hear things?
- No!

2584
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:48,930
Karuta's training has given my ears a super workout.

2585
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,280
Come on, if you got a problem with that, tell me!

2586
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:53,300
- What is it?
- Well, u-uhh...

2587
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,280
What is it?

2588
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,180
I told you to wait.

2589
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,750
What I'm trying to say to you...

2590
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:58,930
is...

2591
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:45,210
Thanks for coming to see me off.

2592
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:47,670
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

2593
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:50,340
Speaking of that, what happened to the karuta club?

2594
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:51,770
Well,

2595
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:54,980
the school recognized me for making it to the finals,

2596
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:57,050
so they won't be disbanding it.

2597
01:48:57,530 --> 01:49:00,800
I lost, though.

2598
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:05,670
- Kazuha-chan... Huh?
- Come here.

2599
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:07,490
- Huh?
- I wonder what it's about?

2600
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:08,790
What?

2601
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:10,550
- Is it confidential?
- Eh...

2602
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,320
- Really?
- Yeah, because...

2603
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:15,110
I took "Shinoburedo"!

2604
01:49:15,430 --> 01:49:18,010
You made that poem as your signature card, huh?

2605
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,570
No, no. It's not just the poem.

2606
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,160
The person who wrote the poem, too.

2607
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,700
Taira no Kanemori.

2608
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,210
Among all the poets in the Hyakunin Isshu,

2609
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:29,570
only he and Heiji share the same
starting character in their name.

2610
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:32,550
So, I could only see it as Heiji's card.

2611
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,520
Also, I sent Shinoburedo's

2612
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,130
picture to Heiji.

2613
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,340
"This is my feelings."

2614
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,850
Sending Shinoburedo

2615
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,940
is how you're going to confess?

2616
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,810
Isn't that against the rules?

2617
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:47,240
Momiji-san,

2618
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,310
did you hear what I just said?

2619
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:52,110
You're not the only one with good hearing.

2620
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,710
Oh, if it isn't Momiji.

2621
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:55,690
What are you doing out here?

2622
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:58,450
I've come to confess, as I promised.

2623
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:01,290
Then again, Heiji-kun has already

2624
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,780
confessed to me long ago.

2625
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,700
Huh? About what?

2626
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,300
This is the photographic evidence.

2627
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:09,250
- Ohh.
- A pinky promise.

2628
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:11,460
You've made a promise.

2629
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:14,690
If you break it, you have to swallow a thousand needles.

2630
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:15,810
Wait.

2631
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,510
What kind of promise did I make?

2632
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:18,860
The next time we meet,

2633
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:20,540
I'll marry you. Just you wait!

2634
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:21,550
What?

2635
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:25,280
He sure has the most embarrassing memories.

2636
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:26,950
Or

2637
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:30,060
are you pretending this never happened?

2638
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:32,790
Hm... Ah, I remember now!

2639
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:34,540
No, what I told you back then was this.

2640
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:36,060
Don't cry.

2641
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,060
We can battle again in the future.

2642
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,710
But the next time we meet, I'll be even stronger

2643
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:42,710
so hone your skills and wait for me!

2644
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:45,310
-I'll be...
-Even...

2645
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:47,000
stronger?

2646
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,930
Yeah... She's a girl, so

2647
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:50,570
I didn't want to hurt her.

2648
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,880
So I used to go easy on her.

2649
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,210
Iori, retreat!

2650
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,800
Yes, m'lady.

2651
01:50:57,150 --> 01:51:00,300
Well, I'll let you off the hook for now.

2652
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,680
I never let anyone take my cards.

2653
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,390
Did you get that?

2654
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:08,660
- Kazuha-chan.
- Huh?

2655
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,710
What?

2656
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:15,050
Are you going to play karuta with Kazuha again?

2657
01:51:21,970 --> 01:51:23,300
Sorry. Were you asleep?

2658
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:26,030
You know a lot about the Hyakunin Isshu, don't you?

2659
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,790
Yeah, we do it as a family every New Year's.

2660
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,260
I sent Shinichi

2661
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:32,540
a picture of the Meguri-Aite card,

2662
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:35,370
and he replied with Se O Hayami.

2663
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,670
What does it mean again?

2664
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:38,590
I forgot...

2665
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:41,640
Even though I'm separated from the love of my life

2666
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,600
- I'm sure one day we'll meet again...
- Hello?

2667
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:45,340
- It is what Emperor Sutoku composed.
- Hello, Sonoko?

2668
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:46,760
- It's a lovey-dovey poem.
- Sonoko?

2669
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:48,100
Thanks for the food!

2670
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,100
Huh? Wait, Sonoko?

2671
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,810
You're not supposed to forget it.

2672
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:11,860
Zero.
