1
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.640
The members of the Youth Detective Squad are today's hero.

2
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.140
A boisterous racket breaks out.

3
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.540
Right before the game soft appears on the market.

4
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.125
Hey! It's there!

8
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.325
Look!

9
00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.325
So that's where "Gadlin One" was made, isn't it?

10
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.325
It's amazing!

11
00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:09.825
Yeah, I know!

12
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:23.325
It's so cool!

13
00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:25.425
I really can't wait.

14
00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.525
So, is that it?

15
00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.825
Is that the TV game you all got hooked on?

16
00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:33.025
That's...

17
00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:34.325
-"Gadlin"! -"Gadlin"!

18
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:39.625
And this is where the awesome game is being made!

19
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.125
The Shining!

20
00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.725
How can you forget, Conan?

21
00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:46.725
"Gadlin" is a million-seller TV game, you know?

22
00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.425
This is episode one!

23
00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:53.425
I think you are the only one

24
00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.825
who doesn't know about this TV game.

25
00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.525
I don't really care.

26
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:02.725
Episode two is finally coming out next week!

27
00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.625
There were seven mysteries left unsolved in episode one,

28
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.725
but everything is gonna to be solved in the second one.

29
00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:10.825
I really can't wait!

30
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.125
What's waiting at the end!

31
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.125
Gadlin! Please, tell me!

32
00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:19.025
Hey!

33
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.725
Where do you guys think you're going?

34
00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:39.125
"Fugitive TV Game"

35
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:43.625
Can I help you?

36
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.525
What? Yes.

37
00:03:47.225 --> 00:03:48.525
Actually...

38
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.125
Could you do us a favor?

39
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.625
Could you tell us the seven mysteries in "Gadlin Two", please?

40
00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:55.825
You don't have to tell us everything. Just a little!

41
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.025
Please?

42
00:03:57.025 --> 00:04:00.625
"Yukari Hachisuka (25)" -No. I cannot do that.

43
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:03.325
Okay, then, what about a hint?

44
00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:04.325
Please?

45
00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:06.925
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:08.725
You have to wait until it comes out,

47
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:12.725
Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

48
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:18.925
Do you know my name?

49
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.525
Yes. Of course!

50
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.025
You are famous.

51
00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.325
That's not so true.

52
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:29.725
You got your name tag on your backpack.

53
00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:30.725
What?

54
00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:36.125
I see.

55
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.725
I need to go!

56
00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:39.625
I need to go to washroom.

57
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.225
What? Washroom?

58
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:43.425
Oh, please, Genta!

59
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:46.925
I really can't hold it! I'm in danger!

60
00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:48.625
I'm going to use your washroom, okay?

61
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:49.625
Kid!

62
00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.625
-Hey! -Genta!

63
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.325
This is bad... I need to hurry!

64
00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.825
Oh my god. Where is it?

65
00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:01.125
Hey, what are you doing here?

66
00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:02.925
You can't come up here!

67
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:04.425
Wait, I'm going to pee in my pants!

68
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:05.525
Let me use your washroom, please!

69
00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.025
Genta!

70
00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.325
Hey, you! Wait!

71
00:05:08.325 --> 00:05:09.925
Don't talk to me...

72
00:05:09.925 --> 00:05:12.625
-Hey! -Where is it?

73
00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:13.925
-Wait! -Hey!

74
00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:15.425
I'm going to pee in my pants if I keep running.

75
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:16.625
Wait!

76
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.925
Oh no! Don't tell me it's a dead end!

77
00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:25.025
Come on, hurry up!

78
00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.925
Washroom... Is it this way?

79
00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:28.225
Kids, where are you!

80
00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:34.025
-Let's go, guys! -Is it okay here?

81
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:42.925
Which floor is the washroom?

82
00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:54.325
"This Month's Topic: Nobukazu Michiba"

83
00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:57.725
Come in.

84
00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:00.725
President Michiba!

85
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:03.625
The subscription sales of "Gadlin Two" have gone over two hundred thousand!

86
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.625
"Nobukazu Michiba (36)" -It's gonna be a huge hit.

87
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.425
Even bigger than the first one!

88
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:09.625
Of course.

89
00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:11.225
For "Gadlin Two",

90
00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:13.425
I worked as hard as I could.

91
00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:16.625
It have to be a huge hit.

92
00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.925
Nobukazu Michiba, a genius game producer.

93
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:23.025
You're the superstar of the gaming world.

94
00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:26.225
You're also a genius scenario writer.

95
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:29.625
Well, let's do the final check.

96
00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:39.725
You can never be too sure, right?

97
00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:40.925
See you later.

98
00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.025
Michiba!

99
00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:53.625
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

100
00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:56.125
"Shinji Kobayashi (36)" -It was what I wrote when I was in college!

101
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:57.725
It was all in my notebook!

102
00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.825
And you just stole them all without my permission!

103
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.225
So what are you trying to say?

104
00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:06.625
I'm going to tell the media that you stole my idea!

105
00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.125
See you in court!

106
00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:09.425
Darn it!

107
00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:11.925
-What are you doing? -You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

108
00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:30.325
Kobayashi was murdered...

109
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:33.125
two nights ago in this room.

110
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:35.125
Who are you?

111
00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:37.125
Me?

112
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:40.225
I'm a detective hired by Kobayashi.

113
00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:43.925
Kobayashi had been searching for evidence of plagiarism.

114
00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:46.625
It will be quite useful in court.

115
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:49.125
So for his evidence searching,

116
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:52.325
I was hired to spy on you with a hidden camera.

117
00:07:55.125 --> 00:07:57.525
It was worth doing it.

118
00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:05.725
With two hundred million yen, you can buy this disk.

119
00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:07.325
What are you talking about?

120
00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.625
Hey! Stay right there!

121
00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:14.425
Sorry, I just don't wanna be shot like Kobayashi.

122
00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:16.825
Oh, yeah, before I forget...

123
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.925
If anything happens to me,

124
00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:23.425
the master tape of this movie will be played in public, just so you know.

125
00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:24.725
Now again, it's two hundred million yen.

126
00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:28.025
You earned tons and tons of money with "Gadlin One".

127
00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:29.925
This much money is nothing to you, right?

128
00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:34.025
But remember, I'm not here to negotiate with you!

129
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.325
I got it.

130
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:39.625
Yeah, that's my friend.

131
00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:41.125
Mr. President.

132
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:43.025
Who would?

133
00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.525
What are you doing?

134
00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:55.225
What are you trying to do?

135
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.525
Where did they go?

136
00:09:08.525 --> 00:09:10.225
He's gone.

137
00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:12.325
Hey, where's Genta?

138
00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.925
Where is the master tape?

139
00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:21.025
Say it!

140
00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:26.125
Or you want to die, right now?

141
00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:27.525
Now I'm back!

142
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.825
It was close though...

143
00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:32.725
What... Where is this?

144
00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:40.225
Looks so nice. Whose room is this?

145
00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.725
A TV game?

146
00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.425
"Gadlin Two"?

147
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:49.825
No way!

148
00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:51.725
It's "Gadlin Two"!

149
00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.025
Genta!

150
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:55.525
Where were you?

151
00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:56.725
We were worried about you!

152
00:09:56.725 --> 00:10:00.225
The guard is still looking for us. He's mad.

153
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.025
Look what you did!

154
00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.225
We got to get out of here right now!

155
00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:07.025
Come on, Genta! Hurry up!

156
00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:09.125
Kids?

157
00:10:10.925 --> 00:10:13.825
-I'm sorry! -Hey, wait!

158
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:16.325
It's nothing! Kids, stop!

159
00:10:23.825 --> 00:10:26.825
There you are!

160
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:27.925
Go that way!

161
00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:29.625
Mr. Michiba!

162
00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:33.425
Get them, go! They stole "Gadlin Two"!

163
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.525
What?

164
00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:40.725
Take the stairs! I'll be coming too!

165
00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:41.825
Yes, sir!

166
00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.025
I'm over if that disk goes public!

167
00:10:47.325 --> 00:10:48.725
Hurry up...

168
00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:52.025
-Conan! -Hurry...

169
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:57.925
Now, hurry!

170
00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.225
Hey!

171
00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.925
Wait!

172
00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:02.025
Where did they go?

173
00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:04.325
Outside! They went outside!

174
00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:05.525
Okay!

175
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:13.025
A gun? What's going on?

176
00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:14.125
All right.

177
00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:21.825
I'm so sorry!

178
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.525
What are you doing here? Is that your friend?

179
00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:26.925
-What? -Forget it!

180
00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:28.125
Get out of here!

181
00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:33.625
I'm sorry. I couldn't catch them.

182
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.725
What?

183
00:11:34.725 --> 00:11:37.625
They all had a bike.

184
00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:39.925
I could never imagine kids sneaking into a huge building

185
00:11:39.925 --> 00:11:41.325
and stealing things!

186
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.625
You got to be kidding!

187
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:44.725
Who are they?

188
00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:46.025
Sorry.

189
00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:47.725
He is...

190
00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:51.525
I remember his name is Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School.

191
00:11:51.525 --> 00:11:53.325
Teitan Primary School.

192
00:11:53.325 --> 00:11:55.625
Genta Kojima?

193
00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.625
Should I call the police?

194
00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.025
No, don't! I'll go!

195
00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:02.525
You guys go back to work!

196
00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:03.925
Yes, sir.

197
00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:22.025
Those kids think that the disk is "Gadlin Two".

198
00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:25.225
They'll play it as soon as they get home!

199
00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:28.125
I must prevent it or else, we are over!

200
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:32.025
Search the address of Genta Kojima from Teitan Primary School!

201
00:12:33.225 --> 00:12:35.625
Now I see what is happening.

202
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:40.825
When you get the info, go to his house before him, got it, Bee?

203
00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:43.325
Bee? Is that the name of his partner?

204
00:12:44.525 --> 00:12:47.625
For kids, it would take 30 minutes to get to Beika-cho.

205
00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:50.725
If they don't come home within 30 minutes, then.

206
00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:51.825
Darn!

207
00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:53.225
What bad timing!

208
00:12:53.225 --> 00:12:56.125
The bug is broken!

209
00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.825
This is bad. They are in danger!

210
00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:00.525
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

211
00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:01.725
Ayumi!

212
00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.488
Beika. Beika.

213
00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:14.088
Please do not forget your belongings when leaving the train.

214
00:13:14.088 --> 00:13:15.388
Hurry!

215
00:13:17.988 --> 00:13:19.088
Here!

216
00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:25.488
"No entry for cars"

217
00:13:28.688 --> 00:13:29.888
What are we gonna do?

218
00:13:29.888 --> 00:13:32.588
Those guys looked mad.

219
00:13:32.588 --> 00:13:36.488
I just used the washroom. What's wrong with that?

220
00:13:36.488 --> 00:13:39.288
I'm so hungry since we ran so hard.

221
00:13:40.588 --> 00:13:44.488
This happened because you went inside the building all of a sudden!

222
00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:46.788
Did you know that?

223
00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:47.988
What the...

224
00:13:47.988 --> 00:13:50.888
What? What is it, Genta?

225
00:13:52.088 --> 00:13:53.088
Actually...

226
00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:54.188
What?

227
00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:56.088
I got something in my bag.

228
00:13:57.488 --> 00:13:58.988
This is...

229
00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:01.688
-"Gadlin Two", isn't it? -"Gadlin Two"! No way!

230
00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:05.588
It's real!

231
00:14:05.588 --> 00:14:09.188
Although this is the dummy version, it's the real "Gadlin Two"!

232
00:14:11.388 --> 00:14:12.988
Yeah, I know.

233
00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:16.588
But Genta, how did you get this?

234
00:14:16.588 --> 00:14:20.988
Well, actually it was just inside my backpack.

235
00:14:20.988 --> 00:14:23.688
In your backpack, you said?

236
00:14:23.688 --> 00:14:26.888
How? How did I get this?

237
00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:29.588
It's the fancy room!

238
00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:34.488
No wonder they were trying so hard to catch us.

239
00:14:34.488 --> 00:14:36.088
Hold it! Hey!

240
00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:38.488
I see. So this is the reason why.

241
00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:41.888
Genta! We are in a pretty serious situation right now.

242
00:14:41.888 --> 00:14:43.088
That's right.

243
00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:46.788
Although it wasn't intentional, this is still stealing.

244
00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:49.988
Plus, the game is not in store yet.

245
00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.788
Stealing? Me?

246
00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:55.888
This is why we're being chased.

247
00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.488
"If you have seen this boy, call 110"

248
00:15:03.288 --> 00:15:05.388
Finally, the suspect, a primary school boy,

249
00:15:05.388 --> 00:15:07.688
Genta Kojima, has been arrested by the police!

250
00:15:07.688 --> 00:15:09.188
According to the police,

251
00:15:09.188 --> 00:15:11.088
it's been found that the suspect is involved in many other crimes

252
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:12.688
besides the stolen "Gadlin Two" case.

253
00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:16.988
-Genta! -Genta!

254
00:15:16.988 --> 00:15:18.688
Genta Kojima!

255
00:15:18.688 --> 00:15:20.788
We've got all the evidence already!

256
00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:23.988
You're the one who broke the headmaster's vase, aren't you?

257
00:15:23.988 --> 00:15:24.988
Me?

258
00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:27.788
I know you didn't do your homework three days in a row

259
00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:30.788
and also skipped your cleanup duty.

260
00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:32.988
We've got a witness saying that you didn't wash your hands

261
00:15:32.988 --> 00:15:36.088
before eating your lunch!

262
00:15:36.088 --> 00:15:38.088
What are you? A beast?

263
00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:40.488
Have you forgot your own language!

264
00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:42.588
We know you did it!

265
00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:44.488
Come on, spit it all out!

266
00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:45.788
Genta Kojima!

267
00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:48.488
I'm sorry!

268
00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:56.788
I think you should turn yourself in, Genta!

269
00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:03.488
But before that, I want to eat grilled eel.

270
00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:07.088
My mom told me that we're having grilled eel for dinner!

271
00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:08.688
It's not too late yet, right?

272
00:16:08.688 --> 00:16:09.888
What the...

273
00:16:11.188 --> 00:16:13.788
It's been an hour already.

274
00:16:13.788 --> 00:16:15.088
Those people from The Shining must think that

275
00:16:15.088 --> 00:16:19.088
the kids have seen what's in the disk.

276
00:16:19.088 --> 00:16:21.388
They're seriously in danger!

277
00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:24.688
They're back!

278
00:16:30.488 --> 00:16:31.588
Hey!

279
00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:44.088
What the...

280
00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:50.088
Everyone! Move! Move!

281
00:16:50.088 --> 00:16:51.088
Oh no!

282
00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:59.688
It hurts...

283
00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:03.088
That guy is seriously mad!

284
00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.888
-Let's go! -Ayumi! Hurry up!

285
00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:07.288
Wait!

286
00:17:20.088 --> 00:17:21.688
Take this!

287
00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:42.588
Hey! Wake up!

288
00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:46.088
Take that gun and kill them, Bee!

289
00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:48.688
Go, now!

290
00:17:48.688 --> 00:17:51.588
That was his partner, Bee.

291
00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:54.888
Bee has a gun and is chasing Genta and the rest now.

292
00:17:56.988 --> 00:17:58.688
Genta! Mitsuhiko!

293
00:17:58.688 --> 00:17:59.788
Ayumi!

294
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.088
Where are you all?

295
00:18:02.088 --> 00:18:04.188
It's possible that they went there.

296
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.988
Hurry, Genta!

297
00:18:10.988 --> 00:18:14.388
I'm starving. I can't walk anymore.

298
00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:17.588
Be a man! You're the one who caused this trouble!

299
00:18:20.988 --> 00:18:23.688
Let's just go and put the game back.

300
00:18:23.688 --> 00:18:25.588
And apologize.

301
00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:26.688
Let's go!

302
00:18:33.788 --> 00:18:36.488
No one's here.

303
00:18:36.488 --> 00:18:38.488
It was here.

304
00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:40.488
Then, put it there.

305
00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.288
Okay? Three, two, one.

306
00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:47.488
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry.

307
00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:49.988
I hope our apology is accepted.

308
00:18:49.988 --> 00:18:51.688
I hope so too.

309
00:18:51.688 --> 00:18:52.888
Genta!

310
00:18:52.888 --> 00:18:54.188
Hey!

311
00:18:54.188 --> 00:18:57.288
Can we watch "Gadlin Two" just a little, before we go?

312
00:18:57.288 --> 00:18:59.188
Oh, no!

313
00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:01.388
Don't!

314
00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:02.888
What are you doing?

315
00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:04.988
Only the seven mysteries.

316
00:19:04.988 --> 00:19:06.988
Just a little.

317
00:19:06.988 --> 00:19:09.588
-The seven mysteries? -The seven mysteries?

318
00:19:09.588 --> 00:19:11.888
Just a little, yeah?

319
00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:26.088
Michiba!

320
00:19:26.088 --> 00:19:29.088
"Gadlin One" and "Gadlin Two", both of it was my idea.

321
00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:30.688
What is this?

322
00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:33.188
See you in court!

323
00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:36.488
You think I'll let you do that, you jerk?

324
00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:37.788
What are you doing, Michiba?

325
00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:39.788
You jerk!

326
00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:41.788
You stole my "Gadlin"!

327
00:19:41.788 --> 00:19:44.688
Now you're stabbing me in the back!

328
00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:46.288
Just because you can't beat me! Michiba,

329
00:19:46.288 --> 00:19:48.688
you haven't changed at all since you were in college.

330
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.988
Shut up!

331
00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:55.288
How hard do you think I worked on creating this software?

332
00:19:57.188 --> 00:20:01.388
No way! You're better than this, Michiba!

333
00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:02.388
-No way! -No way!

334
00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:05.288
It... It's the woman that was at the front desk!

335
00:20:06.888 --> 00:20:09.388
Yes, it was me.

336
00:20:09.388 --> 00:20:10.488
-What? -What?

337
00:20:12.088 --> 00:20:14.788
You saw what's in the disk.

338
00:20:14.788 --> 00:20:16.688
Now I have to kill you all.

339
00:20:19.888 --> 00:20:22.088
No. Please, don't!

340
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:25.688
No! I have to eat mom's grilled eel.

341
00:20:25.688 --> 00:20:29.888
Really? That's too bad, Genta Kojima.

342
00:20:31.288 --> 00:20:33.788
As I suspected, it was you.

343
00:20:33.788 --> 00:20:35.188
Yukari Hachisuka.

344
00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:39.788
Conan!

345
00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:41.788
-Conan! -Conan!

346
00:20:41.788 --> 00:20:45.788
When Michiba called his partner "B", it dawned on me that

347
00:20:45.788 --> 00:20:48.788
"B" stood for "Bee", an insect.

348
00:20:48.788 --> 00:20:50.888
In Japanese, bee is "hachi"?

349
00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:55.388
Hachisuka.

350
00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:58.988
Your last name has also the word "hachi" in it,

351
00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:02.388
so I concluded that Bee was your code name.

352
00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:06.188
I guess you are in a relationship with Michiba, aren't you?

353
00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:10.088
Yes. We are gonna get married soon.

354
00:21:10.088 --> 00:21:12.688
And in order to protect our promised future,

355
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:14.488
I would do anything!

356
00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:16.188
Anything, literally.

357
00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:17.188
Conan!

358
00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:19.688
Miss! Please, don't!

359
00:21:19.688 --> 00:21:20.888
Did you know?

360
00:21:20.888 --> 00:21:25.088
That all this conversation is being recorded by the police.

361
00:21:26.188 --> 00:21:27.388
Cell phone!

362
00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:33.888
Yukari Hachisuka!

363
00:21:33.888 --> 00:21:37.388
You're under arrest for attempted murder!

364
00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:39.188
It's game over, isn't it?

365
00:21:40.288 --> 00:21:45.388
Thus, Yukari Hachisuka and President Michiba were arrested.

366
00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.788
The blackmail detective was found alive.

367
00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:50.688
Also, the kids seemed to have learned that

368
00:21:50.688 --> 00:21:55.888
their stupidity had caused a lot of trouble.

369
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:29.288
If I didn't go to the washroom,

370
00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:31.488

The uniform of the Jaguars.

383
00:24:13.488 --> 00:24:15.188
Police!

384
00:24:18.988 --> 00:24:20.988
How did you know?

385
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:29.676
