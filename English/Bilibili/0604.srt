1
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.540
Shoko.

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.540
Kira has...

3
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.440
Resurrected!

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.940
That's ridiculous.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.740
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.240
Tears are start of all dramas.

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.640
The incident takes an unexpected turn.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.940
The mystery deepens, now for the 2nd locked room.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.310
We got lost and coincidentally ended up at a strange house.

13
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.710
They were about to hold a seance to summon

14
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710
the spirit of idol Kira Miyahara who had died

15
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.810
of an accident a year ago, when we arrived.

16
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.310
They explained that rumors concerning Kira's curse

17
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.410
was going around among Kira's fan club members.

18
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.510
It went as far as a murder being committed,

19
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.010
so it prompt them to ascertain the cause of the events.

20
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.110
All of the phenomenon that occurred at the seance

21
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.810
turned out to be a hoax,

22
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.710
but there seemed to be something behind Kira's death.

23
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.210
Late that night,

24
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.810
in the meditation room, where the seance was held,

25
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.310
one of the participants,

26
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.210
Ms. Shoko Utakura was found killed.

27
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.810
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (2nd Locked room)"

28
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.110
Mr. Honogi?

29
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.210
Oh my god! Mr. Hirasaka is...

30
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.810
What seems to be the problem?

31
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.410
Mr. Hirasaka is dead.

32
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.310
He looks to be dead!

33
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.710
What?

34
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.310
Is that true?

35
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.710
No!

36
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.610
Mr. Hirasaka too?

37
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.210
What do you mean, "too"?

38
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.010
Shoko's been killed.

39
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.510
In this room.

40
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.210
What?

41
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.210
Oh, no.

42
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.910
Where? Please take us there!

43
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.410
"I have returned to life, Kira" -I received a strange mail,

44
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.010
"I have returned to life, Kira" -so I went to his room

45
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.310
to talk it over with him.

46
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.710
The door was locked, and there was no answer

47
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.010
despite my knocking on the door.

48
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.510
I was contemplating what I should do

49
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.310
when I heard the ringtone of the cell phone from inside the room.

50
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.710
A ringtone?

51
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.310
Since it was the sound of Shoko's cell phone,

52
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.110
I thought that something was strange

53
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.610
and looked in through the ventilation window above the door.

54
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.610
You found Mr. Hirasaka dead?

55
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.510
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.610
This is not something a child should look at.

57
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.210
Mr. Hirasaka!

58
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.010
Mr. Hirasaka...

59
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.510
Where's the key to this room?

60
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.910
Only Mr. Hirasaka has it.

61
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.210
Anything to pry open the door?

62
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.210
Oh, there's a tool box in the storage room

63
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.710
at the end of the corridor!

64
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.110
There!

65
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.510
Mr. Hirasaka.

66
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.910
What's this?

67
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.310
This is a poster.

68
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.610
Probably the poster of Kira that was in the meditation room!

69
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.310
All of this?

70
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.010
Those were the pieces of the posters that have been torn apart,

71
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.310
scattered over the floor.

72
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.210
Why on earth would anybody do something like this?

73
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.810
How's Mr. Hirasaka?

74
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.110
This is. Shoko's?

75
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.410
Probably.

76
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.110
And...

77
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.710
The rope that was used to kill Shoko?

78
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.910
The victim is Ms. Shoko Utakura.

79
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.710
She seems to be gravure model in the making.

80
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.110
Shoko Utakura?

81
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.310
That name sounds familiar.

82
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.910
She's the one who first found the corpse of the editor

83
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.610
who was murdered about half a month ago.

84
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.110
Oh, that's the case that Inspector Shiratori is handling!

85
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.110
What?

86
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.410
In that incident, the victim

87
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.410
seems to left a blood written dying message of the name "Kira".

88
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.510
This text mail was sent to all those concerned

89
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.310
"I have returned to life, Kira" -before the corpse was found.

90
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.010
It's Kira on this side too but...

91
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.510
Are you saying that this case has something to do

92
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.410
with the case that Shiratori is in charge of?

93
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.610
Weird things were found here and there of the room.

94
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.810
Yeah, those are the seeds of the trick used during the seance.

95
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.210
A seance?

96
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.310
The thing where you summon the spirit of the dead?

97
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.710
That's it.

98
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.610
They had a seance here last night.

99
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.910
The spirit they were trying to summon was

100
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.210
of idol actress Kira Miyahara who died of an accident a year ago.

101
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.810
Kira Miyahara?

102
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.310
I'm not too familiar myself either.

103
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.710
But it seems she was a charismatic figure of cosplay sites.

104
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.710
Cosplay, meaning dressing up in outfits

105
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.610
like characters in comics or animations.

106
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.910
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.110
And before she died it seems like

108
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.710
she was doing gravure modelling and actress work too.

109
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.810
She seems to have had quite fervent fans too.

110
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.910
And? Why did they hold the seance?

111
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:39.510
It seems that a weird rumor was spreading in her fan club recently.

112
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.710
About a curse or something.

113
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.910
A curse?

114
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.210
There were rumors going around that the death

115
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.310
of the editor was also due to Kira's curse,

116
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.310
so they decided to hold a seance to summon her spirit

117
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.210
and ask her for the truth.

118
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.510
And did the spirit appear?

119
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.410
Of course not.

120
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.110
It was all a hoax.

121
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.310
The ones who set it up were Mr. Hirasaka and Mr. Honogi.

122
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.410
I guess they just wanted to surprise everybody.

123
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.210
However, the contents of Kira's voice that they set up beforehand,

124
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.310
seem to have been switched by someone.

125
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.410
I shall resurrect tonight

126
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.510
to avenge my death with my own hands!

127
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.510
It's most probably the doings of the culprit.

128
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.010
The culprit is using Kira's name who died of an accident,

129
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.010
and committing murders repeatedly.

130
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.210
There's another thing that struck me as odd.

131
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.010
I didn't detect any defensive wounds on her.

132
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.110
The only trace left on the corpse

133
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.510
was a strangulation mark on the throat

134
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.110
made with a thin rope like thing.

135
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.610
Could it be that she was drugged to sleep or something

136
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.110
and then strangled?

137
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.510
This sure is a strange room, this room.

138
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.710
This is called the meditation room

139
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.710
where Mr. Hirasaka confines himself to,

140
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.310
when thinking over plans for his comics.

141
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.410
Is it true that this room was locked

142
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.510
at the time the corpse was found?

143
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.110
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.710
The only entrance to this room is through these doors.

145
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.610
The door was locked from the inside with this padlock.

146
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.210
It seems that Mr. Hirasaka

147
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.810
is the only one who has the key to open this lock.

148
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.510
The key hasn't been found from inside the room yet.

149
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.310
There's a ventilation window over there,

150
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.410
but there's no footing to climb up there.

151
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.910
If you use the easels and chairs here,

152
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.510
maybe it can be done?

153
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.010
Even if you were to stack the easels up on the chair and climb,

154
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.810
the window can't be reached.

155
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.110
If the window were to be reached somehow,

156
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.510
evidence of the footing should still be under the window.

157
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.510
But, there was no such thing.

158
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.610
Besides, that window is powered by electricity,

159
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.610
so it can be opened and closed only by using this switch.

160
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.610
But, if you take your hand off the switch...

161
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.310
It stopped.

162
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.510
The same goes when you close it.

163
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.010
You have to keep pushing it or it can't be closed completely.

164
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.110
So, you can't escape from that window.

165
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.810
Then, how did the culprit get away?

166
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.910
Is it Kira's ghost after all?

167
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.210
It can't be.

168
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.910
A completely locked room.

169
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.910
So this is it.

170
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.510
In the meditation room last night,

171
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.510
there were several posters of Kira decorated as props.

172
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.010
It seems that the posters were brought in here

173
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.910
and shredded to pieces.

174
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.710
Why would anybody go out of his way to do something like that?

175
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.310
I don't know.

176
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.010
How about it, Chiba?

177
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:08.110
We suspect he was poisoned by cyanide compounds.

178
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.210
We think it was mixed into his wine.

179
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.510
Was this room also locked?

180
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.610
Yes, sir.

181
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.210
We were told that Mr. Hirasaka

182
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.410
was the only one who had the key to this room.

183
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.110
So, I had no choice but to pry it open.

184
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.010
Did you find the key?

185
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.610
It wasn't in the drawer of the desk.

186
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.110
The only place left to look is the drawer over there, I guess.

187
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.910
This drawer is locked.

188
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.210
Oh, it opened.

189
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.910
I found the key!

190
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.510
This seems to be the key.

191
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.510
But it won't move because the shaft

192
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.010
was probably bent out of shape when it was pried open.

193
00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.810
It seems that the key is made in Germany

194
00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.910
and cannot easily be duplicated.

195
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.410
In order to lock this door,

196
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.210
that key is necessary for both locking it

197
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.110
from outside and inside.

198
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.910
Yes, it seems to be so.

199
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.110
The other one could be for that padlock.

200
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.710
Confirm it, will you?

201
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.110
Yes, sir!

202
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.010
What about the rope that was on the floor?

203
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.910
We can't say for sure until we run a test and confirm a match,

204
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.810
but there's a high probability that it's the murder weapon

205
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.210
used to kill Shoko.

206
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.710
What about that window?

207
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.110
It was locked from the inside.

208
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.810
Either way, there are decorative iron bars on the outside,

209
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.710
so going in and out from there isn't possible.

210
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.610
So, this was also a locked room.

211
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.910
Right.

212
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.210
This ventilation window only opens about 10cm,

213
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.910
making this door the only entrance.

214
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.010
That key was found inside the room in a drawer

215
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.010
that was also locked, so...

216
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.210
No, inspector, if we look at it from a different angle,

217
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.410
this locked room murder is as good as solved.

218
00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.810
What?

219
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.410
It's suicide.

220
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.910
Suicide?

221
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.110
Hirasaka is the one who killed Shoko.

222
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.810
Then after he returned to this room,

223
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.810
he locked the door and drank poisoned wine.

224
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.210
I see.

225
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.510
It could be that Mr. Hirasaka killed Editor Sawanami too.

226
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.210
But, "Kira" was left written at the scene of the crime, right?

227
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.810
Mr. Hirasaka is the one who wrote that too.

228
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.610
He was also was the one who sent the text mail out

229
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.010
from Shoko's cell phone.

230
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.410
He probably wanted to make it appear

231
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.710
as if the main character of his comics appeared in reality

232
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.410
and committed serial killings.

233
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.610
If so, this room wouldn't have to be locked, would it?

234
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.910
Because it would easily give away the fact that he committed suicide.

235
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.410
His comics, The Blackmagic Girl, was it?

236
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.310
The main character Kira is a witch.

237
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.810
That's why he probably wanted to make it look like an impossible crime,

238
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.110
in which a magic spell was used!

239
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.010
It does sort of seem to make sense.

240
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.110
I hope you solved the other locked room mystery too.

241
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.910
Well, not quite yet.

242
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.610
Is that so?

243
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.210
However, the only one who had the key to the meditation room

244
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.010
was Hirasaka.

245
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.010
I saw him lock the door from the outside with a padlock

246
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.810
after the seance.

247
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.610
No one besides Hirasaka could've gone into that room.

248
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.310
Even if he were to have committed suicide,

249
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.710
would he go out of his way to put the key away in a drawer,

250
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.410
and lock that drawer as well?

251
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.010
And besides,

252
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:37.910
why did he have to tear up Kira's posters like this?

253
00:14:48.315 --> 00:14:50.815
Everyone, I hate to do this

254
00:14:50.815 --> 00:14:52.415
knowing that you're all tired,

255
00:14:52.415 --> 00:14:55.115
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

256
00:14:55.115 --> 00:15:00.415
Last night, the body of Ms. Shoko Itakura was found at 01:00.

257
00:15:00.415 --> 00:15:04.215
After that, Mr. Hirasaka's body was also found.

258
00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:06.315
The estimated time of death for both people

259
00:15:06.315 --> 00:15:09.515
was between 23:00 to 01:00.

260
00:15:09.515 --> 00:15:12.615
Therefore, I would like you to tell me

261
00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:14.515
what each of you were doing during this time.

262
00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:17.015
Last night, after the seance,

263
00:15:17.015 --> 00:15:20.015
there was a strange atmosphere going around so...

264
00:15:20.015 --> 00:15:23.915
We all went back to our rooms without wasting any time.

265
00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:26.015
It was around 22:00.

266
00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:27.915
After returning to my room,

267
00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:31.715
I was looking forward to Kira resurrecting right through

268
00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:34.415
without sleeping a wink.

269
00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:37.415
Maho, Mr. Mifune and I,

270
00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:41.215
talked to Mr. Mouri for a while,

271
00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.115
so I guess we left for our rooms at around 23:00.

272
00:15:43.115 --> 00:15:45.915
Back then, you called Shoko, didn't you?

273
00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:49.115
Oh. Do you know what time it was?

274
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.515
Yes.

275
00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:54.815
At 22:40.

276
00:15:54.815 --> 00:15:58.015
Back then, she said that she had a headache.

277
00:15:58.015 --> 00:16:01.415
After that you went to check on her, didn't you, Maho?

278
00:16:01.415 --> 00:16:03.415
Yes.

279
00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:07.015
I was worried so I went to look in on her,

280
00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:09.415
but Shoko wasn't in her room.

281
00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:12.815
My room is right next to hers, so I waited for her to return

282
00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:14.915
hoping to give her some medicine,

283
00:16:14.915 --> 00:16:21.015
but she didn't return so I got worried,

284
00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:24.415
and went to Mr. Mouri for help.

285
00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:28.115
Is there anyone who met Mr. Hirasaka after the seance?

286
00:16:32.515 --> 00:16:35.015
Oh, before I returned to my room,

287
00:16:35.015 --> 00:16:38.715
I talked to him for a little while in his room.

288
00:16:38.715 --> 00:16:40.515
What did you talk about?

289
00:16:40.515 --> 00:16:43.715
About somebody having switched Kira's voice

290
00:16:43.715 --> 00:16:46.815
that we set up beforehand the seance.

291
00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:50.415
But, I returned to my room in about 15 minutes.

292
00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:55.915
Why did you decide to have a seance?

293
00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.615
Why...

294
00:16:57.615 --> 00:17:00.415
Because there were strange rumors going around

295
00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:02.715
in the fan club about Kira casting a curse.

296
00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:04.915
And even murder was committed so...

297
00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:07.815
Do you seriously believe in spirits and curses?

298
00:17:07.815 --> 00:17:09.615
Oh, not really.

299
00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:13.815
It's true that it's not something that a sensible adult would do.

300
00:17:13.815 --> 00:17:16.915
Didn't you have some other purpose for carrying it out?

301
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:20.015
Well...

302
00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:21.615
Come to think of it, Mr. Honogi,

303
00:17:21.615 --> 00:17:24.915
you mentioned receiving strange calls in the past, didn't you?

304
00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:26.715
Well...

305
00:17:26.715 --> 00:17:28.915
What're you talking about, Yatsukawa?

306
00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:33.015
Well, I think it was a month ago,

307
00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:34.615
we coincidentally ran into each other at a snack bar

308
00:17:34.615 --> 00:17:36.415
and drank together.

309
00:17:37.315 --> 00:17:39.715
Yes. Hello.

310
00:17:43.415 --> 00:17:44.915
What happened?

311
00:17:44.915 --> 00:17:48.115
I've been getting upsetting phone calls recently.

312
00:17:48.115 --> 00:17:50.315
I wonder who on earth it is.

313
00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:55.715
Weren't you being blackmailed by somebody?

314
00:17:55.715 --> 00:17:58.015
No, that's not true.

315
00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:01.615
Come to think of it,

316
00:18:01.615 --> 00:18:04.815
Mr. Sawanami also received strange letters.

317
00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:06.315
Really?

318
00:18:06.315 --> 00:18:08.815
Yes, when I went to the publisher

319
00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:12.415
to make arrangements for a magazine about a month ago...

320
00:18:12.415 --> 00:18:15.915
Mr. Sawanami, do you know about the rumor that's going around?

321
00:18:15.915 --> 00:18:17.415
Rumor?

322
00:18:17.415 --> 00:18:19.315
It seems that the members of the fan club

323
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:21.515
who have switched to become fans of other idols

324
00:18:21.515 --> 00:18:25.515
have been getting hurt or falling ill.

325
00:18:25.515 --> 00:18:27.015
What?

326
00:18:27.015 --> 00:18:32.015
Some people seem to claim seeing Kira after they got hurt.

327
00:18:32.015 --> 00:18:33.715
Ridiculous.

328
00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:35.415
Are you saying that Kira's ghost

329
00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:38.815
is haunting the fans who have become fans of other idols?

330
00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:42.015
Gosh. Not again.

331
00:18:43.115 --> 00:18:45.415
Is that Kira?

332
00:18:46.915 --> 00:18:48.315
It's nothing.

333
00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:50.315
It's just a prank.

334
00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:54.115
He said, "Not again"?

335
00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:55.715
Yes.

336
00:18:55.715 --> 00:18:58.515
Mr. Sawanami was being blackmailed by somebody

337
00:18:58.515 --> 00:19:01.115
and killed.

338
00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:03.915
Mr. Honogi, how about you?

339
00:19:03.915 --> 00:19:06.415
I...

340
00:19:06.415 --> 00:19:09.015
Please tell us the truth.

341
00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:14.615
It's true that I was being blackmailed.

342
00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:16.715
What kind of blackmail?

343
00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:19.615
Kira didn't die of an accident

344
00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:22.615
but rather, here, during the party.

345
00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:28.915
And Mr. Hirasaka has hidden Kira's body.

346
00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:33.215
There was a similar rumor spreading through the internet too.

347
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:36.215
Someone probably took it for fact, and committed the murders.

348
00:19:36.215 --> 00:19:40.015
Mr. Sawanami and Mr. Hirasaka were also being blackmailed.

349
00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:43.615
But, it was just nonsense, a baseless rumor!

350
00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:47.615
And yet, Mr. Sawanami ended up the way he did!

351
00:19:47.615 --> 00:19:50.715
I wonder if the blackmailer is the culprit?

352
00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:53.815
Could it be that everyone was gathered here

353
00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:55.815
to search for the blackmailer?

354
00:19:55.815 --> 00:19:59.715
Under the pretense of holding a seance.

355
00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:01.515
Is that right?

356
00:20:03.415 --> 00:20:08.115
That's right, after discussing it with Mr. Hirasaka.

357
00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:12.015
Kira's fervent fan, Mr. Kani.

358
00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:18.015
Shoko and Maho who worshipped Kira as a charismatic figure.

359
00:20:18.015 --> 00:20:20.315
Mr. Yatsukawa, assistant director from the TV station

360
00:20:20.315 --> 00:20:21.715
are also to be suspected.

361
00:20:21.715 --> 00:20:23.015
Mr. Mifune too.

362
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:25.515
Is that why you called us over here?

363
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.215
No joke.

364
00:20:34.015 --> 00:20:36.215
Mr. Hirasaka suggested that

365
00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:39.415
we scare everyone at the seance and watch their reaction.

366
00:20:39.415 --> 00:20:42.215
If Kira's voice that you set up beforehand

367
00:20:42.215 --> 00:20:43.815
was switched by someone,

368
00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:47.215
it could be that the blackmailer is among someone here after all.

369
00:20:47.215 --> 00:20:49.115
So, it's highly likely that the person who killed Mr. Sawanami

370
00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.715
and the culprit of this case is one and the same.

371
00:20:51.715 --> 00:20:54.615
It could be that Kira's family or lover

372
00:20:54.615 --> 00:20:56.815
believed the rumors on the internet and...

373
00:20:56.815 --> 00:20:58.915
Kira had no family.

374
00:20:58.915 --> 00:21:01.715
They seemed to have died in a car accident when she was a child.

375
00:21:01.715 --> 00:21:06.015
Oh, that's why Kira was more into safe driving than anyone else.

376
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:07.615
It seems so.

377
00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:10.115
Pops, why don't you have them show you

378
00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:13.615
the word "Kira" that Mr. Sawanami left behind?

379
00:21:13.615 --> 00:21:15.415
Maybe it'll help you come up with something.

380
00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:19.515
Well, true.

381
00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:20.815
Inspector.

382
00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:23.115
Why not?

383
00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.315
-Takagi. -Yes, sir.

384
00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:31.315
Inspector.

385
00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:34.315
This key was the key for the padlock in question after all.

386
00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:35.515
I see.

387
00:21:35.515 --> 00:21:39.415
And, as for the rope that was found in Mr. Hirasaka's room,

388
00:21:39.415 --> 00:21:42.715
there's no doubt that it was used to kill Ms. Utakura.

389
00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:44.315
Just as I thought.

390
00:21:44.315 --> 00:21:47.515
If so, just as I deduced, Hirasaka's the...

391
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:52.215
But, unless we solve the other locked room mystery...

392
00:21:52.215 --> 00:21:54.715
Maybe there's a secret escape route

393
00:21:54.715 --> 00:21:56.415
in the meditation room or something?

394
00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.415
There could never be such a thing.

395
00:21:58.415 --> 00:22:00.815
Mr. Mouri, I'm had the picture of the word

396
00:22:00.815 --> 00:22:02.315
sent over by mail right now.

397
00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:09.715
"Kira"

398
00:22:09.715 --> 00:22:12.015
This is...

399
00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:14.915
Don't tell me the culprit is that person.

400
00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:25.115
"Kira"

401
00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:46.615
"Next Episode"

402
00:23:46.615 --> 00:23:49.615
I've got to solve the mystery of the two locked rooms!

403
00:23:49.615 --> 00:23:52.215
She used a magic spell!

404
00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:55.215
Kira became a witch after all, you know!

405
00:23:56.015 --> 00:23:58.615
If it's just as I've imagined,

406
00:23:58.615 --> 00:24:01.115
this room is much too sad.

407
00:24:01.115 --> 00:24:06.115
The name of the culprit that Mr. Sawanami wanted to relay...

408
00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.915
Next Conan,

409
00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:14.953
"Mystery of the Double Locked Room Seance (Locked Room Opened)"

410
00:24:15.742 --> 00:24:17.842
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:17.842 --> 00:24:20.042
"Ninja Technique"

412
00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:22.242
Ninja technique, "sober up"!

413
00:24:22.242 --> 00:24:24.742
Karate breathing method, "Seiya"!
