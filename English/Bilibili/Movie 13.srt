1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,260
Tonight, we've come to Tokyo Tower in Minato District.

2
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,550
Here at the Tokyo Tower, the Tanabata Fair is currently underway,

3
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,220
attracting a large number of visitors...

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,070
Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,090
Meet at the professor's at 4:00 p.m., right?

6
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,450
Don't be late. See you!

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,930
I also need a flashlight.

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,290
Well, I remember it was...

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,240
in this drawer.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,450
Ah! Here it is!

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,090
Huh?

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,380
Who's there? Ran-neechan?

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,850
Mr. Mouri is out playing mahjong. It can't be him.

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,940
Huh...Must be my imagination!

15
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,240
Long time no see, Shinichi Kudo! Or...

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,780
should I call you Conan Edogawa?

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,970
I'm surprised that you are still alive, and as a kid!

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,370
Hell of a miracle, isn't it, Boss?

19
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,770
How... How did they find out my identity?

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,330
Conan-kun?

21
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,890
Conan-kun, what's going on?

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,450
I heard some loud noises down there.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,500
Conan-kun?

24
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,040
Look carefully.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,590
Look and see how everyone

26
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,410
around you will end up!

27
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,170
Conan-kun? Is everything okay?

28
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,330
Conan-kun?

29
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,250
Are you inside?

30
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,140
I'm coming in.

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,450
Conan-kun?

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,990
Ran!

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,760
Holy crap! What a nightmare!

34
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,120
(Detective Conan
The Raven Chaser)

35
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,730
I'm high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,360
While visiting an amusement park

37
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,920
with Ran Mouri, my childhood friend and classmate,

38
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,870
I witnessed a man in black in the middle of a suspicious deal.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,840
Totally caught up in watching the deal go down,

40
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,580
I failed to notice one of his partners sneaking up behind me.

41
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,560
It was then that he forced me to take some weird drug.

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,330
When I woke up again,

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,570
my body had shrunk to that of a child!

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,270
If those guys found out that I was still alive,

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,900
they'd come after me again

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
and put those around me at risk.

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,440
At Professor Agasa's suggestion,

48
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,720
I hid my real identity,

49
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,990
and came up with the alias Conan Edogawa

50
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,630
when pressed by Ran.

51
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,640
In order to collect information on those responsible,

52
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,920
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.

53
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,290
The mysterious Black Organization consists of

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,700
Gin,

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,010
Vodka,

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,260
Vermouth,

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,120
Chianti, Korn,

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,510
and Sherry.

59
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,680
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

60
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,040
Her parents, who died when she was young,
once served as scientists for the Black Organization.

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,020
Under the codename Sherry,

62
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,440
she also worked for the Organization,

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,330
and developed the aforementioned drug APTX4869.

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,770
However, when her only elder sister,
Akemi Miyano, was killed by the Organization,

65
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,430
she turned against them.

66
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,560
She took the drug with the intention of taking her own life,

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,410
but instead, her body shrank as well.

68
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,510
She thus changed her name to Ai Haibara,

69
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,400
disguising herself as a first grader like I have

70
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,620
in order to evade the Organization.

71
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,380
Meanwhile, in one of my encounters with Vermouth,

72
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,100
I found an important lead.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,500
I wouldn't if I were you.

74
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,010
If you attempt to unplug this device,
a signal will be sent to my partner.

75
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,200
With your boss's...

76
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,370
E-mail address.

77
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,350
S-Seven Children?

78
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,240
Yeah. When you input the boss's address, that's what it sounds like...

79
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,470
The melody of Seven Children.

80
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,880
Don't tell me you are going to send an E-mail.

81
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,550
No way! I'm not that stupid, okay?

82
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,750
I won't send one until Detective Takagi finds out
who owns this E-mail address...

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,250
He'll be killed. I mean Detective Takagi.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,050
It'll happen when he gets close to finding out.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,090
And their next target will be the one who provided him
with the address, which would be you, Kudo-kun.

86
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,210
I say, you should let it go and forget all about it.

87
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,470
Because that E-mail address

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,820
is like a Pandora's Box that should never be opened.

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,240
Even though my body has shrunk, I'm still the same sharp-minded,

90
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,120
intelligent, and undefeated detective!

91
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,480
Only one truth will prevail!

92
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,350
Oh, there you are!

93
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,040
Nice!

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,340
I found one! A beetle!

95
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,020
Well done!

96
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,290
So it's true that those beetles like to stay in high places.

97
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,070
Alright! I'll climb up there too!

98
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,370
I don't think so, Genta-kun.

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,140
You'd better not.

100
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,330
I agree.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,770
Besides Edogawa-kun, the only ones
that can climb that high are monkeys.

102
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,460
Excuse me for being a monkey...

103
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,800
I know! You can use the suspenders.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,240
Suspenders?

105
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh. You mean those things you gave us earlier?

106
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,790
Yes. I've improved them.

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,680
One push of that button will make it extend up to 100 meters.

108
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,570
If you hold the button down, the belt will keep elongating.

109
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Once you release it and press again,
the belt will retract immediately.

110
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,130
Ouch!

111
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,340
I'm... I'm sorry!

112
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Come on! Be careful!

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,680
I found a beetle!

114
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,540
That's great, Genta-kun.

115
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,710
A rhinoceros beetle!

116
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,470
There's another one!

117
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Wow, two of them!

118
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,910
A male and a female!

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Eh?

120
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,330
The female beetle's wings have been taped. Look!

121
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,550
It's true. So mean!

122
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,030
Something's written on it.

123
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,830
Let's see...

124
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,910
Oh, it says "open."

125
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,600
They use this kind of tape on bento boxes sold in convenience stores.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,250
I saw some on a fried chicken bento I bought yesterday...

127
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,430
Fried chicken?

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,480
Isn't your belly big enough?

129
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,800
Let me see. I'll get those off.

130
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,870
Oh. Sure.

131
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,250
Who did this? What an awful prank!

132
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,650
But, since there are a male and a female,

133
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,770
maybe

134
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,320
they are lovers.

135
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,760
Then Ayumi will name them.

136
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,280
Well...The male is called Hikoboshi, and the female, Orihime!

137
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,540
Good idea!

138
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,810
Now that you mentioned it, Tanabata festival is coming up.

139
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,480
Speaking of Tanabata...

140
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,350
Alright. It's off.

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,510
...it's time for your long-waited quiz!

142
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,150
No one was waiting for that...

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,860
One year, on the night of Tanabata, it rained heavily,

144
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,010
stopping Orihime and Hikoboshi from reaching one another.

145
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,510
Troubled, the two lovers decided on a "Day to Spend with Your Lover,"

146
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,360
or "Lovers' Day" for short, so they could meet on that day instead.

147
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,210
Now, which of the following is that day?

148
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,700
No. 1, New Year's Day on January 1st.

149
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,150
No. 2, Setsubun on February 2nd.

150
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,550
No. 3, Peach Festival on March 3rd.

151
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,850
No. 4, Tango no Sekku on May 5th.

152
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,410
I know! No. 3! Peach Festival!

153
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,160
Because Odairi-sama and Ohina-sama are lovers
in the girl's doll sets they sell then.

154
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,260
Nope. It should be No. 4, Tango no Sekku.

155
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,850
Because lovers like to dance to the passionate music of tango!

156
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,040
I think it's No. 1! On New Year's Day,
you can eat mochi with your lover!

157
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,820
Oh, you guys sure came up with some good reasons.

158
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,650
Professor, what's the answer?

159
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,350
It's No. 4, May 5th.

160
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,460
I got it right!

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,660
But my explanation is...

162
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,960
May 5th, also called Children's Day, can be read "Kodomo no Hi."

163
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,280
If you separate the kanji from Kodomo no Hi,

164
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,890
you'll get "Ko-i-tomo-no-Hi",
namely "Koi, tomo no Hi", or Lovers' Day.

165
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,730
I see, a pun!

166
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,910
That's why you told us the shorter name for
"Day to Spend with Your Lover", right?

167
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,730
"Lovers' Day," huh?

168
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,990
I hope that Hikoboshi-san and Orihime-san can be together forever!

169
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,610
Say, do you really think it's suitable
to name two beetles Hikoboshi and Orihime?

170
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,490
Why not?

171
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,040
I think those are perfect names.

172
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,440
Orihime in English is Vega.

173
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,120
The tape on the female beetle forms the letter "V,"

174
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,870
which is the first letter of Vega, isn't it?

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,370
True! It is perfect!

176
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,780
Yes!

177
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,070
Well done, Haibara-san!

178
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,380
Say, how am I supposed to get down?

179
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,750
What's going on?

180
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,870
Stop! Stop!

181
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,780
Hey! Are you okay?

182
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,020
Call an ambulance!

183
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,170
Okay!

184
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,590
T-Tanabata...Kyo...

185
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,840
What?

186
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,190
Hey! Hang in there! The ambulance will be here soon!

187
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,680
Hey! Stay with me!

188
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,630
Listen, I'm making an exception by bringing you here.

189
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,070
You need to behave yourself.

190
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,770
Okay!

191
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,470
Ah, dad, your tie is crooked.

192
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,060
Ah, Mouri-san!

193
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,200
Thank you for stopping by this early!

194
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,100
Good morning, Ran-chan, Conan-kun.

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,700
Good morning!

196
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,550
So this is a full-on serial murder case?

197
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,170
Yes. Our crime scene yesterday was on a turnpike in Odawara City.

198
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,960
We also found a mahjong tile there.

199
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,460
Similar mahjong tiles were also found at the previous crime scenes

200
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,570
in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka and Nagano.

201
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,080
There are altogether five similar cases now.

202
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,380
I see.

203
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,170
Anyway, let's go over the details in the meeting.

204
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,820
Please.

205
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,100
Hey, isn't that Mouri-san! Long time no see!

206
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,050
You are as loud as always,

207
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yokomizo.

208
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,710
I'm Sango. This is my brother, Juugo.

209
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,720
I know. I've met him several times.

210
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,010
Sango and Juugo? Like, 3-5 and 10-5?

211
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,940
Who's the lady?

212
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,950
Oh, pardon me. This is Inspector Ogino
with the Saitama Prefecture Police.

213
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,090
I'm Ayami Ogino. I've heard so much about you.

214
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,940
My, to think there was such a beautiful inspector
in the Saitama Prefecture Police!

215
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,250
When I worked in Saitama, she was junior to me.

216
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,430
Why the Saitama Prefecture Police?

217
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,180
The victim who was killed in Tokyo was from Tokorozawa, Saitama,

218
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,540
so I was called to this meeting.

219
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,810
And what brought you here, Mouri-san?

220
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,480
He was invited to serve as a special advisor
as per Superintendent Matsumoto's request.

221
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,850
To think we have to call upon a private
detective for help. How shameful!

222
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,760
Agreed.

223
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,540
You are...

224
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,020
Inspector Yamato Kansuke from Nagano Prefecture Police. And you are

225
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,580
that quack detective with Gunma prefecture Police...

226
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,950
You are such a kidder, Mouri-san!

227
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,460
You know my name is Yamamura Misao.

228
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,120
But, didn't the incident happen in Nagano?

229
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,740
Why would someone from Gunma...

230
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,150
Because the crime scene lies on the border of Nagano and Gunma, so...

231
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,500
The victim's body parts from the knees down
were in Gunma Prefecture! Right here!

232
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,850
Ah, enough, I already know your name.

233
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,280
I-Inspector?

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,700
You were promoted to inspector?

235
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,400
Oh, you've noticed! It's true that I've been
honorably promoted to inspector!

236
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,030
So you were promoted...

237
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,740
Is Gunma serious about this?

238
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,160
Say, did the boy with glasses come?

239
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,710
The boy with glasses?

240
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,470
You mean Conan?

241
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,650
Yes, Conan Edogawa-kun.

242
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,910
When he's around, cases always seem to get solved easily.

243
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,760
Come to think of it, that's happened to me, too!

244
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,700
Same here as well!

245
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,280
Ah? You all think so?

246
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,860
Actually, we can't agree more!

247
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,310
And then you'd lose consciousness,

248
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,490
and next thing you knew, the case was already solved, right?

249
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,320
Oops!

250
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,310
Lose consciousness?

251
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,280
Really?

252
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,110
That didn't happen to me.

253
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,340
Never. Never.

254
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,230
What? Just me?

255
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,180
You were the only officer I've ever tranquilized.

256
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,500
How weird...

257
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,400
It's time for the meeting.

258
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,400
Excuse me!

259
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,390
Mouri-san!

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,660
Hey, Mouri-san!

261
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:13,990
Huh?

262
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,530
Who is he? He looks so mean.

263
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,270
Idiot! That's Superintendent Kiyonaga Matsumoto!

264
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,360
With a face like that?

265
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,910
Keep talking like that, and you'll get your ass kicked!

266
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,010
For starters, putting the sixth case aside,
the common factor between the previous five cases was

267
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,790
that all of the victims were stabbed to death with a large knife.

268
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,890
Judging from the puncture wounds,

269
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,280
the killer raised his right arm and plunged the knife straight down.

270
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,010
Also, the victims in each of the five cases
were attacked with a stun gun first,

271
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,350
then killed and left at the primary crime scenes.

272
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,740
Now, one question surfaces. Why did the suspect

273
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,770
move the disabled and unconscious victims to another location

274
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,910
to complete the murder?

275
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,210
Besides, on the bodies of the six victims

276
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,640
we found mahjong tiles with red circles on the front

277
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,360
and alphabet letters with black vertical lines
through them on the back.

278
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,200
These appear to be messages left by the killer.

279
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,820
About the red circles of the 7-pin tiles, the top-right

280
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,960
and bottom-left circles of the four bottom ones are left unmarked.

281
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:33,050
The alphabet letters are two A's, E, H, Z and an upside-down L.

282
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,170
Also, each one of the six victims has had something

283
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,800
taken from among their belongings.

284
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,530
A pendant, a wallet, a keepsake...

285
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,160
A motorcycle key holder, a make-up kit, and a doll.

286
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,300
Could they merely have fallen out while the bodies
were being moved from one place to another?

287
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,170
No. Since each of the six victims had precisely one item missing,

288
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,950
chances were they were taken by the suspect.

289
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,700
Our main focus all comes down to the meaning of those messages.

290
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,590
There's another message.

291
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,990
Our sixth victim, Ryuuzaki-san, said words
"Tanabata...Kyo" before he died.

292
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:18,270
Ryuuzaki-san was probably at the rest stop on Mount Daikan

293
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,390
when his brake oil ran out. It must also be the place
where he saw the suspect.

294
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,940
Say... Everybody.

295
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,910
No need to overcomplicate this case.

296
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,710
I think the mahjong tiles represent the game of mahjong itself.

297
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,970
The motive is simple. It's an argument
gone wrong over a game of mahjong.

298
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,550
The 1-pin and 7-pin tiles left by the suspect

299
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,050
suggest that there were eight players.

300
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,950
As for the 7-pin tiles, only two circles remain unmarked in red.

301
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,500
One of them represents the suspect,

302
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,190
while the other the final victim.

303
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
You mean the crime is still ongoing?

304
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,800
Yes. I'm afraid so.

305
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,010
If it were meant to represent eight people,
wouldn't it be better to leave 8-pin tiles?

306
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,980
There's more to the 1 and 7-pin tiles.

307
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,380
The suspect was waiting for those two tiles in order to claim victory.

308
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,960
And with those, the suspect could have made a quick comeback!

309
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,150
I see!

310
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,600
Although, another player still won with a cheap hand!

311
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,350
And that's when the suspect went crazy, right?

312
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,730
Exactly! I'm afraid the other players also felt it unfair,

313
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,060
yet the suspect took it the hardest among them all.

314
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,530
And that's the motive.

315
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,410
Excuse me...

316
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,670
How do you explain the alphabet letters, then?

317
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,420
And why did the suspect move the victims
to another place to proceed with kill?

318
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,980
Also...

319
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,030
What does Ryuuzaki-san's dying message mean?

320
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,310
Um...About that...

321
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,550
Well...

322
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
As for that... Well...We will see in due course.

323
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,750
Superintendent.

324
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,040
Do the six crime scenes mean anything special to the suspect?

325
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,460
If they do,

326
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,260
that's the part which will lead us right to our suspect.

327
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,560
As for the six victims, they were bound

328
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,360
to be related to the suspect somehow.

329
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,920
Finding out what they had in common
should be the key to cracking the case.

330
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,410
It's still possible that the connection
lies in a game of mahjong, as Mouri-kun said.

331
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,070
Besides, the alphabet letters and black lines
on the back of the tiles, as well as

332
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,220
the dying message "Tanabata...Kyo," should also be taken into account.

333
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,000
Listen up, everyone. It's highly possible
that our suspect will commit another crime.

334
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,450
We must stop him no matter what it takes!

335
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,260
At times like this, we must put aside
our territorial imperatives and rivalries,

336
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,820
and share with each other all the information in order

337
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:02,830
to capture our suspect as soon as possible!
Do your best in your investigations!

338
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,100
Yes, sir!

339
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,300
Bathroom! Bathroom! Can't hold it!

340
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,960
Looks like the meeting is over.

341
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,110
Looks like it.

342
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,370
Superintendent Matsumoto!

343
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,350
Long time no see! How's Sayuri-sensei doing?

344
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,130
Oh, you are Mouri's... My daughter is doing fine.

345
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,600
Well, Mouri. I'm counting on you.

346
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,390
Your humble servant, Kogoro Mouri,

347
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,760
vows to do his best and meet your expectations!

348
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,180
Okay.

349
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,830
Thank you for your trust!

350
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,540
Ah, Detective Chiba, did you lose weight?

351
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,020
You noticed?

352
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,510
I'm on a diet now. It's popular on that morning TV program, you know?

353
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,110
Speaking of that,

354
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,130
Shiratori, you've put on weight, haven't you?

355
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:10,040
A-Are you kidding, Mouri-san? I work out twice a week.

356
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,340
How unusual! You drink black coffee?

357
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,070
Yes.

358
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,810
The doctor asked me to pay attention to my sugar intake.

359
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,610
But if I remember right, you hate sweet food, don't you?

360
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,030
Three murder cases happened in a row.

361
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,780
I can't function without glucose!

362
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,430
Well, Inspector Yokomizo...

363
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,710
Huh?

364
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:29,990
Yes?

365
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,990
Oh, I mean the elder one.

366
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:33,950
Oh.

367
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,910
Say... Is that the boy

368
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
you've been talking about, Conan Edogawa-kun?

369
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,090
Oh.

370
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,960
Because he's influenced by Mouri-san's deductions,

371
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,090
he'd sometimes say things that turn out to be quite enlightening.

372
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,980
And he often notices little interesting things-

373
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,390
the things even we pros may overlook...

374
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,670
Is that so?

375
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,860
♪ Oh, crow ♪

376
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,340
♪ Why are you crying ♪

377
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,170
♪ 'Cause in the mountain, the crow... ♪

378
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,440
Detective Yamamura, that song...

379
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,250
I see you may not know that I am...

380
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,870
Why were you just singing that song, Inspector Yamamura?

381
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,040
Why? I just heard it outside the bathroom.

382
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
It sounded like someone dialing a phone number.

383
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,130
When I left the bathroom...

384
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,460
I saw an officer with glasses dialing on his cellphone and...

385
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,840
Wait, Conan-kun...!

386
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,870
Could it be...

387
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,600
Could it be those guys...

388
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:37,920
Could it be...

389
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,580
There!

390
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,630
Hey, Conan-kun!

391
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,980
Is everything okay?

392
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,040
Shoot!

393
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,190
Going to the bathroom!

394
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,170
Conan-kun?

395
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,820
The bathroom is right here.

396
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,340
That was a Porsche 356A. Gin's car!

397
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,730
How? How did they get in the meeting?

398
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,220
What will they do next?

399
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,080
What did you say?

400
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,990
They infiltrated the police meeting?

401
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,940
Shh! Lower your voice!

402
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,550
I hope Haibara didn't hear that.

403
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,990
Oh, I think she's in the lab downstairs.

404
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,440
I'm afraid the disguised officer was Vermouth.

405
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,010
She must have mailed her boss about the meeting
while waiting for the elevator.

406
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,930
I see. That's why Detective Yamamura overheard

407
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,340
the number being dialed that sounded like Seven Children.

408
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,960
But why...

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,930
Oh, well...

410
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,590
I was wondering what you guys were whispering about.

411
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,800
Haibara!

412
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,810
So, why do you think that was Vermouth?

413
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,150
The dialed numbers alone wouldn't...

414
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,080
Because I also saw Gin's Porsche.

415
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,690
The risk would be too high for them
to infiltrate the police without a disguise.

416
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,190
And Vermouth is best at disguising herself.

417
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,020
Anyway, it's safe to assume that the Black Organization

418
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,780
has something to do with these cases.

419
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,960
So, I'd like to investigate these cases. Think you can lend me a hand?

420
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,600
I certainly can...

421
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,660
You wouldn't stop anyway, even if I asked you to.

422
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,240
However, you've got to be careful. You should know

423
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,710
that if they find out who you really are...

424
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah. I know.

425
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,480
Eh? They didn't play mahjong?

426
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,980
Yes. According to our investigation,
none of the six victims played mahjong.

427
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,410
Sorry, but looks like your deduction was wrong.

428
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,630
We are completely stuck.

429
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,150
If only Kudo-kun were here at a time like this...

430
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,330
By Kudo-kun you mean the high school detective Shinichi Kudo-kun

431
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,900
who often helps with your cases?

432
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,580
Well, yes.

433
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,890
Now that you mention it, I haven't heard anything about him recently.

434
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,450
I bet he's already tired of playing detective.

435
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,760
Ah, no, it's not true.

436
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,100
He just solved a case at a Taitan High School festival

437
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,550
a short while ago.

438
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,840
Takagi-kun!

439
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,330
Sorry! I slipped...

440
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,140
What's that about?

441
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,840
As per his request, we've been withholding
information regarding his involvement.

442
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,410
I see.

443
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,470
He's quite low-key, huh?

444
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,120
He's changed, for some reason.

445
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,090
He used to be

446
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,320
quite the show-off.

447
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,690
Taking two days off from school didn't cause
any problems for you, right?

448
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,990
Um... I guess.

449
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,470
And

450
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,340
what about the correlation between the mahjong titles
and the alphabet letters?

451
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,490
I still don't know.

452
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,550
Nor do I know the meaning of "Tanabata...Kyo."

453
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,580
Wow! Mitsuhiko-kun, it's amazing!

454
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,390
It's a rhinoceros beetle, isn't it?

455
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,750
Yeah. I'm pretty good at it!

456
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,090
But some people do mean things like putting tape on beetles.

457
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,570
You mean Orihime-san, right? I wonder who did it.

458
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,880
Me, too.

459
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,160
Say, Genta-kun, is that a snake you made?

460
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,770
Can't you tell? It's an eel! Eel!

461
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,050
Oh, an eel again?

462
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,930
Genta-kun, you really love eels, don't you?

463
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,610
You even wrote it on your Tanabata wish card.

464
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,800
"I want to have a big bowl of Unadon. Genta."

465
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,830
Come to think of it, Tanabata is tomorrow.

466
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,150
Tanabata...Kyo...

467
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,910
What's that supposed to mean?

468
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,800
Come on! You should turn that off during a meeting!

469
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,490
Yes?

470
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,190
It's me.

471
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,800
And?

472
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,630
What?

473
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,160
Oh! Roger that!

474
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,650
Good news!

475
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,860
I was told that a man suspected to be our serial killer
might show up in Beika City.

476
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,210
Are you sure?

477
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,380
Minoru Fukase, 27 years old.

478
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,210
One year ago, he stabbed

479
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,190
Shuuhei Jinno-san to death on Usui pass.

480
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,660
He was also badly wounded, and remains on our wanted list.

481
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,170
I asked our men to monitor his girlfriend,

482
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,730
who, based on my intel, boarded a train from Nagano to Tokyo,

483
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,010
and just arrived at Beika Station.

484
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,580
Risa Yoshii, 21 years old.

485
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,820
She works at a bar in Nagano.

486
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,100
So, why did this Fukase guy kill Jinno-san?

487
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,110
While they were lining up at the Tropical Land amusement park,

488
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,210
Jinno-san warned him not to smoke, which got him fired up.

489
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,980
Tropical Land...

490
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,980
Takagi-kun?

491
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,310
What came to mind just now?

492
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,420
Could it be...

493
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,430
Could it be that all the victims were all waiting in the same line?

494
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,360
What? Explain, please.

495
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:10,840
Yes.

496
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,280
There are two variations of the mahjong tiles found near the victims.

497
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,320
Jinno-san's was 1-pin,

498
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,190
and the others' were 7-pins.

499
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,820
And, if we place them into the circles
as indicated by the red marks...

500
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,540
the victims may have lined up this way, right?

501
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,560
I see.

502
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,320
Then, that Fukase...

503
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,560
Alright. Megure, get your men and go along with Inspector Yamato.

504
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,560
Gosh, I can't believe they sent you!

505
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,150
For once, I wanted to ride on the capital highway!

506
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,970
Inspector Yamato, what about you?

507
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,470
Now, let's spread out as planned.

508
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,220
She's the suspect?

509
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,080
Or, could she be...

510
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,470
Minoru!

511
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,120
We've got eyes on Fukase.

512
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,000
Hold this position.

513
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,660
Do not get spotted.

514
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,300
Hurry! Hurry!

515
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,250
The game shop's on the 7th floor, right?

516
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,050
Yep. Let's get some ice cream after.

517
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,390
I'm gonna get a vanilla and chocolate double scoop!

518
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,670
Inspector, we have children around Fukase!

519
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,700
Remain calm. Make our move after the children are gone.

520
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,250
Roger.

521
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,100
-Which floor is this?
-One more to go.

522
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,340
Suspect has arrived on the 5th floor.

523
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,250
We are almost there!

524
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,410
Now, move in!

525
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,580
Roger that!

526
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,850
Roger that!

527
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Wait...

528
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,100
That idiot!

529
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,100
Fukase! Freeze! Police!

530
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,370
You have nowhere to run!

531
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,300
Damn!

532
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,620
Stop it, Fukase!

533
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,440
Stay away! Or I'll kill her!

534
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,450
Damn!

535
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,720
Don't move! I'll stab her if you dare!

536
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,650
Stop! You can't get away with it!

537
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,200
Shut up! Stay away!

538
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:29,980
Stay away!

539
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,370
Get out of my way!

540
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,790
Okay! Just calm down!

541
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,550
What a waste of time!

542
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,520
He passed out. What happened?

543
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,080
Stay away from him!

544
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,860
Stay away from him!

545
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,710
Stay away from him!

546
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,290
Calm down, Risa-san. Drop the knife.

547
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,440
No.

548
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,930
That won't change anything. Drop it.

549
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,090
I won't! Stay away from him!

550
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,460
Alright, that's enough, Risa-san.

551
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,300
You don't want to commit another crime.

552
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,060
I'm sorry!

553
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,560
Are you okay, Inspector?

554
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,580
Don't worry. My belly fat has some thickness to it.

555
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm sorry!

556
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,730
I'm so sorry. I dropped my guard.

557
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:31,900
It's okay. I can't let another prefecture's officer
get hurt in my jurisdiction, can I?

558
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,820
What's wrong?

559
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,250
Well...Where's that female hostage?

560
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,700
You are just gonna walk away like this?

561
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,400
Isn't there something you want from that guy?

562
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,990
Vermouth.

563
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,540
I didn't have any other choice. You pushed me into a corner.

564
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,470
Besides, perhaps that man isn't the killer.

565
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,400
Yeah. That's true.

566
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,770
Take it easy! My right shoulder hurts!

567
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,200
Your right shoulder hurts?

568
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,540
Wait a sec, just now...

569
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,400
Stay away!

570
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,040
A man who can't even raise his right arm can't be our assailant.

571
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,020
Assuming he didn't hurt it after committing the crime, that is.

572
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,310
So, you recognized me after all.

573
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,330
Your ankle.

574
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,260
My ankle?

575
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,910
There was a bulge near your right ankle.

576
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,810
You have a gun concealed there, no?

577
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:00,650
And, the guy wounded your left cheek with a knife,
but you didn't even bleed.

578
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,050
Jeez...

579
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,620
I guess I'll have to make a blood-seeping mask next time.

580
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,240
I think

581
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,040
you purposely made yourself his hostage,
and planned to utilize your gun

582
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,020
to turn the tables on him once you were out of the police's sight.

583
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,500
What a well-thought-out plan!

584
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,730
I doubt you'd really put your gun to use, anyway.

585
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,140
I didn't expect to receive a compliment from you.

586
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,500
Why is your Organization involved in this serial murder case?

587
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,540
How straightforward of you!

588
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,860
Spit it out.

589
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
NOC.

590
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,580
NOC?

591
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,980
A member of yours working undercover
as a civilian became one of the victims?

592
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,950
Right. That agent, perhaps for the sake of safety,

593
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,180
carried a memory card containing our entire NOC list.

594
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,970
The organization had planned to get rid of him.

595
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,110
But who would've thought...

596
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,320
That he would be killed by someone else first.

597
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:16,590
Correct. And then the killer took the memory card.
Most likely without knowing its value.

598
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,440
I see. It would be trouble for you

599
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,970
should the police catch the killer and get the memory card, so...

600
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,420
Wait, the fact that you are here means a NOC
has been planted in the police!

601
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,860
No. You had one of your partners disguise as an officer.

602
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,390
That's why you infiltrated the meeting, right?

603
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,930
You wanted to ensure that your partner's disguise was still airtight.

604
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,550
Otherwise, you would've stayed undercover yourself.

605
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,270
Who is it? Who is he disguised as? Is the real officer in danger?

606
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,630
The time for sharing tips is over. You're on your own for the rest.

607
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,170
His codename is Irish.

608
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,710
Irish...

609
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,210
Yep. Irish whiskey is nicely distilled, with a mild taste.

610
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,740
Excuse me, security guard.

611
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,190
This kid is lost.

612
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,550
Lost?

613
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,620
No...

614
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,580
Good luck! I wish you all the best!

615
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,030
Damn!

616
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,440
Yes? It's Megure. Oh, Superintendent.

617
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,750
We just got a call from a painter named Sumire Shindo

618
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,750
saying she has a clue that may lead to our suspect.

619
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,840
The address is in Hachioji City.

620
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,530
Yes, sir! Got it.

621
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,850
Sato! Takagi!

622
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,690
Head to Hachioji now!

623
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,550
Yes, sir!

624
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,180
Got it. Sumire Shindo, right?

625
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,660
Not good, Boss. If we go from here,

626
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,120
even if we are ahead of the cops, we'll still
get caught before we get the job done.

627
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,980
We won't be running into the cops.

628
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,550
It's me.

629
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,160
Nice! We made it in time!

630
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,360
I'll take right.

631
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,370
Okay. Leave the left to me.

632
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,060
Cute boy...

633
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,820
Pretty lady...

634
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,250
What's going on?

635
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,510
Stay calm! Slowly pull over!

636
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,260
It's hot! We got a flat tire!

637
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,490
And another here.

638
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,480
Takagi-kun, contact Shiratori-kun.

639
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,320
Got it.

640
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,470
Damn.

641
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,330
Someone got here first.

642
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,500
We can't stay for long.

643
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,630
Let's go.

644
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,430
What? No one's there?

645
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,000
Are you sure she's not just left home?

646
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,760
I'm sure. The room has been trashed.

647
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,960
I'm sure the suspect abducted Shindo-san and fled.

648
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,680
Requesting backup A.S.A.P.

649
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,710
Please call for the forensics team.

650
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,660
Roger.

651
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,490
Thanks.

652
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,230
Takagi-kun...

653
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:46,940
What is it?

654
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,070
Sato-san?

655
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,100
Disguised as an officer?

656
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,050
Yeah. The codename is Irish. Ever heard of it?

657
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,530
No. Never.

658
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,120
I see.

659
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,650
If only I had a clue about who this guy is...

660
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,090
I think you should leave it.

661
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,020
If it's true that this Irish was disguised as an officer,

662
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,840
he must have noticed that you ran after Vermouth after the meeting.

663
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:26,480
Yeah...but...

664
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,970
Don't you get it?

665
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:33,500
The more cases you solve, the more obvious
it will be that you are Shinichi Kudo!

666
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,240
Ai-kun...

667
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,670
I know what you are worried about.

668
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:53,050
But I can't just leave it be. It concerns the life
of the officer Irish disguised himself as.

669
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,060
Anyway, there's no doubt that Irish
already infiltrated that police meeting.

670
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,310
I need to find out who he is by any means necessary,

671
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,150
and catch the culprit before they do

672
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,790
in order to get the memory card that NOC was carrying.

673
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,260
That memory card could be the key
to taking them down once and for all.

674
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,050
But can you trust what Vermouth said?

675
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,460
She was already aware that Haibara is Sherry.

676
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,830
She may even know my identity as well.

677
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,710
But, for whatever reason, she's kept it from the Organization.

678
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,510
I have no choice but to trust her for now.

679
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,780
Even so, she still called you out
to the shrine like she was leery of you.

680
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,750
She was leery of Irish.

681
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,190
Let's not meet except for at school until everything's settled.

682
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,830
Only as a precaution.

683
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,690
What's up, Gin?

684
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,960
Where have you been for the past two hours?

685
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,370
Seems you've been places where you had to turn your cell off.

686
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,460
What are you getting at?

687
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,070
Forget it.

688
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,850
Just focus on finishing your job.

689
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:11,010
By the way, the one who used the drug
to poison the high school detective was you, right?

690
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,600
Who are you talking about?

691
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,740
Shinichi Kudo...

692
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,770
Remember?

693
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,090
What happened?

694
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,060
Sorry!

695
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,210
I broke your bowl!

696
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,460
It's okay.

697
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,470
But you seldom break things, though.

698
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,220
Yeah. What's with me today?

699
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,150
Apparently the victim is Sumire Shindo.

700
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,320
Okay. Got it. 3:00, right?

701
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,630
See you then.

702
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,730
Was that Detective Takagi?

703
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,660
There's another meeting at 3:00.

704
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,570
Any progress on the case?

705
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,210
Sumire Shindo's body was found.

706
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,310
Where?

707
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,200
He said it was in Kanagawa Prefecture's Ayase City.

708
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,520
Was there another 7-pin mahjong tile?

709
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,770
Yeah. The red mark this time is on the top-right
of the four bottom circles.

710
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,320
But instead of a letter on the back, there's a triangle.

711
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,450
Hey! Go to school!

712
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,490
It's true!

713
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,010
Really strange!

714
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,850
Morning!

715
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,750
Conan-kun!

716
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,090
It's bad! Your dolphin's fin is missing!

717
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,400
The fin?

718
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,010
Oh. It's true!

719
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,570
There are marks of a leather glove!

720
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,980
A mysterious case has occurred!

721
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,430
That's an exaggeration. I bet it was knocked off
by accident when someone was cleaning.

722
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,840
But we searched everywhere and couldn't find it.

723
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,560
It's okay. I'll just make another one and put it on.

724
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,530
Do you think that fin...

725
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,340
No way. Don't worry.

726
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,950
It must be those people...

727
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:23,050
Just looking from here gives me the chills. We really lucked out!

728
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,580
Don't you think it's strange?

729
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,770
There's no way that two tires would burst at the same time.

730
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,530
Maybe there were nails on the road.

731
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,420
A sniper...

732
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,090
Our tires must have been shot flat by someone from this bridge.

733
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,380
I saw a car parked here.

734
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,330
Really?

735
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:50,600
Takagi-kun, it might be just a wild hunch,
but I think there might be another

736
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,400
group of people lurking around in this case besides our suspect.

737
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,640
Lurking around?

738
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,290
At Shindo-san's studio, her paint tube was stepped on twice.

739
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,900
The first time, it caused paint to squirt out.

740
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,000
After the paint had dried, someone stepped on it again.

741
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,820
It means after the culprit abducted Shindo-san,
someone else visited the scene.

742
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:19,420
Really? Maybe the culprit left after the paint had dried.

743
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,990
Moreover, the female hostage who disappeared
at the mall in Beika City was also suspicious.

744
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,920
Could she have been a partner of those people,

745
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,600
merely playing the part of a hostage?

746
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,040
Come on, you're thinking too much!

747
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,850
You're right. I guess I think too much.

748
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,140
But if it's true,

749
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,700
there's got to be one of them in the cops too,

750
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,790
and the spy would have been among the meeting attendees.

751
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,870
The dark knight helmet?

752
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,490
It's damaged. People in the drama club are arguing about it.

753
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,490
The bowl...

754
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,140
I broke Conan-kun's bowl last night.

755
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,920
And now, the helmet Shinichi wore is damaged.

756
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,750
I have a bad feeling about this.

757
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,020
Aren't you thinking too much?

758
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,890
That kid and Shinichi-kun aren't related in any way.

759
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,870
Even so...I need to tell him about it.

760
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,780
The dark knight helmet is damaged?

761
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,760
Oh, no! My fingerprints

762
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,070
were on that helmet!

763
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,180
Damn! If both the dolphin fin and the helmet were their doing...

764
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,860
What do I do now? If I can't figure out a solution,

765
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,980
Ran and Mr. Mouri and everybody around me will be in danger.

766
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,330
The memory card! I'll have the upper hand
if I can get the memory card!

767
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,690
I have to hurry and catch the culprit!

768
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,500
I bet it's from Shinichi-kun.

769
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,050
Yes.

770
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,130
He says, "I'm dealing with a tough case right now,"

771
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,930
"so don't call or text me."

772
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:09,530
But...

773
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,350
What tough case?

774
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,170
At least let me hear your voice, Shinichi...

775
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,830
That should do it.

776
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,750
What gets me is the message "Tanabata...Kyo."

777
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,760
What does that mean?

778
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,510
Tanabata...Kyo... Kyoto?

779
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,690
Oh, Kudo. It's been a while.

780
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,280
What is it that you wanted to ask me about?

781
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,140
I see.

782
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,870
Who are you talking to?

783
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,340
You scared me, moron!

784
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,340
I'm sorry!

785
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,330
You scared the hell out of me!

786
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,510
So, you are talking to someone important, aren't you?

787
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,810
Don't be silly! It's Kudo!

788
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,950
Regarding that serial murder case...

789
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,760
He asked me whether "Tanabata Kyoto" rings a bell or not.

790
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,650
Sorry about that, Kudo.

791
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,420
That stupid Kazuha just interrupted me.

792
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,380
Speaking of "Tanabata Kyoto"

793
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,980
Doesn't he mean the Mitarashi Festival?

794
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,540
The one held in Kitano Tenman Temple.

795
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,390
Also, the Tanabata Festival in Jishu-Jinja Shrine is famous, too!

796
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,080
Why don't we go there tonight?

797
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,840
Go by yourself! Did you hear that, Kudo?

798
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,420
Yeah. But I don't see the connection.

799
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:35,730
Me neither. Other things that come to mind are...

800
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:40,930
Come on! Let's go! We don't have to spend the night
if we go to Kyoto. It's just a one-day trip.

801
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,100
I wouldn't stay in a hotel anyway, idiot!

802
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,500
There was a fire there two years ago, remember?

803
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,170
Stingy!

804
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,440
Hey, Hattori...

805
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,890
What was that fire about?

806
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,780
There was a fire in Kyoto the year before last.

807
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,980
Come to think of it, it was on the night of Tanabata.

808
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,390
Tell me more.

809
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,310
I remember the hotel was named Vega.

810
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,090
Two guests died in the fire.

811
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:10,080
Hattori, please get more information
about the fire for me. It's an emergency!

812
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,090
Okay.

813
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,570
Wait, Heiji! What are you doing?

814
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,110
Class is starting soon!

815
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,630
Just tell the teacher

816
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:25,150
that Hattori-kun went to Vega to meet Orihime-san!

817
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,460
Hey! Who's Orihime-san?

818
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:35,460
Fire... Do the red marks and letters on the tiles represent a fire?

819
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:49,680
The cause was a lit cigarette that belonged to a guest
on the fifth floor. The emergency staircase was unusable.

820
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,660
Another guest on the sixth floor died from smoke inhalation.

821
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:57,480
Nanako Honjue, from Mitaka City, Jindai Ward.

822
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,050
Mizutani-san!

823
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,550
Mizutani-san!

824
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,280
Mizutani-kun is out.

825
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,450
Do you know where he went?

826
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,070
So, you are Detective Mouri's assistant?

827
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:36,110
My name is Shun Sawamura. I'm a law student at Jounan University.

828
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,710
Thank you! Please don't tell anyone about this.

829
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,030
It's a confidential investigation.

830
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,710
That's why he sent a kid like you?

831
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,770
So, Kosuke Mizutani-san and Nanako Honjue-san were...

832
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:57,110
Lovers. They ran away from Chiba to here together
because their families disapproved of their relationship.

833
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,600
Ran away...

834
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:05,650
On the day of Tanabata two years ago, they took a trip
to Kyoto and stayed at that business hotel.

835
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:10,300
And then he went to visit a friend in the city by himself.

836
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,230
The hotel caught fire during that time.

837
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:18,830
"If only I hadn't gone out by myself, Nana wouldn't have died."

838
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,260
He began crying after saying that.

839
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,070
What does Mizutani-san do for work?

840
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,140
He was working a part-time job,
but he stopped working after his girlfriend died.

841
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,410
He hasn't been here for a long time.

842
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,000
Where does he live now?

843
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,420
Who knows? Oh, maybe in Chiba.

844
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,690
Today's the second anniversary of his girlfriend's death.

845
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,190
Then he went to a temple?

846
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:49,260
Maybe. You might have better luck asking her big brother.

847
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,350
Hold on a second.

848
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,280
Prior to her death, her big brother came here several times.

849
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,900
He told me to contact him if his sister was in any trouble.

850
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,950
Found it! Look.

851
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,720
It's her brother's card. And this is Mizutani-kun.

852
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,500
May I take a note of this number?

853
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,200
Sure.

854
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,910
And, please give me your cellphone number, too, Sawamura-san.

855
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,670
Hello? Hattori.

856
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,750
Hey, Kudo! Big news!

857
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,700
The names of the seven victims you sent

858
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,130
match the names of the guests on the sixth floor during the fire.

859
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,580
There were two more guests on the sixth floor.

860
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,430
Nanako Honjue-san and Kosuke Mizutani-san.

861
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,330
You knew already? Then, how about this?

862
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:52,360
That Mizutani guy also came here
and asked about the same thing one year ago.

863
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:58,850
I bet this case has everything to do with the fire two years ago.

864
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,510
But what is it all about? If Mizutani is the culprit,
what is his motive?

865
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,680
Wasn't Honjue-san's death an accident?

866
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,650
Hattori,

867
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,210
how many elevators are there in the hotel?

868
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:16,230
Elevators? There's only one, I think.

869
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,570
What's the capacity?

870
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,610
Hold on.

871
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,490
Seven people.

872
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,970
Why are you asking, Kudo?

873
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,080
I'll get out! I'll get out!

874
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,850
I see! I get it, Kudo!

875
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,940
I guess on the day of the fire Nanako Honjue-san was...

876
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,710
Pushed out of the elevator after boarding it.

877
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,170
Because the eighth person wanted to get in forced her out.

878
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:58,360
The eighth person would be the one with the 1-pin tile, Jinno-san.

879
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,450
The other six would have been standing in the elevator
on the positions suggested by the 7-pin's red circles.

880
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,110
And the last circle would represent Nanako-san's position.

881
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:17,380
I'm afraid so. The shape of the Mahjong tiles corresponds to
the shape of the elevator, with the black lines as the doors.

882
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,840
Exactly!

883
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:24,170
When Jinno-san got on, the buzzer went off.
That's why he wanted someone out.

884
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,810
And he picked Nanako-san.

885
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,850
The other six, worrying they'd be forced out as well,

886
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:35,580
pretended not to see anything, which in turn encouraged Jinno-san.

887
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:41,800
After missing the ride, Nanako-san died
since it was too late for her to escape.

888
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,810
So, is there a problem with my deduction?

889
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:50,430
No. It's just that I still don't understand
what the letters on the tiles mean.

890
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:56,170
Yeah. It is strange that there was a triangle
instead of a letter on the seventh tile.

891
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,990
If the last circle really does represent Nanko-san,

892
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,590
there shouldn't be any more murders.

893
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,650
Hopefully. Anyway, I'll try to locate Mizutani-san first.

894
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,960
Thank you, Hattori. Seriously...

895
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,300
Kudo.

896
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,200
You know what? I found an awesome restaurant that serves Okonomiyaki.

897
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,460
I'll take you there next time you come over.

898
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,810
Please do. I'll wait for you.

899
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,110
Yeah, I will. Later.

900
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,420
Kudo.

901
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,860
Please do come!

902
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,060
What? On July 7th two years ago?

903
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,800
All the victims were in Kyoto on that day?

904
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,720
Yes. We've confirmed it through our investigations.

905
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,370
That means...

906
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,500
the "Tanabata...Kyo" our witness heard

907
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,570
refers to "Tanabata Kyoto."

908
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,910
I'm having people looking into exactly
what happened on that day in Kyoto. But...

909
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,390
what do these messages the culprit has left
on the mahjong tiles actually mean?

910
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:18,850
Only the bottom-left circle hasn't been marked red.
He may commit another crime.

911
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,820
And...

912
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,380
it's no coincidence that today is July 7th.

913
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,160
So, the last victim will die today?

914
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,720
Where and who, though?

915
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,650
Could it be someone among us...?

916
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,130
I've got it!

917
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,390
The seven locations represent the shape of a certain animal!

918
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,070
A certain animal?

919
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,950
Here, look!

920
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:55,640
If we connect the different crime scenes with lines...

921
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,370
Do you see it now?

922
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:09,720
This long line is the neck. And here's the chest.
This is the front leg, then the back, and then the hind leg.

923
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,850
So, rather than Nessie from Loch Ness,

924
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,400
It's Assie, from Lake Ashino!

925
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,620
Assie?

926
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,370
Is there even such a thing?

927
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:25,210
Nah, never heard of it.

928
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,800
I don't get it at all!

929
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,130
Then, how about this?

930
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,460
Well, if you put it this way...

931
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,540
It does look like one!

932
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,110
But, why Assie?

933
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,200
It could be Lake Yamanaka's Yassie.

934
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,400
Take a close look at the shape of the lake.

935
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,430
Lake Yamanaka is shaped like a whale.

936
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:46,950
What about Lake Ashino?

937
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,850
I got it, Mouri-san!

938
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:54,910
The next crime scene will be at Assie's nose!

939
01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:01,640
You amateur, Inspector Yokomizo! I did it on purpose
to trick you. It should be here.

940
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,880
It's in Gunma Prefecture's Annaka City!

941
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,460
I know Annaka City very well.

942
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,090
I'll go there, too! You lead the way!

943
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:10,730
Yes!

944
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,330
I'll go with you!

945
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:15,590
What are you doing?

946
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,120
Don't go!

947
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,350
But how could those two deal with a vicious killer?

948
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,690
Two is enough.

949
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,970
That was fun!

950
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,330
Yes! I wish Conan-kun had come!

951
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,110
Say, don't you think Conan's been weird lately?
He went back alone again today.

952
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,800
I bet his cold hasn't gone away yet.

953
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,800
He even took two days off from school.

954
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,250
The bus is here.

955
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,540
It's a rhinoceros beetle!

956
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,380
This bus must have come from Beika Forest.

957
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:03,010
I see. The beetle flew onto that man's shoulder
and was taken here by accident.

958
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,950
Convenience store tape!

959
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,280
Again?

960
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,260
So there are more beetles suffering from this prank! How sad!

961
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,100
I can't remove it! It's so sticky!

962
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,130
Let's ask the professor to peel it off.

963
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,650
And to treat us some snacks!

964
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:53,290
Kazuki-san, there's only one anonymous bouquet today.

965
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,530
I know.

966
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:58,710
Hello.

967
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,930
You are Detective Mouri's assistant?

968
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,310
Yeah?

969
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:10,260
I'm looking for Mizutani-san as part of an investigation,

970
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,640
but it seems that he didn't come to the memorial service, huh?

971
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,910
Oh, he stopped by this early morning and left a bouquet.

972
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,810
Just left a bouquet?

973
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:25,570
My parents still can't forgive him for running away with my sister.

974
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,220
That's why...

975
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,510
The one she said was left anonymously...

976
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:31,710
Was that from Mizutani-san?

977
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,210
She said it was the only one today. So there were more before?

978
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,450
Yeah. There were more other than his.

979
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,280
When? And do you know from where?

980
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:46,980
Yes. There were four on the day of the funeral two years ago,

981
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,030
respectively from Matsumoto, Kawasaki,

982
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,820
Numazu and Kamakura.

983
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,900
There were three on the memorial service day last year,

984
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,240
respectively from Tokorozawa, Odawara, and Hachioji.

985
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,220
They are the places where the seven victims were from.

986
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,630
Actually, when I met Kousuke-kun this morning,

987
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,980
he said something strange.

988
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,460
Something strange?

989
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:12,740
"There are eight people I can't forgive. Now, only one remains."

990
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,250
This was done

991
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:25,040
by the same person. The way he taped the V-shape is the same.

992
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,480
I see! It could be someone's message!

993
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,870
Message?

994
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,710
Do you know what the message is?

995
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,250
The answer is "Help!"

996
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,380
Why?

997
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,270
This bug is called a "beetle" in English.

998
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:52,160
My Volkswagen has a similar shape so it's also called a Beetle.

999
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,010
Also, "beet" in beetle shares the same
pronunciation with a musical "beat."

1000
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,670
So, by combining the two you get The Beatles, the legendary band!

1001
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,470
The Beatles?

1002
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:08,360
Their first album was titled Please Please Me.

1003
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,010
The second, With the Beatles.

1004
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,210
The third, A Hard Day's Night.

1005
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,960
The fourth, Beatles for Sale.

1006
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,550
And the fifth, Help!

1007
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,110
So, do you get it?

1008
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,200
What's "Beatles"?

1009
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,540
A foreign band.

1010
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,520
You guys don't know The Beatles?

1011
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,810
Never heard of them! Not at all!

1012
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,250
My sister used to listen to their music a lot.

1013
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,100
She loved the oldies.

1014
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,250
Oldies...?

1015
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,660
I wish he had treated us to food instead of quizzes!

1016
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:54,420
Help means someone is asking for assistance, right?

1017
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,010
Yes.

1018
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,750
Then the Detective Boys should come to rescue!

1019
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,860
I finally understand the meaning of "Tanabata Kyoto."

1020
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,920
All seven victims checked in?

1021
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,100
The victim of the fire was a young girl named Nanako Honjue.

1022
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:18,100
And her boyfriend, Kosuke Mizutani,
came here to look into the case a year ago.

1023
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,850
Also, two hours earlier, Heiji Hattori-kun
came and inquired about the same thing.

1024
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,230
Yeah, that's right. I'm interested in this case.

1025
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,890
Oh, right, Inspector, I'll share something juicy with you.

1026
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,510
The mahjong tiles represent an elevator.

1027
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,820
An elevator?

1028
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,070
Ow...

1029
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,800
There were altogether 9 people staying
on the sixth floor of that hotel.

1030
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:52,140
Aside from Nanako-san and Mizutani, all other seven were killed.

1031
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,100
Then just who will be the final victim?

1032
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,460
Oh, I know.

1033
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:59,270
This is chouzu, isn't it?

1034
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,510
Right, you sure know a lot!

1035
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,540
But I don't know what to do with this dipper.

1036
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,890
Oh, yeah? Let me show you, then.

1037
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:18,760
What?

1038
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,370
The location of the stars?

1039
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:27,240
The seven crime scenes represent locations
of Polaris and the six stars in the Big Dipper.

1040
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,400
Hold on.

1041
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,680
It's true. They are not just similar.

1042
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,860
They perfectly align with the actual photo of the stars.

1043
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,940
What a perfectionist, our killer!

1044
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:52,570
The mahjong tiles and the letters all represent
Polaris and the Big Dipper.

1045
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,850
The 1-pin and 7-pins all indicate the shape
of Polaris and the Big Dipper.

1046
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,040
And the letters represent stars from the Ursa constellations,

1047
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:07,450
and are short for the full spelling of α、β、γ、δ、ε、ζ、η in Greek.
(Α、Β、Γ、Δ、Ε、Ζ、Η)

1048
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,330
So, Haibara...

1049
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:14,020
The location of the remaining Big Dipper star
is unseen. I'll pull it out right now.

1050
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,160
Thank you!

1051
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,150
There it is.

1052
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:18,930
Shiba Park, in Minato District.

1053
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:25,180
The person who sent the "Help!" message should be near that oak tree.

1054
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,300
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

1055
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:27,780
That's right!

1056
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,410
Detective Boys,

1057
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,900
let's go!

1058
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,490
A boy with glasses just came and asked about Mizutani-kun

1059
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,600
and Nanako-san two hours ago.

1060
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,730
A boy with glasses?

1061
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,330
Yeah. He said he was Detective Mouri's assistant.

1062
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,140
This is what Mizutani-san said, correct?

1063
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:57,530
"There are eight people I can't forgive. Now, only one remains."

1064
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,550
Yes.

1065
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:01,790
What happened? Did Mizutani-kun...

1066
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,480
Nothing. Just asking.

1067
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,010
What?

1068
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:08,240
You mean our suspect plans to kill another?

1069
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,650
Yes. I'm afraid so. And Conan-kun came here earlier as well.

1070
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,020
Conan-kun?

1071
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,760
No!

1072
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,390
How could I send a little boy to do that?

1073
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:25,380
Then who else could it be? Could it be Kudo-kun?

1074
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,620
Superintendent, is it safe to say
that Kosuke Mizutani is the culprit?

1075
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,180
I think it's a fair assumption.

1076
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:36,870
But who's his next target? And where is he gonna do the deed?

1077
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,630
Nana...

1078
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,960
Kousuke!

1079
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,300
Oh, no!

1080
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,380
Can I try again?

1081
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,130
I'm so excited!

1082
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,900
This is our first trip together!

1083
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:04,830
Kousuke!

1084
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,050
Nana! Nana! Let me go!

1085
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:19,930
Nana's in there! Nana! Nana!

1086
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,850
Nana...

1087
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,630
Okay.

1088
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,820
I'll try to look for them. Thanks!

1089
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,020
Tsuburaya-kun hasn't gone home?

1090
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:38,840
It's 7:00 p.m. already. Where could those three be?

1091
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,200
I tried to reach them through their Detective Badges, but no answer.

1092
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,030
Professor, do you think they...

1093
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:55,250
Hello?

1094
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,620
Sawamura-san?

1095
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,380
Yes? Mizutani-kun and Nanako-san's hobby?

1096
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,500
Yes. Was it stargazing?

1097
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,690
That's right.

1098
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,570
He said he chose to live here because it's close to the observatory.

1099
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,080
As I thought.

1100
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:10,720
Of all the stars,

1101
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:14,040
they loved Polaris and the Big Dipper the most

1102
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,870
for the beautiful shape of the Big Dipper,

1103
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,070
and Polaris shining right above the north pole.

1104
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:29,900
I think the stars were like a love token to them.

1105
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,420
But a kid like you

1106
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:34,530
wouldn't understand.

1107
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,800
Thanks!

1108
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:40,410
The place where is closest to the stars would be...

1109
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:47,710
Good evening!

1110
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:53,010
I'm currently at Tokyo Tower, where the Tanabata Fair is being held.

1111
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:57,500
Though it's cloudy today, visitors wearing yukatas
are still swarming to be here

1112
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:01,330
since it's the last night of the fair.

1113
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:04,740
Next is our weather forecast for tonight and tomorrow.

1114
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,940
There's a high chance of rain in the Tokyo area around 10:00 tonight.

1115
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,900
Thunderstorms are expected elsewhere...

1116
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,890
Onee-san!

1117
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,100
How may I help you, little boy?

1118
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,350
Could you watch this for me?

1119
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,530
I sure can. But are you all by yourself?

1120
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,950
When I went to the bathroom,

1121
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,450
my dad and my younger brother left without me. Can you believe that?

1122
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,030
Hitomi-chan, your yukata is so pretty!

1123
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,870
So is yours!

1124
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,510
How about the four of us taking a picture?

1125
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,200
The more the better!

1126
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,810
Here we go. Ready?

1127
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,160
Cheese!

1128
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,100
Have we been here before?

1129
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,750
Did we take the wrong path?

1130
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,470
I'm starving! Let's go home.

1131
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,270
No! We must find him ourselves!

1132
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,520
That's right! Don't you want to solve a case
without Conan-kun's help for once?

1133
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,190
I do.

1134
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,930
But we can't seem to find that oak tree...

1135
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,050
Oh, I know!

1136
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,360
We can let this beetle show us the way!

1137
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:40,670
Beetles usually fly towards the tree with the same sap.

1138
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:45,900
That way!

1139
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,380
Do we have to run?

1140
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,900
Through our investigation, we have identified the suspect,

1141
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,200
and have determined that it's highly possible
he'll commit another murder.

1142
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:02,160
However, we know neither the whereabouts
of the suspect nor the location of his next crime.

1143
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,550
Any thoughts, people?

1144
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,480
Damn! While we are waiting here...

1145
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,570
Someone's probably being killed out there.

1146
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:26,220
Found it! The oak tree!

1147
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,870
Huh? There's another one!

1148
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,860
Could it be also taped up?

1149
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,420
A little higher!

1150
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,980
It's taped, just like we expected.

1151
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,120
It must be there.

1152
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,130
The one who seeks help must be in there.

1153
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:52,900
I guess.

1154
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,670
But it looks a little creepy.

1155
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:57,650
I feel like something's coming.

1156
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,510
Don't say that!

1157
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,460
As expected, at a place like this, the stars
sure look much more amazing!

1158
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,750
That one's Polaris, and that's the Big Dipper!

1159
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,800
Huh? That shape...

1160
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:18,950
Where have I seen it?

1161
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,350
What? Polaris and the Big Dipper?

1162
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,950
Ouch! So you are saying the crime scenes
represent Polaris and the Big Dipper?

1163
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,060
I'm sure, Inspector!

1164
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,200
You are the detective from earlier.

1165
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,130
So, Mizutani-san and Honjue-san's hobby

1166
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,970
was stargazing? Thanks!

1167
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:42,970
Superintendent.

1168
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:48,080
The final star from the Big Dipper matches the location of Shiba Park.

1169
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:52,950
Good work! Megure, secure an emergency warrant
for Kosuke Mizutani and wait for further orders here.

1170
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:55,870
The rest of you, head over to Shiba Park! Hurry!

1171
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:56,670
Yes, sir!

1172
01:16:58,350 --> 01:16:59,830
What the...

1173
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,930
Don't scare me like that!

1174
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,230
What do you mean?

1175
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:08,120
You shouldn't be hanging around here at this hour.

1176
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,400
We are not here for fun.

1177
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,750
We are trying to rescue someone.

1178
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,530
The one who used the beetles to send those S.O.S messages!

1179
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,290
Whatever your reason is, you head home now.
Your parents must be worried about...

1180
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,000
Not so fast.

1181
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:19,390
Huh?

1182
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,170
They can go home after we respond to that message.

1183
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,740
Thank you!

1184
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,800
Thank you!

1185
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,720
I'll take it.

1186
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,590
Sorry, if you would.

1187
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,150
Hello, this is Takagi's cell. Oh, Agasa-san.

1188
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,600
We are a little busy right now.

1189
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,350
Sorry to bother you, but please hear me out.

1190
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:07,250
This may sound strange, but...

1191
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,540
The Beatles? Could it be...

1192
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,260
Okay. I'll be right there.

1193
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,450
Please find a safe place and hide.

1194
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,500
Takagi-kun, we need to stop by Beika Forest.

1195
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,090
But...

1196
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,890
Don't worry. I'll take full responsibility.

1197
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:28,330
Alright. But let me take that responsibility.

1198
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:31,740
Huh? Which way?

1199
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,940
I don't know.

1200
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,040
To the left.

1201
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:38,740
Got it.

1202
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,290
Conan-kun went to the TV tower?

1203
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,790
Yes. I saw him entering Tokyo Tower by himself.

1204
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,740
It was around 8:00 p.m.

1205
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,960
I see.

1206
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,840
Don't worry, though. He'll come home soon.

1207
01:18:57,190 --> 01:19:00,460
But his cell phone has been off.

1208
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,990
Still no answer. Superintendent, Takagi and Sato won't pick up.

1209
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:13,140
Then let's start without them.

1210
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,250
Mizutani should be hiding somewhere around here.

1211
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,890
Split up, and arrest him as soon as you find him.

1212
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,580
Yes, sir!

1213
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:42,950
It's cloudy today. You can't see them, can you?

1214
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:46,670
The stars you and Nanako-san loved,

1215
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,670
Polaris and the Big Dipper.

1216
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:51,520
Little boy...

1217
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,130
Oh, this visitor...

1218
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,300
You saw him?

1219
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,510
He visited the tower after-hours several times, so I remember him.

1220
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:05,380
He went up to the viewing platform alone around 7:00 p.m.

1221
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,120
You're that assistant of Detective Mouri's, aren't you?

1222
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,970
Sort of.

1223
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,840
It's too bad, huh?

1224
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,060
To have come so close to the sky and not be able to see the stars.

1225
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,670
No.

1226
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,310
I can see them...

1227
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,780
whenever and wherever...

1228
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,620
I can see those stars.

1229
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:34,360
What? On the viewing platform?

1230
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:37,120
Yes. This lady saw him go up there.

1231
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:39,010
Did you see him leave?

1232
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,910
No, not yet.

1233
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:46,960
Good. There's no doubt that our suspect is still on the platform

1234
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:51,370
and waiting for the target to walk into his trap.

1235
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:56,380
Let's move! Arrest the suspect and protect the victim.

1236
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:00,960
The suspect may be armed. Stay alert!

1237
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,170
Please keep the interior lighting as it is.

1238
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,440
Copy that.

1239
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,560
Let's go!

1240
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,250
Yes, sir!

1241
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,210
Mizutani-san.

1242
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,220
Are you going to kill yourself after finishing the wine?

1243
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:22,670
"There are eight people I can't forgive. Now, only one remains."

1244
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,690
The one that still remains is you, right?

1245
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:31,290
Wh-What's going...

1246
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:48,680
I understand the shock and the anger you felt
when you learned how Nanako-san died.

1247
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:54,040
That's why you went to the hotel in Kyoto
and investigated those seven people, right?

1248
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:57,960
It's just as you said.

1249
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:03,700
If I hadn't visited my friend on that day two years ago,

1250
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,770
Nana wouldn't have died.

1251
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,950
When I think of that, I can't forgive myself.

1252
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,400
But you can't commit suicide! It means you'll be killing...

1253
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,030
I know that...I do know that...

1254
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:21,440
But I can no longer bear to live in a world without Nana.

1255
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:25,830
Besides,

1256
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,670
I'll get a death sentence anyway.

1257
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,060
You won't!

1258
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:29,720
Why?

1259
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,770
Because you didn't kill anybody!

1260
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:40,980
Wasn't there someone else who asked a nice man
like you to take guilt on yourself

1261
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:45,280
and commit suicide in exchange for him killing those seven people?

1262
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:50,870
I don't object to your desire
to take responsibility for Nanko-san's death,

1263
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:56,540
but the one that person really hates and wishes to kill

1264
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:58,550
is actually you, Mizutani-san.

1265
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,120
It's because

1266
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,140
you were the one who took away his beloved sister.

1267
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,940
Isn't that right,

1268
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,300
Nanako-san's elder brother,

1269
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,140
Kazuki Honjue-san?

1270
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,330
Onii-san! What are you doing here?

1271
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,090
Bastard, you have no right to address me that way!

1272
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:19,670
What?

1273
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:21,540
Kid,

1274
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,890
how did you know I did it?

1275
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,480
It made no sense, no matter how I looked at it.

1276
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,650
If Mizutani-san was the culprit,

1277
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,740
the logic behind choosing the positions of Polaris
and the Big Dipper as the crime scenes

1278
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,850
would defile his precious stars, now wouldn't it?

1279
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,170
Therefore, I thought this may have been

1280
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:49,080
a plan someone else had come up with to make him a scapegoat.

1281
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,020
When I realized that, everything came together.

1282
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:58,340
Moreover, the culprit, who precisely adapted
the positions of Polaris and the Big Dipper

1283
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,880
to the map and used them for crime scenes, is clearly a perfectionist.

1284
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,380
But the sign on Mizutani-san's apartment door

1285
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,100
was tilted and written in scrawl.

1286
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,590
The phone number written on your name card, however,

1287
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:19,640
was in very neat handwriting. There was even
a faint pencil line to ensure the writing was straight.

1288
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,960
And inside your notebook, the names
and addresses of those who sent flowers

1289
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,260
were carefully recorded.

1290
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,930
All of this undeniably showcases your perfectionist personality.

1291
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:33,570
Just who are you exactly?

1292
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:37,020
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

1293
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,950
Thank you for coming!

1294
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,750
Agasa-san, where are the other kids?

1295
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:50,390
Their parents took them home. I'll show you the way.

1296
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,490
Please do.

1297
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,810
Ai-kun, go wait in the car.

1298
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:05,190
You were the one who told Mizutani-san
how Nanako-san died, weren't you?

1299
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:12,250
Yes. That day when I heard that the artist Sumire Shindo
was staying in the same hotel on the same floor,

1300
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,430
I went to her personal art exhibition to ask some questions.

1301
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:23,300
At that time, I happened to overhear Sumire
and Ryuuzaki's conversation.

1302
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,920
So you passed on the information,
along with your own lies, to Mizutani-san.

1303
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:35,070
On the first anniversary of Nanako-san's death,
everyone who had been on the 6th floor brought flowers.

1304
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:39,800
If it was because they felt guilty, only one or two might have come,

1305
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,200
but all seven came.

1306
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,420
The only possible reason was they wanted to express their gratitude,

1307
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:50,910
thanking her for allowing them to board the elevator.

1308
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:56,760
So, you are saying Nanako wasn't forced out, instead, she willingly...

1309
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,690
That's right. She was such a kind girl.

1310
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,130
But still, even if she got off willingly,

1311
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,310
it doesn't change the fact that she died because the rest of them

1312
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,960
had all boarded that elevator!

1313
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:12,360
Mizutani-san,

1314
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:21,750
it's true that Nanako-san sacrificed herself to save the other seven.
However, it's worlds apart from

1315
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:28,120
how he made you a scapegoat and commit suicide for his crimes.

1316
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:34,870
The difference is as great as that of a star in the sky
and a stone rolling on the ground.

1317
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,760
Nana...

1318
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,370
I quit.

1319
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,300
What?

1320
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:52,640
I'm sorry. I won't kill myself.

1321
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,380
This boy's words have brought me to my senses.

1322
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:57,950
Mizutani!

1323
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:00,050
And I'm sure that Nana in heaven

1324
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,270
wouldn't want me to commit suicide either.

1325
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:09,990
Please take this back. I no longer need this.

1326
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,220
Please turn yourself in, onii-san.

1327
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:14,510
Damn!

1328
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,100
Honjue-san.

1329
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:20,100
Those are the items you took from the seven victims, right?

1330
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:23,990
You gave them to him so that they'd be considered
as evidence of the murders

1331
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,700
after he committed suicide, right?

1332
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,990
Hmph, it's a good thing I came.

1333
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:34,960
When I heard that Detective Mouri was investigating,
I rushed here fearing something'd go wrong.

1334
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:41,050
I lied to you because I was hoping you could take revenge on them.

1335
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:46,140
But you didn't have the courage,
so I decided to take it into my own hands.

1336
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,490
That isn't courage, but merely self-satisfaction!

1337
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,260
Shut up!

1338
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:53,950
Since Detective Mouri isn't here, you must have come here alone.

1339
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,950
How dare you belittle me!

1340
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,070
Did I make it in time?

1341
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,930
I'm Matsumoto from the Metropolitan Police Department.

1342
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:09,440
Metropolitan Police Department?

1343
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,190
Are you injured?

1344
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:12,580
No.

1345
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,360
Come with me to the station.

1346
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:23,270
Damn it!

1347
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,390
Shit!

1348
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,240
Like I'd let you arrest me like this!

1349
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,670
As I thought...

1350
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,740
You are Irish, aren't you?

1351
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:46,930
Police!

1352
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:47,910
Don't move!

1353
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,200
As expected! Superintendent!

1354
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,710
Superintendent?

1355
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:59,450
Hang in there!

1356
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,200
Superintendent! Who locked you here?

1357
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:06,220
The other Superintendent Matsumoto is a fake. He's been replaced!

1358
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,800
The superintendent was from The Beatles generation,
but I never thought it'd really be him.

1359
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,370
Hurry and contact Inspector Megure!

1360
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:14,990
Okay!

1361
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,900
It's me. What's up?

1362
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:25,380
We've been exposed. They know he's a fake.

1363
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,940
Got it.

1364
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,320
Vermouth...

1365
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,090
What? He really was here?

1366
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:05,010
Yeah. He asked me to watch his skateboard, but he never retrieved it.

1367
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,560
Could he be still inside?

1368
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:09,610
That's not possible.

1369
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:13,560
It would be disastrous if he were. He could run into that murderer!

1370
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:15,540
M-Murderer?

1371
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,650
The police are conducting a search inside right now.

1372
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,180
Sonoko, wait here!

1373
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,680
Wait, Ran!

1374
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:22,930
Hey! Wait!

1375
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,570
What did you do to the superintendent?

1376
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:31,540
Did you...

1377
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:34,140
No. He's still alive.

1378
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:39,170
I need him to be my scapegoat, you know.

1379
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:44,720
I'm assuming that's the memory card
containing the Organization's NOC list, no?

1380
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,450
Yeah, it is.

1381
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,450
When did you find out I was a fake?

1382
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:56,580
Here's my thought. If Vermouth, the master of disguise,
had sent someone else

1383
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:02,630
to infiltrate in her stead, it must be
because the huge difference in body shape that made it impossible.

1384
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:06,490
In that case, you were the first to come to mind.

1385
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:11,500
I see. As expected, you are Shinichi Kudo indeed.

1386
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:16,500
Before matching the fingerprints, I still wasn't sure.

1387
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:20,050
Have you reported this to your boss?

1388
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:24,420
Nope. I haven't told anybody about this.

1389
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:26,940
Not even Gin?

1390
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,270
Yeah.

1391
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,660
Do you remember Shinichi Kudo?

1392
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:37,150
I've killed too many people to remember every one of them.

1393
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:39,250
What about him, anyway?

1394
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,960
No. Nothing.

1395
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:45,860
Hmph. Just focus on your own mission.

1396
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:50,610
Why?

1397
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,680
There was a time

1398
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:58,040
when he shot a fellow member of the Organization that made a mistake.

1399
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:03,320
He left the body to burn there at Haido City Hotel
where it eventually turned to ashes.

1400
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:13,000
That member was someone I respected like a father.

1401
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:16,310
Haido City Hotel...

1402
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:20,370
Pisco?

1403
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:25,850
You've investigated us thoroughly, haven't you?

1404
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:33,380
To have failed in killing Shinichi Kudo and in seeing through
your true identity, he's made a huge oversight.

1405
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:37,840
I'll be taking you to meet that person

1406
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:43,030
to make you a witness in order to overthrow
that conceited and cold-blooded bastard.

1407
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:49,590
He's the only one who knows my real identity for now.
As long as I can defeat him...

1408
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,540
But, with the tranquilizer out of action, there's only...

1409
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:05,590
Don't worry. I won't kill you. I'm just going to
knock you unconscious.

1410
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:09,430
Unless I bring you back alive,

1411
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,410
that person wouldn't believe that you are actually Shinichi Kudo.

1412
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:24,750
What is...

1413
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:30,640
Detective Chiba? Detective Chiba? Are you okay?

1414
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:37,580
It seems he's just lost consciousness.
I think the others are the same.

1415
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,050
Conan-kun!

1416
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:41,980
Wait! Hey!

1417
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,040
Hey! Wait up!

1418
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,170
Conan-kun!

1419
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:55,420
Conan-kun! What happened?

1420
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:57,830
Ran-neechan...

1421
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:58,770
Are you okay?

1422
01:33:58,770 --> 01:33:59,970
Are you guys alright?

1423
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:02,410
Superintendent Matsumoto?

1424
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,250
Superintendent, bad news! The other officers downstairs were...

1425
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,950
Attacked by the suspect, right?

1426
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:12,380
What is it?

1427
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,420
Don't... Run...

1428
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,580
What? What happened?

1429
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:19,200
Run! It's him...

1430
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:19,990
What?

1431
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,310
You are not Superintendent Matsumoto, aren't you?

1432
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,470
Don't!

1433
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,900
It's alright.

1434
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,680
I can't avoid a bullet from a rifle like Kyougoku-san, but a pistol...

1435
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,550
Ran, you know what?

1436
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:52,840
The speed of a rifle bullet is about 1,000 meters per second.

1437
01:34:53,340 --> 01:35:00,420
Compared to that, the speed of a pistol's bullet
is only a third of that-roughly 350 meters a second.

1438
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:07,460
What's so funny? You think you can dodge a bullet?

1439
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,330
That's exactly it.

1440
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,370
Interesting! Then try it!

1441
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:25,680
What?

1442
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,580
Amazing!

1443
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:37,100
Nice move, young lady!

1444
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:43,350
I forgot that you are a karate expert.

1445
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:15,590
Ran!

1446
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,650
You're making me wasting my energy here!

1447
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:28,600
Ran, stay down!

1448
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,880
Leave the rest to me! Just stay there!

1449
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,500
Damn!

1450
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:49,250
Run! Go ahead!

1451
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,480
It's more fun this way!

1452
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:20,220
Darn it!

1453
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:26,240
What a pity! You almost got me!

1454
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:36,330
What? Are you done fighting now?

1455
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:41,430
Good! There you go!

1456
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,990
Let's end this game of cat-and-mouse, shall we?

1457
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,170
Now the tables have turned!

1458
01:38:11,690 --> 01:38:12,790
Crap!

1459
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,440
Now, hand over the memory card!

1460
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:22,550
So, they are here!

1461
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,160
The tables have turned again!

1462
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,500
It's me.

1463
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:45,960
How did it go?

1464
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,210
Have you secured the memory card?

1465
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:49,120
Yeah.

1466
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:00,780
I can't see it clearly. Hold it out further.

1467
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:02,730
Hmph...

1468
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:06,330
That's right. A little more.

1469
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,530
Now!

1470
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,980
Bingo!

1471
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,290
I wanted to shoot.

1472
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:23,290
Boss.

1473
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:24,870
Look down.

1474
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,090
That's...

1475
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:32,000
He has nowhere to run. Thanks for your service, Irish.

1476
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,560
There's someone else down there.

1477
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,670
Hey, stay with me! Hey!

1478
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:49,290
You'll live! It's not fatal. I'll get you medical treatment

1479
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,790
once I've taken care of those people.

1480
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,080
I see now.

1481
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,190
No wonder Vermouth thinks so highly of you.

1482
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:59,210
Don't talk!

1483
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,810
After you've recovered,

1484
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:03,600
I still need you to reveal the true identity
of your boss! So hang in there!

1485
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,230
Irish!

1486
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:18,610
Shinichi Kudo, don't stop going after them...

1487
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,120
Irish!

1488
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:23,760
Hmph! He used Irish as a shield!

1489
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:28,010
It'll be big trouble if we have to land. Use that!

1490
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,080
Roger!

1491
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:34,370
Damn!

1492
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:52,850
Oh, no! Ran is still inside!

1493
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,330
He's out! Continue!

1494
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,160
Boss, what do we do?

1495
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:38,980
Chianti, smoke him out!

1496
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,070
Okay.

1497
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,580
Damn it! What now?

1498
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:47,160
Tear gas!

1499
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,710
Here he comes!

1500
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,970
Force him to the top!

1501
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:25,430
The mouse has been cornered. Go up.
Attack from above! There'll be nowhere to hide!

1502
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,290
Copy!

1503
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,100
Damn!

1504
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:36,880
What do I do? At this rate, I'll be a sitting duck!

1505
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:42,140
Damn! What do I do?

1506
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:07,530
Now... Let me see your face!

1507
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,290
He... He jumped!

1508
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:24,340
He'll accept his fate of no escape, huh?

1509
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,600
Go!

1510
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,690
We've been hit!

1511
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:50,800
Hold on!

1512
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:51,590
What happened?

1513
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:53,640
I... I'm losing control!

1514
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:55,310
No choice! Retreat!

1515
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:56,510
Copy!

1516
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:57,730
What...

1517
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:02,540
Who was it...

1518
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,310
As expected of the Silver Bullet. He's good.

1519
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,610
And then "bang," I was totally out!

1520
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:43,960
Thank God no one was hurt!

1521
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:44,970
I'm sorry!

1522
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:46,590
Well, then, Ran-chan.

1523
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:51,370
I'll inquire as to the details another day. Until then, thank you!

1524
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:52,080
Sure.

1525
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:56,160
I'll arrange for a car to take you home now. Please wait a moment.

1526
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:57,950
Thank you very much!

1527
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:00,790
Are you really alright?

1528
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:01,290
Yes.

1529
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:04,630
Oh, I'll get you something to drink.

1530
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:05,760
You don't have to.

1531
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:07,690
Just wait here.

1532
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,310
Thank you!

1533
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:10,770
Ran-neechan.

1534
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:16,580
Shinichi-niichan said that the case has been solved.

1535
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,950
Speaking of Shinichi...

1536
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:22,100
About that, he said he had another case.

1537
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,270
Eh? He left abruptly again?

1538
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,780
Hmm. And...

1539
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:31,470
I'm sure he said something like, "don't tell anyone about it."

1540
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,120
Oh, right! He also said it was alright for you to call now.

1541
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:40,180
Alright for me to call?

1542
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:44,320
Oh, no, something like, "please call me."

1543
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,610
Well, just hearing his voice is good enough.

1544
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:51,850
Besides,

1545
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:56,590
voice aside, there are people who can only see each other once a year.

1546
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:57,570
Seems that they didn't find any bodies
in the debris of that helicopter crash.

1547
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:58,470
Yeah.

1548
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:01,430
All of them must have escaped before the explosion.

1549
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:05,750
And in the end, we still didn't get to uncover Irish's true identity.

1550
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,480
The police didn't come across anything either, did they?

1551
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,510
I couldn't possibly tell them, anyway.

1552
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:18,800
But who would've thought that he was confined
in such a place for 10 days...

1553
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:23,600
I heard Superintendent Matsumoto didn't see
the face of the person who kidnapped him.

1554
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:28,740
Anyway, it was all thanks to those kids that he was rescued.

1555
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,210
Yeah.

1556
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:34,390
Irish died before he could even reveal the hiding place.

1557
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:38,880
Irish...

1558
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:45,580
Shinichi Kudo, don't stop going after them...

1559
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,140
I will do just that until I take you all down!
