1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,573
Chianti and Korn, you both go around to support this time.

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,675
What? Support?

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,177
I want to shoot.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,680
Well, think about it.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,683
He's riding a specially ordered bulletproof car.

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,185
It's not the same as killing him in the park.

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,687
But...

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,790
Besides, he's tightly guarded on both sides by bodyguards

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,293
who have been trained in the Self-Defense Force.

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:30,164
The 7.62 mm bullet may pierce though the thinnest part of the car.

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,267
Though the thinnest side window.

12
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,070
But will not reach DJ.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,472
Then, how do you intend to kill him?

14
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:42,876
Do you might me to stand on the bridge stark naked and hitchhike,

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,280
then get myself in his car or something?

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,283
My, Chianti. That's pretty good thinking.

17
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,885
Vermouth?

18
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:51,886
I'm going to ride this motorbike

19
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:55,889
and fall right in front of DJ's car and stop him.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,292
When he comes out of the car,

21
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,195
I'll come from behind

22
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,963
and get him.

23
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:07,968
The job of you both is to get rid of the two bodyguards

24
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,371
that come out of the car together with DJ.

25
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:17,177
But I wonder if that cautious man will come out of the car that easily.

26
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,880
Don't worry.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,682
If a woman bleeds from her head

28
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,085
after her helmet flies off and is lying on the ground.

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,189
A man of justice such as he is will probably come dashing over, no?

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,291
What?

31
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,095
Cut out the joke!

32
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,564
There are going to be other cars on the bridge too.

33
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,768
If a famous actress like you expose your face.

34
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,169
Idiot.

35
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,071
I'm going to be exposing...

36
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,572
This face!

37
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,377
Kiriko Busujima of the Deisan Organization!

38
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,979
Just as would be expected of you, Vermouth.

39
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,881
You're a complete duplicate.

40
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,182
I see.

41
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,585
That's why you've come out front.

42
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,888
Where's the place?

43
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,089
Gin.

44
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:06,093
We're going to kill DJ at Vane B.

45
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,963
Bein B?

46
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,375
Bein B?

47
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,578
Is that the next assassination site?

48
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,181
Yeah. The time is 16:00.

49
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,882
It seems that they're going to kill Mr. Domon

50
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,286
when his car passes over a bridge somewhere.

51
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:36,991
In other words, the "B" of Bein B means bridge?

52
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,094
But if we can't specify which bridge it is,

53
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,495
we can't stop the assassination.

54
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,263
Quiet!

55
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,767
They're checking the map now.

56
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,570
Maybe they'll say the name of the place.

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,372
Korn, you position yourself here.

58
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,274
Chianti, you go here.

59
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,078
We're counting on you both!

60
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:01,181
Where's my motorbike?

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,282
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,485
Behind that container.

63
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,486
Thank you.

64
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,189
Let's get together in the foreground of Vane B.

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,191
Hey, Kir.

66
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,496
Don't tell me that you...

67
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,666
I hope you're not. Are you?

68
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,670
Idiot.

69
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,572
Of course not.

70
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,178
What is it?

71
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,984
Well, I'll go on ahead.

72
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,587
Make sure you back me up if something comes up.

73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,689
I have a bad feeling

74
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,592
about this assassination scheme.

75
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,194
Leave it to me.

76
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,864
If things start looking bad and you're in danger of falling in their hands,

77
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,568
I won't hesitate firing a bullet right through your head.

78
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,772
Yes. If such time comes, make sure you aim at my face, okay?

79
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,974
You don't want the world to know that

80
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,876
I was part of the assassination scheme, do you?

81
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,578
Things will turn out badly, right?

82
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,183
Is there something bothering you, Vermouth?

83
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,284
No.

84
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,886
It's just this feeling I have.

85
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,288
Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,764
Okay.

87
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,266
Let's get going too.

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,774
Okay, I don't know how much you know.

89
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,477
But I wonder if you can stop me?

90
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,981
My dearest...

91
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,383
Silver Bullet?

92
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,889
So, we don't know where the location is.

93
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,990
Yeah.

94
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,494
The sound is getting worse from a while ago.

95
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,064
The only clue we have is that it's on a bridge somewhere.

96
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,868
Maybe we can find out by calling Mr. Domon's election office

97
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,769
and asking them

98
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,972
where he's headed for now

99
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,174
and what bridge he'll be crossing.

100
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,276
I called them several times but...

101
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,378
They won't tell me.

102
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,880
Since I was quite persistent,

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,582
they seem to suspect me of being up to no good.

104
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:16,783
Well...

105
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,686
Unless we find out what the "Bein" of Bein B is.

106
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,489
This bad direction of the wind won't change.

107
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,091
Direction of the wind?

108
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,694
Bein sounds a lot like V. A. I. N.

109
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:32,366
Which means useless, worthless, and conceited.

110
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,969
I wonder if there was a place with that sort of name in Tokyo?

111
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,671
No, that's not it.

112
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,973
It's not V. A. I. N.

113
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,676
But V. A. N. E. As in Vane!

114
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,680
What? You mean the vane as in weathervane or a windmill?

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,781
Yeah.

116
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,785
A word that at the same time means the arrow feather of a bow.

117
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,888
The name of a place around here that suggests an arrow feather is.

118
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,189
Toriya-cho!

119
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,992
In other words, Vane B is Toriya Bridge!

120
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,094
That is Toriya Grand Bridge!

121
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,663
That's good news!

122
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,365
We still have two hours till 16:00,

123
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,267
the scheduled time of the assassination!

124
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,270
We finally get to take the lead!

125
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,173
There are a total of six of them,

126
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,575
three women and three men!

127
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,077
The two women will be riding motorbikes

128
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,780
and the remaining four will come on two different cars.

129
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,082
One of which is a Porsche 365A.

130
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:26,687
Let's send the investigator's vehicle to the bridge on the double

131
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:30,490
and block off all the roads leading to the bridge for now.

132
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,492
We're going to round them up, right?

133
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,263
No, we're going to stay low and sneak up from behind.

134
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:39,166
And make sure we fish them all without fail, one by one.

135
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,672
Geez!

136
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,874
Why do I, the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri,

137
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,778
have to play a TV game at your house, Dr. Agasa?

138
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,680
Well, no big thing, is it?

139
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,383
You didn't have anything to do anyway, did you?

140
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,885
Besides, that's a deduction game

141
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,088
that I developed that I'm quite confident of!

142
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,691
And there's no one else than you to be the first to try it out.

143
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,694
This game is filled with a lot of cases, isn't it?

144
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,563
This is already the third case.

145
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,365
Who cares?

146
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,867
Nobody's dying for real.

147
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,269
And if a bit of the painful feeling is felt by the player,

148
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,872
it's served its purpose.

149
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,975
Well, I wish people would keep homicides confined

150
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,177
to games and TV dramas.

151
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,780
The grief that one goes through when someone really dies

152
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,283
can't be compared to the one felt through games and TV dramas.

153
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,586
By the way, where's Conan?

154
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,188
Wasn't he with you, Dr. Agasa?

155
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,590
Oh, yes.

156
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,492
He went on home before us.

157
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,194
Because it started raining quite heavily.

158
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,464
I guess I'll start heading on home too, then.

159
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
I don't want Conan to be starving.

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
Well...

161
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,971
Don't go home!

162
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,275
Edogawa will be fine.

163
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,977
Don't worry about him.

164
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,182
So, don't go! Please!

165
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,590
-Ai. -Ai.

166
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,263
Okay, if you say so.

167
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,664
Then I'll stay.

168
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,120
Well, let's take a look back at the Black Organization.

169
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,360
We accepted a convey request from announcer Mizunashi Reina.

170
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,580
But the eavesdropper I set was stick to Mizunashi's shoes.

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,400
Let's meet at 10 .am as scheduled.

172
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,640
Gin.

173
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,980
I overheard the conversation between she and Gin.

174
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,460
She was one of them!

175
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,420
They planned to assassinate alternative member of House of Commons, Tomoya Suteru.

176
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,920
The members who involved in this plan are...

177
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,120
Gin, Vodka, Vermouth, Kir, Chianti and Korn.

178
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,580
Hyde Park has a good sight.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,780
If they commit a sniper assassination there, Mr.Tomo must be seen.

180
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,860
We weathered the storm this time thanks to Ms. Jodie's shooting technique.

181
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,900
About 16 o'clock, DJ will drive through the bridge,

182
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,820
and there is the point where they assassinate.

183
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,300
But Gin has a plan B.

184
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,300
The place is Toriya Bridge!

185
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,260
Wait for me, I will definitely prevent you.

186
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,400
I won't let you assassinate anyone!

187
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,780
The following comes the climax eventually.

188
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,460
Gin changed his target suddenly.

189
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,660
They headed for Beika-cho.

190
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,620
And who will be their target next time?

191
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,663
Okay!

192
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,831
The vision's great here!

193
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,640
How about where you are, Korn?

194
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,842
Clear view.

195
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:22,547
Yes.

196
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,649
I'm already in position.

197
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,652
Okay! All we need to wait for is Kir.

198
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,754
Hey, Vodka.

199
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,457
I keep hearing static on your side.

200
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:35,760
No.

201
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,764
It's nothing.

202
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,445
Yes. Only a few minutes until we get there.

203
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,548
Let us know when you get there, Kir.

204
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:57,649
Roger!

205
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:20,939
Excuse me.

206
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:23,341
I'd like to ask you something.

207
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,748
Will you please stop your motorbike?

208
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,837
That is bad!

209
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:37,949
She's still breathing!

210
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,350
Rush her to the hospital!

211
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,552
Okay!

212
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,461
Rena Mizunashi?

213
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,263
What's Rena Mizunashi doing here?

214
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:54,733
According to your story,

215
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,834
wasn't the woman riding this motorbike

216
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:59,237
supposed to be Vermouth in disguise?

217
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,738
I thought so

218
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,440
because she was quite some distance away from the transmitter.

219
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,943
I thought for sure that was the case, but...

220
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:08,346
She changed into leather overalls and boots somewhere.

221
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,951
The transmitter and wiretap that are on her loafers are probably there.

222
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,954
But where did she change?

223
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,758
Not yet?

224
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,059
Gin.

225
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,561
Men who keep people waiting are not liked!

226
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,463
Hold your horses, Chianti.

227
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,632
We haven't got word from Kir yet.

228
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:31,336
Besides, DJ's car is still...

229
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,737
This might not mean anything

230
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:35,840
but I can't hear a thing because your voice is full of static!

231
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,142
Static?

232
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,145
What's up?

233
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,546
Quiet.

234
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,332
What?

235
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,934
You're playing the game, Ran?

236
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,135
Yes.

237
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,038
And I don't see Mouri around.

238
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:11,442
Oh. He went home saying that

239
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,344
the main derby is going to start pretty soon.

240
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,850
What's the matter?

241
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,653
The transmitter switched off.

242
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,855
How? About the noise?

243
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:26,357
I can hear something faintly.

244
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:29,561
But the sound is muffled.

245
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,562
What?

246
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,063
Cancelled?

247
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:34,732
You telling us to quit after coming this far?

248
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:38,436
Yeah. I got boss' approval just now too.

249
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,739
To change the target.

250
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,741
Change?

251
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:46,144
Change the target?

252
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,745
And, where is it?

253
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,950
The next target.

254
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,954
The place is Beika-cho, Gochome.

255
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:57,956
Mouri Detective Agency.

256
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:01,759
Mouri Detective Agency?

257
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,262
The horses have turned the fourth corner

258
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:07,532
and are running the straight course!

259
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,834
What's this?

260
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,037
I'm hitting the bull's eye left and right today!

261
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,541
What? Two black cars together?

262
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,844
They are pulling away from Toriya Grand Bridge?

263
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:23,348
Are those cars really theirs?

264
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,551
Yes! One of it is a Porsche 356A.

265
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,353
And the other one is a Viper!

266
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:30,555
The Harley was abandoned.

267
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,558
So that who was riding the motorbike is probably also in the car.

268
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,860
It can't be!

269
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,861
I mean...

270
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,664
The car that Mr. Domon, their target is on,

271
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:44,035
is speeding right before our eyes at this moment.

272
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:46,137
It's not even on the bridge yet.

273
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:52,043
In which direction did the two cars head for?

274
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,845
Where are those cars headed?

275
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:58,650
They turned left on the intersection of Toriya Yonchome

276
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,052
and headed towards Haido-cho?

277
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,253
Strange.

278
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,156
They're headed back to where they failed to assassinate their target?

279
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:10,161
No. Those guys are probably headed for Beika-cho!

280
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:11,162
What?

281
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:14,632
They found the transmitter and wiretap!

282
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:17,936
Leave Mr. Domon's car up to the FBI agents car pursuing from behind,

283
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,837
and head for Beika-cho!

284
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,339
Pops is in danger!

285
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,846
What's going on with the car behind?

286
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:31,849
I was thinking it strange that they were tailing us close for some time.

287
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,151
Let them be!

288
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,353
If you get too nervous,

289
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,755
you won't be able to handle things when you'll really need to.

290
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:41,159
I'm really grateful for all you're doing for me.

291
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,862
Well, I, myself have become a man worthy of being protected by you two,

292
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:47,332
and overcome the fix that I'm in now too.

293
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,833
A fix?

294
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,836
I just got word about that.

295
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,538
It's bad news.

296
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,242
But is it really true?

297
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,544
But is that story about Kogoro Mouri

298
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:04,549
setting a transmitter and wiretap on the sole of Kir's shoe true?

299
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,551
Yeah, no doubt about it.

300
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,753
According to the info we got,

301
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:12,256
the one that Kir was in touch with before meeting us today

302
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,558
was that guy.

303
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:16,461
But that's not enough to suspect him.

304
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,463
I don't know what he set it there for but...

305
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,531
He's the one that did it.

306
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:23,634
If it had been set some days ago, even more so.

307
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,137
Kir would've realized.

308
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:28,439
If it was that famed detective.

309
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,444
Are you saying that Kir disappeared because of that detective?

310
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,046
Keep your voice down.

311
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,948
The wiretap is still going.

312
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:40,251
What? Didn't you crush it along with the transmitter?

313
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:43,855
I have it hidden in my coat, wrapped heavily in cloth

314
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,157
so that it won't pick up what we say.

315
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:49,060
This way, we can throw him off a bit too.

316
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,163
I have something I want to ask that detective

317
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:56,033
while he's still here in this world with us.

318
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,936
What? Pops went home?

319
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:00,738
Right.

320
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,540
Ran's still here,

321
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,743
but Mouri left the minute we took our eyes of him.

322
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:07,545
Would you like me to go his detective agency

323
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,147
and bring him back here again?

324
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:12,050
No! Don't!

325
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,654
It seems that he left before the FBI arrived at Dr. Agasa's place!

326
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,156
What's up?

327
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,557
I'll explain later!

328
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,059
And until I contact you,

329
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,161
don't step an inch out of the house until you hear from me!

330
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:26,764
Please, Pops.

331
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:28,132
Please...

332
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,834
Please be okay!

333
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,826
This... This is scary.

334
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,327
Too scary.

335
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,730
I've already won 11 races in a row from the first race!

336
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,600
The God of Horse Races must've finally descended upon me?

337
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,805
Hey. Come on...

338
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,007
Darn it! This clunker of a TV!

339
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,609
This always happens at the wrong time!

340
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,313
Geez!

341
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:05,920
Hey! Pops?

342
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,921
Pops?

343
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,322
Gosh!

344
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:12,927
I've a 12 races straight win on my shoulders now!

345
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,029
Now for the odds of the final race...

346
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,798
I can't be answering the phone at a time like this!

347
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:18,999
Seriously!

348
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,204
What a simpleton.

349
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:27,007
I blew up the TV antenna and he shows his face.

350
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,009
His ear. He got...

351
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,912
Something and...

352
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:34,815
He's probably just listening to the wiretap that he set up

353
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:37,318
with all his might.

354
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:42,423
Then, let's make him hear our voices just as he wishes.

355
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:45,626
Do you hear me, Kogoro Mouri?

356
00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:46,627
Gin!

357
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:48,028
Don't you dare to move.

358
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:50,598
We've target locked your back.

359
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,600
I have something I'd like to ask you before we open a ventilation hole

360
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,401
in your suit.

361
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,904
The relationship between you and Sherry.

362
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,707
The transmitter and wiretap that you set up.

363
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:03,410
Looks a lot like the ones that woman set up previously.

364
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,614
I won't take coincidence for an answer.

365
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,416
I'll give you 10 seconds.

366
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,317
If you decide to answer,

367
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:14,221
take your left hand away from your earphone and raise it up.

368
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,623
Earphone.

369
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,526
If the horse makes it, it'll be my win!

370
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:19,727
I see!

371
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,629
Pops is listening to the horse races on the radio.

372
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,901
There, I see it!

373
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:29,303
Mouri Detective Agency!

374
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,305
Ten.

375
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:33,007
Nine.

376
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,408
Eight.

377
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:36,310
The roof of the car! Quick!

378
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,013
Seven.

379
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,414
Six.

380
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:41,515
Five.

381
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,018
Four.

382
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,619
Three.

383
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,722
Two.

384
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:50,724
One! Go for it!

385
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,403
A soccer ball?

386
00:21:02,403 --> 00:21:05,306
Hey! Who the heck are you?

387
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,909
I'm sorry, I kicked the ball a little too hard!

388
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,511
Why you...

389
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,313
By the way, how did the horse race go?

390
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,115
You were listening to it through the earphone, right?

391
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,417
Horse race?

392
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:21,121
Thanks to you, I goofed it!

393
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,626
It seems that he had nothing to do with this.

394
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:28,028
Get rid both of them.

395
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,331
Okay!

396
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,501
Punish when in doubt, right?

397
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,302
Wait!

398
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,804
We don't even conclusive proof,

399
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:40,107
and yet if we kill this man who has deep connections with the police...

400
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,111
Enough, Vermouth!

401
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,218
Gin.

402
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:55,022
Do you have something going with that detective?

403
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,223
So?

404
00:21:56,223 --> 00:21:58,125
What if I do?

405
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:00,828
Never mind.

406
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:04,999
The one who set this up seems to have carelessly left fingerprints behind.

407
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,200
After we get rid of him,

408
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,302
if we check his surroundings

409
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:11,505
we'll eventually be able to figure out who set it up.

410
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,110
What?

411
00:22:17,912 --> 00:22:20,114
Behind you at 8 o'clock.

412
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,818
It's from that building!

413
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:27,821
It can't be! It's 700 yards away.

414
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:28,822
Give it to me!

415
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,801
Shuichi Akai?

416
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:49,510
We've finally met.

417
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,313
My dear and dearest arch-enemy.

418
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:53,614
My dear.

419
00:22:56,517 --> 00:23:00,421
The FBI. So that's the story.

420
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,922
Gin.

421
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,023
We're splitting!

422
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:05,426
But what about the detective and kid?

423
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,427
Never mind!

424
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,628
Get out of here, quick!

425
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:20,507
Their car is headed west from Beika-cho Gochome.

426
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:21,809
Please pursue.

427
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,412
Well, they may throw you off track part way, though.

428
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,922
That gun fire a while ago was shot by an FBI agent?

429
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:38,425
Yeah, we fell into their trap.

430
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:42,830
If they didn't know that we were going there from some time ago,

431
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,499
they couldn't have positioned themselves on that building.

432
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:49,103
Then, you mean that Kogoro Mouri and the FBI joined hands and...

433
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:50,904
I don't think so.

434
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:56,510
To the FBI, he's no more than just a bait to lure us out.

435
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,914
I wonder if they would risk the life of one of their comrades.

436
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:07,521
They probably got info that he was going to have contact with Kir,

437
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,223
and after the two parted,

438
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:14,928
the FBI probably set the transmitter and wiretap onto Kir's shoe.

439
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:17,898
That way, just in case we all get caught,

440
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:21,101
we would all suspect him because of it.

441
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:25,205
Let's say that's what happened.

442
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:29,209
Kogoro Mouri seems to be your favorite detective after all.

443
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,112
Thank you.

444
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:35,015
The problem for now is Kir.

445
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,917
Don't tell me, the FBI...

446
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,118
Yeah.

447
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:41,121
There's probably no doubt that she fell into their hands.

448
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:45,225
Well, but I don't think Kir is the type to spit things easily.

449
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:48,529
I'll search her out no matter what it takes.

450
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,398
Do you have an idea where she is?

451
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:54,702
Hints are everywhere.

452
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,104
It's not that I believe that Kogoro Mouri

453
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,807
is completely innocent yet, either.

454
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:08,015
Did you see the TV program on this morning?

455
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:11,018
Yeah. The news about Mr. Domon passing up

456
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:14,121
being a candidate for election this time, right?

457
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:17,324
The reason is suspicion of his father, a government official,

458
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,926
having an extra-marital affair.

459
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:21,028
Which was 20 years ago.

460
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,798
Mr. Domon seems to have agreed to a special interview with Nichiuri TV,

461
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,602
under the condition that they keep this affair thing a secret,

462
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:31,805
but it was found that Rena Mizunashi had made up on her own.

463
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:35,509
Which means she was not commuting to work to the TV station.

464
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:40,013
Well, if they had known that he was such a righteous guy

465
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:42,716
that would give up candidacy for something like that.

466
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:45,919
They wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble.

467
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,924
Only if we could arrest two or three of those guys.

468
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,527
I could've blown off his leg,

469
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:57,698
but I fired through his bullet proof jacket and left it at that.

470
00:25:57,698 --> 00:25:59,299
I didn't want to stop them carelessly

471
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,602
and start a gunfire battle in the middle of town

472
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,905
while risking the general public falling prey to bullets.

473
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,006
Besides, in this case,

474
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:07,808
it was our top priority to make them think that

475
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:12,112
it was the FBI who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

476
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,914
Right?

477
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:15,415
That's true, but...

478
00:26:15,415 --> 00:26:17,718
Besides, it's not only that.

479
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,122
All ties have been severed with them either.

480
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,425
Although her life is not in danger,

481
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:28,228
she seems to be still unconscious.

482
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:30,898
I guess all we can do is wait for her to recover.

483
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:34,501
I've asked them to keep the fact that she's been hospitalized hidden.

484
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:37,604
But if an announcer suddenly disappears,

485
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:42,509
the TV station will not overlook it, will they?

486
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,611
That boy said don't worry.

487
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:47,414
He'd work something out.

488
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,716
That boy again.

489
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:51,318
Who is he, anyway?

490
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,920
A detective.

491
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,122
He's my favorite.

492
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:58,525
Personnel manager?

493
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:00,127
This is Rena Mizunashi!

494
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:02,229
I'm very sorry to say this,

495
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,097
but I'd like to take time off for a while.

496
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:33,420
How lucky you are.

497
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,823
Detective Mouri who was hanging around you was suspected,

498
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:39,426
and escape being killed by them by a hairsbreadth.

499
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,828
But he was saved at the very last moment.

500
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:46,300
That guy foresaw what was going to happen and ambushed them

501
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,704
to make those guys think that it was the FBI who schemed all this.

502
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,607
Well, you'd better thank that Akai guy.

503
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,209
Yeah, I really appreciate what he did.

504
00:28:56,209 --> 00:29:00,113
As well as Dr. Agasa and you for sheltering Ran at Dr. Agasa's place.

505
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,215
By the way, is everything all right?

506
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:06,219
It seems that nobody's keeping guard over Detective Mouri since then.

507
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,221
It's safer not to have anybody guard him

508
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:10,724
so I refused the FBI's offer to guard him.

509
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,826
I mean this is the chance to show them that

510
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:15,529
Pops has nothing to do with the FBI.

511
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,431
If I carelessly ask the FBI to guard him,

512
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,500
and they suspect that Pops is involved after all.

513
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,502
That would be more dangerous.

514
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:24,004
True, but...

515
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:28,909
Besides, we got a card that they left behind for us.

516
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:32,512
Announcer Rena Mizunashi, right?

517
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:35,716
I hear she's unconscious and in the hospital.

518
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:39,119
Yeah. I hear that the FBI are on guard around the clock

519
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,922
waiting for her to get up.

520
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:45,325
But if those guys find the hospital...

521
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,526
Don't worry!

522
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:48,929
I called the TV station using her voice and told them that

523
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:51,198
she'll be going on a long leave of absence.

524
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:55,001
So, I'm sure those guys won't think that she's in the hospital either.

525
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,704
At any rate, always keep on your guard.

526
00:29:57,704 --> 00:30:00,707
I'm sure that those guys are frantically looking for

527
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:03,110
her whereabouts right now, too.

528
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,715
Yeah. Those guy would do anything to achieve their purpose.
