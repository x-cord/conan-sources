1
00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:05.563
Chianti and Korn, you both go around to support this time.

2
00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.663
What? Support?

3
00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:10.163
I want to shoot.

4
00:00:10.163 --> 00:00:12.663
Well, think about it.

5
00:00:12.663 --> 00:00:15.663
He's riding a specially ordered bulletproof car.

6
00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:18.163
It's not the same as killing him in the park.

7
00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:19.663
But...

8
00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.763
Besides, he's tightly guarded on both sides by bodyguards

9
00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:26.263
who have been trained in the Self-Defense Force.

10
00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:30.163
The 7.62 mm bullet may pierce though the thinnest part of the car.

11
00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.263
Though the thinnest side window.

12
00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:36.063
But will not reach DJ.

13
00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:38.463
Then, how do you intend to kill him?

14
00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:42.863
Do you might me to stand on the bridge stark naked and hitchhike,

15
00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:46.263
then get myself in his car or something?

16
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:49.263
My, Chianti. That's pretty good thinking.

17
00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:50.863
Vermouth?

18
00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:51.863
I'm going to ride this motorbike

19
00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:55.863
and fall right in front of DJ's car and stop him.

20
00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:58.263
When he comes out of the car,

21
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.163
I'll come from behind

22
00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:02.963
and get him.

23
00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:07.963
The job of you both is to get rid of the two bodyguards

24
00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.363
that come out of the car together with DJ.

25
00:01:10.363 --> 00:01:17.163
But I wonder if that cautious man will come out of the car that easily.

26
00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:19.863
Don't worry.

27
00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:21.663
If a woman bleeds from her head

28
00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:25.063
after her helmet flies off and is lying on the ground.

29
00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:29.163
A man of justice such as he is will probably come dashing over, no?

30
00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:30.263
What?

31
00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:35.063
Cut out the joke!

32
00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:37.563
There are going to be other cars on the bridge too.

33
00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:40.763
If a famous actress like you expose your face.

34
00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:42.163
Idiot.

35
00:01:42.163 --> 00:01:44.063
I'm going to be exposing...

36
00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.563
This face!

37
00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:50.363
Kiriko Busujima of the Deisan Organization!

38
00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:51.963
Just as would be expected of you, Vermouth.

39
00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:53.863
You're a complete duplicate.

40
00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.163
I see.

41
00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:58.563
That's why you've come out front.

42
00:01:58.563 --> 00:02:00.863
Where's the place?

43
00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:02.063
Gin.

44
00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:06.063
We're going to kill DJ at Vane B.

45
00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:09.963
Bein B?

46
00:02:19.363 --> 00:02:21.363
Bein B?

47
00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:24.563
Is that the next assassination site?

48
00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:27.163
Yeah. The time is 16:00.

49
00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:28.863
It seems that they're going to kill Mr. Domon

50
00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:32.263
when his car passes over a bridge somewhere.

51
00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:36.963
In other words, the "B" of Bein B means bridge?

52
00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:40.063
But if we can't specify which bridge it is,

53
00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:41.463
we can't stop the assassination.

54
00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:43.263
Quiet!

55
00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:46.763
They're checking the map now.

56
00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:49.563
Maybe they'll say the name of the place.

57
00:02:49.563 --> 00:02:51.363
Korn, you position yourself here.

58
00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:54.263
Chianti, you go here.

59
00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:58.063
We're counting on you both!

60
00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:01.163
Where's my motorbike?

61
00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:02.263
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:02.263 --> 00:03:04.463
Behind that container.

63
00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:05.463
Thank you.

64
00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:09.163
Let's get together in the foreground of Vane B.

65
00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:11.163
Hey, Kir.

66
00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:15.463
Don't tell me that you...

67
00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.663
I hope you're not. Are you?

68
00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:23.663
Idiot.

69
00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:25.563
Of course not.

70
00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.163
What is it?

71
00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.963
Well, I'll go on ahead.

72
00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:40.563
Make sure you back me up if something comes up.

73
00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:42.663
I have a bad feeling

74
00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:45.563
about this assassination scheme.

75
00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:47.163
Leave it to me.

76
00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:50.863
If things start looking bad and you're in danger of falling in their hands,

77
00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:54.563
I won't hesitate firing a bullet right through your head.

78
00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:58.763
Yes. If such time comes, make sure you aim at my face, okay?

79
00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:00.963
You don't want the world to know that

80
00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.863
I was part of the assassination scheme, do you?

81
00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:04.563
Things will turn out badly, right?

82
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:09.163
Is there something bothering you, Vermouth?

83
00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:10.263
No.

84
00:04:10.263 --> 00:04:12.863
It's just this feeling I have.

85
00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:14.263
Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:23.763
Okay.

87
00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.263
Let's get going too.

88
00:04:29.563 --> 00:04:33.763
Okay, I don't know how much you know.

89
00:04:33.763 --> 00:04:36.463
But I wonder if you can stop me?

90
00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.963
My dearest...

91
00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:43.363
Silver Bullet?

92
00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:48.863
So, we don't know where the location is.

93
00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:49.963
Yeah.

94
00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:53.463
The sound is getting worse from a while ago.

95
00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:57.063
The only clue we have is that it's on a bridge somewhere.

96
00:04:57.063 --> 00:05:00.863
Maybe we can find out by calling Mr. Domon's election office

97
00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.763
and asking them

98
00:05:02.763 --> 00:05:04.963
where he's headed for now

99
00:05:04.963 --> 00:05:07.163
and what bridge he'll be crossing.

100
00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.263
I called them several times but...

101
00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.363
They won't tell me.

102
00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:12.863
Since I was quite persistent,

103
00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:15.563
they seem to suspect me of being up to no good.

104
00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:16.763
Well...

105
00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:19.663
Unless we find out what the "Bein" of Bein B is.

106
00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:22.463
This bad direction of the wind won't change.

107
00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:24.063
Direction of the wind?

108
00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:27.663
Bein sounds a lot like V. A. I. N.

109
00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:32.363
Which means useless, worthless, and conceited.

110
00:05:32.363 --> 00:05:35.963
I wonder if there was a place with that sort of name in Tokyo?

111
00:05:35.963 --> 00:05:37.663
No, that's not it.

112
00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:39.963
It's not V. A. I. N.

113
00:05:39.963 --> 00:05:42.663
But V. A. N. E. As in Vane!

114
00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:46.663
What? You mean the vane as in weathervane or a windmill?

115
00:05:46.663 --> 00:05:47.763
Yeah.

116
00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:51.763
A word that at the same time means the arrow feather of a bow.

117
00:05:51.763 --> 00:05:54.863
The name of a place around here that suggests an arrow feather is.

118
00:05:54.863 --> 00:05:56.163
Toriya-cho!

119
00:05:56.163 --> 00:05:58.963
In other words, Vane B is Toriya Bridge!

120
00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.063
That is Toriya Grand Bridge!

121
00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:02.663
That's good news!

122
00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:05.363
We still have two hours till 16:00,

123
00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:07.263
the scheduled time of the assassination!

124
00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:10.263
We finally get to take the lead!

125
00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:13.163
There are a total of six of them,

126
00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:14.563
three women and three men!

127
00:06:14.563 --> 00:06:17.063
The two women will be riding motorbikes

128
00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:19.763
and the remaining four will come on two different cars.

129
00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:22.063
One of which is a Porsche 365A.

130
00:06:22.063 --> 00:06:26.663
Let's send the investigator's vehicle to the bridge on the double

131
00:06:26.663 --> 00:06:30.463
and block off all the roads leading to the bridge for now.

132
00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:32.463
We're going to round them up, right?

133
00:06:32.463 --> 00:06:36.263
No, we're going to stay low and sneak up from behind.

134
00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:39.163
And make sure we fish them all without fail, one by one.

135
00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:45.663
Geez!

136
00:06:45.663 --> 00:06:47.863
Why do I, the Famed Detective, Kogoro Mouri,

137
00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:51.763
have to play a TV game at your house, Dr. Agasa?

138
00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:53.663
Well, no big thing, is it?

139
00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:56.363
You didn't have anything to do anyway, did you?

140
00:06:57.463 --> 00:06:58.863
Besides, that's a deduction game

141
00:06:58.863 --> 00:07:01.063
that I developed that I'm quite confident of!

142
00:07:01.063 --> 00:07:04.663
And there's no one else than you to be the first to try it out.

143
00:07:04.663 --> 00:07:07.663
This game is filled with a lot of cases, isn't it?

144
00:07:07.663 --> 00:07:09.563
This is already the third case.

145
00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.363
Who cares?

146
00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:13.863
Nobody's dying for real.

147
00:07:13.863 --> 00:07:16.263
And if a bit of the painful feeling is felt by the player,

148
00:07:16.263 --> 00:07:18.863
it's served its purpose.

149
00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:21.963
Well, I wish people would keep homicides confined

150
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:24.163
to games and TV dramas.

151
00:07:24.163 --> 00:07:26.763
The grief that one goes through when someone really dies

152
00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:30.263
can't be compared to the one felt through games and TV dramas.

153
00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:32.563
By the way, where's Conan?

154
00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:35.163
Wasn't he with you, Dr. Agasa?

155
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.563
Oh, yes.

156
00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:38.463
He went on home before us.

157
00:07:38.463 --> 00:07:41.163
Because it started raining quite heavily.

158
00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.463
I guess I'll start heading on home too, then.

159
00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:47.463
I don't want Conan to be starving.

160
00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:49.463
Well...

161
00:07:49.463 --> 00:07:50.963
Don't go home!

162
00:07:52.363 --> 00:07:55.263
Edogawa will be fine.

163
00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:56.963
Don't worry about him.

164
00:07:59.263 --> 00:08:02.163
So, don't go! Please!

165
00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:10.563
-Ai. -Ai.

166
00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:16.263
Okay, if you say so.

167
00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:17.663
Then I'll stay.

168
00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:26.436
No.

169
00:08:28.836 --> 00:08:30.436
It's nothing.

170
00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:44.136
Yes. Only a few minutes until we get there.

171
00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:47.236
Let us know when you get there, Kir.

172
00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:48.336
Roger!

173
00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:11.636
Excuse me.

174
00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:14.036
I'd like to ask you something.

175
00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:20.436
Will you please stop your motorbike?

176
00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:16.536
That is bad!

177
00:10:27.136 --> 00:10:28.636
She's still breathing!

178
00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:30.036
Rush her to the hospital!

179
00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.236
Okay!

180
00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:40.136
Rena Mizunashi?

181
00:10:40.136 --> 00:10:42.936
What's Rena Mizunashi doing here?

182
00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:45.436
According to your story,

183
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.536
wasn't the woman riding this motorbike

184
00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:49.936
supposed to be Vermouth in disguise?

185
00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:51.436
I thought so

186
00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:53.136
because she was quite some distance away from the transmitter.

187
00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:55.636
I thought for sure that was the case, but...

188
00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:59.036
She changed into leather overalls and boots somewhere.

189
00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:03.636
The transmitter and wiretap that are on her loafers are probably there.

190
00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:06.636
But where did she change?

191
00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.436
Not yet?

192
00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.736
Gin.

193
00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:14.236
Men who keep people waiting are not liked!

194
00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:16.136
Hold your horses, Chianti.

195
00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:18.336
We haven't got word from Kir yet.

196
00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:22.036
Besides, DJ's car is still...

197
00:11:22.036 --> 00:11:23.436
This might not mean anything

198
00:11:23.436 --> 00:11:26.536
but I can't hear a thing because your voice is full of static!

199
00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:27.836
Static?

200
00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:30.836
What's up?

201
00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:32.236
Quiet.

202
00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:52.036
What?

203
00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:53.636
You're playing the game, Ran?

204
00:11:53.636 --> 00:11:54.836
Yes.

205
00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:57.736
And I don't see Mouri around.

206
00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:02.136
Oh. He went home saying that

207
00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:04.036
the main derby is going to start pretty soon.

208
00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:09.536
What's the matter?

209
00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:12.336
The transmitter switched off.

210
00:12:12.336 --> 00:12:14.536
How? About the noise?

211
00:12:14.536 --> 00:12:17.036
I can hear something faintly.

212
00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.236
But the sound is muffled.

213
00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:21.236
What?

214
00:12:21.236 --> 00:12:22.736
Cancelled?

215
00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:25.436
You telling us to quit after coming this far?

216
00:12:25.436 --> 00:12:29.136
Yeah. I got boss' approval just now too.

217
00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:32.436
To change the target.

218
00:12:32.436 --> 00:12:34.436
Change?

219
00:12:34.436 --> 00:12:36.836
Change the target?

220
00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:38.436
And, where is it?

221
00:12:40.536 --> 00:12:42.636
The next target.

222
00:12:42.636 --> 00:12:46.636
The place is Beika-cho, Gochome.

223
00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.636
Mouri Detective Agency.

224
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:52.436
Mouri Detective Agency?

225
00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:54.936
The horses have turned the fourth corner

226
00:12:54.936 --> 00:12:58.236
and are running the straight course!

227
00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.536
What's this?

228
00:13:00.536 --> 00:13:03.736
I'm hitting the bull's eye left and right today!

229
00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:07.236
What? Two black cars together?

230
00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:10.536
They are pulling away from Toriya Grand Bridge?

231
00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:14.036
Are those cars really theirs?

232
00:13:14.036 --> 00:13:17.236
Yes! One of it is a Porsche 356A.

233
00:13:17.236 --> 00:13:19.036
And the other one is a Viper!

234
00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:21.236
The Harley was abandoned.

235
00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:24.236
So that who was riding the motorbike is probably also in the car.

236
00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.536
It can't be!

237
00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:27.536
I mean...

238
00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:30.336
The car that Mr. Domon, their target is on,

239
00:13:30.336 --> 00:13:34.736
is speeding right before our eyes at this moment.

240
00:13:34.736 --> 00:13:36.836
It's not even on the bridge yet.

241
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:42.736
In which direction did the two cars head for?

242
00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:44.536
Where are those cars headed?

243
00:13:46.136 --> 00:13:49.336
They turned left on the intersection of Toriya Yonchome

244
00:13:49.336 --> 00:13:51.736
and headed towards Haido-cho?

245
00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:52.936
Strange.

246
00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:55.836
They're headed back to where they failed to assassinate their target?

247
00:13:55.836 --> 00:14:00.836
No. Those guys are probably headed for Beika-cho!

248
00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:01.836
What?

249
00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:05.336
They found the transmitter and wiretap!

250
00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:08.636
Leave Mr. Domon's car up to the FBI agents car pursuing from behind,

251
00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:10.536
and head for Beika-cho!

252
00:14:10.536 --> 00:14:12.036
Pops is in danger!

253
00:14:17.536 --> 00:14:19.536
What's going on with the car behind?

254
00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:22.536
I was thinking it strange that they were tailing us close for some time.

255
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:23.836
Let them be!

256
00:14:23.836 --> 00:14:26.036
If you get too nervous,

257
00:14:26.036 --> 00:14:28.436
you won't be able to handle things when you'll really need to.

258
00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:31.836
I'm really grateful for all you're doing for me.

259
00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:35.536
Well, I, myself have become a man worthy of being protected by you two,

260
00:14:35.536 --> 00:14:38.036
and overcome the fix that I'm in now too.

261
00:14:38.036 --> 00:14:39.536
A fix?

262
00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:42.536
I just got word about that.

263
00:14:42.536 --> 00:14:44.236
It's bad news.

264
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.936
But is it really true?

265
00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:50.236
But is that story about Kogoro Mouri

266
00:14:50.236 --> 00:14:55.236
setting a transmitter and wiretap on the sole of Kir's shoe true?

267
00:14:55.236 --> 00:14:57.236
Yeah, no doubt about it.

268
00:14:57.236 --> 00:14:59.436
According to the info we got,

269
00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:02.936
the one that Kir was in touch with before meeting us today

270
00:15:02.936 --> 00:15:04.236
was that guy.

271
00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:07.136
But that's not enough to suspect him.

272
00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:09.136
I don't know what he set it there for but...

273
00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:11.236
He's the one that did it.

274
00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:14.336
If it had been set some days ago, even more so.

275
00:15:14.336 --> 00:15:16.836
Kir would've realized.

276
00:15:16.836 --> 00:15:19.136
If it was that famed detective.

277
00:15:19.136 --> 00:15:24.136
Are you saying that Kir disappeared because of that detective?

278
00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:25.736
Keep your voice down.

279
00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:27.636
The wiretap is still going.

280
00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.936
What? Didn't you crush it along with the transmitter?

281
00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:34.536
I have it hidden in my coat, wrapped heavily in cloth

282
00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:36.836
so that it won't pick up what we say.

283
00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:39.736
This way, we can throw him off a bit too.

284
00:15:39.736 --> 00:15:42.836
I have something I want to ask that detective

285
00:15:42.836 --> 00:15:46.736
while he's still here in this world with us.

286
00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:49.636
What? Pops went home?

287
00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.436
Right.

288
00:15:51.436 --> 00:15:53.236
Ran's still here,

289
00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:56.436
but Mouri left the minute we took our eyes of him.

290
00:15:56.436 --> 00:15:58.236
Would you like me to go his detective agency

291
00:15:58.236 --> 00:15:59.836
and bring him back here again?

292
00:15:59.836 --> 00:16:02.736
No! Don't!

293
00:16:02.736 --> 00:16:07.336
It seems that he left before the FBI arrived at Dr. Agasa's place!

294
00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:08.836
What's up?

295
00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.236
I'll explain later!

296
00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:11.736
And until I contact you,

297
00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:13.836
don't step an inch out of the house until you hear from me!

298
00:16:15.936 --> 00:16:17.436
Please, Pops.

299
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:18.836
Please...

300
00:16:18.836 --> 00:16:20.536
Please be okay!

301
00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:26.636
This... This is scary.

302
00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:28.136
Too scary.

303
00:18:28.136 --> 00:18:30.536
I've already won 11 races in a row from the first race!

304
00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:33.988
The God of Horse Races must've finally descended upon me?

305
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.974
Behind you at 8 o'clock.

306
00:18:38.874 --> 00:18:40.674
It's from that building!

307
00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:43.674
It can't be! It's 700 yards away.

308
00:18:43.674 --> 00:18:44.674
Give it to me!

309
00:18:54.374 --> 00:18:56.674
Shuichi Akai?

310
00:19:02.974 --> 00:19:05.374
We've finally met.

311
00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:08.174
My dear and dearest arch-enemy.

312
00:19:08.174 --> 00:19:09.474
My dear.

313
00:19:12.374 --> 00:19:16.274
The FBI. So that's the story.

314
00:19:16.274 --> 00:19:17.774
Gin.

315
00:19:17.774 --> 00:19:18.874
We're splitting!

316
00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:21.274
But what about the detective and kid?

317
00:19:21.274 --> 00:19:22.274
Never mind!

318
00:19:22.274 --> 00:19:23.474
Get out of here, quick!

319
00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:36.374
Their car is headed west from Beika-cho Gochome.

320
00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:37.674
Please pursue.

321
00:19:37.674 --> 00:19:41.274
Well, they may throw you off track part way, though.

322
00:19:47.474 --> 00:19:50.774
That gun fire a while ago was shot by an FBI agent?

323
00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:54.274
Yeah, we fell into their trap.

324
00:19:54.274 --> 00:19:58.674
If they didn't know that we were going there from some time ago,

325
00:19:58.674 --> 00:20:01.374
they couldn't have positioned themselves on that building.

326
00:20:01.374 --> 00:20:04.974
Then, you mean that Kogoro Mouri and the FBI joined hands and...

327
00:20:04.974 --> 00:20:06.774
I don't think so.

328
00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:12.374
To the FBI, he's no more than just a bait to lure us out.

329
00:20:12.374 --> 00:20:16.774
I wonder if they would risk the life of one of their comrades.

330
00:20:18.974 --> 00:20:23.374
They probably got info that he was going to have contact with Kir,

331
00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:25.074
and after the two parted,

332
00:20:25.074 --> 00:20:30.774
the FBI probably set the transmitter and wiretap onto Kir's shoe.

333
00:20:30.774 --> 00:20:33.774
That way, just in case we all get caught,

334
00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:36.974
we would all suspect him because of it.

335
00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:41.074
Let's say that's what happened.

336
00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:45.074
Kogoro Mouri seems to be your favorite detective after all.

337
00:20:46.274 --> 00:20:47.974
Thank you.

338
00:20:47.974 --> 00:20:50.874
The problem for now is Kir.

339
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.774
Don't tell me, the FBI...

340
00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:53.974
Yeah.

341
00:20:53.974 --> 00:20:56.974
There's probably no doubt that she fell into their hands.

342
00:20:56.974 --> 00:21:01.074
Well, but I don't think Kir is the type to spit things easily.

343
00:21:01.074 --> 00:21:04.374
I'll search her out no matter what it takes.

344
00:21:04.374 --> 00:21:07.274
Do you have an idea where she is?

345
00:21:07.274 --> 00:21:10.574
Hints are everywhere.

346
00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:12.974
It's not that I believe that Kogoro Mouri

347
00:21:12.974 --> 00:21:15.674
is completely innocent yet, either.

348
00:21:21.474 --> 00:21:23.874
Did you see the TV program on this morning?

349
00:21:23.874 --> 00:21:26.874
Yeah. The news about Mr. Domon passing up

350
00:21:26.874 --> 00:21:29.974
being a candidate for election this time, right?

351
00:21:29.974 --> 00:21:33.174
The reason is suspicion of his father, a government official,

352
00:21:33.174 --> 00:21:34.774
having an extra-marital affair.

353
00:21:34.774 --> 00:21:36.874
Which was 20 years ago.

354
00:21:36.874 --> 00:21:40.674
Mr. Domon seems to have agreed to a special interview with Nichiuri TV,

355
00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:44.474
under the condition that they keep this affair thing a secret,

356
00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:47.674
but it was found that Rena Mizunashi had made up on her own.

357
00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:51.374
Which means she was not commuting to work to the TV station.

358
00:21:53.174 --> 00:21:55.874
Well, if they had known that he was such a righteous guy

359
00:21:55.874 --> 00:21:58.574
that would give up candidacy for something like that.

360
00:21:58.574 --> 00:22:01.774
They wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble.

361
00:22:01.774 --> 00:22:06.774
Only if we could arrest two or three of those guys.

362
00:22:06.774 --> 00:22:09.374
I could've blown off his leg,

363
00:22:09.374 --> 00:22:13.574
but I fired through his bullet proof jacket and left it at that.

364
00:22:13.574 --> 00:22:15.174
I didn't want to stop them carelessly

365
00:22:15.174 --> 00:22:17.474
and start a gunfire battle in the middle of town

366
00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:20.774
while risking the general public falling prey to bullets.

367
00:22:20.774 --> 00:22:21.874
Besides, in this case,

368
00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:23.674
it was our top priority to make them think that

369
00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:27.974
it was the FBI who set up the transmitter and wiretap.

370
00:22:27.974 --> 00:22:29.774
Right?

371
00:22:29.774 --> 00:22:31.274
That's true, but...

372
00:22:31.274 --> 00:22:33.574
Besides, it's not only that.

373
00:22:36.174 --> 00:22:37.974
All ties have been severed with them either.

374
00:22:39.474 --> 00:22:41.274
Although her life is not in danger,

375
00:22:41.274 --> 00:22:44.074
she seems to be still unconscious.

376
00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:46.774
I guess all we can do is wait for her to recover.

377
00:22:46.774 --> 00:22:50.374
I've asked them to keep the fact that she's been hospitalized hidden.

378
00:22:50.374 --> 00:22:53.474
But if an announcer suddenly disappears,

379
00:22:53.474 --> 00:22:58.374
the TV station will not overlook it, will they?

380
00:22:58.374 --> 00:23:00.474
That boy said don't worry.

381
00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:03.274
He'd work something out.

382
00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:05.574
That boy again.

383
00:23:05.574 --> 00:23:07.174
Who is he, anyway?

384
00:23:07.174 --> 00:23:08.774
A detective.

385
00:23:08.774 --> 00:23:10.974
He's my favorite.

386
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.374
Personnel manager?

387
00:23:14.374 --> 00:23:15.974
This is Rena Mizunashi!

388
00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:18.074
I'm very sorry to say this,

389
00:23:18.074 --> 00:23:19.974
but I'd like to take time off for a while.

390
00:24:47.374 --> 00:24:49.274
How lucky you are.

391
00:24:49.274 --> 00:24:52.674
Detective Mouri who was hanging around you was suspected,

392
00:24:52.674 --> 00:24:55.274
and escape being killed by them by a hairsbreadth.

393
00:24:55.274 --> 00:24:57.674
But he was saved at the very last moment.

394
00:24:57.674 --> 00:25:02.174
That guy foresaw what was going to happen and ambushed them

395
00:25:02.174 --> 00:25:06.574
to make those guys think that it was the FBI who schemed all this.

396
00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:09.474
Well, you'd better thank that Akai guy.

397
00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:12.074
Yeah, I really appreciate what he did.

398
00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:15.974
As well as Dr. Agasa and you for sheltering Ran at Dr. Agasa's place.

399
00:25:15.974 --> 00:25:18.074
By the way, is everything all right?

400
00:25:18.074 --> 00:25:22.074
It seems that nobody's keeping guard over Detective Mouri since then.

401
00:25:22.074 --> 00:25:24.074
It's safer not to have anybody guard him

402
00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:26.574
so I refused the FBI's offer to guard him.

403
00:25:26.574 --> 00:25:28.674
I mean this is the chance to show them that

404
00:25:28.674 --> 00:25:31.374
Pops has nothing to do with the FBI.

405
00:25:31.374 --> 00:25:33.274
If I carelessly ask the FBI to guard him,

406
00:25:33.274 --> 00:25:36.374
and they suspect that Pops is involved after all.

407
00:25:36.374 --> 00:25:38.374
That would be more dangerous.

408
00:25:38.374 --> 00:25:39.874
True, but...

409
00:25:39.874 --> 00:25:44.774
Besides, we got a card that they left behind for us.

410
00:25:44.774 --> 00:25:48.374
Announcer Rena Mizunashi, right?

411
00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:51.574
I hear she's unconscious and in the hospital.

412
00:25:51.574 --> 00:25:54.974
Yeah. I hear that the FBI are on guard around the clock

413
00:25:54.974 --> 00:25:57.774
waiting for her to get up.

414
00:25:57.774 --> 00:26:01.174
But if those guys find the hospital...

415
00:26:01.174 --> 00:26:02.374
Don't worry!

416
00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:04.774
I called the TV station using her voice and told them that

417
00:26:04.774 --> 00:26:07.074
she'll be going on a long leave of absence.

418
00:26:07.074 --> 00:26:10.874
So, I'm sure those guys won't think that she's in the hospital either.

419
00:26:10.874 --> 00:26:13.574
At any rate, always keep on your guard.

420
00:26:13.574 --> 00:26:16.574
I'm sure that those guys are frantically looking for

421
00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:18.974
her whereabouts right now, too.

422
00:26:18.974 --> 00:26:24.574
Yeah. Those guy would do anything to achieve their purpose.

423
00:26:27.874 --> 00:26:29.974
"Next Episode" -Don't tell me that this is?

424
00:26:29.974 --> 00:26:31.874
"Next Conan's Hint: Wooden sword" -A love letter?

425
00:26:31.874 --> 00:26:33.374
"Next Conan's Hint: Wooden sword" -Maybe...

426
00:26:33.374 --> 00:26:36.474
the culprit felt the same way we did.

427
00:26:36.474 --> 00:26:39.674
Did you have anything else written in your diary?

428
00:26:39.674 --> 00:26:43.874
That man called Nagai had a wooden sword, didn't he?

429
00:26:43.874 --> 00:26:48.574
Ran was saying that she's going to tell the guy how she honestly feels.

430
00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:50.774
I wonder if she's going to tell him about me...

431
00:26:52.174 --> 00:26:57.874
Next Conan, "Love Letter to Ran"
