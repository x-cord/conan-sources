"First Prize 10 Million Yen"

3
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.370
It's full of hot air balloons.

4
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.370
They're really beautiful.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.770
This is the nation's greatest hot air balloon contest after all.

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.770
10 million yen will be awarded to the annual champion.

7
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.870
That's amazing.

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.870
"Tournament Headquaters"

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.470
"Reception" -Mr. Hasegawa.

10
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.970
Lady Sonoko, thanks for coming such a long way.

11
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.970
I brought my friend along with me this year,

12
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.770
-I hope you don't mind. -Sure, it's okay.

13
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.470
I'm Hasegawa, a member of the management board.

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.970
The more people the better.

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.970
How high can hot air balloons fly?

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.270
It depends on the size of the hot air balloon.

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.570
But a big one can go higher than 10,000 meters.

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.370
It'll fly easily over Mt. Fuji too.

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.970
Really? I'd like to ride one.

20
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.770
I'm going to be riding to take a video,

21
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170
so would you like to come with me?

22
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.170
I'll go, I'll go!

23
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.770
Ran, Sonoko, come ride with us too!

24
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.670
But I don't want to be a bother.

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.670
Yes, she's right.

26
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.370
I'll bet you're just scared.

27
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.670
Hot air balloons are safe to ride,

28
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.970
so you'll be completely okay.

29
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.570
It's a large as a seven story building,

30
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
and there is a lot of light air inside it.

31
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.270
So even if a small hole were to open in it,

32
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.770
it won't descend right away.

33
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.670
See, even the person at headquarters is saying so too.

34
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.270
Is something wrong, Mr. Mizuguchi?

35
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.070
No, I was thinking of registering one more person.

36
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670
I'd like to show my wife the scenery from above too.

37
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.070
Although he used to ask me, I always refused up to now

38
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.770
but I've finally decided to try riding it.

39
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.870
See, if you pass this chance up,

40
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.270
you'll probably never get to experience this ever again.

41
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.370
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.970
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

43
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.970
A gigantic colorful hot air balloon.

44
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.070
Riding it brought about an unexpected turn of events!

45
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.670
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.170
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:14.828
"Mystery in a Hot Air Balloon"

49
00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:19.528
I'm not really interested in hot air balloons.

50
00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:21.828
What? Then, why did you say you were going to ride it?

51
00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.728
He said that he is sure to win,

52
00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:26.628
so for me to hold the championship trophy.

53
00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:30.328
He also said that he'd buy a necklace for me with the award money.

54
00:04:30.328 --> 00:04:32.028
So, I thought why not?

55
00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:36.328
His salary is low and yet he does this hot air balloon thing

56
00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:39.428
so he never bought me accessories.

57
00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:42.428
I wonder what happened.

58
00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:44.928
What're they doing? Stop it! Cut it out!

59
00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:48.428
"Akihiro Okuda (35)" -I would never lose to a guy like you!

60
00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:51.428
How dare you! I'm the champion, you know!

61
00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:52.828
So what?

62
00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:54.028
What?

63
00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:55.628
Dear!

64
00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.928
-Just what're you doing? Stop it! -Don't fight! Cut it out!

65
00:04:57.928 --> 00:04:59.128
Stop it, please!

66
00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:01.628
Arisa! But he...

67
00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:05.228
Watch your mouth! You're the one who started the fight!

68
00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:07.228
Hot air balloons are more...

69
00:05:07.228 --> 00:05:10.428
Easygoing things, I thought.

70
00:05:10.428 --> 00:05:12.828
I guess not.

71
00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:18.128
Mr. Mizuguchi said that he was the champion, right?

72
00:05:18.128 --> 00:05:21.828
Yes. He was the annual champion for two successive years.

73
00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:23.828
He's a very earnest person, you see.

74
00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:26.428
Even last night after everyone left for the hotel,

75
00:05:26.428 --> 00:05:29.428
he stayed behind making preparations.

76
00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:34.128
See, that blue hot air balloon way back there is Mr. Mizuguchi's.

77
00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:37.428
Please get ready to start.

78
00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:47.328
"Bell Tree, 66, Suzuki Balloon Festival"

79
00:05:51.028 --> 00:05:53.928
"Suzuki Balloon Festival"

80
00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:01.528
Fantastic!

81
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.328
How beautiful.

82
00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:08.028
Hey, look!

83
00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:10.628
The people are getting smaller and smaller.

84
00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:12.328
You're right!

85
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.928
Hey, everyone's going ahead of us.

86
00:06:54.928 --> 00:06:56.728
Don't you have to catch up with them?

87
00:06:56.728 --> 00:07:00.628
Yes. It seems the wind is stronger above.

88
00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.428
I'm going to adjust the burner

89
00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:04.128
so will you take videos for me?

90
00:07:04.128 --> 00:07:05.828
What?

91
00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:07.028
What's the matter?

92
00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:09.228
Nope. It's nothing.

93
00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:15.428
Everybody's really speeding.

94
00:07:15.428 --> 00:07:18.428
They're flying so close together. It looks dangerous.

95
00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:19.928
Today's task is...

96
00:07:19.928 --> 00:07:24.528
Task means the item of the event which is "Race to Area",

97
00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:27.528
where you not only have to drop the marker on the target

98
00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:29.428
but how fast you do it adds points.

99
00:07:29.428 --> 00:07:33.028
That's why everybody's trying to make it to goal as fast as possible.

100
00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:35.428
Hey, doesn't that look dangerous?

101
00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:36.428
Where?

102
00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:38.928
That blue balloon in the lead.

103
00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:40.228
You mean the one with two people on it.

104
00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:42.428
Isn't that Mr. Mizuguchi?

105
00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:46.528
Watch out! They'll crash!

106
00:07:54.028 --> 00:07:56.228
He opened the exhaust valve?

107
00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:00.928
He's going to flee below!

108
00:08:09.128 --> 00:08:10.228
They're falling!

109
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:13.128
Yes. But hot air balloons fall slowly,

110
00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:15.228
so the people riding them should be okay.

111
00:08:31.628 --> 00:08:33.328
Oh, Conan!

112
00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:47.528
Arisa.

113
00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:49.628
How could this happen?

114
00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:57.028
Mr. Hasegawa, please call the police!

115
00:08:57.028 --> 00:08:58.328
Yeah!

116
00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:06.128
I see.

117
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:07.928
"Lieutenant Kaneko (35)" -As far as I've heard till now,

118
00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:10.928
"Ibaraki Prefectural Police" -this is totally an accident.

119
00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:13.528
And where is the person who crashed the hot air balloon?

120
00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:17.128
Mr. Okuda is still continuing the race.

121
00:09:17.128 --> 00:09:20.828
I think it's about time that he reaches the goal though.

122
00:09:20.828 --> 00:09:21.828
Although it may be an accident,

123
00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:25.628
I'd like to know the details on how the woman fell.

124
00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:31.828
I'm Kaneko from the Ibaraki Prefectural Police Department.

125
00:09:31.828 --> 00:09:33.928
You're Mr. Shingo Mizuguchi?

126
00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:38.628
I hate to ask you this at a time like this

127
00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:42.428
but will you please give me the details of when you wife fell?

128
00:09:43.628 --> 00:09:46.528
The hot air balloon came crashing into ours

129
00:09:46.528 --> 00:09:48.528
and a hole opened in the fabric.

130
00:09:48.528 --> 00:09:49.528
Fabric?

131
00:09:49.528 --> 00:09:52.628
It's the part on top of the hot air balloon that looks like a balloon.

132
00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:55.028
Oh. And?

133
00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:59.028
Since the impact of the crash and the hole opened sideways,

134
00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:03.628
the basket swayed, and although I told her to hang on tight...

135
00:10:03.628 --> 00:10:05.128
But Arisa...

136
00:10:06.828 --> 00:10:07.928
Chief.

137
00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:11.428
We've finished, so is it okay for us to transport the corpse?

138
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:12.428
Yes.

139
00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:13.928
Arisa.

140
00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:16.028
Where are you taking her?

141
00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:18.928
We may need to give her an autopsy

142
00:10:18.928 --> 00:10:20.428
so she's being taken to the university hospital.

143
00:10:20.428 --> 00:10:22.928
Please don't autopsy on her!

144
00:10:22.928 --> 00:10:25.628
I can't bear you slicing up Arisa's body!

145
00:10:25.628 --> 00:10:28.028
She's already wounded a lot as she is.

146
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:31.628
We know she died from the fall.

147
00:10:31.628 --> 00:10:34.128
But, we can't say for sure

148
00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:36.428
unless the medical examiner checks her over.

149
00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:39.528
Arisa!

150
00:10:39.528 --> 00:10:41.328
Please take me with you too.

151
00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:44.928
Yes, because you should also be treated for your wounds.

152
00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:52.028
It was so pathetic that I just couldn't watch.

153
00:10:52.028 --> 00:10:55.128
How dare he cause such an accident at our contest?

154
00:10:55.128 --> 00:11:00.028
It may be an accident but I'll never forgive that guy Okuda!

155
00:11:07.828 --> 00:11:08.828
What?

156
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.028
Arisa's hat?

157
00:11:13.728 --> 00:11:15.728
Blood stains!

158
00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:19.428
Come to think of it, Mr. Mizuguchi had wounds on his face.

159
00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:26.228
What?

160
00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:30.128
Vinyl? Could it be a part of something?

161
00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:32.228
Conan!

162
00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:34.628
Sonoko says she's going over to the goal.

163
00:11:34.628 --> 00:11:36.028
I'll be right over!

164
00:11:55.128 --> 00:11:56.428
Died?

165
00:11:56.428 --> 00:11:57.628
Really?

166
00:11:57.628 --> 00:12:00.928
That's why I've come here.

167
00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:03.028
You really didn't know?

168
00:12:03.028 --> 00:12:06.628
It's true! I was in the lead and flew all the way here.

169
00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:09.128
How should I know about somebody who was behind me?

170
00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:12.528
You admit bumping into Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon, then?

171
00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:15.228
Yeah, but since it's a race.

172
00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:18.728
We're all desperate to reach the goal as fast as possible.

173
00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:21.428
This kind of thing happens frequently in races.

174
00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:22.928
It may have been an accident,

175
00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:24.828
but a person has died, you know.

176
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:28.028
You may be charged with corporate manslaughter.

177
00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:29.728
No!

178
00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:34.028
Sir, you were fighting with Mr. Mizuguchi before the race, weren't you?

179
00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:36.928
-What? -What, is that true?

180
00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:39.028
Watch your mouth, brat!

181
00:12:39.028 --> 00:12:42.428
I would never lose to a guy like you!

182
00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.828
How dare you! I'm a champion, you know!

183
00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:48.728
It was his fault.

184
00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:52.128
He had the nerve to say I'm too much of a greenhorn to beat him.

185
00:12:52.128 --> 00:12:55.828
So you got angry and deliberately bumped into him?

186
00:12:55.828 --> 00:12:58.128
I told you it wasn't deliberate!

187
00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:01.628
And the basket of your hot air balloon is broken

188
00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:03.928
and the rattan is sticking out.

189
00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:10.228
You're right!

190
00:13:10.228 --> 00:13:12.928
You tried to open a hole in Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon

191
00:13:12.928 --> 00:13:15.328
and drop it, didn't you?

192
00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.328
This is not an accident

193
00:13:17.328 --> 00:13:19.028
but a homicide!

194
00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:39.195
And the perp is you, Mr. Okuda!

195
00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:42.295
What? Don't be ridiculous!

196
00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:44.295
When I checked my balloon yesterday,

197
00:13:44.295 --> 00:13:46.795
no such thing was sticking out!

198
00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:49.595
And besides, even if this were here,

199
00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.495
if he didn't lower his altitude,

200
00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:54.895
the balloons would have just bumped into each other and that was it!

201
00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.695
He's right.

202
00:13:56.695 --> 00:13:58.295
Back then...

203
00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:03.595
Mr. Mizuguchi opened the exhaust valve and lowered his altitude.

204
00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:05.895
Why?

205
00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:11.895
Ran, you said, "What?" when we were flying.

206
00:14:11.895 --> 00:14:14.295
Did you notice something strange?

207
00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:15.895
Oh, that.

208
00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.295
It looked like there was only one person

209
00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:20.295
in Mr. Mizuguchi's hot air balloon.

210
00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:23.995
But, when I took another look later, two people were riding.

211
00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:26.295
So I guess Arisa was bent down.

212
00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:33.095
Hey, Mr. Hasegawa, can you please show me your camera?

213
00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:34.295
Sure.

214
00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:36.995
Thank you.

215
00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:45.195
This is...

216
00:14:45.195 --> 00:14:47.795
Maybe this is...

217
00:14:48.495 --> 00:14:51.995
At any rate, Mr. Okuda, please come to the police station with me!

218
00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:55.495
Wait. I won today.

219
00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.495
Please wait until after the awards are announced.

220
00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:12.795
"Suzuki's Balloon Festival"

221
00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:16.795
That's it for the report from forensics.

222
00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:18.395
Good work.

223
00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:21.295
Let me know if something comes up.

224
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.395
Yes, sir!

225
00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:29.195
Mr. Mizuguchi.

226
00:15:32.195 --> 00:15:34.495
Are you all right?

227
00:15:34.495 --> 00:15:35.695
Yes.

228
00:15:35.695 --> 00:15:38.995
I'm sorry for troubling everyone at this contest.

229
00:15:38.995 --> 00:15:42.095
It's not your fault, Mr. Mizuguchi.

230
00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:48.995
Mr. Okuda.

231
00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.495
As a result of the judges discussing this matter,

232
00:15:51.495 --> 00:15:53.595
because of obstructing another,

233
00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:55.595
your win has been cancelled.

234
00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:57.595
What? Obstructing another?

235
00:15:57.595 --> 00:16:01.295
I was just desperately trying to win the race.

236
00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:03.495
Please discuss it over again.

237
00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:06.295
The result will be the same no matter how many times we talk it over.

238
00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:12.795
So, Mr. Okuda, please come to the police station with me.

239
00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:14.195
No.

240
00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:24.395
Hey, Sonoko.

241
00:16:24.395 --> 00:16:25.595
What's the matter?

242
00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:28.495
Please wait a while, will you, Officer?

243
00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.495
Don't take him to the police station yet.

244
00:16:30.495 --> 00:16:31.795
Why not?

245
00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:34.195
I'm telling you that the person that's going to be arrested is not him

246
00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:36.795
but someone else.

247
00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:39.695
Who are you talking about?

248
00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:43.295
It's the pathetic husband of the victim.

249
00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:47.095
Right, Mr. Shingo Mizuguchi?

250
00:16:48.795 --> 00:16:52.495
Just what the heck are you talking about?

251
00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:53.695
Mr. Hasegawa said that

252
00:16:53.695 --> 00:16:57.695
yesterday night you stayed to tune your hot air balloon up

253
00:16:57.695 --> 00:16:59.995
and was the last one to leave.

254
00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:06.895
"Mizuguchi"

255
00:17:13.295 --> 00:17:14.995
"Okuda"

256
00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:20.395
That's when you broke the basket of Mr. Okuda's hot air balloon

257
00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:22.795
and took out the rattan, correct?

258
00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:29.295
Then you provoked Mr. Okuda before the race began

259
00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:32.095
so that he would bump into you, didn't you?

260
00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:33.295
If he didn't come at you,

261
00:17:33.295 --> 00:17:35.995
I guess you were planning to bump into him from your side.

262
00:17:35.995 --> 00:17:39.795
Why would I have to do something like that?

263
00:17:39.795 --> 00:17:42.795
When Ran saw your hot air balloon in the air,

264
00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:46.495
she said she thought she saw only one person in it.

265
00:17:46.495 --> 00:17:48.095
But, when she looked the second time around,

266
00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:49.795
she saw two people.

267
00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:53.095
Of course! There were two of us riding.

268
00:17:53.095 --> 00:17:56.395
It's true, there were two of you riding.

269
00:17:56.395 --> 00:18:01.195
But the person we saw while flying was not Arisa.

270
00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:02.195
At that time,

271
00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:05.795
Arisa was made to sit at the bottom of the basket.

272
00:18:06.895 --> 00:18:09.695
When we saw your hot air balloon at the river bank,

273
00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:12.795
the bag that you put the rope that is needed for the people down here

274
00:18:12.795 --> 00:18:16.395
to pull the hot air balloon along upon landing was there

275
00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:20.395
but the other bag that you needed to put important things was missing.

276
00:18:20.395 --> 00:18:24.995
And there were blood stains on the inside of the basket.

277
00:18:24.995 --> 00:18:29.595
We thought at first that it were the stains of when you got hurt.

278
00:18:29.595 --> 00:18:33.995
Those blood stains were probably those of your wife, Arisa.

279
00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:36.195
True. According to the forensic officers,

280
00:18:36.195 --> 00:18:37.795
it was the victim's blood.

281
00:18:37.795 --> 00:18:40.695
In other words, when Arisa was riding the hot air balloon,

282
00:18:40.695 --> 00:18:43.395
she was already hurt.

283
00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:52.495
When Mr. Okuda's hot air balloon hit yours,

284
00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:56.495
you had your arm around Arisa's body, didn't you?

285
00:18:56.495 --> 00:19:01.495
I was desperately trying to protect Arisa inside the unstable basket!

286
00:19:01.495 --> 00:19:03.695
No, that's not it.

287
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.895
Watch out! They'll crash!

288
00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:14.695
After you opened the exhaust valve and lowered the altitude,

289
00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:17.195
you were desperately trying to hold Arisa

290
00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:20.095
who was standing beside you from floating up.

291
00:19:20.095 --> 00:19:22.595
Why? Because that was not Arisa

292
00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:25.795
but a light doll that you had inflated by putting air into it.

293
00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:29.095
And after you landed on the ground,

294
00:19:29.095 --> 00:19:30.795
in order to get rid of the evidence,

295
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.495
you burned the doll together with the hot air balloon.

296
00:19:33.495 --> 00:19:36.995
If you keep this up, I'm going to sue you for slander!

297
00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:39.095
Listen, it was an accident!

298
00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:42.995
Rather, if it were not an accident, Okuda's to blame for it!

299
00:19:42.995 --> 00:19:45.995
What a poor loser.

300
00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:48.895
Now, let's get to the root of the matter.

301
00:19:50.295 --> 00:19:51.895
You lowered the altitude of your hot air balloon

302
00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:56.195
and when it was out of view from everyone, you...

303
00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:03.695
Threw Arisa who was fainted out of the basket.

304
00:20:12.595 --> 00:20:17.195
You killed Arisa who completely trusted you.

305
00:20:17.195 --> 00:20:20.695
-Is it true? -You're not serious, are you?

306
00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:21.895
It's a lie!

307
00:20:21.895 --> 00:20:23.795
It's all nonsense!

308
00:20:23.795 --> 00:20:25.995
Where do you have such evidence?

309
00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.495
Now, please!

310
00:20:41.495 --> 00:20:45.395
Look at the burnt remains on the top part of the hot air balloon.

311
00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:46.595
If you take a good look,

312
00:20:46.595 --> 00:20:50.495
there's a vinyl that looks like the hand of a doll, right?

313
00:20:52.395 --> 00:20:54.295
And this too!

314
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:58.995
It was on the ground about 300 meters from the starting point.

315
00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:01.395
The content is a fire extinguisher.

316
00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:04.795
I think it'll match the wound on the back of Arisa's head.

317
00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:10.995
I couldn't help it.

318
00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:14.995
The stocks that I bought with the money a client entrusted me with

319
00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:16.995
took a plunge.

320
00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:18.795
And I had to return it as soon as possible

321
00:21:18.795 --> 00:21:22.095
or next month is audit month.

322
00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:25.995
That's why you were blinded by your wife's insurance money?

323
00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:28.895
It's too stupid to even get upset over it.

324
00:21:28.895 --> 00:21:33.295
Just to think you would kill a person for money!

325
00:21:33.295 --> 00:21:37.595
Go cool your head off behind bars.

326
00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:39.195
You inhuman jerk!

327
00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:47.595
Mr. Mizuguchi, please come to the police station with me.

328
00:23:20.695 --> 00:23:22.595
Just a expected of a Deduction Queen!

329
00:23:22.595 --> 00:23:26.695
Sonoko, you were awesome.

330
00:23:26.695 --> 00:23:28.395
You think so?

331
00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:30.595
You're so good at deduction

332
00:23:30.595 --> 00:23:33.795
and yet I wonder why it doesn't apply to other things.

333
00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:35.895
None of you business.

334
00:23:35.895 --> 00:23:37.495
Besides, when you deduce,

335
00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:40.395
why do you fall asleep like my dad?

336
00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:42.895
I wonder.

337
00:23:42.895 --> 00:23:45.795
If it's an inherited trait, you're the one who should fall asleep.

338
00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:48.495
It's not the genetic.

339
00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:50.895
All Pops and Sonoko are doing is sleeping

340
00:23:50.895 --> 00:23:52.895
and not deducing.

341
00:23:55.095 --> 00:23:57.095
It's the voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin).

342
00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:00.595
How beautiful.

343
00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:12.095
I wonder why it was swaying.

344
00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:14.195
It could've been the wind.

345
00:24:16.695 --> 00:24:18.395
It's the voice of Tengu.

346
00:24:19.095 --> 00:24:20.695
Next Conan,

347
00:24:20.695 --> 00:24:24.295
"Voice of Tengu (a long-nosed goblin)"

348
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:27.638
Next Conan's Hint:

349
00:24:27.638 --> 00:24:29.538
"Wind"

350
00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:31.538
You can count on me to solve any case.

351
00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:32.538
Maybe I overdid it this time?

352
00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:34.138
Sonoko's become conceited.
