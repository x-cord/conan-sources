1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.266
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.866
Today it's an overnight stay at an inn for training.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.566
Ayumi and Genta disappear!

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.266
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.004 --> 00:02:00.004
"The Disappearance of the Youth Detective Squad"

9
00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.504
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Series of thievery at inns.

10
00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:08.004
The guests and managers have suffered losses.

11
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.004
How dangerous.

12
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.804
But, well, it's larceny that doesn't use any brains.

13
00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:17.604
I guess there's no reason for a great detective to make an appearance.

14
00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.904
Gosh, dad.

15
00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.904
But the way, I don't see that Conan around,

16
00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:27.204
is he still in dreamland?

17
00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:30.504
If it's Conan, he's gone to training camp!

18
00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:33.004
The neighborhood's children's club.

19
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:34.604
What's that?

20
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.904
The children's club will be putting on a puppet show.

21
00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:42.104
A puppet show? A training camp?

22
00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:45.304
Yes. At an inn on the Kiriga-oka Highlands.

23
00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:49.204
He's staying over with the other children to practice.

24
00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:51.604
Which means...

25
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.304
that Youth Detective Squad is with him too.

26
00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:57.704
-But I wonder if it's safe? -What is?

27
00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:01.804
The thievery at inns that was in the newspapers!

28
00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:04.004
There's nothing to worry about!

29
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.804
It's a totally different area.

30
00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:08.604
But, Kirigaoka Highlands is famous

31
00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:12.604
for the heavy fog that sets in at night.

32
00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:13.604
Well...

33
00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:15.604
"Okkatakahara Sasayuki Village" -What if they get lost?

34
00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:18.604
There's an adult with them, isn't there?

35
00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:21.804
There is. A person who lives in Sanchome named Kaifu.

36
00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:25.304
"Hajime Kaifu (28)" -It seems he did puppet plays when he was a student.

37
00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.304
He's taking care of the script

38
00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:29.904
and acting at the children's club this time.

39
00:03:32.404 --> 00:03:35.004
Good grief, Dad.

40
00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:36.204
Let's see...

41
00:03:36.204 --> 00:03:39.504
That's strange. Another person has disappeared.

42
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.804
Wait...

43
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:47.204
Genta! There are no feelings in that dialogue at all, is there?

44
00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:48.604
Is that right?

45
00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.604
Yes, Genta one more time!

46
00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:54.004
That's strange. Another person has disappeared!

47
00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:56.304
And next, Ayumi's dialogue.

48
00:03:56.304 --> 00:03:57.804
Let's see...

49
00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:00.204
What's this all about?

50
00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:04.504
He's acting big, that Mitsuhiko.

51
00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:06.704
Next, it's your turn, Conan!

52
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:09.704
What? Let's see.

53
00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:13.604
The murderer is definitely in here.

54
00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.404
A high school student doing a puppet play.

55
00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:22.204
I shouldn't have come like Haibara.

56
00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:25.004
I have no interest in those things.

57
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:28.204
Darn it! I envy that character!

58
00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:30.904
Conan, that's no good!

59
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.604
You're supposed to be playing the role of a detective.

60
00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:36.504
Put more force into the dialogue.

61
00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:38.904
Isn't that right, Teacher Kaifu?

62
00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.504
Mitsuhiko, let's not call me a teacher.

63
00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:44.204
This is my first time producing too.

64
00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:47.004
But Conan's role is...

65
00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:49.804
You're definitely right.

66
00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:52.704
Conan, can we try it again?

67
00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:54.904
Yes.

68
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:58.804
The murderer is definitely in here!

69
00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:03.504
The movement of the puppet isn't quite right.

70
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:06.604
Gosh. That Mitsuhiko... What's he all so gung-ho about?

71
00:05:06.604 --> 00:05:10.404
That Mr. Kaifu moved into Mitsuhiko's neighborhood.

72
00:05:10.404 --> 00:05:12.704
They quickly became friends.

73
00:05:12.704 --> 00:05:16.304
He even let him help make this story.

74
00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:20.504
But if I'm not mistaken, this is...

75
00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:23.604
And, no one was left.

76
00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:25.104
A kind of mystery.

77
00:05:25.104 --> 00:05:28.104
Anybody can see that

78
00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:29.604
it's been taken from Agetha Christie's famous novel.

79
00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:30.704
I know the story!

80
00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:32.804
People are invited to an island.

81
00:05:32.804 --> 00:05:35.404
And they're killed off one by one.

82
00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:39.504
Rather than that, I'm hungry.

83
00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:42.404
Oh, Genta.

84
00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:43.804
All right.

85
00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:45.504
Then... let's call it quits for now!

86
00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:48.704
One hour later, after dinner, let's try it again.

87
00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:50.304
-Yes! -Yes!

88
00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:51.904
Gather the puppets together

89
00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.204
so they won't get lost.

90
00:05:53.204 --> 00:05:54.704
-Yes! -Yes!

91
00:05:55.904 --> 00:05:58.304
Great.

92
00:05:58.304 --> 00:05:59.704
Dinner time...

93
00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:02.504
Grilled eel with rice!

94
00:06:02.504 --> 00:06:04.504
That Genta.

95
00:06:04.504 --> 00:06:06.204
Conan, great job!

96
00:06:06.204 --> 00:06:07.204
Well...

97
00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:08.704
Pardon me.

98
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.004
Everybody still has a long way to go.

99
00:06:13.004 --> 00:06:14.604
Hard practice is necessary!

100
00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:17.704
-What? -Hard practice...

101
00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:19.404
Good grief.

102
00:06:24.404 --> 00:06:26.104
What a thick fog.

103
00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:30.004
I guess that's why it's called Kirigaoka Highlands.

104
00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:32.004
Just great... I'm full!

105
00:06:32.004 --> 00:06:34.404
It's no good. I can't move an inch!

106
00:06:34.404 --> 00:06:38.504
Everyone! Rest 30 minutes and it's practice again!

107
00:06:38.504 --> 00:06:40.504
Practice? Practice again?

108
00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:43.404
Mitsuhiko! Give us a break!

109
00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:46.904
But there's a midnight snack prepared too, Genta.

110
00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:48.904
What! I'll do it...

111
00:06:48.904 --> 00:06:50.904
Let's go! Hurry up!

112
00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:00.704
Everybody.

113
00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:02.904
Has someone seen the teacher around?

114
00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:04.504
What's the matter?

115
00:07:04.504 --> 00:07:06.404
Well... something's wrong.

116
00:07:06.404 --> 00:07:08.804
He suddenly disappeared.

117
00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:10.904
It's already time to practice.

118
00:07:10.904 --> 00:07:14.604
Come to think of it. The Sanchome guys aren't around either.

119
00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:15.704
You're right.

120
00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:16.904
I wonder where they've gone.

121
00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:18.604
This is a problem.

122
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.104
Hey, have you seen them?

123
00:07:21.104 --> 00:07:22.604
Nope.

124
00:07:25.204 --> 00:07:26.904
Just as I thought.

125
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.204
The dolls are missing too!

126
00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:29.904
Those belonging to the Sanchome kids.

127
00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:31.804
What? You're right.

128
00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:34.304
The teacher is gone too!

129
00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:37.804
Hey... This is just like...

130
00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:41.904
Those Sanchome kids probably took it along with them.

131
00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:43.304
But, where?

132
00:07:43.304 --> 00:07:46.504
Well... maybe they went home?

133
00:07:46.504 --> 00:07:48.004
At this hour?

134
00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:50.104
In this fog?

135
00:07:54.504 --> 00:07:56.304
Someone's outside.

136
00:08:01.804 --> 00:08:03.104
It's no good!

137
00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:05.004
I can't see anything with this fog.

138
00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:13.504
No mistake about it!

139
00:08:13.504 --> 00:08:16.004
Someone was here.

140
00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:18.904
What? Even those kids are gone!

141
00:08:18.904 --> 00:08:20.104
What?

142
00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:30.404
Their dolls are gone too!

143
00:08:30.404 --> 00:08:33.504
Only ours are left!

144
00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:37.204
Darn it. This is a bad joke.

145
00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:39.404
And, no one was left.

146
00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:41.004
It's exactly the same.

147
00:08:41.004 --> 00:08:46.004
Is that the story this puppet play is based on?

148
00:08:46.004 --> 00:08:49.404
Yes. In the original story,

149
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.304
the characters get killed off one by one.

150
00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:55.804
And the dolls disappear as each person gets killed.

151
00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:58.304
As they get killed off...

152
00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.104
You got to be kidding!

153
00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:02.204
Then...

154
00:09:02.204 --> 00:09:05.704
All the children who have disappeared have been...

155
00:09:05.704 --> 00:09:07.104
You're joking.

156
00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:09.804
Calm down! We don't know for sure about that yet!

157
00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:12.104
The backdoor!

158
00:09:17.304 --> 00:09:19.304
The fog is heavy over here too.

159
00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:22.104
It's the footprints of those children, isn't it?

160
00:09:22.104 --> 00:09:25.704
There's one more pair. Those of an adult.

161
00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:27.504
Whose are they?

162
00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:30.304
Could it be from that guy who was at the window?

163
00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:31.304
No.

164
00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:35.404
The size and kind of shoe from those prints are different.

165
00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:37.304
Then who?

166
00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:40.004
The person at the managing office said that

167
00:09:40.004 --> 00:09:43.904
this is the only inn with guests today.

168
00:09:43.904 --> 00:09:45.404
Which means...

169
00:09:46.504 --> 00:09:47.704
I don't know.

170
00:09:47.704 --> 00:09:51.604
But, there's no doubt that there's something going on

171
00:09:51.604 --> 00:09:52.904
in this foggy lodging area.

172
00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:55.004
Something.

173
00:09:55.004 --> 00:09:56.704
I know!

174
00:09:56.704 --> 00:09:59.704
What? What do you know?

175
00:09:59.704 --> 00:10:03.304
It's the doing of that thief who raids inn!

176
00:10:03.304 --> 00:10:06.304
You mean the one that's in the news lately.

177
00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:08.404
That's right.

178
00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:09.904
There's no mistake about it.

179
00:10:09.904 --> 00:10:12.704
He's probably locked everyone up somewhere.

180
00:10:12.704 --> 00:10:17.404
In the meantime, he's planning to raid all the inns in the area!

181
00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:19.504
So, that's it.

182
00:10:19.504 --> 00:10:21.404
Okay! If that's the case,

183
00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:26.304
the Youth Detective Squad is going to snag that thief!

184
00:10:26.304 --> 00:10:27.904
Agree!

185
00:10:27.904 --> 00:10:30.804
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to move into action!

186
00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:33.604
All right. Let's do it!

187
00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:36.804
What's the matter, Conan?

188
00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:40.404
Nothing.

189
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:43.104
But if it's a thief,

190
00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:44.804
putting the kids aside,

191
00:10:44.804 --> 00:10:48.204
why did he take the dolls?

192
00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:49.804
This is full of things I can't understand!

193
00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:51.104
Darn it!

194
00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:54.004
Anyway...

195
00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:57.304
It's best that we contact the police.

196
00:10:58.604 --> 00:11:00.504
It won't be too late for the Youth Detective Squad

197
00:11:00.504 --> 00:11:03.504
to make its appearance after that.

198
00:11:03.504 --> 00:11:04.604
What?

199
00:11:06.004 --> 00:11:08.104
Conan, what's the matter?

200
00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:09.704
Can't you get hold of them?

201
00:11:09.704 --> 00:11:12.704
The phone's dead.

202
00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:15.804
With this,

203
00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:19.404
we've been completely locked up in this fog.

204
00:11:24.104 --> 00:11:26.404
Conan, what are you going to do?

205
00:11:26.404 --> 00:11:28.304
There should be someone

206
00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:29.904
at the management office over the hill.

207
00:11:29.904 --> 00:11:31.304
Are you planning to go there?

208
00:11:31.304 --> 00:11:32.804
Yes.

209
00:11:32.804 --> 00:11:34.204
That's strange.

210
00:11:34.204 --> 00:11:37.504
Weren't there a flashlight and candles around?

211
00:11:37.504 --> 00:11:39.604
Yes. When we got here,

212
00:11:39.604 --> 00:11:42.304
we checked out the emergency exits and saw them.

213
00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:43.804
They are not there?

214
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:47.604
Yes. Somebody probably took them.

215
00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:49.804
Somebody? Who?

216
00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:51.204
Geez, Genta.

217
00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:54.004
Who else would it be but the thief!

218
00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:56.804
No. We can't be sure of that yet.

219
00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:59.904
But at this rate, we'd get lost even more

220
00:11:59.904 --> 00:12:01.804
if we tried to get to a nearby inn.

221
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:06.704
Anyway, let's try to find some leads in this inn.

222
00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:08.904
Can't count on that too much.

223
00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:16.104
Let's go, Conan!

224
00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:19.904
Ayumi, stay here with Genta.

225
00:12:19.904 --> 00:12:22.504
Can't be helped.

226
00:12:22.504 --> 00:12:24.304
Genta! Take care of Ayumi.

227
00:12:24.304 --> 00:12:25.504
Okay!

228
00:12:25.504 --> 00:12:27.904
Be careful, Conan, Mitsuhiko.

229
00:12:27.904 --> 00:12:29.404
Just leave it to us!

230
00:12:43.604 --> 00:12:46.004
This is Mr. Kaifu's room.

231
00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:47.504
Shall we try going in?

232
00:12:53.704 --> 00:12:55.104
What's this?

233
00:12:57.804 --> 00:13:00.204
It's a map of this area.

234
00:13:00.204 --> 00:13:04.104
Inns here and there are marked.

235
00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:07.904
What's this supposed to mean?

236
00:13:13.604 --> 00:13:15.204
What's this?

237
00:13:15.204 --> 00:13:17.704
Could it be...

238
00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:19.704
You're kidding.

239
00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:22.104
Teacher Kaifu is...

240
00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:26.304
-Genta! -Ayumi!

241
00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:32.904
Genta! Ayumi!

242
00:13:32.904 --> 00:13:34.604
Where are you?

243
00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:36.304
This is...

244
00:13:36.304 --> 00:13:39.404
What's the matter, Conan...

245
00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:41.504
You're kidding.

246
00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:47.004
We're the only one left.

247
00:13:47.004 --> 00:13:49.904
I got it...

248
00:13:49.904 --> 00:13:52.004
The teacher...

249
00:13:52.004 --> 00:13:54.904
That Teacher Kaifu is the thief that's raiding the inns.

250
00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:58.104
The proof is that map and that tool box!

251
00:14:01.604 --> 00:14:04.004
To raid the inns at Kirigaoka,

252
00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:07.004
he used this puppet play practice as a coverup.

253
00:14:07.004 --> 00:14:09.304
He even fooled us.

254
00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:11.704
I can't forgive him.

255
00:14:11.704 --> 00:14:13.704
Mitsuhiko, wait a minute!

256
00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:15.104
Not only the children have disappeared,

257
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.004
but the dolls as well.

258
00:14:17.004 --> 00:14:20.104
I don't think it's just a simple burglary.

259
00:14:20.104 --> 00:14:22.404
Conan, you're over-thinking this one!

260
00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.804
In the first place, Teacher Kaifu is the only one

261
00:14:24.804 --> 00:14:27.104
who can take the dolls out!

262
00:14:27.104 --> 00:14:28.704
That's true, but...

263
00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:32.904
Anyway, all we can do is try to find Genta, Ayumi and the others.

264
00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:34.404
That's right!

265
00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:36.404
And, we're going to catch the criminal!

266
00:14:36.404 --> 00:14:38.704
-What? -With our own hands.

267
00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:55.894
The next inn was in this direction, wasn't it?

268
00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.394
Yes.

269
00:14:57.394 --> 00:14:59.294
That is...

270
00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:02.894
I think this is too near to be the next inn.

271
00:15:02.894 --> 00:15:04.894
Let's try going anyway!

272
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:13.494
Everyone!

273
00:15:17.594 --> 00:15:18.694
Mr. Kaifu!

274
00:15:18.694 --> 00:15:19.894
Oh, no!

275
00:15:25.994 --> 00:15:28.894
It's him. It's him after all.

276
00:15:39.394 --> 00:15:41.894
Where's everyone?

277
00:15:43.994 --> 00:15:45.894
We're going in. Hurry!

278
00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:50.894
No one's here.

279
00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:56.694
It's no good.

280
00:15:58.294 --> 00:15:59.594
I'll go check out the second floor!

281
00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.594
-Conan. -Stay here!

282
00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:07.094
Please make it quick.

283
00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:15.094
Conan!

284
00:16:15.094 --> 00:16:16.494
Mitsuhiko.

285
00:16:23.494 --> 00:16:24.494
What?

286
00:16:24.494 --> 00:16:27.594
Conan! What's the matter?

287
00:16:36.094 --> 00:16:38.994
What are you trying to do?

288
00:16:38.994 --> 00:16:40.994
Conan?

289
00:16:40.994 --> 00:16:44.694
Run! Mitsuhiko, run!

290
00:16:47.294 --> 00:16:48.794
Conan?

291
00:16:52.494 --> 00:16:53.894
You're kidding.

292
00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:55.594
Conan too.

293
00:16:55.594 --> 00:16:56.994
Well...

294
00:16:56.994 --> 00:17:01.194
And, you're the only one that was left right, Mitsuhiko?

295
00:17:02.294 --> 00:17:06.694
You're joking...

296
00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:13.194
Somebody!

297
00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:18.894
Help me!

298
00:17:18.894 --> 00:17:22.194
There's no use in running, Mitsuhiko!

299
00:17:35.194 --> 00:17:38.694
All right. Come with me, Mitsuhiko!

300
00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.794
Don't come...

301
00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:44.394
Don't play the spoiled kid, Mitsuhiko.

302
00:17:54.294 --> 00:17:55.594
Come.

303
00:18:12.794 --> 00:18:14.894
-Hurry! -Oh, no...

304
00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:16.494
Terrible...

305
00:18:21.094 --> 00:18:23.394
Geez, thanks.

306
00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:25.094
Conan?

307
00:18:25.094 --> 00:18:26.494
Everyone?

308
00:18:30.094 --> 00:18:32.794
Then this is...

309
00:18:32.794 --> 00:18:34.794
Mitsuhiko, sorry about that.

310
00:18:34.794 --> 00:18:38.494
We were practicing the puppet play.

311
00:18:38.494 --> 00:18:41.694
I had each person come one by one to the inn.

312
00:18:41.694 --> 00:18:44.494
You're kidding. I didn't hear anything about it.

313
00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:48.994
Sorry about that. I forgot to tell you four about it.

314
00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:53.194
Then, what were those pliers and screwdrivers for in your room?

315
00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:57.494
I thought of making some simple stage installations.

316
00:18:57.494 --> 00:18:58.594
I wanted all of you

317
00:18:58.594 --> 00:19:01.294
to get the atmosphere of drama as quick as possible.

318
00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:04.194
Then what about that map?

319
00:19:04.194 --> 00:19:06.894
Of course. It's so we wouldn't get lost here.

320
00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:10.494
I heard that the fog was really thick around here.

321
00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:12.194
Is that what it was all about?

322
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:13.494
Those dolls that disappeared were,

323
00:19:13.494 --> 00:19:16.894
of course, used for the practice.

324
00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:19.394
Mitsuhiko. I bet it really scared you, didn't it?

325
00:19:19.394 --> 00:19:22.494
Genta, you were just as scared.

326
00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.094
What? Not really.

327
00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:28.694
But, when we were doing voice training.

328
00:19:28.694 --> 00:19:30.794
You thought we looked like we were tied up.

329
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:34.094
But we really thought you were.

330
00:19:34.094 --> 00:19:35.494
Isn't that right, Conan?

331
00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:37.394
Mitsuhiko, I'm sorry.

332
00:19:37.394 --> 00:19:40.494
Even I scared you in the end.

333
00:19:40.494 --> 00:19:42.294
Actually, at that time...

334
00:19:42.294 --> 00:19:44.294
Run! Mitsuhiko, run!

335
00:19:44.294 --> 00:19:46.494
Calm down, Conan.

336
00:19:47.894 --> 00:19:49.694
All of you...

337
00:19:49.694 --> 00:19:51.894
Is that what this is all about!

338
00:19:51.894 --> 00:19:54.394
Mitsuhiko is the only one left.

339
00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:56.594
Everyone, continue practicing.

340
00:19:56.594 --> 00:19:58.794
Wait!

341
00:19:58.794 --> 00:20:02.094
That guy was acting big all day today,

342
00:20:02.094 --> 00:20:04.394
so, let's scare him a bit!

343
00:20:04.394 --> 00:20:06.994
I think that's being too mean?

344
00:20:06.994 --> 00:20:10.994
But it may be good drama practice.

345
00:20:10.994 --> 00:20:14.794
Hey... What are these guys doing anyway?

346
00:20:14.794 --> 00:20:17.094
You're kidding. Even you, Ayumi.

347
00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:18.894
It's a shock!

348
00:20:23.494 --> 00:20:27.794
Mr. Kaifu, why did you cut the telephone lines?

349
00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:30.694
What are you talking about?

350
00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.594
Teacher, wasn't it you?

351
00:20:32.594 --> 00:20:34.194
What does it mean?

352
00:20:34.194 --> 00:20:37.594
If it wasn't the teacher, who'd do a thing like that?

353
00:20:37.594 --> 00:20:39.094
Could it be?

354
00:20:40.494 --> 00:20:41.594
Mitsuhiko!

355
00:20:41.594 --> 00:20:44.494
-Let's go! -Mitsuhiko!

356
00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.494
-A real thief? -You saw me!

357
00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:48.694
Help!

358
00:20:48.694 --> 00:20:50.594
Mitsuhiko!

359
00:20:50.594 --> 00:20:52.294
Help!

360
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:53.894
Mitsuhiko!

361
00:20:53.894 --> 00:20:57.494
Conan. Everyone!

362
00:20:57.494 --> 00:20:58.694
Then the one who cut the phone lines

363
00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:00.894
and took the flashlights...

364
00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:03.494
Right. It's his doing.

365
00:21:03.494 --> 00:21:07.794
-The work of a real thief. -Help me!

366
00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:10.094
Don't come!

367
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:12.194
Don't you care what happens to him?

368
00:21:12.194 --> 00:21:13.794
Everyone! Never mind me.

369
00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:15.694
Get this guy!

370
00:21:15.694 --> 00:21:17.994
Mitsuhiko!

371
00:21:17.994 --> 00:21:19.294
Don't make noise!

372
00:21:19.294 --> 00:21:20.494
Be quiet...

373
00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:31.294
You brat!

374
00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.294
Let's get him!

375
00:21:37.294 --> 00:21:38.694
-Yes! -Yes!

376
00:21:43.494 --> 00:21:44.794
We did it!

377
00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:46.494
That was a close call!

378
00:21:46.494 --> 00:21:48.194
Dangerous...

379
00:21:48.194 --> 00:21:49.594
I'm saved.

380
00:21:49.594 --> 00:21:51.894
Conan, close your eyes a bit.

381
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:53.594
What?

382
00:21:53.594 --> 00:21:55.494
Close your eyes tightly.

383
00:21:55.494 --> 00:21:58.194
Mitsuhiko! I'm sorry about that comment a while ago.

384
00:21:58.194 --> 00:21:59.494
You really impressed me.

385
00:22:00.794 --> 00:22:04.294
Geez, I don't care if I die.

386
00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:07.294
Mitsuhiko! I won't forgive you!

387
00:22:07.294 --> 00:22:09.994
Please stop it, Genta!

388
00:22:09.994 --> 00:22:11.694
How dare you!

389
00:23:40.394 --> 00:23:43.394
Three day later, the town's Children's Club was held.

390
00:23:43.394 --> 00:23:46.294
Our puppet play was performed.

391
00:23:55.794 --> 00:23:57.694
The result is, of course...

392
00:23:57.694 --> 00:23:59.394
A great success!

00:24:03.594 --> 00:24:06.194

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.494
Spider mansion!

395
00:24:15.394 --> 00:24:17.594
A thumbtack.

396
00:24:17.594 --> 00:24:20.694
The surface is rusty but the needle is new.

397
00:24:20.694 --> 00:24:24.194
But dad said not to leave the room.

398
00:24:24.194 --> 00:24:26.094
Pops, wake up!

399
00:24:26.094 --> 00:24:28.094
Ran is in danger!

400
00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:29.394
