1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,870
Since the murdered victim

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,070
was found holding the scissors that Dr. Agasa invented,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,470
I, as well as Mr. Subaru Okiya accompanied him

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,370
to the scene of the crime.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,370
Was the water left running

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,370
from the faucet in the bathroom, by any chance?

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,970
Yes, it seems so.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,870
But how did you know?

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,170
Mr. Akai.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,770
Is there something to this case?

11
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,370
You've already realized too, haven't you, sonny?

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,170
It resembles the Koji Haneda murder

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,670
that occurred 17 years ago to a tee.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,270
Furthermore, when the body

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,970
was being carried out past us.

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,970
Sweet...

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,870
Scent.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,370
There seems to have been some gooey substance

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,570
like honey on the wound of the body for some reason.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,970
The scissors that the victim was holding,

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,270
the cup that fell to the floor and cracked.

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,770
The scent of honey that was on the corpse,

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,270
the faucet with the water running.

24
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,770
How did the perp kill Mr. Hiyama?

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,070
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,370
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,370
Scissors, a cup and sweet honey.

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,670
A variety of evidence ties it all together.

29
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,970
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:17,928
"The Same Crime Scene as 17 Years Ago (Part 2)"

33
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,628
But this sure is an odd case.

34
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,528
The victim was killed holding scissors

35
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:29,128
and honey was on the wound of the corpse

36
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:31,928
and on top of that, the faucet

37
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,428
was left with water running from it, right?

38
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,528
Even if Mr. Senba, who didn't have a murder weapon on him

39
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:39,728
is not the perp,

40
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:43,628
how on earth did the perp make it into this annex

41
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:46,028
with iron bars on all its windows?

42
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,628
Wrong.

43
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,328
The perp...

44
00:03:58,328 --> 00:03:59,928
Is...

45
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:03,128
"Kazunori Senba (50), Former Candy Shop Owner" -Mr. Senba.

46
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:06,128
Really?

47
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:09,728
Yes, we know how he committed the murder.

48
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,628
But we still haven't found the murder weapon.

49
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:14,728
Hey.

50
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:18,528
You men frisked Mr. Senba, didn't you?

51
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:20,928
Yeah.

52
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,928
Back then didn't Mr. Senba have anything strange on him?

53
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:26,628
Something strange?

54
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:29,228
Right, he had a small figurine

55
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,928
about this size in a plastic bag.

56
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:35,128
Yeah. Together with a small catalog

57
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:37,228
with the series of that figurine in it.

58
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:38,728
He said it was a freebie from one of the candies

59
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,228
and that he was going to give it to his grandchild as a gift.

60
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:45,028
It seems that the shop is already gone, though.

61
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,828
Nothing else?

62
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,828
No, all he had were a wallet, a handkerchief and a key.

63
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:53,028
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:56,928
a colored ball that I used to buy frequently at a candy shop

65
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:59,128
when I was a child came flying.

66
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,828
A colored ball?

67
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:05,328
Yeah. A little before Mr. Senba showed up,

68
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,828
a yellow one about this size came flying.

69
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,528
I gave it over to the police detective, though.

70
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,628
Since a park

71
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:12,928
is on the other side of this fence,

72
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:16,528
maybe a child was playing baseball or something.

73
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:19,628
Nobody came to get the ball, though.

74
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:22,928
About that ball, do you know which direction it came flying from?

75
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:26,828
Yes, since I heard something hit the roof,

76
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,028
I went farther inside towards the annex.

77
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,428
If I remember correctly, I found it rolling just about here.

78
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:35,628
At that time, did both of you leave the entrance?

79
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,828
No, only I did.

80
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,928
Did you find anything besides the colored ball?

81
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:42,528
No, just that one ball.

82
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:48,428
Sir, this small window isn't barred.

83
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:49,828
Where does this lead to?

84
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:51,028
To the restroom.

85
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,228
That's on the opposite side

86
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,428
of the changing room with the corridor between it.

87
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:58,028
Well, there are no bars on this window

88
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:01,928
because even a child couldn't make it through, a window so small.

89
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:07,828
A slipper that stepped on the shards of a cup,

90
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,728
honey that was found on the wound,

91
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,528
a colored ball that hit the roof.

92
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,628
A catalog and a figurine that was in a plastic bag,

93
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,628
the small window of the restroom.

94
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,028
Come to think of it...

95
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,228
the sound was quite loud though,

96
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:27,528
like clank-clank, despite it being a colored ball.

97
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,228
Don't... don't tell me that...

98
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:32,528
He put the murder weapon in there?

99
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,628
Doc!

100
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:38,828
Is something the matter?

101
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:42,928
Oh, no... Well...

102
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,228
It's no big deal really but...

103
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:46,628
See... see that.

104
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,828
Ants...

105
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,428
Ants are moving in a line.

106
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:57,128
That surprised me, you see.

107
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,728
But Doc, you have a lot of illustrated encyclopedias

108
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,528
of insects and such, don't you?

109
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,528
Well, that's true, but...

110
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,128
In photos, it's easy to view them

111
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:13,728
as cute little insects,

112
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,828
but actually seeing them moving around

113
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,728
it's a different story, you see.

114
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:21,028
If it's inside, it's a different story?

115
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,728
Hey, sonny, come over here.

116
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:28,828
I guess we've found the murder weapon...

117
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:31,628
we were looking for.

118
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,428
What?

119
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,228
You've figured out who the perp is and the trick he used?

120
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,928
Is it true, Dr. Agasa?

121
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:49,628
Well, rather, it's these two that figured it out, you see.

122
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,428
Yes, we've figured it out.

123
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,628
Yep.

124
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,828
How Mr. Senba brought

125
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:57,528
the blunt murder weapon into this annex.

126
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,228
Come on, I explained it to you already, didn't I?

127
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:05,328
That they frisked me before I came into this annex.

128
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:06,528
Hey, you guys,

129
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,128
I didn't have any blunt object on me back then, did I?

130
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:10,928
-Well, no. -Same here.

131
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:14,628
But he had a plastic bag with a figurine

132
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:19,028
and a small catalog of the series of it in the bag, right?

133
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,028
So... so what?

134
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,828
If so, you would've had to have that too,

135
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:26,028
but why didn't you have it?

136
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:28,228
Just what is that supposed to be.

137
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,828
The round plastic capsule.

138
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:33,928
Because what you had was the contents that were inside the capsule, right?

139
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:36,428
It seems that the catalog wasn't inside

140
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,528
the plastic bag together with the figurine either.

141
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:39,628
Oh, that?

142
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:43,828
I didn't need it so I threw it away somewhere.

143
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,028
Conan.

144
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:47,028
Here, I went and bought what you asked for,

145
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:49,028
the capsule toy, honey,

146
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,228
the colored ball and a big marble.

147
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:56,128
But did the perp really use these things?

148
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:59,228
Yep. First, you open the capsule.

149
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,728
And with the tape that holding the two halves together,

150
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,728
cover the holes in the capsule.

151
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:10,128
Then, put the marble into the capsule

152
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:13,628
and pour honey on top of it.

153
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:16,928
Then you place the lid back on.

154
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,628
There, all done!

155
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:21,628
All done? What's all done?

156
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,228
Will you throw this capsule and colored ball

157
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,828
onto the roof of the restroom?

158
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:28,628
What? You want me to throw it?

159
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:29,928
Yep!

160
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,128
Okay.

161
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,128
Throw it so it gets on the roof!

162
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,328
Okay.

163
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:39,728
There!

164
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:45,728
What?

165
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,128
The colored ball came falling.

166
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:50,228
But the capsule hasn't come down yet.

167
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:53,628
Will you stay there a while and keep watch, Officer Takagi?

168
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,128
Okay.

169
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,928
Then, let's all go into the annex.

170
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:58,928
Yeah.

171
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:04,028
After being frisked and entering the annex,

172
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:05,928
what did you say you did?

173
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,928
Like I said.

174
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,928
I was waiting for Hiyama to come out and answer

175
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,728
but since he didn't, I took the liberty of entering on my own.

176
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,428
Rather, I think this is what you said to

177
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,128
Mr. Hiyama who came to the entrance.

178
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,128
That you wanted to use the restroom.

179
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,628
Use the restroom?

180
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:27,528
Yes. But of course, it wasn't because nature called him.

181
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,328
But rather to retrieve the murder weapon.

182
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,328
What?

183
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,795
At any rate, let's go to the restroom.

184
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,095
I guess it's about time it's arrived.

185
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,595
Arrived?

186
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:56,595
You'll see.

187
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,795
Opposite to the changing room where Mr. Hiyama was murdered,

188
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,995
is the restroom, and inside the toilet.

189
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,895
The small window below the wall.

190
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,695
Up ahead after you open it.

191
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:19,295
See, as you can see.

192
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,195
That's...

193
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,195
the capsule that Officer Takagi threw up on the roof a while ago.

194
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:27,395
Why is that capsule outside the small window

195
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,095
that you stretched your hand out to?

196
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,895
Did you hand it over to him, Officer Takagi?

197
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,895
No, I didn't do anything.

198
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,595
Then, how?

199
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,495
Inspector Megure, you saw a while ago yourself, right?

200
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:40,995
Velocity causes the colored ball to fall

201
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:43,895
if the roof is tilted.

202
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:46,695
But as to this capsule, even if you tilt it...

203
00:11:46,695 --> 00:11:49,895
See. It won't roll as much because the honey

204
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:51,695
is all over the marble ball.

205
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,795
I... I see.

206
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:58,295
So unlike the colored ball that fell right away,

207
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:02,695
it rolled slowly and went inside the downspout,

208
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:06,095
moving slowly

209
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,895
then fell all the way down like rainwater

210
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,895
and came out of the exit of the downspout.

211
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:15,195
The downspout is a bit tilted at the edge

212
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:18,295
so that rainwater flows easier.

213
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:21,195
Is... is that so, Officer Takagi?

214
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,595
Yes, sir!

215
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:26,495
After a while, it came out of here.

216
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,595
By the way, Mr. Senba threw the capsule in together

217
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,895
with the colored ball from outside the fence,

218
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,995
to camouflage the sound when it hit the roof.

219
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,195
If the bodyguard falls under the impression

220
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,695
that the sound was caused by the colored ball,

221
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,295
he would leave the place immediately.

222
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,895
But I wonder if you can kill somebody

223
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:48,795
using a marble ball like this?

224
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,995
If what he put in the capsule was not a marble ball

225
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:55,795
but a heavy iron ball and put it in his sock

226
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:58,195
to create a weapon called blackjack,

227
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,895
the ability to kill a person would extremely increase.

228
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:03,995
The fact that honey was found on Mr. Hiyama's head that was wounded

229
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:07,595
when he was struck with a blunt object is proof of it.

230
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,595
Right, Mr. Senba?

231
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:10,695
What...

232
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:11,995
What about the blood?

233
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:15,295
If I punched somebody so bad that he bled to death,

234
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,395
I would have gotten blood splattered on me too, isn't it?

235
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:21,395
But there's no blood anywhere on my clothes.

236
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:24,095
Didn't you get naked in the restroom?

237
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,395
It looked as if you hurried and put your clothes,

238
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:29,295
being careful not to get blood on them.

239
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:35,095
You washed off the blood that got splattered on your body,

240
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,895
using the shower in the bathroom next to the changing room, right?

241
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:40,995
You wiped off your wet body using toilet paper

242
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,295
and flushed it down the toilet.

243
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:46,595
Isn't it right, Doc?

244
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:47,895
Yeah.

245
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:52,795
You're always enthusiastic about revealing the truth of cases,

246
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:54,995
but today you're a bit quieter, aren't you?

247
00:13:56,695 --> 00:14:00,095
I... I just thought that I'd leave things up to the young ones this time.

248
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:02,195
That's right.

249
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:05,195
Mr. Senba who retrieved the iron ball from the toilet,

250
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,695
put it in his sock,

251
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:10,795
got naked and called Mr. Hiyama

252
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:14,495
telling that the water of the toilet kept running.

253
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:16,295
Then Mr. Hiyama

254
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:20,195
was struck by Mr. Senba with the iron ball inside the sock,

255
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,695
and although he fled into the changing room

256
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,895
inside the bathroom on the other side,

257
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,695
Mr. Senba broke the door down,

258
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,395
and although the victim tried to resist by throwing a cup at him,

259
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:31,495
he was finished off.

260
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,395
I guess you were planning to wash off

261
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,395
Mr. Hiyama's blood and the honey that was on your sock,

262
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:38,895
as well as your body in the bathroom,

263
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,395
you figured if your socks got wet and you wore slippers with them on,

264
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,495
it would look unnatural.

265
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:46,595
That's why you deliberately stepped

266
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:50,295
on the shard of the cup that Mr. Hiyama threw and hurt yourself,

267
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:53,295
to create an excuse for removing your socks.

268
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,895
Then, after you quickly put your clothes back on,

269
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,595
you returned to the front entrance

270
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,495
to tell the bodyguards that you found

271
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,695
Mr. Hiyama killed in the changing room.

272
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,795
When they went off to the changing room to confirm it,

273
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:10,195
you hid the murder weapon

274
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:13,695
under the porch of the main house.

275
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,995
Well, the capsule with the iron ball inside it

276
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:18,795
that the ants were gathered around

277
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,495
have been found by the forensic officers.

278
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:24,795
And although you stepped on the shard of the cup with your heel,

279
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,395
the fact that blood was found all the way inside the slipper

280
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:31,095
will prove that the blood there was Mr. Hiyama's.

281
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,595
Of course, you have some on your body, too.

282
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,695
Luminol reaction cannot be washed off

283
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,695
by rinsing off just once with water, you see.

284
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:44,195
Yeah.

285
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,095
I'm sure it's on my body.

286
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,495
Because when I washed it off in the bathroom,

287
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:54,495
the tiles were smeared bright red with his blood.

288
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,895
Then, was your motive for killing him

289
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:59,195
because he bought your property, after all?

290
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:01,895
Yeah, because he talked my son and his wife into doing so

291
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,795
while I was in the hospital.

292
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:08,295
Moreover, the traffic accident that landed me in the hospital

293
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:12,195
was something that Hiyama had ordered his henchmen to set up.

294
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:14,095
Are you sure about that?

295
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:15,495
Yeah.

296
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:18,195
I pressed him for an answer before finishing him off,

297
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,895
he was blabbering things like,

298
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,695
"Please forgive me and I'll pay for your hospital charges".

299
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,695
That candy shop was a precious one

300
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,595
that I had inherited from my Grandfather and yet.

301
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:31,095
I was really shocked when I came home from the hospital.

302
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,595
The shop was demolished to pieces

303
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:37,495
and a huge iron ball was hanging in the air.

304
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:39,695
That's why...

305
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,695
I shattered his head with an iron ball, too.

306
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,195
I'm nothing more than the owner of a candy shop after all.

307
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:50,295
I couldn't fake it through.

308
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,795
I could never trick a kid, especially.

309
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,395
If so,

310
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:07,395
what of the scissors that the victim was holding?

311
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,095
It was Mr. Hiyama's dying message.

312
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,395
Dying message?

313
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:17,995
The letters on the shards of the cup on the floor

314
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,395
were F, U, A and R.

315
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:23,595
And the letter that was stuck to the shard on the slipper

316
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:24,795
was D.

317
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,195
FUSAE BRAND.

318
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:30,095
If you exclude the letters F, U, A, R, D and rearrange them,

319
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,395
you get SENBA.

320
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:33,895
I see.

321
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:37,395
But the door of the changing room that he fled into

322
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:39,995
was about to be broken down by the assailant.

323
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,895
So, it's hard to believe that he could so skillfully

324
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,095
cut out the small letters printed in the cup.

325
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,595
I... I see.

326
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,495
It's chemomechanical effect.

327
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:50,495
Chemomechanical?

328
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:51,895
Yeah.

329
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,495
When you try to cut glass with scissors

330
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,895
it'll shatter to pieces,

331
00:17:56,895 --> 00:18:00,695
but if in water, since the molecules of water come in

332
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,595
between the glass becomes fragile

333
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,795
making it easy to cut as if it were paper.

334
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:09,595
Can you really cut glass in water?

335
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:11,695
Will you show us?

336
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:14,895
Rather, although it can be cut easily like paper,

337
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:18,795
little pieces will still scatter about so it's very dangerous.

338
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:22,795
I really don't want to cut Fusae's cup.

339
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:26,295
But then why didn't he

340
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:29,295
leave the letters SENBA behind?

341
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:31,395
It would've been a lot more comprehensible.

342
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:34,395
Because it would be too easy that way.

343
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,995
If the perp sees his name,

344
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,595
he'll definitely hide it.

345
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,595
I... I guess so.

346
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:45,295
Maybe that's why he threw the cup that he cut

347
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:48,595
the letters out from towards Mr. Senba, no?

348
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,595
By doing so, the perp would be under the illusion

349
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,895
that the cup cracked because it hit the wall.

350
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:55,395
He would never think that the letters that were cut out

351
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,495
are more important.

352
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,895
It wouldn't be possible for the perp...

353
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:02,195
To immediately recognize this.

354
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:08,595
I see, I see.

355
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:11,795
Holding the scissors and the faucet with the water running

356
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:14,195
were hints pointing to the what you may call effect

357
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,095
and the shards of glass with the letters SENBA printed on them,

358
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:20,495
were probably flushed down the toilet.

359
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:22,495
I see, I see.

360
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,495
So that's...

361
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,795
What?

362
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,295
Where's everybody?

363
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,695
Conan?

364
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:30,495
Hey, wait for me!

365
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,195
Gosh.

366
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:59,795
Hey. Is it okay, Shinichi?

367
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:00,995
Don't you have to attend interrogation

368
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,395
for the case after this or something?

369
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,595
The computer.

370
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:07,495
Your computer was in the Beetle, right?

371
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:08,895
Yeah.

372
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:12,895
Is everything okay, Shinichi?

373
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:15,495
I found it.

374
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:21,495
Rather, where's Mr. Akai?

375
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,495
What's up?

376
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,595
Calling me so suddenly?

377
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:59,695
Will you take my tablet out of the dashboard (glove box).

378
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:07,595
I found it.

379
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,795
The article about Koji Haneda's case

380
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,195
hasn't been deleted yet.

381
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:15,495
If I remember correctly the letters found on the hand mirror were...

382
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,595
PTON.

383
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:23,095
The letters that were originally written on the hand mirror were...

384
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:25,695
"Put on mascara".

385
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:29,095
If you exclude the letters PTON,

386
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:30,695
the remaining letters would be

387
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:36,595
UMASCARA.

388
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:38,495
There sure a lot of As.

389
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,795
Could it be the name of a Japanese person?

390
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:44,495
If "CA" can also be read "KA",

391
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:45,695
then the thing that comes to mind is...

392
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:50,795
Asaka.

393
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:53,395
The suspect Asaka?

394
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:58,395
If you exclude the letters ASACA from UMASCARA,

395
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:01,095
the remainder would be UMR.

396
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:02,495
Then if you rearrange them...

397
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:44,995
Rum.

398
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,395
"Next Episode" -Spirit Detective, Gaito Hotta?

399
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,395
What?

400
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,295
You're going to disclose the truth about the Koji Haneda murder case?

401
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,495
Someone just ran from the balcony.

402
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:07,995
Haneda...

403
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:09,295
Koji.

404
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:11,195
What's the matter, Officer Takagi?

405
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,395
Oh, it's nothing.

406
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:14,295
It seems that something got on my finger

407
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:16,795
when I slapped the desk a while ago.

408
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:18,395
I wonder if this is salt?

409
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,595
Next Conan,

410
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:24,395
"The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 1)"

411
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,038
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,538
"Wine Glass"

413
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,938
-Rum. -One of his eyes is an artificial glass eye.

414
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,038
The number 2 man of the Black Organization.
