1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,340
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,240
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,940
Today's case has a slightly different taste.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,640
Solving the trick consisting of three flavours.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Let's taste the joy of problem solving.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,825
What's with that sigh?

10
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,125
I didn't sigh.

11
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,125
I was just wondering if Ran's doing okay at the tournament.

12
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,625
Of course she's okay.

13
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,925
I mean she practiced as much as she did,

14
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,725
and went to sleep early last night, too.

15
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,725
She's doing just fine.

16
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,125
I guess so.

17
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,225
Huh?

18
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:17,225
What's up?

19
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:20,525
-I've been telling you... -It's the owner of the sweets shop.

20
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:23,325
-So, I'm saying that's not it. -The police officer is Mr. Kinoshita.

21
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,025
What seems to be the matter?

22
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,025
Mr. Mouri, what a good timing.

23
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,025
Mr. Mouri, please hear me out.

24
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,725
-Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem. -Mr. Mouri, we're having a problem.

25
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,625
Hold it.

26
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,525
I have this uncomfortable premonition.

27
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:47,825
"Spicy, Bitter and Sweet Flavour"

28
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,825
So what you're saying is...

29
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:55,025
Etsuko, you saw a man running out of room 105

30
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:58,025
on the first floor of this condo.

31
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:02,025
The time this happened was about two hours ago at 9:00 in the morning.

32
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:06,425
And Officer Kinoshita, you came here after Etsuko reported this to you.

33
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:07,425
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:12,125
Then you found the corpse of Ms. Fumie Ozawa, the woman renting this room,

35
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,825
and concluded that she committed suicide.

36
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,625
It can't be a suicide!

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,125
But...

38
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:22,325
Listen. I saw the scene with my very eyes.

39
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,825
There was a suicide note and the room was not messed up.

40
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,225
But...

41
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:29,825
Besides, there are no other eye-witnesses

42
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,525
who saw the suspicious man you saw.

43
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,225
But I saw him for sure.

44
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:38,125
Come on! Please tell him, Mr. Mouri.

45
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,525
Tell him to investigate the incident more thoroughly!

46
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:41,525
What?

47
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,625
Now, now.

48
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,425
And is there a possibility that it was made to look like suicide?

49
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:51,825
I had the medical examiner come over and investigate just in case, but...

50
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,725
Judging from the degree of post-mortem rigidity,

51
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:55,425
the estimated time of death

52
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:58,925
is thought to be between 6:00 to 8:00 last night.

53
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:02,425
If the man she says she witnessed committed the crime,

54
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,325
he would've had to stay with the dead body for more than 13 hours,

55
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,925
after killing the victim and setting up the suicide.

56
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,325
It is unthinkable under normal terms.

57
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,525
I'm getting nowhere talking to you!

58
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,725
Let's have Mr. Mouri decide.

59
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:18,025
Mr. Mouri! Please tell us what you think.

60
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,725
Well, I'm sure in a fix.

61
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,825
You don't look to be in a fix to me.

62
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,125
Officer Kinoshita!

63
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,725
This is the man I saw! There's no mistake about it.

64
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:43,525
Oh, don't touch it!

65
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,625
But...

66
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:52,325
The victim is the person who lives here, Ms. Fumie Ozawa, age 24.

67
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,125
She works for financial institution.

68
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,825
When I found the body,

69
00:04:56,825 --> 00:05:01,225
she had a wire that was suspended from the shower nozzle around her neck,

70
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:05,225
with her body leaning against the wall and sitting down.

71
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,825
What a strange place to choose to commit suicide though.

72
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,825
Mr. Mouri, please look over here.

73
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,725
There is a will written using the computer.

74
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:19,325
"Chairman Shimizu of the loan department,

75
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,925
I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.

76
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,625
I will take my life so please accept my apologies."

77
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,125
The contents of the suicide note

78
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,525
is that she had embezzled more than 30,000,000 yen of company money,

79
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,425
so that she would like to apologize by taking her own life.

80
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,525
She addressed this to her superior.

81
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,125
Embezzlement?

82
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,125
She sent this mail out yesterday at 5:45 in the evening.

83
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,725
I think she died soon after that.

84
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:56,125
You stay out of this, brat!

85
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,825
Manner mode?

86
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:01,925
At home?

87
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,025
It seems that this will be concluded

88
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,825
as suicide just as Officer Kinoshita says.

89
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,925
Please look at the calendar!

90
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,625
She's got a dentist appointment.

91
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,025
Calendar?

92
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:26,925
It's true that she has a dentist appointment written for today.

93
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:29,925
You sure have good eyes, Etsuko.

94
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,725
You can see what's written from there?

95
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,025
Yes. Well, sort of...

96
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:38,625
A calculated suicide to the point of getting a wire ready.

97
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,625
Would such a person make a dentist appointment for today?

98
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,825
Wait a second.

99
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:48,325
Officer Kinoshita, this may possibly not be a case of suicide.

100
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,225
So she was killed by the man in that picture, right?

101
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:55,025
No, I can't really answer that yet.

102
00:06:55,025 --> 00:07:00,425
Officer Kinoshita, was this room locked or unlocked when you came here?

103
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:03,425
The door was not locked.

104
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,025
Which means she committed suicide without locking the door.

105
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,825
Rather, a person who commits suicide

106
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,425
would probably be reluctant to be found in the act.

107
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:15,525
The picture that was found at the front entrance was peeled off from here.

108
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,725
Hey!

109
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,325
Hey, Pops.

110
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:22,725
The victim must have been close with the man in this picture,

111
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:26,125
but isn't there a suicide note addressed to him?

112
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,825
Huh?

113
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,625
Pops, I wonder what this is?

114
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,925
There's some kind of white powder here.

115
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,925
It hurts.

116
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:57,925
It has no smell and is dry.

117
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:00,225
I think this powder is edible.

118
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,625
I think this is cornstarch.

119
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,325
What else can you use cornstarch for other than cooking?

120
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,325
Well, for making Japanese sweets.

121
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:13,725
Rice cake filled with sweet beans is also covered with cornstarch.

122
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:19,325
Inspector, the money that Ms. Ozawa was in charge of at her company,

123
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,225
a sum of about 30,000,000 yen is missing.

124
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:25,125
Her superior, Mr. Shimizu is off today.

125
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,725
Which means he doesn't know that Ms. Ozawa committed suicide.

126
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,225
And we've also come up with something unexpected.

127
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:37,825
This man who is loading the cooler box is where she sent her mail to.

128
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,525
He is her superior, Mr. Shimizu.

129
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,925
You mean her superior was going out with her?

130
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,825
Nobody in the company seems to have known

131
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,725
that they were going out with each other.

132
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:50,225
Moreover, it seems that Shimizu liked gambling

133
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,525
and invested a lot of money into it.

134
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:53,725
Inspector.

135
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,225
It sounds fishy, don't you think?

136
00:08:56,225 --> 00:08:57,725
Excuse me, Inspector.

137
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,125
It's him!

138
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,125
The one who came out of this room.

139
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,725
Tell the truth!

140
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:08,425
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,425
And excuse me for being rude, but who are you?

142
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,925
-Please get out of the way and don't interfere. -It's this guy. It's him.

143
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,825
Inspector, he is Mr. Shimizu.

144
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:17,625
He was resting at home, but I asked him to come.

145
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,425
Getting right down to business,

146
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,325
did you know that Ms. Ozawa who was working under you,

147
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:34,325
had embezzled a sum of 30,000,000 yen?

148
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,525
"Ryota Shimizu (30)" -No. The officer informed me of it.

149
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:38,825
I was utterly surprised.

150
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:43,725
Weren't you going out with Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

151
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:46,025
If so, it would seem natural that she would discuss the matter with you.

152
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,025
We weren't going steady or anything.

153
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:51,125
You're referring to that picture that you had?

154
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,425
Ms. Ozawa said that she wanted to try going fishing once,

155
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,025
so I took her fishing with me.

156
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:59,625
Where were you this morning, a little after 9:00?

157
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,125
What do you mean?

158
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:05,625
Someone saw you come fleeing out of this room.

159
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,625
Me?

160
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
No use playing dumb!

161
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,925
I saw you clearly with these eyes of mine.

162
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,425
I'll be straightforward with you.

163
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:18,125
Didn't you come here this morning at 9:00 and kill Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

164
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,025
Are you trying to say

165
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:24,025
that I used Ms. Ozawa to embezzle money from the company and killed her?

166
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:27,825
Yes. After you sucked sweet honey, and sucked it all,

167
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,925
you got rid of her and...

168
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,225
Wait.

169
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,625
I didn't do it.

170
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,725
I had a class reunion with the classmates of my elementary school days

171
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,425
and was in Hiroshima yesterday.

172
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:39,025
So at about 9:00 this morning,

173
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:42,425
I was at the airport in order to board the plane headed for Haneda.

174
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,525
This is the cut half of the plane ticket.

175
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:52,625
Then, where were you last night from 6:00 to 8:00?

176
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,425
I was in the midst of the class reunion.

177
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,225
This is the name card of the person in charge.

178
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,425
Please let me have it for a while.

179
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,925
Sure.

180
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:00,925
Go check on it.

181
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:01,925
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:04,325
Mr. Shimizu has an alibi.

183
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:07,925
But Etsuko insists that she definitely saw him.

184
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,525
If this is not a suicide case...

185
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,325
How was it?

186
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,925
Wasn't what that man said an outright lie?

187
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,725
It was just as Mr. Shimizu had said.

188
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,325
I confirmed with the chairman of the class reunion

189
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,125
as well as the airline company.

190
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:44,825
I see.

191
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,825
Etsuko probably mistook someone else to be Mr. Shimizu.

192
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,125
But Etsuko has good eyes, doesn't she?

193
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:54,725
Because she was able to see the words on the calendar from far away, right?

194
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:57,825
Then, are you saying that she wanted to set Mr. Shimizu as the killer?

195
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,125
For what?

196
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,225
It's totally Greek to me.

197
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,625
Where's Officer Horita?

198
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,225
He is questioning a courier at the entrance of the condo

199
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,325
because the courier seems to have seen something.

200
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:12,925
Since my alibi's been established,

201
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,925
I guess I'll get heading home then.

202
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,025
No, you don't.

203
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:23,525
Don't let him go. He is a killer!

204
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,025
Etsuko.

205
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:26,725
What a woman.

206
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,725
Do you have a grudge against me or something?

207
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:32,025
Do you have proof that I'm the killer?

208
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,625
I do.

209
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,425
I knew her since she was a little child.

210
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:42,025
She thought of me as her mother and told me everything about herself.

211
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,325
She told me that she was going out with a person called Shimizu.

212
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:48,025
She also confessed to me that she embezzled money from the company

213
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,425
under his orders.

214
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,325
What a thing to say.

215
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,125
Stop it.

216
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:04,325
It was on vibrator. That was ticklish.

217
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,525
Yes, this is Mouri.

218
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:09,225
The thing that medical examiner asked for?

219
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:12,625
She has no bad teeth? You mean Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

220
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,425
But she had a dentist appointment.

221
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:18,525
No. Thank you very much.

222
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,725
Nothing is wrong with her teeth, and yet she had a dentist appointment?

223
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,025
Excuse me.

224
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:25,025
I don't want to be a bother,

225
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,925
but I don't think this is Ms. Ozawa's writing on the calendar.

226
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:33,425
Since I'm her superior, I used to see her writing all the time.

227
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:38,125
We can't say for sure until we get it evaluated,

228
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,225
but it does look different.

229
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:43,025
Then who wrote in the calendar?

230
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,625
From what I hear, this woman here is the one who first found the body?

231
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,725
I see. I understand now.

232
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:55,125
It's not unusual for the first person to find the body is the killer.

233
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,925
Well, it's too bad that Etsuko is the killer.

234
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,225
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

235
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:04,825
Etsuko wanted to set Mr. Shimizu up as the killer.

236
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,825
That's why she set it up

237
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,225
so that it looked to be as if Fumie had a dentist appointment.

238
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:11,625
She also peeled the picture from the album

239
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,025
and put the picture at the front entrance for everyone to see.

240
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:16,025
Etsuko, just in case,

241
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,125
could you write the word dentist for me, please?

242
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,525
It's that woman over there, but are you sure?

243
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,025
Yes, I am.

244
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,625
She hid it here.

245
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,025
Inspector.

246
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,525
What is this?

247
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:39,825
What?

248
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:42,625
Etsuko,

249
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:47,525
you came into this room a little after 9:00 this morning today, didn't you?

250
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,525
No.

251
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:53,925
The driver of a courier saw you come out of this room.

252
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,925
Moreover, you seemed to be in a rush and bumped into him.

253
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:04,325
There's five million yen here.

254
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,125
Can you explain where this money came from

255
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,625
and why you hid it in the gas meter box?

256
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,825
I brought the money from my house.

257
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:20,125
I hid it because when I went to report Fumie's death to the police.

258
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,425
I didn't want to drop it just in case.

259
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:26,825
So you did come into this room after all.

260
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,825
No, I haven't.

261
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:31,825
You killed Ozawa yourself and tried to set me up as the killer.

262
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,625
Just what do you think you're saying?

263
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,025
Mr. Mouri, please don't listen to what this man is saying.

264
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,725
Well, what a predicament.

265
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:43,725
It's a lie. One of the two is lying.

266
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:45,925
Etsuko or Mr. Shimizu, which of them is the killer?

267
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,225
What's this?

268
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:55,225
The scale of a fish?

269
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:56,625
Why would something like this be here?

270
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:58,825
Maybe...

271
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,825
I see. So that's the story.

272
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:13,889
I did write it

273
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,789
and I am the one who put the picture there, too.

274
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,489
Was it to put the blame of the crime on Mr. Shimizu?

275
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:21,489
No, that's not it.

276
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:24,289
I did it to have Mr. Shimizu arrested.

277
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,189
I came to this room this morning.

278
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,989
I was going to accompany Fumie

279
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,789
who said she was going to turn herself into the police.

280
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,089
I brought money along with me

281
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,989
thinking that returning some money would make what she did a bit lighter.

282
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:44,889
I just knew that Mr. Shimizu was responsible

283
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,489
for the way I found Fumie.

284
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:51,089
She told me that she was going to confess everything to the police.

285
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,389
But there is nothing in this room that hints that Mr. Shimizu did anything.

286
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,789
That's why you put the picture in the front entrance

287
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,989
and schemed writing what you did on the calendar.

288
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,089
The killer is Mr. Shimizu!

289
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:09,889
But Etsuko, that's your side of the story

290
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,489
and we can't believe it completely.

291
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,389
After all, Mr. Shimizu does have an alibi.

292
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:19,389
We'd like to know where you got such a sum as five million yen, too.

293
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,689
So would you please come to the police?

294
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,589
Mr. Mouri, thank you for waiting.

295
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,189
This is Mr. Inoue, who works at the ice making shop.

296
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,789
Ice making shop? What's this about?

297
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:38,589
Just as you had assumed, ice had been bought.

298
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,489
Officer Sato and Officer Horita,

299
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,889
take her to the police and hear her out, will you?

300
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:44,989
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

301
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,789
Inspector, please wait.

302
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,489
What is it?

303
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,689
Mr. Mouri! Did it start?

304
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:10,089
Let that person go right away.

305
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,489
The one who needs to go to the police is you, Mr. Shimizu.

306
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,389
Why do I have to go to the police?

307
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:20,589
Mr. Inoue, when did he come to buy ice?

308
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:21,989
Yesterday afternoon.

309
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:25,689
He came to buy four blocks of ice totalling 15 kilograms.

310
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,489
I remember him because he brought a large cooler box along with him.

311
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,789
At this time of year,

312
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,289
how long does it take for ice to melt and disappear?

313
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:38,389
At normal room temperature, about half a day.

314
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,989
Thank you for taking time out to come here.

315
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:44,089
No problem.

316
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,389
Thank you very much.

317
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:49,389
Officer Sato.

318
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:53,089
If you look underneath the bathtub cover, you will find a fish scale.

319
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,489
Please remove the wires from it and bring it here.

320
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,489
A fish scale in the bathroom?

321
00:18:58,689 --> 00:18:59,889
Mr. Shimizu.

322
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,789
Around yesterday afternoon,

323
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,689
you probably put Ms. Ozawa to sleep using sleeping pills.

324
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:07,289
Then you carried her into the bath tub.

325
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,189
You made her sit on the bench you made using ice

326
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,789
and the lid of the bathtub and left.

327
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,789
As the ice melts the bench lowers and chokes her neck.

328
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,189
At the estimated time of her death between 6:00 to 8:00 last night,

329
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:21,789
half the ice would've melted.

330
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,089
And this morning, when Etsuko found her,

331
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:28,489
the ice had melted and the floor of the bathtub was dry.

332
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,889
It may have been stuck to the cooler box that you loaded the ice with.

333
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,189
A fish scale was on the lid of the box.

334
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:40,389
Does that serve as proof that I killed her?

335
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:45,289
Listen, Ms. Ozawa sent me mail at 5:45 in the evening.

336
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:50,489
How can a person who is asleep with wire around her neck do that?

337
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,789
Conan.

338
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:55,589
Will you put Ms. Ozawa's cell phone in the open space of the book shelf?

339
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:58,089
Stick about half of it out though.

340
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,389
Okay.

341
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:10,389
The cell phone is on manner mode.

342
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,589
Officer Sato, please call Ms. Ozawa's cell phone.

343
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,989
Yes, sir.

344
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,389
If you look at the history of incoming calls,

345
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:32,089
you will notice that she received a call a little before 5:45.

346
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:35,089
No, but I didn't do it.

347
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:36,389
I was in Hiroshima.

348
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:39,289
You sure are obstinate!

349
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:42,789
Officer Sato, please look at the place where the wire is tied.

350
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:46,089
You'll see hair stuck to it.

351
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:49,689
Don't you see hair other than Ms. Ozawa's hair that is dyed?

352
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:51,889
There is.

353
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,589
Something that looks like straight black hair.

354
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,289
Mr. Shimizu, when you carried Ms. Ozawa,

355
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,989
your hair got tangled with Ms. Ozawa's hair.

356
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:03,989
However, you did not realize it.

357
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:06,089
Mr. Shimizu, it will be obvious whose hair it is

358
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,589
once we get it evaluated by the forensic officers.

359
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,089
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:18,089
She said that she couldn't continue any longer,

361
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,689
and that she would turn herself in to the police.

362
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:21,789
That's why I...

363
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,689
You drank a lot of sweet honey,

364
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,389
so from now you're going to have to drink a lot of bitterness.

365
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,289
You sure were fantastic!

366
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,389
Mr. Mouri, Inspector Megure was saying

367
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,289
that your plan of letting Shimizu suck sweet candy first

368
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,589
then giving him the blow was utterly splendid.

369
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,089
That a pinch of salt is necessary

370
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,489
to bring out the full effect of sweetness.

371
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:58,289
Maybe I should shake a little salt on you, too?

372
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:04,389
"Next Episode"

373
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,589
It's been ringing for quite a long time.

374
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,189
It's that case that happened 12 years ago!

375
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:11,389
There was an incident that happened 12 years ago

376
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:13,789
that was very similar to this case!

377
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,989
It's from Ran!

378
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:20,489
Then, don't tell me...

379
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:21,889
Don't tell me that...

380
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:24,089
Oh, no.

381
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:29,677
Next Conan, "Request from a Queer Family (Part 1)"

382
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,016
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:34,616
"Cell phone lock"

384
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:35,816
Why isn't Officer Takagi in this episode?

385
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:37,616
I think it's because the title to this episode is sweet flavour.

386
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,016
Officer Sato.
