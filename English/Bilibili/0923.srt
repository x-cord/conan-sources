1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,570
"We apologize for the inconvenience. We are working as safely as possible."

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,170
"We appreciate your cooperation."

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,870
"No Authorized Access"

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,770
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,070
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,670
The Youth Detective Squad were at the crime scene,

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
but Conan doesn't seem to be around.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,270
His name is Detective Conan!

11
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:23,928
"A Day Without Conan"

12
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,728
The victim...

13
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:31,928
"Sadakazu Unmo (30)" -is a serial blackmailer named Sadakazu Unmo.

14
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,628
There's no weapon at the crime scene,

15
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,928
but he most likely died instantly

16
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:39,028
when he was hit over the head with a metal pipe.

17
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,328
But Mitsuhiko...

18
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,528
They're finished. I'll call you back.

19
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,228
These hot springs are great!

20
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:50,428
Compared to how cold it is in Tokyo, this place is paradise!

21
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,828
Come on, kid!

22
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:54,528
Let's stuff ourselves!

23
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:59,428
"Gift. Kogoro Mouri." -Pops got free hotel vouchers somewhere.

24
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:04,828
Ran was unable to come, so he made me come with him.

25
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:07,928
So the estimated time of death

26
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:11,428
is today between 3:30 to 4:30.

27
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:12,828
It's four.

28
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:14,328
That's when...

29
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,128
the tall man wearing sunglasses and a mask came out.

30
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,328
And you kids were

31
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:24,828
watching this construction site from across the street then?

32
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:28,328
Yes. We saw a woman in trouble.

33
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:30,628
It was regarding her grandson who lives with her.

34
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,528
"Hisae Kubo (73)" -Not only can he not hold down a job,

35
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,428
"Housewife" -but lately he's being going out in the evening

36
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:39,228
and staying out until morning.

37
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:43,028
That idiot is out gallivanting around when he doesn't even have a job.

38
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,028
We should catch him while he's out fooling around

39
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,028
and advise him to stop.

40
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,228
-Yeah! -Yeah!

41
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,528
It's not like we're meddling.

42
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,728
I feel bad for that woman.

43
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,428
I didn't say anything.

44
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:03,028
He should be going out soon.

45
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,128
Hide.

46
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:15,028
That's a huge dude.

47
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,728
The suspicious man...

48
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,428
came running out after about five minutes.

49
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:28,628
He ran away.

50
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:30,828
Did something happen?

51
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,828
We were curious about what happened, but then...

52
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,828
"Kubo"

53
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,928
"Yukihide Kubo (19)" -...the grandson in question came out.

54
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,128
"Hisae's Grandson"

55
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,328
When we followed him,

56
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,928
we discovered he was actually working.

57
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,628
He was working nights.

58
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,928
He's still a trainee.

59
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:53,528
He planned to tell her once he became an employee.

60
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,828
By the way, who was that man?

61
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:12,028
The man you kids saw certainly sounds suspicious,

62
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,928
but without knowing his appearance or age...

63
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,928
But he was really tall.

64
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,028
There are lots of men like that.

65
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:23,628
Unmo himself looks to be almost two meters tall.

66
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:26,528
Inspector Megure, it seems that

67
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:30,028
the suspect was being blackmailed by Unmo.

68
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:34,528
It seems Unmo had no relationship with his neighbors.

69
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:39,928
The culprit was being blackmailed by that Unmo guy, too.

70
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,628
So they lied about paying him,

71
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,928
asked to meet him here, and killed him.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,028
Most likely, yes.

73
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,928
"Incoming Call: Conan Edogawa" -Conan.

74
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:54,328
Hello?

75
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,128
There's something bothering me.

76
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,828
There was no weapon at the crime scene, right?

77
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:01,328
Yes, we believe the culprit took it with them.

78
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:06,028
But the man who fled wasn't carrying a metal pipe, right?

79
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:07,328
You're right.

80
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:10,028
Perhaps he was hiding it under his coat.

81
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,128
Got it. I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

82
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,328
Let's find the culprit then.

83
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:19,228
"All You Can Eat, All You Can Drink" -Got it.

84
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,028
-It hurts! -Pops!

85
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,028
"We apologize for the inconvenience."

86
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,028
"We are working as safely as possible." -What?

87
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:26,328
"No Authorized Access" -You can't come back now?

88
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,428
"Hospital" -Yeah, sorry.

89
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:32,528
Stick with the police and tell me everything you learn.

90
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:33,528
Got it.

91
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:34,628
"Unmo"

92
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,828
Found it.

93
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,728
"Client List" -It's a list of the people he was blackmailing.

94
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:43,328
Ten men and one woman?

95
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:46,128
Let's split up.

96
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,428
We'll join you.

97
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,728
We can't let you do that.

98
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:58,728
We saw the culprit.

99
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:01,728
If we encounter the suspect, we may be able to recall something.

100
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:07,228
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:10,128
What happened to the metal pipe?

102
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,628
Perhaps he was hiding it under his coat.

103
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:15,228
If that's true,

104
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,628
then they would've noticed him running unnaturally.

105
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:22,028
Which means the weapon disappeared later.

106
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:25,228
Did someone take it?

107
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,128
We're sorry to have bothered you on your day off.

108
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,728
"Rika Samei" -That just leaves Rika Samei.

109
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,228
A woman.

110
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:39,528
Maybe that person was actually a masculine woman.

111
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,328
It's not her.

112
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,528
Someone who makes such cute drawings

113
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,228
couldn't kill a person.

114
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:56,128
And she's hardly a masculine woman.

115
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:58,828
"Rika Samei (28), Illustrator" -She's frail and small.

116
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:03,628
Rika Samei, where were you at four yesterday?

117
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:04,828
I was...

118
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,628
Oh, Kuniko.

119
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:07,628
Yes?

120
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:11,028
I was in my apartment yesterday afternoon, right?

121
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:15,228
"Kuniko Tago (36), Rika's Neighbor" -What? You started working at around 3.

122
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,728
Did something happen?

123
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,828
No, thank you.

124
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:19,928
I see.

125
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:21,128
Well, see you later.

126
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,028
"Rika Samei, 28, Illustrator. According to the neighbor,"

127
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,428
"Kuniko (housewife), she started working around three." -We didn't...

128
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,028
get any hits.

129
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,428
Then let's try calling the other group.

130
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,028
We're on the phone with them right now.

131
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:44,328
What? I see. Got it.

132
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,728
Everyone they spoke with had an alibi, too.

133
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,728
What?

134
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,328
All the suspects are innocent?

135
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:56,828
We're stuck.

136
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:01,428
Then who killed that guy with the dumb face?

137
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:03,228
Dumb face?

138
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:05,928
The victim, Sadakazu Unmo,

139
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:08,428
didn't have a particularly dumb face.

140
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:12,428
That's because you didn't see the body, Conan.

141
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,628
Hold on.

142
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,528
Hello, this is Mouri.

143
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,928
What? Are you feeling better?

144
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:28,328
Yeah. Could you put Officer Takagi on the phone?

145
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,928
Very well. I can't refuse a request from you, Mr. Mouri.

146
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,928
I see.

147
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:41,028
Were his front teeth knocked out when he was hit?

148
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,428
No, they weren't.

149
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,128
"Yamamoto Dental Clinic, Sadakazu Unmo" -They're dentures.

150
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:46,328
We found them in his apartment.

151
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:49,828
He was going to have them put back in at the start of the week.

152
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:53,528
So they were out since before he arrived at the crime scene.

153
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,528
I was just curious. Sorry to have bothered you.

154
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:02,828
Anyway, the real problem is all the suspects are innocent.

155
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:07,828
Why can't we find the man who killed this person and fled?

156
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:15,928
He was wearing a button-down shirt.

157
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,428
Could it be...

158
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,428
But...

159
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:26,428
"Unmo" -They're making a new list of suspects?

160
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:28,328
So we're back to square one.

161
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,928
The estimated time of death?

162
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,928
I told you, it was around four.

163
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:39,028
That's when you guys saw the tall man running away, right?

164
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:41,328
What time did the police determine it was?

165
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:46,028
Between 3:30 and 4:30.

166
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,528
"Hospital" -Until 4:30, right?

167
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,928
Yes. What about it?

168
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:54,528
So that's how it is.

169
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:09,395
He was wearing a button-down shirt.

170
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,795
Could it be...

171
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:13,795
But...

172
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,395
The estimated time of death?

173
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,695
I told you, it was around four.

174
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:26,695
That's when you guys saw the tall man running away, right?

175
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,095
What time did the police determine it was?

176
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:33,695
Between 3:30 and 4:30.

177
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:36,095
"Hospital" -Until 4:30, right?

178
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,595
Yes. What about it?

179
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:42,595
So that's how it is.

180
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,095
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya: Call Ended"

181
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,095
That explains everything...

182
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:51,795
about why we can't find the tall man,

183
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,995
the missing weapon,

184
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,895
and the victim, Unmo.

185
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:02,095
I even have some idea of why the culprit did that.

186
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:04,395
The problem is...

187
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,995
who is the culprit?

188
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:13,495
According to Mitsuhiko, all the suspects have alibis.

189
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:18,295
No, are we sure that's true?

190
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:25,295
Mitsuhiko, sorry. I want you guys to split up and do something for me.

191
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,895
The first is to confirm her alibi with the witness.

192
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,095
The second is a treasure hunt.

193
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,295
Got it. We'll give it a shot.

194
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,395
He's ordering us around without even explaining why?

195
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:40,095
He treats us like errand boys.

196
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,395
Errand boys?

197
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,895
We just need to solve the case, right?

198
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:50,595
And Conan's always making us run errands for him.

199
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:54,995
But this time he gave us orders over the phone.

200
00:12:56,295 --> 00:13:01,095
Why not? It's up to us to find the key to solving the case.

201
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,195
You're right.

202
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,095
Let's go. We'll start with the treasure hunt.

203
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:06,895
Yeah!

204
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,895
I guess I'll talk to the witness.

205
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:13,495
But I'd better give Edogawa a piece of my mind first.

206
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:19,395
Did I visit my neighbor Rika Samei's apartment yesterday?

207
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:20,695
No, I didn't.

208
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:26,095
Then how did you know she started working at three?

209
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:29,795
Oh, because she came to ask me for something yesterday.

210
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:34,295
I have a job I need to finish by tonight,

211
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,295
but I'm being followed by a strange fan.

212
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:42,595
If someone knocks on or yells outside my door,

213
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:45,295
could you tell them I'm out?

214
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,195
So you want me to send them away.

215
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,695
-You got it. -Thank you.

216
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,495
Now I can focus on my work.

217
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,795
She made her request

218
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,795
and went back into her apartment around three.

219
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,895
She was definitely working, right?

220
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,895
Fortunately, no weirdos showed up.

221
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:11,195
Oh, Kuniko.

222
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:15,195
-Yes? -I was in my apartment yesterday afternoon, right?

223
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:19,195
What? You started working at around three.

224
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:20,995
Did something happen?

225
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,795
No, thank you.

226
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:29,095
In other words, we don't know if she was actually

227
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,595
in her apartment after three.

228
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:35,895
Yeah, but she looks nothing like the tall man.

229
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,795
That's not important anymore.

230
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,495
Just tell me already!

231
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:46,795
What treasure are we looking for?

232
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:51,295
He just said to thoroughly search the area around the crime scene.

233
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:54,095
What's that? It's waving.

234
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:02,395
Is this...

235
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:04,895
This belongs to the culprit!

236
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:09,795
I understand why they got rid of the weapon,

237
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,595
but why did they leave their coat and other belongings?

238
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:15,395
Let's call Conan.

239
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:18,995
-Oh, right. -This must be the treasure.

240
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,995
Conan will be so surprised.

241
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,295
It's me! We found them.

242
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:26,195
The metal pipe and coat, right?

243
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,195
What?

244
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,695
How did you know?

245
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,895
Call the police.

246
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:34,595
We will, but what does this mean?

247
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,095
I made him tell me.

248
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,395
Edogawa's deduction.

249
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:45,095
Take them back and have them examined immediately.

250
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,995
Conan figured it all out?

251
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,595
Is he back?

252
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,795
No.

253
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:54,395
He figured it out based on the information we gave him.

254
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,195
Come with us.

255
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:59,095
Conan isn't with us, though.

256
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,195
This time I'll run down the culprit.

257
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,995
-You? -You?

258
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:08,095
I'm more than just an errand boy.

259
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,395
It's still bothering him?

260
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:13,495
There's nothing wrong with having some backbone.

261
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,395
The other suspects' alibis are rock solid,

262
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,795
but Rika Samei, you can't say the same, can you?

263
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,795
My neighbor Kuniko can...

264
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,395
Wait.

265
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:34,795
Your neighbor didn't actually see you.

266
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:36,795
You're right,

267
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,795
but it doesn't matter if I have an alibi.

268
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:45,895
Wasn't Unmo killed by a tall man?

269
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:48,095
We never would've found him.

270
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,895
Not the man we saw.

271
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,695
-What? -What?

272
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:57,295
Because that man is...

273
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:07,595
He made it just in time.

274
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,595
Who are you?

275
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,695
Pops is incredibly resilient.

276
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:15,795
Even the doctor was surprised!

277
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,295
-I'm all better now! -You just had too much to eat.

278
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:25,895
More importantly, why couldn't you have found him?

279
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,995
Tell them, Mitsuhiko.

280
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:29,195
Me?

281
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,395
Okay.

282
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:38,595
The tall man wearing sunglasses, a mask, and coat...

283
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,495
was Sadakazu Unmo himself!

284
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,695
-What? -What?

285
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:47,995
Nice one.

286
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,995
Really?

287
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,795
Hold on. The victim, Unmo...

288
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,595
Was also the culprit?

289
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,395
Not the culprit, the suspect.

290
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,195
Mitsuhiko.

291
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,895
Conan, could you handle the rest?

292
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:07,195
You're the one who solved it.

293
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,895
Fine.

294
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,695
Yesterday at four,

295
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:15,995
Unmo came to the construction site to blackmail someone.

296
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,395
Since it was cold, he wore a coat.

297
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:21,995
In other words, the tall man

298
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:24,195
the Youth Detective Squad saw...

299
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,395
was Unmo himself.

300
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,195
They're still not here.

301
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,595
Jerk!

302
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,595
No, you don't!

303
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,095
Don't underestimate me!

304
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,895
I killed them.

305
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,895
Believing he had killed them,

306
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:56,095
he threw away the metal pipe and fled,

307
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,495
which was witnessed by the Youth Detective Squad.

308
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:03,095
Later, Unmo returned.

309
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:04,895
-He returned? -He returned?

310
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:09,095
He must've remembered that his fingerprints were on the weapon.

311
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,495
This isn't good!

312
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,695
I need to get rid of that metal pipe!

313
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,495
Where did it go?

314
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:22,095
Unmo was killed by his blackmailing victim,

315
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,095
who had only been knocked unconscious.

316
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,195
That was around 4:30.

317
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:35,895
Then the culprit removed Unmo's coat,

318
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:40,795
and disposed of it along with the metal pipe.

319
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:48,295
The reason I thought the tall man they saw might be Unmo

320
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:52,895
is because I saw this photo you sent.

321
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:56,995
Since it was a cold day, he must've been wearing a coat,

322
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,395
and if he was going to blackmail someone,

323
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:04,195
he would've hidden the fact that his front teeth were missing with a mask.

324
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:07,895
Once we eliminate the requirement of "tall man,"

325
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:10,795
we should be focusing on the certainty of their alibis...

326
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,595
when determining the culprit.

327
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:20,895
Why did the culprit need to remove Unmo's coat?

328
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:24,195
When they were fighting Unmo,

329
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:30,395
it's possible their blood got on Unmo's clothes.

330
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:32,895
Blood?

331
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:37,095
Forensics just reported that they found blood on the coat.

332
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:39,395
It belongs to the victim Unmo and one other person.

333
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,095
It's mine.

334
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,595
But I didn't mean to kill him!

335
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:52,295
He asked me to meet him yesterday and blackmailed me.

336
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:55,295
When I asked him to stop,

337
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,295
he told me not to underestimate him and started strangling me.

338
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:01,595
In order to defend myself, I grabbed a metal pipe,

339
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,595
but he nearly killed me.

340
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:09,095
I attacked Unmo with the metal pipe when he returned

341
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,595
because I feared he'd come to finish me off.

342
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,495
I was caught up in the moment.

343
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,695
Huh? That contradicts your story.

344
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:24,295
You made your fake request to your neighbor

345
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:27,195
before you went to see Unmo, right?

346
00:21:27,195 --> 00:21:29,895
If you hadn't been planning to kill him,

347
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,995
you wouldn't have done that in advance.

348
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:35,695
You're right.

349
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,295
-Yeah! -Yeah!

350
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:41,595
The little brat is right.

351
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:46,395
I asked that pest to meet me and killed him!

352
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:58,895
Yes!

353
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:00,195
Case closed!

354
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,795
We did it!

355
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:25,395
Impressive work, Conan.

356
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,995
It's thanks to the information you provided me.

357
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:30,295
Thanks for all the work you did.

358
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,795
That doesn't sound like you...

359
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,795
But in the end, you did the heavy lifting.

360
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,195
Guys.

361
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:43,095
Look at them commending each other.

362
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,295
Huh?

363
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:46,595
Is it another case?

364
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,095
All right. Let's go.

365
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,795
Yeah!

366
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:56,695
"Next Episode"

367
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,095
No!

368
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,595
I won't let anyone treat them so carelessly.

369
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,695
So this is what he meant when he said we were his only visitors.

370
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:11,995
Is something wrong?

371
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,095
Hey!

372
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,395
Over here!

373
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:20,395
Next Conan,

374
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:24,295
"The Sun Sets Over Tangerine Fields"

375
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,838
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:29,538
"Container"

377
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,238
-The sky turns orange. -And the day...

378
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,038
-Is over. -Like the citrus fruit?

379
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,038
Yeah.
