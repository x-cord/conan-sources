1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.540
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.340
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.040
The Osaka duo watch a magic show.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.540
Off stage, however, a life-taking trap is set up.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.525
Yes, so we're gonna go and see that with these people right now.

9
00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.825
Oh, that sounds amazing!

10
00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:04.025
Okay, to go to that hall,

11
00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.625
you need to go straight down this street and then...

12
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.525
Why...

13
00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:14.425
Man, it's stressing me out.

14
00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.125
Guess who I am?

15
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.225
-Hey! Stop it! -It's me!

16
00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.425
Stop it! I'm serious! Kudo!

17
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:31.525
So you know, Ran.

18
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.325
Hey, Hattori!

19
00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:39.325
You want me to do the Judo throw on you?

20
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.725
Heiji?

21
00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:43.625
Well...

22
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.825
Hey, Hattori.

23
00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:55.725
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Tricks)"

24
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.925
I'm so sorry, Ran! For asking you a big favor.

25
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.825
Hattori, what brings you here?

26
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:07.125
Is it the Dogo Hoshikawa's Super Magic Show?

27
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.525
She said "I feel like watching miracles".

28
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:17.125
So I had to come for this stupid girl's stupid tricks.

29
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.225
Don't call me stupid, stupid!

30
00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:20.225
Huh?

31
00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:24.025
Kazuha, they are over there.

32
00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:27.325
Now, let's go! Conan.

33
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:42.725
"Dogo Hoshikawa's Illusion Magic Show"

34
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:48.125
Hey, it's here. Hurry up, Ran!

35
00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.825
There are a lot of young people here, don't you think?

36
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.625
Are there?

37
00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:58.525
I see, so he is Dogo Hoshikawa.

38
00:03:58.525 --> 00:04:02.125
That's right! Don't you think he is handsome, Ran?

39
00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:06.325
He's not just a handsome guy but also a great magician!

40
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:23.825
"Illusion Magic Show"

41
00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:31.025
She's a hot girl, huh?

42
00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:32.225
Yes.

43
00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:12.125
What? I thought he was hanging on strings.

44
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.125
That's what I thought too.

45
00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:51.025
It's amazing.

46
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.525
Is it?

47
00:08:34.325 --> 00:08:35.425
No way.

48
00:08:35.425 --> 00:08:36.925
He vanished.

49
00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:50.425
It's unbelievable.

50
00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:52.425
He must be a wizard.

51
00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:53.825
Are you stupid?

52
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:57.525
There's no such thing called a wizard.

53
00:08:57.525 --> 00:08:59.525
I think so too.

54
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:00.825
That cage looks impossible to escape from,

55
00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.825
but it actually has a door in the back.

56
00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.725
So, after the cloth covers the cage, he goes out through the backdoor.

57
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:09.425
We didn't see him anywhere on the stage though!

58
00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:13.025
The girl assistants on the stage are the key to the trick.

59
00:09:13.025 --> 00:09:15.425
Inside the cage, that magician probably changed his clothes

60
00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:19.225
to the ones that the girls are wearing in order to camouflage himself.

61
00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:24.725
Nobody was counting how many assistants were on the stage,

62
00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:28.225
so we wouldn't know whether it was eight or nine assistants, right?

63
00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:30.325
By walking closely with the female assistants,

64
00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:31.325
he disappeared into the wing.

65
00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:32.625
While people are watching the clothes burn up,

66
00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.825
he comes to the audience seats!

67
00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:35.825
Yes.

68
00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:40.925
But the levitation magic was amazing, right?

69
00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:42.925
It looked like he was really flying!

70
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:44.925
I didn't see any wire at all.

71
00:09:44.925 --> 00:09:47.025
For that, he used a bar to hold his body in place,

72
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:50.625
and there was a crane behind the curtain to move the bar.

73
00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:53.425
The curtain can be cut lengthwise and sideways.

74
00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:55.525
The audience pays attention only to the magician above

75
00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:58.025
who they think is being suspended in air by a wire.

76
00:09:58.025 --> 00:09:59.725
Enough!

77
00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:01.825
You guys speak no more!

78
00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:06.525
For God's sake.

79
00:10:06.525 --> 00:10:10.425
You're the ones who wanted to know how the tricks worked.

80
00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:19.725
Now, it's time for today's last illusion.

81
00:10:19.725 --> 00:10:23.025
It's just a little dangerous magic, "Escape from water"!

82
00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:33.925
With both hands and feet handcuffed,

83
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:36.825
he will try to escape from this aquarium which is sealed with a chain.

84
00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:41.125
Please give a big applause if he makes it through!

85
00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:07.425
It's taking too long.

86
00:11:17.325 --> 00:11:19.725
Ran, it's been almost 10 minutes

87
00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.725
since he went into the water, right?

88
00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:22.725
Yes.

89
00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:24.725
Close the curtain!

90
00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:27.525
Somebody, bring an axe!

91
00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:29.625
There has been a minor complication.

92
00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.825
Please wait for a moment.

93
00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:36.525
That's what the legendary magician Harry Houdini used to do.

94
00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:40.325
Yes, that's too common in escape tricks.

95
00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.325
-Let's go! Ran! -Yes!

96
00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:47.325
They're gone, Hattori.

97
00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:55.225
Excuse me!

98
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:57.025
You can't go in!

99
00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:00.025
-You can't... -Get out of the way!

100
00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:11.225
Ran! Break the aquarium with your karate!

101
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:42.925
Somehow, I made it.

102
00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:45.225
To my luck,

103
00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:47.525
and to these two brave ladies

104
00:12:47.525 --> 00:12:50.725
who made this show even more exciting.

105
00:12:50.725 --> 00:12:52.625
Please give them a warm hand.

106
00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:02.125
Hey, Hattori.

107
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:03.725
Yes, what?

108
00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.725
That wasn't a part of the show, right?

109
00:13:07.725 --> 00:13:09.125
I don't know.

110
00:13:15.088 --> 00:13:16.788
"Hoshikawa. Waiting Room"

111
00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:19.188
-I'm so sorry! -I'm so sorry!

112
00:13:19.188 --> 00:13:22.888
We just thought you were gonna die. Right, Ran?

113
00:13:22.888 --> 00:13:25.388
Yes! I'm sorry.

114
00:13:25.988 --> 00:13:27.688
Don't worry about it.

115
00:13:27.688 --> 00:13:32.488
In fact, I'm still alive partly thanks to you ladies.

116
00:13:32.488 --> 00:13:33.588
-Huh? -Huh?

117
00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:36.588
"Dogo Hoshikawa (27), Magician" -I heard your voices

118
00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:39.788
when I was half unconscious underwater.

119
00:13:39.788 --> 00:13:42.688
Your love brought me back to life.

120
00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:44.688
-Really? -Really?

121
00:13:44.688 --> 00:13:46.588
He's telling a lie.

122
00:13:47.388 --> 00:13:49.788
He was probably hiding a pin or something in his mouth

123
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.388
to unlock the handcuffs.

124
00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:54.188
I guess he was out of the aquarium way before. What do you think?

125
00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:59.088
Yes, people believe it's impossible to open the aquarium

126
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.788
since they saw it being sealed with a chain.

127
00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:04.688
But the truth is, some part of the cover has no chain on it.

128
00:14:04.688 --> 00:14:07.688
And from that space, it is possible to escape.

129
00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:09.188
All he needs is to wait behind the curtain

130
00:14:09.188 --> 00:14:10.888
until the audience starts to worry.

131
00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:13.088
As the staff give him the sign,

132
00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:15.788
he pours water over his head and shows up.

133
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:19.788
Now, the great breathtaking-escape illusion is done!

134
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:26.088
Well, it was great, Hoshikawa.

135
00:14:26.088 --> 00:14:28.188
"Riki Handa (41), Magician" -I was just thinking about you and I

136
00:14:28.188 --> 00:14:30.388
doing some collaborative performance. What do you think?

137
00:14:30.388 --> 00:14:33.088
Sure. If it's okay with you.

138
00:14:33.088 --> 00:14:34.988
That would be a great help,

139
00:14:34.988 --> 00:14:37.488
since you're a popular man now.

140
00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:42.288
Would you mind if I joined you guys?

141
00:14:44.288 --> 00:14:46.688
We should make clear,

142
00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:50.588
"Tenko Himemiya (32), Magician" -which one of us three

143
00:14:50.588 --> 00:14:54.188
is the true heir of our master, Mr. Masakage.

144
00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:57.888
Mr. Masakage?

145
00:14:57.888 --> 00:15:00.788
He was a mysterious magician who used to be on TV and stage

146
00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:04.488
but disappeared all of a sudden about 10 years ago.

147
00:15:04.488 --> 00:15:08.488
I heard he's still alive somewhere.

148
00:15:08.488 --> 00:15:10.288
Mr. Masakage.

149
00:15:10.288 --> 00:15:14.588
I never knew these three people were Mr. Masakage's pupils.

150
00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:17.088
Oh, yes!

151
00:15:17.088 --> 00:15:20.188
If we wanna perform together, then why don't we get Kazumi Sanada

152
00:15:20.188 --> 00:15:22.388
since he's as popular as Hoshikawa,

153
00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:25.988
and name the event "Dream Collaboration of the Four Magic Kings"!

154
00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:27.888
Kazumi Sanada?

155
00:15:27.888 --> 00:15:29.788
I wouldn't mind.

156
00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:32.288
I don't know if he's up to it though.

157
00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:36.588
We actually never met him before although we were in the same field.

158
00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:40.188
Hey, Ran, you've met this Kazumi Sanada guy before, right?

159
00:15:40.188 --> 00:15:44.288
Yes. First, it was when Sonoko invited me

160
00:15:44.288 --> 00:15:46.788
at the cruise party for the Zaibatsu Suzuki's 60th anniversary.

161
00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:49.588
Kid sent us a letter.

162
00:15:49.588 --> 00:15:51.388
So for the entertainment at the party,

163
00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:54.488
Sonoko's mother hired Mr. Sanada to disguise as Kid.

164
00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:58.888
I met him for the second time when Motoyasu Tsukumo,

165
00:15:58.888 --> 00:16:00.988
a genius magician's wife

166
00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:03.788
asked my dad to investigate the cause of his death.

167
00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:07.988
Mr. Tsukumo had three pupils and Mr. Sanada was one of them.

168
00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:11.788
Really? You never know who's connected to who.

169
00:16:11.788 --> 00:16:15.988
Then, we should ask this lady to get in touch with Sanada.

170
00:16:15.988 --> 00:16:20.288
Now, I think we should head to master's house and talk.

171
00:16:20.288 --> 00:16:21.688
How about you guys?

172
00:16:21.688 --> 00:16:24.588
We could show you a simple magic show after dinner if you like.

173
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:27.488
-Oh, are you serious? -Can we do that?

174
00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.588
But why his house?

175
00:16:31.588 --> 00:16:33.688
For God's sake, have you forgotten?

176
00:16:33.688 --> 00:16:36.888
Today is the day master disappeared 10 years ago.

177
00:16:37.888 --> 00:16:41.888
He may just decide to return home today, you know?

178
00:16:46.888 --> 00:16:49.188
"Masakage"

179
00:16:49.188 --> 00:16:51.288
Oh, hello there!

180
00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:52.488
"Mari Masakage (54), Wife of Mr. Masakage"

181
00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:55.988
Is it Tenko and Hoshikawa back there?

182
00:16:55.988 --> 00:16:57.088
Hello.

183
00:16:57.088 --> 00:16:58.588
Long time no see!

184
00:16:58.588 --> 00:17:01.988
It's been quite a while. I guess it's been what, 10 years?

185
00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.088
Oh, sorry, who are those people?

186
00:17:04.088 --> 00:17:06.088
They're our special guests tonight!

187
00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:07.688
-Nice to you meet you! -Nice to you meet you!

188
00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:11.088
All right, I guess I should go and get some more groceries for tonight.

189
00:17:11.088 --> 00:17:12.788
Oh no, don't.

190
00:17:12.788 --> 00:17:14.688
We thought so...

191
00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:16.788
so here it is!

192
00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:17.988
I see.

193
00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:22.388
So you've been visiting here the same date every year.

194
00:17:22.388 --> 00:17:26.088
Yes, in anticipation that master might just come back.

195
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:30.188
Unfortunately, we've heard nothing from him these past 10 years.

196
00:17:30.188 --> 00:17:32.588
Well, this brings back memories.

197
00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:35.488
Yes, we used to live here together

198
00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:37.888
and went through master's intensive training together.

199
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:41.288
Well, Hoshikawa, I think you used to drop by here

200
00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.288
even before my husband decided to have pupils, right?

201
00:17:43.288 --> 00:17:46.688
Then, Mr. Hoshikawa is his first pupil.

202
00:17:46.688 --> 00:17:49.488
It doesn't matter who's first and who's last.

203
00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:54.588
What matters is, who's surpasses master as a magician.

204
00:17:54.588 --> 00:17:56.688
Hey, Tenko.

205
00:17:57.488 --> 00:18:00.888
If we're really going to do a show together,

206
00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:04.988
the highlight of my magic will be "Witch Reborn"!

207
00:18:05.988 --> 00:18:09.288
I'm gonna place a huge cross in the middle of the audience

208
00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:12.488
and tie myself to it.

209
00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:14.688
I'll have the audience fire it up,

210
00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:18.988
and before the cross burns out, I'll vanish.

211
00:18:18.988 --> 00:18:22.888
Next time you see me is when I emerge out of the ashes.

212
00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:26.388
What do you think?

213
00:18:26.388 --> 00:18:28.888
It's breathtaking and exciting, isn't it?

214
00:18:31.588 --> 00:18:34.088
I should start preparing dinner now.

215
00:18:34.088 --> 00:18:37.188
Okay, let us help you then.

216
00:18:37.188 --> 00:18:38.388
Sure!

217
00:18:38.388 --> 00:18:42.188
I think I'll look around the house since it's been a while.

218
00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:43.888
That's a good idea.

219
00:18:43.888 --> 00:18:47.088
Actually, I'm gonna go to my room and take a nap.

220
00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:49.088
I had to wake up early this morning.

221
00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:51.888
All right. We'll call you when dinner is ready.

222
00:18:52.888 --> 00:18:55.888
Hattori, she just changed the atmosphere, didn't she?

223
00:18:55.888 --> 00:18:56.988
She did.

224
00:18:57.888 --> 00:19:00.588
-Today, I'm going to... -What?

225
00:19:00.588 --> 00:19:04.888
You want me to call the magician, Kazumi Sanada?

226
00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:06.588
I can't do that!

227
00:19:06.588 --> 00:19:09.388
I don't even know his phone number!

228
00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:12.888
True. We only met him twice. I guess it's impossible.

229
00:19:12.888 --> 00:19:15.388
Hey, Ran, where are you now?

230
00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:17.588
I'm starving to death!

231
00:19:17.588 --> 00:19:20.188
Sorry, dad, I think we'll be late.

232
00:19:20.188 --> 00:19:21.888
Why don't you eat in a restaurant?

233
00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:24.388
Ran, I need you to help me!

234
00:19:26.288 --> 00:19:27.888
What? Hey!

235
00:19:28.888 --> 00:19:30.588
Hey!

236
00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:33.188
I just can't handle this all alone, Ran!

237
00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:35.788
What? Where is Mrs. Masakage?

238
00:19:35.788 --> 00:19:38.788
She went out to get some seasoning because we ran out,

239
00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:41.688
and although it's been quite a while, she still hasn't come back.

240
00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:44.588
I was gonna ask the boys for a help, but...

241
00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:50.488
I can't do this.

242
00:19:50.488 --> 00:19:53.188
This knife isn't as sharp as my deductions are.

243
00:19:53.188 --> 00:19:54.288
Yes.

244
00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:55.888
I think cohesiveness is a necessary factor

245
00:19:55.888 --> 00:19:57.588
when it comes to deductions.

246
00:20:04.888 --> 00:20:07.388
I guess we did all right.

247
00:20:07.388 --> 00:20:10.988
I made you two do all the work. I'm so sorry.

248
00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:13.188
Oh, that's okay. Right?

249
00:20:13.188 --> 00:20:14.388
Yes.

250
00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.788
How's it coming?

251
00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:19.588
It looks yummy.

252
00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:23.088
Huh? Where're your friends?

253
00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:26.388
-They're treating their wound in the kitchen. -What?

254
00:20:26.388 --> 00:20:29.488
It seems one of them cut their finger with the knife.

255
00:20:29.488 --> 00:20:32.388
Okay, I'll go and wake Handa up.

256
00:20:32.388 --> 00:20:35.688
He usually will stay in the room way in the back of the first floor.

257
00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:39.088
Hoshikawa, would you please go and get Tenko?

258
00:20:39.088 --> 00:20:43.888
Sure. She's most probably in that room that I think she's in.

259
00:20:43.888 --> 00:20:45.288
Which room?

260
00:20:45.288 --> 00:20:48.788
Oh, I mean Mr. Masakage's room.

261
00:20:48.788 --> 00:20:52.288
There're pictures and instruments for old magic tricks there.

262
00:20:52.288 --> 00:20:54.988
There are many memorable objects in that room.

263
00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:57.188
-What? -Old magic tricks?

264
00:20:57.188 --> 00:20:59.388
Would you like to take a look?

265
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:01.688
-Yes! -Why not?

266
00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:07.488
Mr. Masakage designed and built this house himself.

267
00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:08.688
-I see. -I see.

268
00:21:08.688 --> 00:21:11.288
His room is on the second floor.

269
00:21:20.388 --> 00:21:22.788
It's a narrow hallway.

270
00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:25.688
It's kinda dark and scary too.

271
00:21:25.688 --> 00:21:29.388
That door on the right is master's room.

272
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:38.388
Maybe the light bulb burned out.

273
00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:43.088
-What is it? -A blackout?

274
00:21:43.488 --> 00:21:44.788
Where's the breaker?

275
00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:49.988
I guess it's not in this room.

276
00:21:51.888 --> 00:21:54.188
Hi, Mrs. Masakage. Where's the breaker?

277
00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:56.788
It's in the next room. In the bathroom.

278
00:22:00.788 --> 00:22:02.688
Okay, I found it.

279
00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:24.588
-Hattori! -Yes!

280
00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:28.688
What is it? What's going on?

281
00:24:00.088 --> 00:24:01.588
What the heck is this?

282
00:24:01.588 --> 00:24:03.688
Tell me, what is this room?

283
00:24:03.688 --> 00:24:08.288
Our master, Mr. Masakage traveled all around the world.

284
00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:10.088
Those are the documents on magic that he collected.

285
00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:13.288
This must be it. This is the Christmas tree magic.

286
00:24:13.288 --> 00:24:17.588
What do you mean? Don't you call me kid, you brat!

287
00:24:17.588 --> 00:24:18.788
This picture.

288
00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:22.088
A picture of his three young pupils.

289
00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:23.688
Maybe this is...

290
00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:25.388
Next Conan,

291
00:24:25.388 --> 00:24:29.588
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (House)"

292
00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.315
Next Conan's Hint:

293
00:24:32.315 --> 00:24:34.515
"Narrow hallway"

294
00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:35.915
-Next week, we'll have a battle. -Yes.

295
00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:39.515
-Oh, you mean a magic battle? -No! A deduction battle!
