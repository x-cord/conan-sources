1
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.540
Darn it! I lost again?

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.040
Talk about a bum day...

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.840
Geez! Just when I'm imagining basking

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.940
in a tropical paradise enjoying my fruit parfait!

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.840
Why don't you go read the derby papers

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.440
back at the detective agency?

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.740
The strawberry looks delicious!

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.940
I'll eat it if you don't want to eat it!

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.640
No! I saved it to eat it last!

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.340
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.840
-I said, no! -Ouch...

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.540
Yes, this strawberry was what triggered it.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.640
I could never have imagined it at this time.

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.040
That this would be the start of

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.840
a bitter sweet serious case.

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.840
The moment you decide what you want to do in life,

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.140
you must be true to yourself.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.940
Finally a great leap out of Japan.

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.140
A serious case occurs in the most adored city of London.

20
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.140
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:49.457
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Holmes's Disciple)"

24
00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:53.457
Oh boy! I was looking forward to eating it!

25
00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.157
What's with this cat?

26
00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.457
I didn't know cats ate strawberries?

27
00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:03.257
I think it's just rolling it around and playing with it.

28
00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.657
Who does this cat belong to anyway?

29
00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.557
Why you!

30
00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:16.557
Oh, Peanuts!

31
00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.657
Peanuts!

32
00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:22.457
I'm glad you're unhurt!

33
00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.057
Thank you so much for finding her!

34
00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:27.557
It seems like she saying thank you.

35
00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:29.557
My father is a detective.

36
00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:32.257
Really? How admirable!

37
00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:35.057
I'm fond of crime novels myself!

38
00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:38.057
And I love to hear stories,

39
00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:41.757
but I've got a flight to catch. Such a shame.

40
00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:45.357
I know, may I invite you to my home

41
00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:46.957
in London?

42
00:03:48.657 --> 00:03:51.057
-What's she saying? -I wonder.

43
00:03:51.057 --> 00:03:53.757
She talks so fast that I couldn't make it out.

44
00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:56.057
Wow, that's great!

45
00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:58.257
Oh, you accept?

46
00:03:58.257 --> 00:04:00.757
Then when can you visit?

47
00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:03.957
We don't have school next weekend!

48
00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:09.757
Oh, good. Then, I'll arrange your trip as soon as I return home.

49
00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.157
He speaks English?

50
00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:13.757
It seems so.

51
00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:16.557
-Okay? -Sure! All right!

52
00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:18.057
Thank you, ma'am!

53
00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:23.657
You're going to England next weekend?

54
00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:26.557
Hey, hey. What about school?

55
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.857
Well, Teitan Elementary as well as High school

56
00:04:29.857 --> 00:04:31.857
is anniversary day, and since it falls on a Saturday,

57
00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:33.857
we have four consecutive days off from school.

58
00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.757
Ran and Pops were all for it.

59
00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:38.857
Moreover, the owner of the cat,

60
00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:43.157
Diana turned out to be super rich!

61
00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.557
She says that she's going to pay all of our air fare

62
00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:46.757
and hotel charges, too!

63
00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:48.957
Well, aren't you lucky though,

64
00:04:48.957 --> 00:04:51.357
getting to go to London where you always wanted to go.

65
00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:54.857
Yeah, father took me a lot of places abroad,

66
00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.957
but I've never been to London yet!

67
00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:00.857
First, I'd like to go to Baker Street.

68
00:05:00.857 --> 00:05:02.757
Then next to Hyde Park where Holmes

69
00:05:02.757 --> 00:05:05.057
and Watson are said to have had walks in!

70
00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:07.357
And then to the Great Britain Museum

71
00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.757
where Holmes is said to have frequented whenever looking up reference!

72
00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:11.057
And if I still have time,

73
00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:13.057
I want to go to Dartmoor that was the stage

74
00:05:13.057 --> 00:05:14.557
for "The Hound of Baskervilles"

75
00:05:14.557 --> 00:05:17.257
and Reichenbach Falls where Holmes fell from together

76
00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:20.757
with his arch enemy Professor Moriarty.

77
00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.157
I've got so many places I want to go to

78
00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:23.557
that I don't know what to do!

79
00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:25.757
But...

80
00:05:25.757 --> 00:05:29.357
what about your passport?

81
00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:34.257
I completely forgot about it!

82
00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:37.757
Remember, Conan Edogawa is the child image of Shinichi Kudo

83
00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:39.857
who was made to drink the drug!

84
00:05:39.857 --> 00:05:43.357
He's actually someone that doesn't exist, you know!

85
00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:45.357
What makes you think that you can travel abroad so easily

86
00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.457
given the situation you're in?

87
00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:50.057
That's true, but...

88
00:05:50.057 --> 00:05:51.957
Hey, Doc!

89
00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:54.057
Isn't there anything you can do about it,

90
00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:56.457
like make a fake passport of something!

91
00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:59.257
Don't be ridiculous! That's a crime!

92
00:05:59.257 --> 00:06:03.257
Darn it! My chance to go to Holmes' sacred land,

93
00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.957
but I have to stay and watch house!

94
00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:07.957
That's ridiculous. Darn it.

95
00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:11.857
There's one way that you could go, though.

96
00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:17.857
That is, if you promise to keep to your word with me, though.

97
00:06:26.257 --> 00:06:31.557
Wow, first class is so spacious!

98
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:36.057
How rich is that lady, anyway?

99
00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:40.057
Too bad Conan couldn't come with us too, though.

100
00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:43.457
Yeah. Something about coming up

101
00:06:43.457 --> 00:06:44.857
with an urgent matter all of a sudden.

102
00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:46.957
But I guess he'll be coming

103
00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:49.557
with Dr. Agasa on the next flight, either way so...

104
00:06:49.557 --> 00:06:51.757
To go as far as to pay for Doc's air fare too.

105
00:06:51.757 --> 00:06:54.057
Diana's really a nice person, isn't she?

106
00:06:54.057 --> 00:06:56.357
But she's not paying for the gifts,

107
00:06:56.357 --> 00:06:57.857
so don't go splurging!

108
00:06:57.857 --> 00:06:59.257
Huh?

109
00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:01.657
You're going to splurge an entire mountain

110
00:07:01.657 --> 00:07:04.457
on that Holmes freak, aren't you?

111
00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:08.057
I... I don't intend to buy an entire mountain, so there!

112
00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:09.257
I'll bet he would've wanted to come,

113
00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:11.957
rather than receive gifts or anything, though.

114
00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:17.257
Really. It would've been nice if Shinichi could come too.

115
00:07:23.557 --> 00:07:26.957
I think the air conditioner is too strong in this plane.

116
00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:29.757
Hey! You've got to keep yourself from standing out now!

117
00:07:29.757 --> 00:07:31.757
We don't want Ran folks finding out

118
00:07:31.757 --> 00:07:34.557
that we're on the same plane, you know.

119
00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:38.257
No need to worry, they're flying first class!

120
00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.857
They won't be coming this way.

121
00:07:39.857 --> 00:07:43.057
You're sure lucky thanks to Ai's great idea.

122
00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:47.057
Returning your body to Shinichi Kudo

123
00:07:47.057 --> 00:07:49.557
temporarily to pass leaving the country.

124
00:07:49.557 --> 00:07:53.157
Yeah, I'm grateful.

125
00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:55.457
I'm only giving you two tablets, understand?

126
00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:57.757
One for going and the other for coming back!

127
00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:01.257
And they're effective only for 24 hours!

128
00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:02.557
Drink the tablet calculating the time backwards

129
00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:04.657
to when you finish going through customs in England

130
00:08:04.657 --> 00:08:08.657
to when your body returns to what you look like now!

131
00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:10.357
But, are you sure you'll be okay,

132
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.357
with me taking Doc along?

133
00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:17.957
Yes. I'll stay over at the Yoshida's.

134
00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:19.857
Sorry.

135
00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:21.757
I'm sure you know,

136
00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:23.457
but if you drink it without spacing the time,

137
00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:25.357
the effectiveness of the drug will be reduced to half

138
00:08:25.357 --> 00:08:29.557
and on top of that, you won't ever be able to come back!

139
00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:31.857
Yes, yes.

140
00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:35.057
"Heathrow Airport England"

141
00:08:41.257 --> 00:08:44.257
Conan and Doc aren't coming out.

142
00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:47.157
Their plane should've landed long ago and yet...

143
00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:49.657
Ran!

144
00:08:49.657 --> 00:08:51.757
Conan?

145
00:08:51.757 --> 00:08:53.557
When did you come out?

146
00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:56.657
Just a while ago. You didn't see us?

147
00:08:56.657 --> 00:08:59.157
The drug didn't wear off for a while,

148
00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:02.757
so I had to stay confined in the restroom for 30 minutes.

149
00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:05.857
Okay, then. Since we still have time

150
00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:09.757
before we meet the rich lady at the hotel tonight, so...

151
00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:12.757
Why don't we go on a London city tour?

152
00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:15.257
Where do you want to go, Conan?

153
00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:17.257
Of course I want to go to!

154
00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.857
"Sherlock Holmes Museum"

155
00:09:22.357 --> 00:09:25.557
Just as would be expected of the Sherlock Holmes Museum!

156
00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:29.457
Awesome!

157
00:09:29.457 --> 00:09:31.057
Can I take this seat?

158
00:09:31.057 --> 00:09:32.757
Of course!

159
00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:35.957
All right!

160
00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:43.057
I'll bet Shinichi would be just as excited.

161
00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:50.357
He wrote that he didn't want any gifts in his mail.

162
00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:52.957
I mean I'm all out to get him something so!

163
00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:55.857
Okay. I guess I'll surprise him a bit!

164
00:10:02.057 --> 00:10:03.857
It's Shinichi's cell phone.

165
00:10:03.857 --> 00:10:05.657
I wonder who it is?

166
00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:08.857
Ran?

167
00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:15.957
Hello, Shinichi?

168
00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:17.757
Ran.

169
00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:20.257
Where do you think I am now?

170
00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:23.657
At Baker Street 221-B!

171
00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:26.557
Come to think of it, you wrote in your mail

172
00:10:26.557 --> 00:10:28.357
that you'd be going to London.

173
00:10:28.357 --> 00:10:31.557
What? What's with that indifferent reaction of yours?

174
00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:34.457
I wish you would envy me a bit.

175
00:10:34.457 --> 00:10:37.157
Sorry. I'm busy right now, you see.

176
00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:41.657
Would you like me to take pictures of certain places?

177
00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:44.657
I'm not sure what places you'd like pictures of...

178
00:10:44.657 --> 00:10:47.657
I told you I don't want anything like that, didn't I?

179
00:10:47.657 --> 00:10:49.257
Besides, I'm already here.

180
00:10:51.057 --> 00:10:54.757
Bye then! I'm hanging up.

181
00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:56.757
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

182
00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.457
Dumb-dumb...

183
00:11:02.957 --> 00:11:05.257
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:05.257 --> 00:11:08.357
Just what're you doing?

185
00:11:08.357 --> 00:11:09.857
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:12.957
Oh no. I got her angry.

187
00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:22.057
Are you leaving already?

188
00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:25.257
Yeah. I've had my fill

189
00:11:25.257 --> 00:11:28.057
and the gift shop is in the house next door.

190
00:11:28.057 --> 00:11:31.257
Well, if Holmes were really here,

191
00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:33.157
I would stick around for days, though.

192
00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:37.957
You're lying to me! I know Holmes is here!

193
00:11:37.957 --> 00:11:39.857
Let me see him!

194
00:11:39.857 --> 00:11:43.257
I'm sorry, but Mr. Holmes is out on an investigation.

195
00:11:43.257 --> 00:11:45.357
What kind of investigation?

196
00:11:45.357 --> 00:11:47.257
Well, he is...

197
00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:50.357
See? You're lying! Save the trouble.

198
00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:54.257
Someone will be killed if we don't do something right away!

199
00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:57.857
And nobody can stop it, but Holmes!

200
00:11:57.857 --> 00:12:00.657
Oh no, look at the time.

201
00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:03.457
My sister's match is about to start!

202
00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:05.257
I have to get back!

203
00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:07.357
Can I be of some help?

204
00:12:07.357 --> 00:12:09.857
Never mind already, cheapskate!

205
00:12:12.057 --> 00:12:14.357
Japanese...

206
00:12:14.357 --> 00:12:16.857
You!

207
00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:19.157
Can you speak Japanese?

208
00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:22.357
Yeah, because I lived in Japan before.

209
00:12:22.357 --> 00:12:25.157
If it's okay with you, will you tell me about

210
00:12:25.157 --> 00:12:27.357
the crime you were just talking about?

211
00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:30.257
Why do I have to tell you about it?

212
00:12:30.257 --> 00:12:35.557
That's because I'm Holmes' apprentice, Mr. Grass.

213
00:12:35.557 --> 00:12:37.557
Why do you know my name?

214
00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:40.057
Do you know me?

215
00:12:40.057 --> 00:12:42.057
It's a simple deduction!

216
00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:46.157
The white liquid and powder that is around your mouth...

217
00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:48.857
It's the whipped cream and powdered sugar

218
00:12:48.857 --> 00:12:50.357
that you put on strawberries, right?

219
00:12:50.357 --> 00:12:52.657
You've got lime, cucumber

220
00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:54.557
and mint in the container that you're holding,

221
00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:57.057
so the content is a drink called Pimm's!

222
00:12:57.057 --> 00:12:58.857
Since you're a child, I guess you had them leave out the liquor

223
00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:02.357
and had them put only lemonade inside, right?

224
00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:05.057
Yeah. I asked the vendor to do that for me.

225
00:13:05.757 --> 00:13:10.257
A sport that you would watch holding a Pimm's and strawberries

226
00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:13.357
is the Wimbledon tennis match!

227
00:13:13.357 --> 00:13:16.057
Today is the semi-finals for the women's singles!

228
00:13:16.057 --> 00:13:19.757
The first game is from 13:00 and it's after 14:00 now,

229
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.057
so your sister's competing in the 2nd match.

230
00:13:23.057 --> 00:13:25.157
One of her opponents is Wang Hai-Li,

231
00:13:25.157 --> 00:13:28.457
who parents are Chinese,

232
00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:31.757
but you don't look Asian at all.

233
00:13:31.757 --> 00:13:34.157
So, then it's her opponent...

234
00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:37.457
the one who's kept winning the Wimbledon for 4 consecutive years,

235
00:13:37.457 --> 00:13:41.757
the world's number one, Queen Grass...

236
00:13:41.757 --> 00:13:44.757
Minerva Grass is your big sister!

237
00:13:45.857 --> 00:13:49.357
Besides, through your chest pocket,

238
00:13:49.357 --> 00:13:54.057
I can see that you have a badge for the Wimbledon VIP Lounge!

239
00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:58.557
Wow! You're really Holmes' disciple!

240
00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:01.657
So, now will you tell me your story?

241
00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:02.957
Yep!

242
00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:05.457
I was watching the winners of the match practicing

243
00:14:05.457 --> 00:14:07.657
in court #15 just after noon, while eating strawberries...

244
00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:09.557
A man in back of me suddenly asked me...

245
00:14:13.257 --> 00:14:15.857
So, you like tennis?

246
00:14:15.857 --> 00:14:19.157
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

247
00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:22.357
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

248
00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:25.557
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

249
00:14:25.557 --> 00:14:28.057
What?

250
00:14:28.057 --> 00:14:31.657
A person is about to be murdered,

251
00:14:31.657 --> 00:14:34.357
somewhere in London.

252
00:14:34.357 --> 00:14:37.157
Right before your eyes...

253
00:14:38.257 --> 00:14:40.157
Did you see his face?

254
00:14:40.157 --> 00:14:41.557
Nope.

255
00:14:41.557 --> 00:14:43.357
He was wearing his cap way down to his eyes,

256
00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:45.257
so I couldn't see what he looked like very well.

257
00:14:45.257 --> 00:14:48.257
But he gave me this strange piece of paper.

258
00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:51.857
Tell Scotland Yard

259
00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.457
that it's my revelation.

260
00:14:54.457 --> 00:14:59.857
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

261
00:15:00.657 --> 00:15:04.557
After he said this, he disappeared off somewhere.

262
00:15:04.557 --> 00:15:06.257
This is...

263
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.462
You can read English, can't you?

264
00:15:15.462 --> 00:15:16.762
Yeah.

265
00:15:16.762 --> 00:15:19.162
It looks like a poem of some kind,

266
00:15:19.162 --> 00:15:21.662
but I still can't make out what this means yet.

267
00:15:21.662 --> 00:15:24.562
Hey, there you are!

268
00:15:24.562 --> 00:15:26.562
Don't go running off by yourself.

269
00:15:26.562 --> 00:15:28.762
I've been looking for you!

270
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.762
Who is he?

271
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.662
Big sister's ex-coach, Ares!

272
00:15:32.662 --> 00:15:36.462
He seems to have been a really strong tennis player before!

273
00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:38.062
Since he used to be big sis's coach,

274
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.062
he gets along with mom too.

275
00:15:40.062 --> 00:15:43.362
He takes care of things around the house for us too now!

276
00:15:43.362 --> 00:15:45.762
Sis is busy going on tours

277
00:15:45.762 --> 00:15:49.162
and mom's eyes are bad, so...

278
00:15:49.162 --> 00:15:51.362
Come on, Apollo. Let's get back!

279
00:15:51.362 --> 00:15:53.262
She's about to play!

280
00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:54.462
But...

281
00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:56.062
Go on!

282
00:15:56.062 --> 00:15:59.062
I'll take this to the police.

283
00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:00.162
Besides,

284
00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:03.562
if he told you to take this mysterious sentence to the police,

285
00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.362
it means that he's giving time for people to think it out.

286
00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:09.862
And the possibility of something happening today is very unlikely!

287
00:16:09.862 --> 00:16:11.862
I guess so.

288
00:16:11.862 --> 00:16:15.062
I'll give you my cell phone number then,

289
00:16:15.062 --> 00:16:17.462
so make sure you call me if you find out about anything!

290
00:16:17.462 --> 00:16:20.062
My name is Apollo Grass!

291
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.062
What's yours?

292
00:16:22.062 --> 00:16:23.962
Conan Edogawa.

293
00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:25.462
Conan?

294
00:16:25.462 --> 00:16:27.862
There couldn't be a more appropriate name for a disciple of Holmes!

295
00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:30.862
See you!

296
00:16:30.862 --> 00:16:32.762
Be sure to call me!

297
00:16:32.762 --> 00:16:34.162
Okay!

298
00:16:34.162 --> 00:16:36.462
Conan!

299
00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.962
Who are those people?

300
00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:41.062
Is there some sort of trouble?

301
00:16:41.062 --> 00:16:42.962
Don't tell me that you're going to get us

302
00:16:42.962 --> 00:16:46.362
messed up in something despite being abroad?

303
00:16:46.362 --> 00:16:48.862
Well, it's sort of something like that.

304
00:16:50.462 --> 00:16:54.062
What? You received a mysterious coded message

305
00:16:54.062 --> 00:16:56.562
from a guy who warned of a coming murder?

306
00:16:56.562 --> 00:16:57.862
Are you serious?

307
00:16:57.862 --> 00:17:01.062
Yep! According to what the boy Apollo told me!

308
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.462
And, what's written?

309
00:17:03.462 --> 00:17:09.062
Uh, the first sentence reads "A rolling bell rises me",

310
00:17:09.062 --> 00:17:13.362
so it's "A ringing bell awakes me."

311
00:17:13.362 --> 00:17:14.662
The second sentence says,

312
00:17:14.662 --> 00:17:18.362
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle."

313
00:17:18.362 --> 00:17:19.662
The third sentence says,

314
00:17:19.662 --> 00:17:23.462
"I fill myself up with boiled egg as cold as a corpse."

315
00:17:23.462 --> 00:17:24.662
The fourth sentence says,

316
00:17:24.662 --> 00:17:28.362
"All I need is to bite on a whole pickle to finish."

317
00:17:28.362 --> 00:17:29.562
The fifth sentence reads.

318
00:17:29.562 --> 00:17:33.262
"That's right, I'll have to order the cursed cake."

319
00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:34.662
The sixth line reads,

320
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:36.162
"the sound of the bell

321
00:17:36.162 --> 00:17:38.662
that rings again stirs up hate in me."

322
00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:41.862
And the final seventh line reads...

323
00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:44.562
"Finish everything off, stab the white back

324
00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:47.162
and pierce through it with two swords."

325
00:17:47.162 --> 00:17:51.062
What're those creepy sentences supposed to mean?

326
00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:54.062
It seems that the man who forewarned of a coming murder,

327
00:17:54.062 --> 00:17:57.662
said that this is his revelation.

328
00:17:57.662 --> 00:17:59.262
A revelation, in other words,

329
00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:01.762
something like a plan to commit murder.

330
00:18:01.762 --> 00:18:03.662
Don't bother...

331
00:18:03.662 --> 00:18:06.562
It's probably some prank of a guy gone nuts or something!

332
00:18:06.562 --> 00:18:09.362
But I promised Apollo

333
00:18:09.362 --> 00:18:12.762
that I would take this over to Scotland Yard!

334
00:18:12.762 --> 00:18:15.862
"The Wimbledon Center court"

335
00:18:30.562 --> 00:18:32.162
Yes!

336
00:18:47.262 --> 00:18:49.762
What? There are many other people

337
00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:52.262
who received the same piece of paper?

338
00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:56.062
Moreover, you say that it was given only to children?

339
00:18:57.162 --> 00:18:58.762
Scotland Yard is filled with

340
00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:02.462
children with the paper and their parents!

341
00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:06.262
A dark complexioned guy wearing a cap with dreadlocks

342
00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:09.262
seems to have been passing the paper out at various places

343
00:19:09.262 --> 00:19:11.962
such as the side of the road or parks!

344
00:19:11.962 --> 00:19:13.162
While he passed the papers out,

345
00:19:13.162 --> 00:19:16.862
he whispered in their ears that someone in London will die.

346
00:19:16.862 --> 00:19:19.062
Wait up!

347
00:19:19.062 --> 00:19:21.162
Didn't you say that the boy named Apollo

348
00:19:21.162 --> 00:19:24.762
was told that somebody would die before his eyes?

349
00:19:24.762 --> 00:19:25.862
Hey, hey.

350
00:19:25.862 --> 00:19:29.662
If the guy said the same thing to the other kids...

351
00:19:29.662 --> 00:19:31.462
Don't tell me that...

352
00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.262
Right.

353
00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:35.062
That someone would be dying

354
00:19:35.062 --> 00:19:37.662
in front of the eyes of all those children.

355
00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:38.762
In other words,

356
00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:43.862
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

357
00:19:43.862 --> 00:19:46.262
A massacre?

358
00:19:46.262 --> 00:19:48.462
Here in London?

359
00:19:52.562 --> 00:19:55.162
Which mean that the killings are going to occur

360
00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:57.062
where there is a large crowd of people.

361
00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.162
Taking into consideration this time of season,

362
00:19:58.162 --> 00:20:01.362
the Wimbledon tennis game could be a likely target.

363
00:20:01.362 --> 00:20:03.362
Right! Because everyone would be

364
00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:04.662
in front of their TV sets watching the game!

365
00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.062
No.

366
00:20:06.062 --> 00:20:08.162
Among many of the children who were given that piece of paper,

367
00:20:08.162 --> 00:20:10.062
there were many who were wearing helmets

368
00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:11.362
for the bicycle race too,

369
00:20:11.362 --> 00:20:13.362
so I don't think it's the Wimbledon!

370
00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:15.162
They said that they were glued to the TV set

371
00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:18.462
every day watching the Tour de France.

372
00:20:18.462 --> 00:20:21.962
Tour de... what? What's that?

373
00:20:21.962 --> 00:20:24.662
It's a bicycle race that's held in France!

374
00:20:24.662 --> 00:20:27.962
That race and the Wimbledon

375
00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:29.462
are usually aired back to back

376
00:20:29.462 --> 00:20:32.062
so you can't watch both programs at once.

377
00:20:32.062 --> 00:20:35.262
Then, it could be the Great Britain Museum.

378
00:20:35.262 --> 00:20:37.462
Or, the Buckingham Palace.

379
00:20:37.462 --> 00:20:39.362
Let's just try going to places

380
00:20:39.362 --> 00:20:41.262
that there may be a large crowd of people!

381
00:20:41.262 --> 00:20:43.462
We may find something.

382
00:20:43.462 --> 00:20:45.762
I'll try deciphering the code together with Doc!

383
00:20:45.762 --> 00:20:48.262
-Hey! -Wait!

384
00:20:48.262 --> 00:20:51.662
We're having dinner with Diana at the hotel tonight, you know!

385
00:20:51.662 --> 00:20:54.062
We'll be back by then!

386
00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:00.162
We could investigate

387
00:21:00.162 --> 00:21:02.262
while trying to solve the code together, can't we?

388
00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.762
The best way is to split up

389
00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.462
and first try to gather as much information as possible!

390
00:21:06.462 --> 00:21:08.862
Because we don't have the slightest idea

391
00:21:08.862 --> 00:21:11.162
where and what the culprit's planning to do at all.

392
00:21:11.162 --> 00:21:14.662
Besides, if we solved the code together,

393
00:21:14.662 --> 00:21:17.962
I may have given away that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

394
00:21:17.962 --> 00:21:19.962
I think that you're already showing much of yourself anyway.

395
00:21:22.062 --> 00:21:23.262
First, for the sentence,

396
00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:26.762
"I awake with the ringing of the bell."

397
00:21:26.762 --> 00:21:31.862
Maybe this is indicating an alarm clock?

398
00:21:31.862 --> 00:21:33.162
The next sentence,

399
00:21:33.162 --> 00:21:36.562
"I am a wizard with a long nose that lives in a castle",

400
00:21:36.562 --> 00:21:38.662
is talking about a castle somewhere.

401
00:21:38.662 --> 00:21:40.162
The key word that has something in common

402
00:21:40.162 --> 00:21:43.162
in the 3rd, 4th and 5th sentences is food.

403
00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:45.062
Boiled eggs,

404
00:21:45.062 --> 00:21:48.862
pickles and cake.

405
00:21:48.862 --> 00:21:50.862
And the sixth line that reads,

406
00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:53.762
"The bell rings again" is probably referring to a clock again

407
00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.962
and the final, "two swords",

408
00:21:55.962 --> 00:21:59.362
if this refers to the murder weapon being a knife.

409
00:21:59.362 --> 00:22:01.262
If you think of it simply,

410
00:22:01.262 --> 00:22:03.262
something is going to happen in a place

411
00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:05.262
where many different types of shops are lined up,

412
00:22:05.262 --> 00:22:07.862
near a castle where there are two clock shops,

413
00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:11.462
as well as food stores and cake shops,

414
00:22:11.462 --> 00:22:13.662
including shops where knives and weapons are sold.

415
00:22:13.662 --> 00:22:15.662
Let's buy a map

416
00:22:15.662 --> 00:22:17.762
and check if there is such a place in London!

417
00:22:17.762 --> 00:22:18.962
Okay.

418
00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:24.362
London, the place where Sherlock Holmes,

419
00:22:24.362 --> 00:22:25.962
the one I admire existed.

420
00:22:25.962 --> 00:22:28.062
The mysterious revelation that I received from a boy

421
00:22:28.062 --> 00:22:31.062
named Apollo who I coincidentally ran into.

422
00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:35.062
I'll decipher the code no matter what

423
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:37.162
and prevent the crime from happening!

424
00:23:58.462 --> 00:23:59.662
"Next Episode"

425
00:23:59.662 --> 00:24:01.562
Holmes said it too, that

426
00:24:01.562 --> 00:24:05.462
"Your brain works more when you're hungry!"

427
00:24:05.462 --> 00:24:09.062
Oh, no! It's the cell phone that Shinichi uses!

428
00:24:09.062 --> 00:24:12.562
Don't tell me that you're here in London?

429
00:24:12.562 --> 00:24:14.062
You're here, aren't you?

430
00:24:14.062 --> 00:24:15.362
Oh, no!

431
00:24:15.362 --> 00:24:17.762
I won't let you get away!

432
00:24:17.762 --> 00:24:20.162
You can't get away from me anymore.

433
00:24:20.162 --> 00:24:23.062
Shinichi!

434
00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:28.362
Next Conan, "Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Love is 0)"

435
00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:31.288
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:31.288 --> 00:24:33.588
"Big Ben"

437
00:24:33.588 --> 00:24:36.288
A great detective, the big bang.

438
00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:38.188
Dad.
