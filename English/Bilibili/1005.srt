1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,520
We received a letter from someone
named Nichihara Taisei-san

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,480
asking us to investigate why
his friend committed suicide,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,300
and came to an abandoned church
deep in the mountains of Nagano.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,000
However, Nichihara Taisei-san was the
man who killed himself at the church.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,750
At the instructions of the
culprit who gathered us here,

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,800
we searched the abandoned church for codes.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,760
Wada Kohei (28)
Office Worker

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,670
Wada Kohei (28)
Office Worker
But Wada-san was murdered,

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,050
followed by Kawasaki-san.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,510
followed by Kawasaki-san.
Kawasaki Yosuke (28)
Bank Employee

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,150
followed by Kawasaki-san.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,120
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,380
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,890
A snowy mountain lodge mystery!

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,310
Amuro and Wakita work
together to solve the code!

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,080
Always determining the one truth

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,940
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,600
his name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,460
The 36-Cell Perfect Game
(Part Three)

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,030
The 36-Cell Perfect Game
(Part Three)
"The 36-Cell Perfect Game, Part Three!"

21
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,010
The 36-Cell Perfect Game
(Part Three)

22
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,350
Which letter are we supposed to start with?

23
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,150
I have no idea.

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,790
If only we had a hint.

25
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,100
Nishino Sumiya (28)
Bartender
Koura Ikue (27)
Office Worker

26
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,400
Nishino Sumiya (28)
Bartender
Koura Ikue (27)
Office Worker
A hint?

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,710
Nishino Sumiya (28)
Bartender
Koura Ikue (27)
Office Worker
There's nothing like that.

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,790
There's nothing like that.

29
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,420
Fujide Raito (27)
High School Teacher

30
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,790
You know, it's kind of annoying.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,300
If you'd tell us about the club
you've kept secret from us,

32
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,600
I think it might help us solve the code.

33
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,220
We don't mind telling you.

34
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,040
Just don't laugh.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,590
Most people make fun of us
when we tell them about it.

36
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,570
Sounds like your phone has service.

37
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,690
Hello? Hello?

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,490
It's Yamato with the Nagano police.

39
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,320
It'll take another hour to
clear the tunnel of snow.

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,120
We'll be able to come get
you in three more hours.

41
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,410
Sit tight until then.

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,100
Hey, wait!

43
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,660
He said they'll be here in three
hours and to sit tight until then.

44
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,510
Three hours...

45
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,010
You can't be serious!

46
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,490
How are we supposed to
sit tight for three hours

47
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,730
when there might be a murderer
lurking in the area?

48
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,200
Someone else could be killed
somehow during those three hours!

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,610
Maybe so, but the first victim
Wada-kun headed to the toilet

50
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,490
where the crossbow trap was
set because you drew his name.

51
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,250
And when Kawasaki-kun was
poisoned in front of the bath

52
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,250
because he went to investigate
a suspicious noise,

53
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,600
you're the one who decided how
we'd choose which pair would go.

54
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,590
You think I'm responsible?

55
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,980
Was it Nishino-san who
suggested the method used

56
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,160
to choose Nishino-san and
Kawasaki-san's pair to investigate?

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,100
Yeah.

58
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,030
He emptied two out of three mint cases.

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,240
The pair that drew the case with
mints would go check things out.

60
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,350
Naturally, with his ability
to pick out losers,

61
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,600
Master Kogoro selected an
empty case right off the bat.

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,000
About that...

63
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,130
I felt like no matter which case I
picked, none of them would be losers.

64
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,140
What?

65
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,650
You mean it was a sham?

66
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,780
I didn't say that.

67
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,550
Are you trying to frame me?

69
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,840
I can't trust any of you anymore!

70
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll protect myself!

71
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,900
Wait, Nishino-kun!

72
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,560
Let's go.

73
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,010
Nishino-kun, open the door.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,830
We don't think you did it.

75
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,220
Shut up!

76
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,250
I'm not opening this door
until the police arrive!

77
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,020
I'm going to survive!

78
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,870
Nobody's going to kill me!

79
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,140
Well, he'll be safe locked inside the study.

80
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,770
As long as the murderer isn't
already hiding in there.

81
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,400
Anyway, don't you think it's odd?

82
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,610
Why was the detective Master
Kogoro invited here?

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,250
If the culprit wanted to avenge Nichihara
Taisei who killed himself here,

84
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,080
they only needed to invite you guys.

85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,130
Inviting a detective here would
get in the way of their own plans.

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,130
Now that you mention it, the letter
said to bring a group of four, right?

87
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,840
Including us, nine people were invited here.

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,890
Perhaps the number nine
has some significance.

89
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,830
One of the benefits of the number nine
is that it's easier to create lots.

90
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,860
Compared to five or seven,

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,440
it's easier to create nine equally-sized
pieces from a single sheet of paper.

92
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,700
It's the same if you use
two sheets to make lots.

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,490
What else is related to the number nine?

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Mahjong's nine gates.

95
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,210
Beethoven's 9th.

96
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,710
The nine-tailed fox.

97
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,460
Nine-ball pool.

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,840
Nine!

99
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,340
That's it. So that's how it is.

100
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,480
The culprit wanted nine people to
show up for a variety of reasons.

101
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,910
Which means that fourth code indicates
where the next crime scene will be.

102
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,990
I see exactly what's going on now.

103
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,490
I know whose life will be ended next,

104
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,750
and the identity of the murderer
who intends to kill them.

105
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,300
Nishino-kun.

106
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,370
Come on out.

107
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,710
Don't stay locked up inside the study.

108
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,190
It's safer for all of us to stick together.

109
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,650
Nobody thinks you did it, Nishino-kun!

110
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,820
Of course I didn't do it.

111
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,570
I'm the one who drew the lot that sent Wada
to the toilet where the crossbow was rigged,

112
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,640
but I couldn't have cheated.

113
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,250
When we went to investigate
the strange sound,

114
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,750
Kawasaki's expression changed when
he received a text from someone,

115
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,320
and he ran off to the bath
where he was poisoned,

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,510
but that wasn't my fault.

117
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,510
So I'm not leaving this room
until the police arrive.

118
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,490
You guys will try to pin it on me.

119
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,010
Huh?

120
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,810
A text? From Nishino, who's
holed up in the study right now?

121
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,210
No subject
I know who did it! I'll tell you who it is, so come to
the study through the ceiling without anyone noticing you.
Nishino Sumiya

122
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,820
No subject
I know who did it! I'll tell you who it is, so come to
the study through the ceiling without anyone noticing you.
Nishino Sumiya
He figured out who did it?

123
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,140
I think...

124
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,330
the study should be around here.

125
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,650
You came.

126
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,480
I'll bring some tables and chairs over so
it's easier for you to get down. Wait there.

127
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,870
So, who's the culprit?

128
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,060
First, take a look at this paper.

129
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,610
You found a new code?

130
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,870
Unfortunately, I can't read it.

131
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,440
Huh?

132
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,250
What are you doing?

133
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,160
Don't poison me!

134
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,870
Hey.

135
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,830
I don't want to die!

136
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,680
Don't kill me!

137
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,080
Then don't swallow it.

138
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,130
Huh?

139
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
That capsule in your right hand.

140
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,030
That poison.

141
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,120
Wh-What?

142
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,460
That's the plastic bottle you
got from Fujide-san's bag.

143
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,530
Naturally, Fujide-san's
fingerprints are on it.

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,030
If we testify that we heard your
screams from outside the room,

145
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,030
the police would probably think

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,540
that Fujide-san snuck in here through
the ceiling and poisoned you.

147
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,680
Even if Fujide-san claims that he received
a text from you telling him to come here,

148
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
if you leave the phone used to
send that message in this room,

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,050
they'd assume he sent that text to himself.

150
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,530
No, you're wrong.

151
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,060
I just panicked because you all
came down from the ceiling.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,940
And like I said earlier, it was a coincidence
that Wada and Kawasaki were killed.

153
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,450
No, it was inevitable.

154
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,350
You made Wada-san head to the toilet

155
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,780
where the crossbow was rigged using a trick.

156
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,160
A trick?

157
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
When you don't have scissors,

158
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,100
cutting one sheet of paper
into nine equal pieces

159
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,950
creates one piece with four
torn edges in the center.

160
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,180
By giving that piece to Wada-san and
making him write his name on it,

161
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,920
even after putting it inside the tissue box,

162
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,220
you could identify it using the torn edges.

163
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,790
I thought he drew them
relatively quickly, though.

164
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,720
Since eight out of nine sheets have untorn
edges, he prioritized choosing those,

165
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,450
and left the person he wanted to
send to the bathroom for last.

166
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,200
But what about the mint cases?

167
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,170
Because the last remaining case happened to
contain mints, Kawasaki and I were chosen.

168
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,820
Hey, Mister.

169
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,800
You said you felt like all
the cases were losers, right?

170
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,660
Yeah.

171
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,390
None of the cases gave me a bad feeling.

172
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,550
Of course they didn't.

173
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,770
After all, all the cases were empty then.

174
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,910
What do you mean?

175
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,740
It's a simple trick.

176
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,020
If I shake the case using my left hand,

177
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,830
it doesn't make a sound, but
when I shake it with my right...

178
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,870
See? It makes a noise.

179
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,050
You're right.

180
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:01,050
It's because I have a spare case with
mints tucked inside my right sleeve.

181
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,850
Since Nishino-san said he brought plenty of
snacks, he probably had spare mints, too.

182
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,120
K-Kawasaki and I only went to check things out

183
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
because we heard the sound of glass breaking.

184
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,850
If you set the ringtone of a phone you
hid in this abandoned church beforehand

185
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,340
to the sound of breaking glass,

186
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,370
you could've made it ring anytime.

187
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,920
Maybe so, but it's true that
when we went to investigate,

188
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,750
Kawasaki's expression changed after seeing
a text from someone, and then he ran off.

189
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,900
When Kawasaki was poisoned
in the bath and shouted,

190
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,310
I was with you guys.

191
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,640
You swiped Kawasaki-san's phone
and poured honey on the screen,

192
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,150
so that Kawasaki-san would remove his gloves

193
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,400
and touch it when he received a text.

194
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,740
With honey on his fingers,

195
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,910
he'd be forced to run into the
nearby bath and wash his hands.

196
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,410
Come to think of it,

197
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,540
Kawasaki-san held his handkerchief in
his mouth when he washed his hands.

198
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,210
By swiping that handkerchief and applying
poison to the section he'd bite,

199
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,000
since Kawasaki-san drank water
after every activity he completed,

200
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,930
he'd swallow the poison on his
lips along with the water.

201
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

202
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,730
You guys have been going on about tricks,
slight of hand, and swiping objects,

203
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,350
but it's not like I'm a
professional pickpocket.

204
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,440
You're a magician, aren't you?

205
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,310
Huh?

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,120
A magician-turned-pickpocket I arrested
long ago happened to say the same thing.

207
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,370
Hold on.

208
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,080
There's an odd stain on the top card.

209
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,990
When holding a deck of cards face down,

210
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,960
he referred to the deck's
"top" and "bottom" cards.

211
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,470
I'm sure a magician could
swipe a phone or handkerchief.

212
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,640
While receiving a drink from Fujide-san,

213
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,850
you apparently put a stack of
blank code sheets in his bag.

214
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,210
You invited nine people
to this abandoned church

216
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,240
because you wanted nine
lots for the first trick,

217
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,290
but also because it's the
key to deciphering the code.

218
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,480
That's right.

219
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,750
It's baseball.

220
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,240
You initially called Wada-san the wife,

221
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
probably because he was the catcher.

222
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,260
In other words, in high school,
you were on a baseball team.

223
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,640
If baseball is the key word, then
that code can be solved easily.

224
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,110
In high school baseball, the players' numbers
are determined by their defensive positions.

225
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,340
If the square thickly outlined in
the middle represents the infield,

226
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:08,850
1 Pitcher

227
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:08,910
1 Pitcher
then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.

228
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,290
1 Pitcher
then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher

229
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,660
1 Pitcher
then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher
3 First

230
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,040

then you simply read the nine letters

2 Catcher

231
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,410

2 Catcher
3 First
4 Second
5 Third

232
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,790

then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher
3 First
4 Second
5 Third
6 Shortstop

233
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,160

then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher

234
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,540

in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher

235
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,910

then you simply read the nine letters
in the order of the player numbers.
2 Catcher

5 Third

9 Right

236
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,410
1 Pitcher
2 Catcher

5 Third
6 Shortstop
7 Left
8 Center
9 Right

237
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,600
Based on that, the code
we first received reads,

238
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,160
"It's time to play ball."

239
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,770
Yeesh!

240
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,790
The deck collapsed, and all the cars
have fallen to the bottom of the ravine.

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,750
The code we found next stuck
to the chapel door reads,

242
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,050
"One out in the toilet."

243
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,260
The code we found in the
rooms we searched reads,

244
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,310
"Two outs in the bath."

245
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,480
The code found next to
Kawasaki-san's body reads,

246
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,380
"Three outs in the study."

247
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,510
And the code you just handed Fujide-san
signifying a perfect crime reads,

248
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,700
"Perfect game."

249
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,800
By hiding the blank code sheets in Fujide-san's
bag, you wanted to make us believe

250
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:17,030
that after gathering his high school
classmates here, killing himself and two others,

251
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,350
and leaving behind an indecipherable
code at the crime scenes,

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,510
Fujide Raito-san was gloating over
committing the perfect crime.

253
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,360
Later, once the police discovered that the
victims were on the same baseball team,

254
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,990
this code would be solved eventually.

255
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,110
I don't get it, though.

256
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,490
I understand you inviting Fujide-san
so you could frame him,

257
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,030
but why invite Ikue-san?

258
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,500
Was it just to have nine people?

259
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,400
I wanted to show Ikue

260
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,380
that Fujide, the man you dumped your
high school boyfriend Nichihara for,

261
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,880
is unbelievably evil.

262
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,890
E-Evil? What are you talking about?

263
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,390
I'm sure you guys have heard

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,570
about the nine-error five-inning
mercy ruled perfect game.

265
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,450
Yeah, between Nagano Kawanaka Academy

266
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,410
Yeah, between Nagano Kawanaka Academy
Sports
9 Consecutive Errors, 5 Inning
Mercy Ruled Perfect Game!!

267
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,370
Sports

and the high school attached
to Shinano University.

268
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:13,530
and the high school attached
to Shinano University.

269
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,910
Were you guys members of the Kawanaka
Academy baseball team that lost that game?

270
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,720
Yeah. I didn't play

271
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,300
because I was injured in the
quarterfinal regional preliminary game,

272
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,210
but I could tell from the other side of the TV

273
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,680
that these guys lost that game on purpose!

274
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,670
They threw the game?

275
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,750
Wada, Kawasaki, and Fujide were
committing errors like crazy.

276
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,490
Since they got into Shinano University,
they must've had a secret agreement.

277
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,300
The Shinano University high
school lost in the finals,

278
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,190
but they became famous for their strength
in academics and sports after that game.

279
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,440
And at that time, our team's
ace was Nichihara Taisei.

280
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,800
Since he was a kid, he pitched crazy fast.

281
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,110
People thought he'd be drafted, but
his reputation tanked after that game.

282
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,450
When he wasn't drafted,

283
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,810
he unsuccessfully tried
to join non-association

284
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,260
and independent leagues
and ended up a free agent,

285
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,840
so he hung himself in this church where
we used to play baseball as kids.

286
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,890
All because they threw the game
and I wasn't there to stop it!

287
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,890
Is that true?

288
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,890
It's true that we lost on purpose.

289
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,540
But it wasn't to get into college.

290
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,100
We did it for Nicchi.

291
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,780
Huh? What are you talking about?

292
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,380
We won the first game 1-0 in extra
innings at the bottom of the 14th.

293
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,760
The second game ended in
a tie after 15 innings,

294
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,500
and we barely won the
rematch 1-0 in 13 innings.

295
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,310
Because he played 42 innings

296
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,250
and threw roughly 1,000 pitches
in such a short amount of time,

297
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
Nicchi's shoulder was at its limit.

298
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,560
We didn't intend to lose from the beginning,

299
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
but once we started to
fall behind, Wada said,

300
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,150
"Let's get the mercy rule invoked
for the sake of Nicchi's future."

301
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,900
"He'd insist on pitching
until the end otherwise."

302
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,830
But Nicchi's shoulder was already shot.

303
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,400
He's the one who dumped me.

304
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,530
He said he couldn't make me happy
with his body the way it was.

305
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,030
No...

306
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,300
It was a coincidence that we
got into Shinano University.

307
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,040
We all apologized to him after the
game, but because you weren't there...

308
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,210
What...

309
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,680
What have I done?

310
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,660
The murderer didn't speak a word
after that, but outside the church,

311
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,840
the blizzard continued to blow,

312
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,560
as though it was sobbing his remorse for him.

313
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,570
Three hours later, the blizzard
stopped, and dawn broke.

314
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,320
Nagano police cars arrived in droves.

315
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,260
I can't believe two people were killed.

316
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,580
Sorry about that.

317
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,960
Conan-kun, good to see you again.

318
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,450
So, who are those two guys behind you?

319
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,460
I'm Mori-sensei's number
one student Amuro Toru.

320
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,480
And I'm his number two
student Wakita Kanenori.

321
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,360
This bum has two students?

322
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,160
Wow, just like Komon-sama.

323
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,390
Komei, let's start inspecting
the crime scene.

324
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,530
Oh?

325
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,150
We meet again,

326
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,620
Mori-san.

327
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,950
I haven't seen you since the Kid case.

328
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,600
Who are those two?

329
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,130
They're my students.

330
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,500
Komei, what are you doing
chatting over there?

331
