1
00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.499
"Torada Residence"

2
00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.099
He's been hit all over his body

3
00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.299
and died of massive bleeding.

4
00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.699
He fell to his death?

5
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.099
Yes.

6
00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.699
My son Yoshiro, the sole heir to my estate

7
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.899
was killed by the hands of a ruthless devil

8
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.899
who holds a grudge against we, the Torada family.

9
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.899
You mean, somebody pushed him off a high place?

10
00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.999
No, it was a tornado.

11
00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.199
What?

12
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.099
He got caught in a tornado,

13
00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.999
was sucked up into mid-air

14
00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.299
and thrown down to his death on a rocky area.

15
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.399
Tornado...

16
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.499
which means, he wasn't murdered?

17
00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:46.799
Look closely, Mr. Mouri.

18
00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.299
Don't you see something in that pool of blood?

19
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.699
I'm sure you can see it if you look very closely.

20
00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.899
You'll see something that shouldn't be there.

21
00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.599
Centipede!

22
00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:06.799
The corpse of that centipede appears to have stepped on once,

23
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.399
and placed there before the blood dried.

24
00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.499
In other words, that someone...

25
00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:19.199
despite seeing our son in that condition,

26
00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:22.799
didn't call for help,

27
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.899
but instead put that repulsive insect next to him

28
00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.299
and left him to die.

29
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.399
But, it could be that

30
00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.399
the corpse of a centipede that someone stepped on,

31
00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.199
coincidentally flew there hurled by wind of the tornado...

32
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.899
Shigetsugu who found the dead body said that,

33
00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.899
"there are no centipedes in area."

34
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.399
He also went on to say that his older brother was left to die.

35
00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.399
Older brother?

36
00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.399
Didn't you say earlier that the deceased was your sole heir?

37
00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.599
I don't consider a moron who wastes his time hunting

38
00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.299
for non-existent treasure, my son anymore!

39
00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.899
And? You have an idea of who the culprit is, don't you?

40
00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899
I mean you mentioned being hated too!

41
00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.499
Conan!

42
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.399
Yes. The ones who have been feuding with us

43
00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.699
the Torada family for years.

44
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.999
The Tatsuo family.

45
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.399
I'm sure that the fiend who left our son to die

46
00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.799
is among them.

47
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.499
The start of the age of mystery.

48
00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.399
The detective show on Monday at 7.

49
00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.599
Shingen's treasures. The mystery of "Fuurinkazan".

50
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.599
The screams of Ran and Kazuha rip through the air.

51
00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.099
He sees through the one and only truth.

52
00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.899
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

53
00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.499
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

54
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.279
"Fuurinkazan: The Mysterious Armored Warrior"

55
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.979
"Tatsuo Residence" -Your son Koji

56
00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.879
was tied up, buried,

57
00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.479
struck repeatedly with a blunt object and beaten to death.

58
00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.279
On top of that, before his blood even dried up

59
00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.779
the culprit left the corpse of a centipede next to him and fled.

60
00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.779
Talk about cruel.

61
00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.179
And? What did the police say?

62
00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.979
Well, they just keep repeating the same answer, saying:

63
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.379
"We're investigating, we're investigating."

64
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.479
That's why I called you, Hattori.

65
00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.479
I got my old friend

66
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.179
Ohtaki from the Osaka police department to contact you.

67
00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.479
But, Mr. Ohtaki said that

68
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.879
you already have an idea of who the culprit is.

69
00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.979
Well, it's more like...

70
00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.579
It's revenge.

71
00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.079
Thinking that we, the Tatsuo family

72
00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:18.579
was to blame for the death of their son,

73
00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.979
someone in the Torada family

74
00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.879
killed Koji in retaliation.

75
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.079
Mother! We don't know for sure yet.

76
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.479
No doubt, seeing from how hideous and ruthless the murder was,

77
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.079
that it was one of them that did it!

78
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:36.379
And? Who found the corpse?

79
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.079
Oh, my other son, Akira.

80
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.679
He said he found it on his way back home

81
00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:43.479
from horseback archery practice.

82
00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:44.879
Horseback archery is the sport

83
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.579
where you fire an arrow while riding a horse, isn't it?

84
00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:51.179
Yeah. Akira is a top practitioner of it in our village,

85
00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:54.479
and always displays his skills during festivals.

86
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.879
And where is Akira now?

87
00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.779
Got them all. Just as expected of you, Akira!

88
00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.979
Yeah, I guess I'll get to be the horseback archery bowman

89
00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.979
for the next festival too.

90
00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.079
If so, you'll have been one for six consecutive years.

91
00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.079
They should just declare you be the horseback archery bowman already!

92
00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.779
No, I haven't reached my senior's level yet.

93
00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.079
Are you Akira?

94
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.279
Oh, yes.

95
00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:40.179
I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri from Tokyo.

96
00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:41.579
If it's okay with you,

97
00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.479
I'd like to ask you about the situation

98
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.679
when you found Koji's body.

99
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:49.779
I guess. I don't mind.

100
00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.179
Do you have any reason to find it difficult to answer?

101
00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:54.279
Oh, no, it's just that someone asked me

102
00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.479
the exact same question a while ago.

103
00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:58.779
A boy detective with an Osaka accent.

104
00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.979
Osaka accent?

105
00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.879
A boy detective?

106
00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:05.079
Don't tell me that...

107
00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:09.979
Yeah, I'm the one who found my older brother Yoshiro's body.

108
00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.779
It's true that there was the corpse of a centipede next to the body.

109
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.879
But, why a centipede?

110
00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.179
Beats me...

111
00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:20.379
Does either the Torada family or the Tatsuo family

112
00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:24.479
have any karmic connection or something with centipedes?

113
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.479
I don't know of any karmic connection.

114
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.179
But, I have a feeling I've seen pictures of centipedes at the festival.

115
00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:31.479
Festival?

116
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.879
At the festival where the horseback archery is held,

117
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:37.379
the men of the village have a mock battle.

118
00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.379
They wear the armor over there.

119
00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.279
Although it's called an armor,

120
00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.879
it's just a fairly lightweight plastic protector

121
00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.479
provided by the village.

122
00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:47.579
I have a feeling

123
00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:51.879
I saw a picture of the centipede somewhere at the festival.

124
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:55.179
Where? Did you see a drawing of it on a chest protector or something?

125
00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:57.279
I know that one of the warlords of the Sengoku Period

126
00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:00.179
had a drawing of a dragonfly on his helmet.

127
00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:01.879
Speaking of warlords,

128
00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:06.079
there was a detective who came by and asked the same question.

129
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.079
A detective?

130
00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:09.879
Yeah. A detective from Tokyo.

131
00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.979
His last name was the same as one of the warlords.

132
00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:14.779
Could it have been Mouri?

133
00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:17.379
Right! Like in Motonari Mouri!

134
00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.579
It's Ran's dad!

135
00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:22.779
Was there a little kid wearing glasses with them too?

136
00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:24.179
Yeah.

137
00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:28.179
He was asking about the incident more diligently than the detective.

138
00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:29.579
It's Kudo!

139
00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:31.379
That reminds me. Akira told us that

140
00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:35.579
a person died in a strange accident that happened six years ago.

141
00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:37.179
Is that true?

142
00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.579
Yeah. The deceased was the one selected to be our

143
00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:43.079
horseback riding archery bowman for the festival, until the previous year,

144
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.279
Mr. Kuroto Kai.

145
00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:48.879
I heard he fell off a cliff while practicing...

146
00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:51.479
Who would know more about this in detail?

147
00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:54.279
Maybe Yui, my late brother's wife.

148
00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:56.979
After all, she's the one who found his body.

149
00:08:56.979 --> 00:08:58.779
Where is she now?

150
00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:02.579
You see those stables behind the fence?

151
00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:06.579
I'm sure she's taking care of the horses now.

152
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:11.079
It's Kudo!

153
00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:14.279
Kudo was also lured over and came here, smelling out the case!

154
00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:19.779
It's just as I thought! We're two of a kind, birds of a feather!

155
00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:23.979
Hey, come on, give me a break!

156
00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:26.279
I'm still trying to get over the death of my husband, you know!

157
00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.879
-I'm in no mood... -Oh, listen to him going at it!

158
00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.779
Please leave already!

159
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.779
Hey! Why don't you cut it out already?

160
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:40.279
What is it, kid?

161
00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:43.279
Well...

162
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.779
Have you seen a detective

163
00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.679
with swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look?

164
00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:52.779
Swept back hair, a flimsy mustache and a dopey look.

165
00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:55.879
You mean like this?

166
00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:59.879
No, not at all...

167
00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:03.379
Kazuha, Hattori, long time no see!

168
00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.779
Ran! How've you been?

169
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:07.379
Great!

170
00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:12.879
So it's him after all.

171
00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:17.079
And, who's that grouchy looking man?

172
00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:19.879
Beats me.

173
00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:24.279
I'm Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police Department,

174
00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:27.179
the one in charge of this case!

175
00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:29.279
A police detective?

176
00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:33.579
I was just asking her some questions.

177
00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:38.579
Okay, ma'am. I'll ask you once more.

178
00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:42.979
Was it there six years ago or was it not?

179
00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:46.479
I just said, I'm in no mood to answer.

180
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.079
People's lives are at stake!

181
00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:51.679
Stop blabbering and answer me!

182
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.379
There wasn't.

183
00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:04.879
There was no centipede near the corpse.

184
00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:08.179
The only thing there was a thin corpse on the ground

185
00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:10.679
along with a dead horse.

186
00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:13.079
I see.

187
00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:16.779
I'm sorry to have intruded on you.

188
00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.479
Hey, hold it.

189
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:23.979
What's with the centipede?

190
00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:26.379
I don't know for sure yet but...

191
00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.679
if we don't figure this case out right away,

192
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:36.279
we're going to be seeing a lot of corpses rolling on the ground

193
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:41.079
just like on the battlefields of the Warring Period.

194
00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:58.979
As to what these two successive cases

195
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:00.679
share in common,

196
00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:01.779
the people who found the dead bodies

197
00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.679
were both related to the victims.

198
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.879
And, for some unknown reason,

199
00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:09.479
a dead centipede was found nearby.

200
00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:13.579
The thing that bothers me is the incident six years ago,

201
00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:15.579
when Mr. Kuroto Kai during horseback archery practice

202
00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:20.779
fell over a cliff along with his horse and passed away.

203
00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.979
But, I'd say, it was just an accident

204
00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:25.979
and most likely has nothing to do with these two cases.

205
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:31.679
Yeah. That is, if we believe what Ms. Yui Torada said

206
00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:34.779
about no centipedes being found near the bodies.

207
00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:36.579
There wasn't any.

208
00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:39.279
Although no centipedes were placed by the bodies,

209
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:41.979
the fact that the victims were left to die,

210
00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:45.379
resembles the first case, in which my husband died.

211
00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:46.879
He was left to die?

212
00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:49.279
Didn't he die instantly after falling over the cliff?

213
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.679
I told you, didn't I?

214
00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:54.379
That the corpse was emaciated.

215
00:12:54.379 --> 00:12:56.879
It's true that when he fell off the cliff,

216
00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.579
he sustained serious injuries when his body slammed against

217
00:12:58.579 --> 00:13:00.379
the trees and the rocks.

218
00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.679
His outfit was also smeared all over with blood,

219
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.579
and oxidation caused it to turn totally black.

220
00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:08.079
-But, he died of starvation. -Starvation?

221
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.679
Yes.

222
00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:12.679
In addition to not being able to stand because he broke his hip bone,

223
00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:15.779
he fell in a place where sunlight didn't shine at all.

224
00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:18.679
Besides, he fell right below the cliff where people rarely pass by.

225
00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:22.579
He was found almost a week after his fall.

226
00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:24.379
A week later?

227
00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:29.479
No one found him despite the horse falling over with him too?

228
00:13:29.479 --> 00:13:31.979
Did you really search for him?

229
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:34.279
Of course! The police as well as all the villagers

230
00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.679
searched for him staying up till late!

231
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:40.079
After all, Officer Kai was loved by all the villagers!

232
00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:41.379
Officer?

233
00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:42.879
You mean he was a police officer?

234
00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:46.379
Yes. He worked at the village police box.

235
00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:49.779
He had a strong sense of justice, was kind and gentle.

236
00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:53.779
I never heard of anyone in the village speak ill of him.

237
00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:57.479
That's why we all searched frantically for him when he disappeared.

238
00:13:57.479 --> 00:14:01.479
Then why couldn't he be found for an entire week?

239
00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.779
-The leaves. -Leaves?

240
00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.479
He was unfortunately buried under the fallen leaves,

241
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:10.279
and hidden beneath until the wind blew them away.

242
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.879
My brother Yoshiro's body was easily found

243
00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:16.379
because it had fallen on a rocky area in clear view.

244
00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:19.479
Did all the villagers look for him back then too?

245
00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:22.779
No, we started looking for him only after we found out

246
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.279
he didn't come back despite daybreak.

247
00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.479
Started looking for him?

248
00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:30.079
Didn't you find my husband coincidentally

249
00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.779
when you were headed for that hole?

250
00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:34.679
Oh, maybe you're right.

251
00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.279
"That hole?"

252
00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:38.279
It's just a hobby.

253
00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:40.779
I sort of treasure hunter, you see.

254
00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.779
Hobby my foot!

255
00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:44.279
As if not working isn't enough,

256
00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:46.579
getting carried away with something like that.

257
00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:48.879
You're a shame to the Torada family!

258
00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:51.579
Shape up, Shigetsugu.

259
00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:55.179
After all, you're the only heir left as of now.

260
00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:57.079
Yeah.

261
00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.379
And? Did you come up with anything, Mr. Mouri?

262
00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:04.679
No, only that the corpse of a centipede was found near

263
00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:09.679
the deceased body of Koji Tatsuo and Yoshiro as well.

264
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.479
Come to think of it,

265
00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:14.779
Koji used to have a lot of private talks with my husband before he died.

266
00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:16.079
Private talks?

267
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:19.679
Something about "going" or "not going."

268
00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:23.379
Yeah. I heard him say that too.

269
00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.179
He said that they would be going together see

270
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:28.879
that one-eyed detective called Yamato soon.

271
00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.779
And that it may turn into something terrible,

272
00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.879
so to be prepared for it.

273
00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:33.879
What?

274
00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:36.479
Did you hear what they were going to meet him for?

275
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:40.679
No. Only that he couldn't talk about it yet.

276
00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:43.179
Maybe we'll be able to find something

277
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:44.979
if we go over to the Tatsuo residence then.

278
00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:48.079
Yeah, let's strike while the iron's hot!

279
00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.479
Okay, we're heading over there,

280
00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:52.779
so you stay here at the house with her, Kazuha!

281
00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:55.579
-What? -Take us with you too!

282
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:59.779
Don't be silly, you'll only get in our way!

283
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.779
They were planning to go to the police?

284
00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:11.079
You mean my son Koji and Yoshiro Torada?

285
00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:15.079
Yes, haven't you heard anything about it from your son?

286
00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:16.979
No, nothing at all.

287
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:19.779
Only after Yoshiro passed away,

288
00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:23.779
he seemed to be terrified of something.

289
00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.179
He seemed terrified?

290
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:29.979
Right, he used to mumble even during meals,

291
00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:34.779
saying, it could be his turn next. That he'd be killed.

292
00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:37.279
Cursed to death.

293
00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:40.179
-Cursed? -Don't you understand?

294
00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.179
The curse of the Torada family

295
00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:45.379
that has been hating the Tatuso family for generations!

296
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:51.979
How come this family and that family don't get along?

297
00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:55.679
That's because...

298
00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.179
long, long ago...

299
00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:03.979
It seems to have slipped my mind.

300
00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:06.179
-Come on... -Granny.

301
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:08.679
I was told that the Torada family was hateful

302
00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:11.379
since I was a little child.

303
00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:13.679
But, I've forgotten why.

304
00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:17.879
I'm sure the feeling is mutual with the Torada family too.

305
00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:20.179
Now that the knotted chains have loosened up,

306
00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:21.579
both Ayaka and I

307
00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.479
were on good terms

308
00:17:23.479 --> 00:17:25.279
with Yoshiro and Shigetsugu Torada.

309
00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.579
But then those two had been talking about

310
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.179
going to the police before they died.

311
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.679
I bet it had to do with the accident

312
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.979
involving the police officer called Kai.

313
00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:36.279
That was just an accident.

314
00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:38.479
He worked too hard on horseback archery practice,

315
00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:41.279
he fell off the cliff from exhaustion.

316
00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:42.979
He was too uptight over

317
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.879
missing the target at the tournament that year.

318
00:17:45.879 --> 00:17:48.079
Now, stop that! Ayaka!

319
00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:49.979
But that's what everybody says!

320
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:52.679
They even say that he might have jumped off the cliff

321
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.179
from the shock.

322
00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.479
There are times when the archer misses the mark?

323
00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:58.279
Yes, once in while.

324
00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:02.279
But Mr. Kai never missed.

325
00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:06.479
Until that last shot of the tournament that year.

326
00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:10.079
He would never think of committing suicide.

327
00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.579
He would leave the people of the village

328
00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:17.179
just because of some embarrassment at a tournament.

329
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:20.679
He isn't such a coward.

330
00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:26.879
Huh? You're staying over there?

331
00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:28.979
You're not planning to come back here, Heiji?

332
00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:32.179
Well, it's starting to rain hard.

333
00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:35.079
And, they way it's really dangerous walking in the woods at night.

334
00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:37.579
So, it's how it is.

335
00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:39.679
Sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite!

336
00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:41.479
Hey! Heiji!

337
00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:45.079
He hang up.

338
00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:48.079
So, Kudo! Anything you noticed?

339
00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:50.679
Nothing yet.

340
00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:52.679
The one thing that bugs me

341
00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:57.279
is what Koji had been muttering before he died.

342
00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:59.979
That he might be next.

343
00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:04.879
If that's true, this is a serial murder case!

344
00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:09.479
On top of that, there may be more to come!

345
00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:19.279
Hey, Ran. Ran!

346
00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:22.579
Did you hear that?

347
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.379
Huh?

348
00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:27.479
I only hear the rain and the thunder.

349
00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:30.679
Hey, that one! I hear something else.

350
00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:32.879
Like the floor creaking.

351
00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:07.006
It's true! It's for real!

352
00:20:07.006 --> 00:20:09.106
We really did see it, didn't we, Ran?

353
00:20:09.106 --> 00:20:12.706
Yeah! We weren't imagining it!

354
00:20:12.706 --> 00:20:15.306
Well, but...

355
00:20:15.306 --> 00:20:17.406
What are you doing here, Kazuha?

356
00:20:17.406 --> 00:20:20.106
Heiji. I saw something.

357
00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.206
Seen what?

358
00:20:21.206 --> 00:20:24.706
Last night, when a lightning flashed...

359
00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:27.406
It was standing right behind the screen door!

360
00:20:27.406 --> 00:20:30.206
The armored...

361
00:20:30.206 --> 00:20:32.006
Wandering warrior!

362
00:20:32.006 --> 00:20:33.706
A wandering warrior?

363
00:20:33.706 --> 00:20:36.606
You mean the suit of armor we saw in Shigetsugu's room

364
00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:39.206
the one they use in the festival?

365
00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:43.906
No! The one we saw had some fluffy hair on the helment.

366
00:20:43.906 --> 00:20:47.806
That's the legendary Suwa Hossyo helmet of Shingen Takeda!

367
00:20:47.806 --> 00:20:49.806
Takeda...

368
00:20:49.806 --> 00:20:52.606
you mean the Red Armor of Takeda?

369
00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:56.406
Was the armor red?

370
00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:01.706
Well... what we saw as a silhouette.

371
00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:10.006
No!

372
00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:13.806
Ayaka locked herself up in the toilet?

373
00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:16.706
Right after you were talking about Shingen Takeda's armor?

374
00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:20.606
-Hey, Ayaka! What happened? -Come out! Don't make such a ruckus!

375
00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:23.406
Ayaka! Ayaka!

376
00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:27.706
What is going on?

377
00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:30.806
She's not here? My daughter-in-law!

378
00:21:30.806 --> 00:21:34.606
I wonder. She was right here a while ago.

379
00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:36.206
She asked me to be left alone,

380
00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:38.906
so I left for a while.

381
00:21:38.906 --> 00:21:41.206
She must still be nearby!

382
00:21:41.206 --> 00:21:43.306
We need to split up and find her!

383
00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:45.506
Then I'll use my scooter.

384
00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:47.106
I'll take the car!

385
00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:50.406
Akira, Yui and I will take the horses!

386
00:21:50.406 --> 00:21:52.906
The rest on foot!

387
00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:54.306
Ayaka!

388
00:21:54.306 --> 00:21:56.606
Where are you?

389
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:58.706
Ayaka!

390
00:21:58.706 --> 00:22:00.006
Where are you?

391
00:22:00.006 --> 00:22:03.206
Ayaka! Ayaka!

392
00:22:03.206 --> 00:22:05.106
Answer!

393
00:22:05.106 --> 00:22:08.306
-Ayaka! -Ayaka!

394
00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:11.506
Where are you?

395
00:22:11.506 --> 00:22:14.106
When I got here...

396
00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.506
There she was, like that.

397
00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.706
Conan, you shouldn't be...

398
00:22:29.006 --> 00:22:30.106
What's going on?

399
00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:31.906
What is it?

400
00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:35.006
Ayaka, Ayaka is...

401
00:22:35.006 --> 00:22:37.706
Ayaka! Ayaka!

402
00:22:37.706 --> 00:22:40.406
Don't move!

403
00:22:40.406 --> 00:22:43.306
The area is now under police control!

404
00:22:43.306 --> 00:22:46.506
Anyone trying to get inside will be prosecuted by me!

405
00:22:46.506 --> 00:22:48.806
What the...

406
00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:53.106
Hey! You on the black horse.

407
00:22:53.106 --> 00:22:54.406
Keep off, you hear!

408
00:22:54.406 --> 00:22:56.306
Yes.

409
00:23:00.106 --> 00:23:03.006
What the...

410
00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:05.106
What happened?

411
00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.306
Darn! Didn't make it!

412
00:23:13.306 --> 00:23:16.706
Uehara, confirm the time!

413
00:23:16.706 --> 00:23:18.106
Yes, sir.

414
00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:21.006
8:59 am.

415
00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:24.606
Sorry, old habit.

416
00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:27.106
No problem.

417
00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:28.106
Old?

418
00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.706
Habit?

419
00:23:29.706 --> 00:23:30.906
It's me!

420
00:23:30.906 --> 00:23:33.206
A death in the forest near the Toradas.

421
00:23:33.206 --> 00:23:36.006
Send the forensic people right away!

422
00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:39.306
Yeah, right! This is serial murder!

423
00:23:39.306 --> 00:23:42.306
Serial murder?

424
00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:43.506
No doubt!

425
00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:45.506
The first death of Yoshiro Torada,

426
00:23:45.506 --> 00:23:50.806
left to die after being maimed in a tornado.

427
00:23:50.806 --> 00:23:55.206
The second case of Koji Tatsuo beaten to death

428
00:23:55.206 --> 00:23:58.006
and buried in a mound.

429
00:23:58.006 --> 00:24:01.606
Just like in the two earlier cases,

430
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:05.006
there it was, at the foot of Ayaka Tatsuo's body,

431
00:24:05.006 --> 00:24:07.806
a dead centipede!

432
00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:09.806
What?

433
00:24:09.806 --> 00:24:11.206
On top of that,

434
00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:16.006
the ground around the centipede was wet with rain

435
00:24:16.006 --> 00:24:21.206
and shows no trace except my own footprints and cane prints!

436
00:24:21.206 --> 00:24:23.706
After the rain,

437
00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:29.706
no one seems to have been up this tree

438
00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:32.806
which means...

439
00:24:32.806 --> 00:24:34.906
It's impossible...

440
00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:38.406
Impossible murder.
