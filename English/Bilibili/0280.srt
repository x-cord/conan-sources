1
00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:02.224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:04.024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:05.824
With soccer and everyone's beliefs,

4
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:08.024
the case is solved!

5
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.024
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:01.811
We, the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:03.611
went to the soccer game with Dr. Agasa,

10
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:06.311
for the first time after a long interval.

11
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.911
The team we cheered for, The Tokyo Spirits,

12
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.411
beat the Noir Tokyo

13
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.311
and won the title of Tokyo Derby!

14
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.811
The train back home was full of supporters of both teams.

15
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.511
After the passengers got off the train,

16
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:43.711
a fatally stabbed body was found left on the floor.

17
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.211
Hey, station manager!

18
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.111
Don't start this train!

19
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:49.311
Someone's been stabbed!

20
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:51.211
What?

21
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:55.911
Please immediately call the personnel at all the wickets

22
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.611
and tell them to check all the tickets

23
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:02.511
belonging to Tokyo Spirits and Noir Tokyo supporters.

24
00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:06.211
Look only for those who bought a ticket before 5 pm

25
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:07.711
and keep them here!

26
00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:10.111
But... Why?

27
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.511
Never mind, just do it now.

28
00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:16.111
If you don't hurry, the killer will get away!

29
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:20.411
The victim killed was a fanatic supporter of Noir Tokyo

30
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.811
who was proud of being a Hooligan

31
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:24.211
and often made news

32
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:26.911
by committing violent crimes one after the other

33
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:28.911
named Mr. Kadotake Akano.

34
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.111
The three suspects held by the police were

35
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.811
Ms. Hasue Kira,

36
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.511
Mr. Mitsuaki Funado,

37
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.611
And Mr. Etsutoshi Oba.

38
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:51.411
There are three suspects...

39
00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:53.211
The only thing that was proven,

40
00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:56.811
was that those three were on the crowded train.

41
00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:59.411
But...

42
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.011
I cannot conclude anything from only that fact.

43
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.111
There must be something more.

44
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.511
Something else.

45
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.611
Another clue to solve the case.

46
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:24.611
"Hooligan in a Labyrinth (Part 2)"

47
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.711
But...

48
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.511
why is that guy...

49
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:35.711
What?

50
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.211
Hey, where's Haibara?

51
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.811
Oh, she said she was going to the bathroom.

52
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:43.711
But, how's the game going?

53
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.011
You've been listening to the radio, haven't you?

54
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:47.211
About that...

55
00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:49.611
I seem to have lost my radio in the crowd

56
00:04:49.611 --> 00:04:51.611
when we got off the train.

57
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.611
I couldn't find it either on the train or on the platform.

58
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:57.011
Boy, you're hopeless.

59
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.511
I think someone must have picked it up.

60
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:06.611
Well, the match is now first half of overtime period,

61
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:08.811
still with the score at 0-0.

62
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:12.211
Ramus made a splendid front pass!

63
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.611
Higo got the pass!

64
00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:15.911
The defense can't catch up with him!

65
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.711
Now, this is a crucial situation!

66
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.811
Higo goes unchallenged straight to the goal!

67
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:22.711
Now, right in front of the goal!

68
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:25.911
Higo shoots for goal!

69
00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:28.611
The ball hit the goal post

70
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:31.711
Have the heavens also forsaken Higo?

71
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:36.211
What massive booing!

72
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:43.611
Mr. Higo kind of resembles you.

73
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:45.911
Doesn't he?

74
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:49.011
Noir means black in French.

75
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:52.211
A betrayer, leaving the black...

76
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.511
What are you saying?

77
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:55.211
But listen, Haibara.

78
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:56.611
Just like you,

79
00:05:56.611 --> 00:06:00.811
Mr. Higo also had a reason to leave the team.

80
00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:04.211
Mr. Higo has an older half brother.

81
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:06.411
His name is Rikuo Endo,

82
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.711
who was a substitute defender

83
00:06:07.711 --> 00:06:10.911
for the major league Noir Tokyo, until last year.

84
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.411
Of course, this fact is little known to the general public

85
00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:15.111
because their family names are different

86
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.111
and they have kept it secret.

87
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.111
I heard about it two years ago,

88
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.611
when I was in the third grade of the junior high,

89
00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:26.011
Mr. Higo and Mr. Endo, who just got into Noir Tokyo,

90
00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:29.411
came to watch my game.

91
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:33.011
This is what Mr. Higo said back then.

92
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:35.411
"Won't you join Noir Tokyo

93
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:40.011
and reach for the top with us?"

94
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:46.511
But this year, Noir Tokyo suddenly notified Mr. Endo

95
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:50.611
that he was disqualified from playing.

96
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:56.311
Which means the reason they recruit Mr. Endo

97
00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:59.811
was to get Mr. Higo.

98
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.311
Mr. Higo who took note of this,

99
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:06.311
moved on to Big Osaka

100
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.711
who hired Mr. Endo as a trainer.

101
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:13.211
Both of them are dreaming to be in the J1 League.

102
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:17.111
Higo got tripped!

103
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:19.911
The player will probably get a yellow card!

104
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:22.411
But, no card.

105
00:07:22.411 --> 00:07:26.611
Despite their team forward striker getting a foul,

106
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:29.211
listen to the roaring cheers of the Big Osaka supporters.

107
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.011
That guy has the whole world against him.

108
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:37.811
Is there no pitch in Japan where he can play?

109
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.811
Wait a second.

110
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.211
I think Today's Tokyo Derby was...

111
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.911
"Tokyo Spirits vs Noir Tokyo" -It's just as I thought.

112
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:51.411
The murderer is that guy who was lying.

113
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.911
And...

114
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.111
if my deduction is correct,

115
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:58.811
I think the evidence is still on that guy's body.

116
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:14.511
Inspector Megure!

117
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:18.411
The train where the murder occurred

118
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.611
has been moved to the depot!

119
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:23.811
And we're almost done checking the areas of the platform

120
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:25.511
around the doors of that train car.

121
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:29.211
So, we did everything we had to do at this station.

122
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.411
All that's left to do is

123
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.711
to take you three suspects to the police station

124
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:36.311
and get the details from each of you.

125
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:37.811
"Hasue Kira (24)" -Wait!

126
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.311
Are you asking us to come to the police station voluntarily?

127
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.511
"Mitsuaki Funato (33)" -Give me a break!

128
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:44.611
I've got to hurry back to work. Gosh.

129
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:48.211
"Etsutoshi Oda (29) -Can we talk to you another day?

130
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.211
No, you can't!

131
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.511
What?

132
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.011
If we wait that long,

133
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:58.611
the critical evidence will disappear.

134
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:01.111
Or is there some special reason

135
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.411
why do you want to get away from the crime scene as soon as possible?

136
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.311
Hey, Shinichi!

137
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:09.211
What's with you, old man?

138
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:11.611
You're talking just like a detective.

139
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.611
You've figured out who the murder is?

140
00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:16.911
About that...

141
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:18.311
Of course!

142
00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:22.111
I got it the moment I heard the stories of these three people.

143
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:25.811
The murderer is a "fake" supporter who is telling a lie.

144
00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:27.211
Telling a lie?

145
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.111
A fake supporter?

146
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:32.611
Oh, I got it! You're talking about him, right?

147
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:33.711
What?

148
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:36.311
I remember you said that

149
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:39.511
you missed seeing the two wings' make a goal.

150
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.911
Yeah, so what?

151
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.911
Naoki who made goal, and Hide who assisted him,

152
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.911
are the two top forwards who move freely around the field.

153
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:52.611
They aren't wings who just move along the sidelines, are they?

154
00:09:52.611 --> 00:09:54.211
Is this true?

155
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:55.711
Yes.

156
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.711
And wing formation is so out-dated now

157
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:02.111
that it is hardly used in soccer games played today.

158
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:06.711
Rather, the truth is, I just became a soccer fan,

159
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.611
so, I thought Hide and Naoki were cool wings

160
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:13.411
because it sounded good.

161
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.711
How dare you make such a remark!

162
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:17.511
You're the murderer, aren't you?

163
00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:19.011
What... What are you talking about?

164
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.711
I just made an incorrect remark!

165
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:22.311
Exactly!

166
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.711
The term "wing" that he used is a mistake

167
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.111
but not a lie.

168
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:29.811
So then who...

169
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:33.311
I'm talking about the one who hasn't even seen the game

170
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.311
but is pretending to have seen it

171
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:38.511
by making such comments about the game.

172
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:40.711
Well, it's no wonder since today was the match

173
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:44.211
between the two teams from Tokyo competing

174
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.411
for the long awaited Tokyo Derby.

175
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:48.911
The stadium was filled to capacity with supporters!

176
00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:51.611
If the criminal had been watching the game together

177
00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:54.711
with the victim, Mr. Akano from the bleachers,

178
00:10:54.711 --> 00:11:00.111
he could lose sight of Mr. Akano in the crowd after the game.

179
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:03.511
Then where was the murderer waiting for him?

180
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:07.011
Most likely in the restroom of the stadium.

181
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:12.211
The guy was probably listening to the game on the radio.

182
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:15.411
Then the guy rushed to the exit and waited for Mr. Akano there.

183
00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:17.311
But who is it?

184
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.811
The murderer who is lying to us.

185
00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:23.011
Okay, then, let me ask you three once again

186
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.811
to see if you were really watching the game.

187
00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:27.611
I was watching the whole thing at the front row stand!

188
00:11:27.611 --> 00:11:30.411
And I saw Naoki make a goal!

189
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:32.911
His shot was so fantastic that

190
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.811
I got into an argument

191
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:36.911
with a Spirits supporter nearby.

192
00:11:36.911 --> 00:11:39.111
I was watching the game, too,

193
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:42.111
from the Noir supporters' seats behind the goal.

194
00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:45.111
Hide came dodging defenders and closing in on goal,

195
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:49.011
passing the ball to Naoki in front of the goal.

196
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:52.611
I... I was watching it from the Spirits seats

197
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:55.211
behind the opposite goal.

198
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:56.611
But I got a phone call from the office,

199
00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.311
so I didn't get to see him make a goal.

200
00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:04.711
But you knew Naoki and Hide made a goal?

201
00:12:04.711 --> 00:12:06.411
Of course I do!

202
00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:08.411
Since after they made goal, the supporters around me

203
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.211
were raving how fantastic Hide and Naoki were.

204
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.611
If you think I'm lying,

205
00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:16.711
just look at my ticket stub, here!

206
00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:18.511
I have one too!

207
00:12:18.511 --> 00:12:19.911
Same here!

208
00:12:19.911 --> 00:12:20.911
Look!

209
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:22.711
So...

210
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:24.911
they say...

211
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.311
Well I know that for all of you who haven't been watching the game,

212
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:29.611
my explanation would be difficult to understand.

213
00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:33.011
So, let me ask these kids who were actually watching the game.

214
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.511
Tell me where our seats were.

215
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.511
Our seats were in the front row!

216
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:38.611
Since we were sitting in the seats right next to the field,

217
00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:41.411
we could see Hide overtaking four Noir players very well!

218
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:46.611
But I didn't see that woman who said she was in the front row!

219
00:12:46.611 --> 00:12:49.911
Isn't that just because my seat was some distance away from yours?

220
00:12:49.911 --> 00:12:51.311
Come on! Give me a break!

221
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:54.411
Is that why you think I'm lying, huh?

222
00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:56.911
No, not really...

223
00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:00.211
Okay, then from which side to which side did Hide cross the field,

224
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:02.411
when overtaking the four players?

225
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:04.511
From right to left!

226
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:06.411
So that means that the Noir goal was on the left side

227
00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.111
from your point of view, right?

228
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.211
Yeah, so what?

229
00:13:11.211 --> 00:13:14.911
I couldn't remember until I saw my ticket either,

230
00:13:14.911 --> 00:13:18.511
but today's Tokyo Derby was hosted by the Tokyo Spirits, right?

231
00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:19.611
What?

232
00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:20.611
Yes.

233
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.611
Normally in the Japan Major League games,

234
00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:25.611
the home team seats are located behind the goal

235
00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:29.311
on the left from the front stand

236
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:34.111
and the opposing team seats are located behind the goal to the right.

237
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:38.911
So, today, the Tokyo Spirits seats ought to have been on the left side.

238
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:43.911
And the Noir Tokyo seats should have been on the right!

239
00:13:43.911 --> 00:13:47.011
You see where I'm headed now, don't you?

240
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:48.811
The strange contradiction

241
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:52.611
that the culprit who is lying does not yet realize.

242
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.620
Strange contradiction?

243
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.120
Would you elaborate a bit more on it?

244
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.220
All right.

245
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.420
Like I said, when viewed from the front seats,

246
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.720
the Tokyo Spirit seats were on the left side

247
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.520
and the Noir Tokyo seats on the right side.

248
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.520
Hide dribbled from right to left.

249
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.920
Then after receiving the ball from Hide,

250
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.820
Naoki shot the ball to the goal to the left.

251
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.020
Just in front of the Spirits supporters' seats.

252
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.820
Which means that there is no way

253
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.920
you could say that you saw Hide dodging the defenders,

254
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.320
coming towards the goal

255
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.220
if you, Mr. Oba, had actually watched the game

256
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.520
from the Noir supporters side!

257
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.120
Listening to the live coverage on the radio,

258
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.320
you came up with your own interpretation of the

259
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.920
the announcer's statement, "Hide is closing in."

260
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.620
It's... It's just a play on words!

261
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.920
Just like him, I made a mistake, I didn't lie!

262
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.820
What I meant to say was Hide was going towards the goal

263
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.820
but I just said it wrong because I was so nervous.

264
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.920
Then check the seat on the ticket!

265
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.820
You'll see that I was in the Noir supporter seats!

266
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.520
No, you were not there.

267
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.520
Or rather, you couldn't have been there

268
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.020
if you were wearing what you are wearing now.

269
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.520
What?

270
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.320
Hey, you! This is...

271
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.820
the uniform of Higo who betrayed Noir Tokyo!

272
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.320
If you went to the Noir seats with this uniform on,

273
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.320
you'd get beaten up!

274
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.620
But Dr. Agasa,

275
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.320
it's all circumstantial evidence.

276
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.220
You need physical evidence.

277
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.820
The evidence should still be left on his arm.

278
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.620
You mean the traces of the wristwatch on his right arm?

279
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.420
But this proves only that he had his arms crossed in the crowded train.

280
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.020
It's on his opposite arm!

281
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.320
The opposite arm?

282
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.520
Just think about it!

283
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.120
If you were trying to get the knife

284
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.820
out of your bag in a crowded train,

285
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.420
it would be conspicuous and suspicious, right?

286
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.520
That's why he had his arms crossed and held the knife

287
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.820
making sure no one else saw the knife,

288
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.120
but at the same time had it ready to get out any time.

289
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.620
Of course, he was wearing a glove and holding the knife.

290
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.120
Yeah... If my deduction is correct,

291
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.220
it should still be somewhere on his upper arm

292
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.020
opposite from his dominant hand.

293
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.820
The traces of the rare scabbard design of the knife he was holding

294
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.320
under his arm very clearly!

295
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.820
Exactly!

296
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.020
So, you're the one who killed him, after all?

297
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.720
I studied soccer,

298
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.620
passed myself off as a supporter,

299
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.520
and I tried to make the plan work for my younger brother.

300
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.620
But who would have thought that

301
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.820
he was the one to blow it up.

302
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.520
Your younger brother?

303
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.020
My twin brother...

304
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.020
Who was killed by that Akano a year ago.

305
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.920
Killed?

306
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.120
On that day a year ago,

307
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.620
my brother came back home from the Noir Tokyo game

308
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.120
with scars all over him.

309
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.020
He told me that he had fallen from the stairs of the stadium.

310
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.320
But, that night,

311
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.020
my brother suddenly collapsed clutching his head in his hands

312
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.320
and lost consciousness.

313
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.820
He died three days later.

314
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.720
The death was caused by a brain hemorrhage due to a fractured skull.

315
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.620
I visited Akano's website, "Tokyo Hooligan",

316
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.020
that my brother often accessed

317
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.820
and read Akano's web journal of the day.

318
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.520
It said: "Today after the game,

319
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.220
I kicked some jerks who criticized my site,

320
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.320
down the stairs of the stadium.

321
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.420
That's what was written.

322
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.120
But, how could you be sure it was your younger brother?

323
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.720
I know,

324
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.520
because when I tried to meet Akano to ascertain what really happened

325
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.820
When he looked at my face,

326
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.720
that guy sniggered saying,

327
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.820
"Oh, you're still alive?"

328
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.220
That's why I avenged my kid brother's death

329
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.620
while wearing his memento.

330
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.320
So then that uniform is...

331
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.720
Yes. My younger brother used to wear this to Noir's game.

332
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.420
Higo's uniform.

333
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.520
It never occurred to me that

334
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.720
I would get caught because of this uniform.

335
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.620
Maybe this uniform

336
00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.420
was a kind of warning from my younger brother

337
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.720
in the world beyond.

338
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.920
What?

339
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.320
Because...

340
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.120
if some Noir Tokyo supporter noticed this uniform

341
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.320
and warned me...

342
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.020
They could have calmed my feeling of murderous anger

343
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.720
and help me snap out of it, saying,

344
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.020
"Just what do you think you're doing?"

345
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.020
By the way, isn't Haibara taking too long?

346
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.420
Oh, yeah.

347
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.420
What? Isn't Haibara back yet?

348
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.720
No, she's not.

349
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.720
Look! There she is!

350
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.320
Over there on the platform!

351
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.620
Oh, you're right.

352
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.020
Hey, what's she doing all the way over there?

353
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.420
The train to Beika leaves from this track.

354
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.920
Don't tell me she's...

355
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.820
Because there is really no room for a traitor.

356
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.720
He can forget everything

357
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.320
and flee to a place far away

358
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.520
from all the booing.

359
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.720
No way!

360
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.720
Haibara!

361
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.320
Haibara!

362
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.320
Haibara!

363
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.920
Haibara!

364
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.120
Darn it!

365
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.320
What are you shouting about?

366
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.420
Did you think I ran away?

367
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.520
Oh, no, I...

368
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.720
Here it is, young lady!

369
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.820
Don't drop it again, okay?

370
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.320
Thank you.

371
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.520
A radio?

372
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.220
I was just looking for the radio Tsuburaya dropped.

373
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.720
When I asked a station officer,

374
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.620
he told me that a sanitary worker could have picked it up.

375
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.320
Oh, really.

376
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.120
You told me, didn't you?

377
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.220
To not to run away.

378
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.020
You told me not to run away from my destiny.

379
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.120
You're gonna protect me, right?

380
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.320
Oh, yeah.

381
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.520
Well, of course,

382
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.820
I'm not a weak little girl

383
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.320
that needs to be protected all the time,

384
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.520
like you think I am, though.

385
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.920
Oh, Haibara.

386
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.820
I forgot to tell you, Mr. Higo did it.

387
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.020
He made the winning goal.

388
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.820
The whole stadium suddenly started to cheer for him.

389
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.720
I knew it from the start

390
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.720
that the booing was a kinda pep talk to him

391
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.420
who hadn't played up to his potential.

392
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.520
So, what? Why are you telling me that?

393
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.320
How stupid!

394
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.620
Don't class me with soccer freaks like you.

395
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:56.820
Higo...

396
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.120
Talk about a hard head...

397
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.720
"Next Episode" -What shall we do?

398
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.220
But if we don't stop it, it will just get worse!

399
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.320
But how can we stop it?

400
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.320
But it's...

401
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.120
This is bad.

402
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.720
This is a real...

403
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.120
Murder case!

404
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.020
Next Conan,

405
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.141
"Little Witnesses"

406
