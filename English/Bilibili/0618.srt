1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.640
Hey, Ran.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.240
Ran?

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.440
Hey!

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840
The tea's over flowing.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.440
That glasses brat seems to have caught a cold.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.740
Huh?

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.340
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.640
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.040
It's been a long time since they last saw each other.

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.340
So, the atmosphere between Ran and Shinichi is strangely awkward.

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.140
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:22.603
What lay waiting for us when we arrived in London

15
00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:24.803
was a coded memo of what looked to be a forewarning

16
00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:27.803
of a massacre that was about to happen.

17
00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:32.903
Ran calls Shinichi to get help on deciphering the code.

18
00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.203
But during the conversation,

19
00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:36.103
I realized that the first sentence of the coded note

20
00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:40.103
was referring to the famous clock tower, Big Ben,

21
00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:43.703
and carelessly told her what I realized, in Shinichi's voice.

22
00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:48.003
Since Ran firmly believed that Shinichi is also in London,

23
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:49.603
she persistently pursues me,

24
00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.203
so I had no choice but to...

25
00:02:55.503 --> 00:03:01.203
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Satan)"

26
00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:04.703
From right about after he got the call from Ran last night,

27
00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:07.103
he suddenly started shaking...

28
00:03:08.303 --> 00:03:12.203
Since he ran around the city of London all sweaty,

29
00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:13.703
then got cold in the night wind,

30
00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:15.203
maybe he caught a cold.

31
00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:17.403
Oh boy. I mean we're going to be

32
00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:19.803
leaving for Japan tomorrow night already, and then...

33
00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:21.703
Well, he drank his medicine

34
00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:24.003
and his fever is coming down, too.

35
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.403
So if he sleeps a day, he'll be fine!

36
00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:27.903
So...

37
00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:30.303
Don't worry about me.

38
00:03:30.303 --> 00:03:34.603
Ran and Pops, please decipher that code!

39
00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:36.403
The seven sentences in that coded memo

40
00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:42.203
is each probably some building somewhere or a place!

41
00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:44.203
How do you know?

42
00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:48.503
Shinichi told me so.

43
00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:50.203
Shinichi did...

44
00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:55.403
By the way, Shinichi was saying in front of Big Ben

45
00:03:55.403 --> 00:03:58.803
that the first line that goes, "The loud ringing of the bell",

46
00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:00.603
means the chime of Big Ben.

47
00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:02.603
In front of Big Ben...

48
00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:06.003
You mean that detective kid is here in London?

49
00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:09.103
I mean, you knew about it, eh?

50
00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:12.703
If I knew, I wouldn't have made a gift list!

51
00:04:12.703 --> 00:04:17.103
At any rate, just leave Conan to me.

52
00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:21.803
Ran and Kogoro, go ahead and decipher the code, all right?

53
00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:28.703
We somehow managed to get through.

54
00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:31.803
But I didn't think you'd go as far as to drink the antidote

55
00:04:31.803 --> 00:04:33.603
you were supposed to use for returning to Japan.

56
00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:35.803
I couldn't help it, could I?

57
00:04:35.803 --> 00:04:37.903
If I didn't drink it, the fact that the boy Conan Edogawa

58
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:43.103
is the childhood form of Shinichi Kudo would've been exposed, right?

59
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:45.103
How do you intend to get back home?

60
00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:47.503
There is no more drug left, you know!

61
00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.803
I can't have Ai bring it over to me either.

62
00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:52.903
Well, I guess I'll stay cooped up in my room

63
00:04:52.903 --> 00:04:54.603
and think of something.

64
00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:57.003
Huh? You're not going out?

65
00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:58.903
You were planning to meet with Ran and the others

66
00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:00.703
to decipher the code, weren't you?

67
00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:02.203
You gotta be kidding!

68
00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:03.403
How can I risk walking outside

69
00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.003
when I don't have the slightest idea

70
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:07.203
when my body will turn into Conan again!

71
00:05:07.203 --> 00:05:11.903
Beside, I really can't face up to her right now.

72
00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:14.703
More important, look at this.

73
00:05:14.703 --> 00:05:17.003
-This morning's paper. -Huh?

74
00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:18.103
From the fingerprints that were detected

75
00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:20.603
on the piece of paper with the code written on it,

76
00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:23.503
they seemed to have come up with a suspect!

77
00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:25.603
His name is Hades Sabara.

78
00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.703
He's a serial killer on the run!

79
00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:32.003
First, we've got to investigate on this guy.

80
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:34.803
But, if they've come up with a culprit,

81
00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:36.403
I'm sure he'll soon be arrested.

82
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.903
Come on!

83
00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:41.403
This guy deliberately left his fingerprints behind, you know?

84
00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:42.903
Which means he's planning to do something,

85
00:05:42.903 --> 00:05:45.103
despite risking being arrested!

86
00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:50.103
If you say that the loud ringing bell is Big Ben,

87
00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:52.703
it's quite convincing.

88
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:56.103
But there can't possibly be buildings

89
00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:58.303
that look like eggs or pickles.

90
00:05:58.303 --> 00:06:00.003
-Excuse me! -Yes?

91
00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:05.403
Is there an egg-shaped building here in London?

92
00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:09.203
Oh yes, there's a city hall near the Tower Bridge.

93
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.703
It's there!

94
00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:15.803
"London City Hall"

95
00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:16.903
It's unbelievable that

96
00:06:16.903 --> 00:06:19.503
there would be a building shaped like this.

97
00:06:19.503 --> 00:06:21.803
Then, for the 3rd sentence that goes...

98
00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:24.203
"Fill an empty stomach on a boiled egg

99
00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:26.303
as cold as a corpse" would mean...

100
00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.203
this City Hall here!

101
00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:31.403
What are these words? A code?

102
00:06:32.703 --> 00:06:35.403
Do they mean a name?

103
00:06:35.403 --> 00:06:38.303
The doll's name is Mazarin Stone!

104
00:06:38.303 --> 00:06:40.203
Mazarin Stone...

105
00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:42.003
Mazarin Stone!

106
00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:44.103
Hi!

107
00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:46.203
How did you get the doll?

108
00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:50.203
The doll? I found it there beside the bench,

109
00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:52.303
under the shrubs.

110
00:06:52.303 --> 00:06:54.503
Can I see that?

111
00:06:54.503 --> 00:06:56.403
You can keep it!

112
00:06:56.403 --> 00:06:59.203
I've got plenty already!

113
00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:01.103
-Goodbye! -Goodbye!

114
00:07:02.103 --> 00:07:03.903
What's that?

115
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:07.203
It may have something to do with the code!

116
00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:08.403
You see,

117
00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:11.903
the culprit who was passing out the paper with the code

118
00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:15.903
said, "If you can't solve it, ask Holmes", right?

119
00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:19.403
If so, he may have scattered things

120
00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:21.203
that have to do with Holmes near the places

121
00:07:21.203 --> 00:07:24.103
indicated by the code, don't you think?

122
00:07:24.103 --> 00:07:26.803
Shinichi told me some time ago,

123
00:07:26.803 --> 00:07:30.803
that "Mazarin Stone" is the titles of one of Holmes' story.

124
00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:35.503
Hey, I went out of my way to make you lunch,

125
00:07:35.503 --> 00:07:37.903
but you haven't touched it at all!

126
00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:41.103
Sorry, I was just checking on a case

127
00:07:41.103 --> 00:07:43.403
that Inspector Megure told me to investigate.

128
00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:45.303
Geez!

129
00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:46.803
Getting carried away making deductions

130
00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:49.703
to point of forgetting that you're hungry.

131
00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:52.203
You're going to starve to death one day!

132
00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:56.503
In a story called Mazarin Stone, Holmes said,

133
00:07:56.503 --> 00:08:01.503
"The brain works better on an empty stomach!"

134
00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:03.903
Holmes again?

135
00:08:03.903 --> 00:08:07.503
"I'm all brains, Watson."

136
00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:11.203
"The rest is just a continuation of add-on sentences!"

137
00:08:13.003 --> 00:08:15.903
If only the top part of the sentences is important...

138
00:08:17.203 --> 00:08:20.103
The head part is what is important.

139
00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:23.903
Hey, just what're you doing?

140
00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:26.303
Huh? Something's written!

141
00:08:26.303 --> 00:08:27.603
What?

142
00:08:27.603 --> 00:08:29.003
T.

143
00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:30.503
T?

144
00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:32.403
I get it!

145
00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:35.703
Some alphabets are hidden in the places indicated by the code,

146
00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:37.803
and if connected the alphabets,

147
00:08:37.803 --> 00:08:40.203
probably form words. What do you think?

148
00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:44.203
But after the "egg" is the "pickle", right?

149
00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:47.003
A thin, flat building that looks like a pickle

150
00:08:47.003 --> 00:08:49.903
couldn't possibly exist.

151
00:08:49.903 --> 00:08:54.103
But the code said "Bite on the whole pickle."

152
00:08:54.103 --> 00:08:56.603
So, it must be pickles before they are sliced.

153
00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:58.103
Don't be silly!

154
00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:02.603
Pickles are young cucumbers immersed in vinegar, you know!

155
00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:05.703
There's no way that such a long, narrow, round building

156
00:09:05.703 --> 00:09:07.603
could exist in this world, you see...

157
00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.103
That must be the one!

158
00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:17.603
No way!

159
00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:22.503
This Hades Sabara guy is really dangerous.

160
00:09:22.503 --> 00:09:25.703
He seems to have started off as a serious office worker

161
00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:27.703
but after his mother fell ill, of a rare disease,

162
00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:29.703
he went out and borrowed money from his acquaintances

163
00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:32.103
to gather funds for his mother's surgery.

164
00:09:32.103 --> 00:09:34.203
Then he invested the money into stocks and bookies,

165
00:09:34.203 --> 00:09:36.203
but lost everything.

166
00:09:36.203 --> 00:09:39.003
Because of this, his mother couldn't undergo surgery,

167
00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:41.403
and she passed away last year in July.

168
00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:45.503
He slaughtered one man after the other,

169
00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:47.403
not only his acquaintances

170
00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:49.303
who kept hounding him for collection,

171
00:09:49.303 --> 00:09:53.803
but also the people who suggested that he invest in stocks.

172
00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:56.003
On top of that, he blew up the hospitals

173
00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:59.003
that refused to perform surgery on his mother one after the other,

174
00:09:59.003 --> 00:10:01.603
which resulted in a large number of casualties.

175
00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:03.403
Blew up...

176
00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.203
You mean he uses bombs, too?

177
00:10:05.203 --> 00:10:06.403
Yeah.

178
00:10:06.403 --> 00:10:08.603
While Hades was on the run,

179
00:10:08.603 --> 00:10:10.403
he ran into a woman named Hestia,

180
00:10:10.403 --> 00:10:13.703
a military outcast and expert on explosives.

181
00:10:13.703 --> 00:10:16.303
She helped Hades carry out his revenge!

182
00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:19.303
As for that woman,

183
00:10:19.303 --> 00:10:22.803
it says that she blew herself up

184
00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:25.303
when the police found her at her hide-out.

185
00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:27.603
But since her body seems to have blown to pieces...

186
00:10:27.603 --> 00:10:29.603
You mean the body that turned up was of someone else,

187
00:10:29.603 --> 00:10:32.303
and that she is still alive?

188
00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:33.503
Yeah.

189
00:10:33.503 --> 00:10:36.503
But why is it that such a vicious criminal

190
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.703
still remains on the loose?

191
00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:40.303
It seems that he's gone through

192
00:10:40.303 --> 00:10:42.003
repeated plastic surgeries while on the run.

193
00:10:42.003 --> 00:10:46.303
Well, with this guy, you can never tell what he'll do.

194
00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:48.603
After all, he may have a grudge

195
00:10:48.603 --> 00:10:50.503
against the entire country of Great Britain

196
00:10:50.503 --> 00:10:54.303
which allows bookies to prey on anybody, in every way possible.

197
00:10:59.203 --> 00:11:00.903
It's from Ran.

198
00:11:03.703 --> 00:11:06.103
Sorry. Answer it for me, will you?

199
00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:10.103
Huh? It'll be strange if I answer that phone!

200
00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.403
I mean, hurry up and answer it!

201
00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:16.103
She could've come up with something concerning the code!

202
00:11:16.103 --> 00:11:17.503
True.

203
00:11:19.103 --> 00:11:20.803
-Hello? -If you're there,

204
00:11:20.803 --> 00:11:22.903
hurry up and answer the phone, stupid!

205
00:11:22.903 --> 00:11:26.503
That's Ran's cell phone, isn't it?

206
00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:29.403
Ran's all blushed and couldn't work up the courage to call you,

207
00:11:29.403 --> 00:11:32.503
so I've decided to personally call you myself!

208
00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:34.403
I mean, she also says that there's no one other than you

209
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:36.903
who knows about Sherlock Holmes the most!

210
00:11:36.903 --> 00:11:38.603
About Holmes?

211
00:11:38.603 --> 00:11:41.503
Yeah! The "egg" in the 3rd line

212
00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:44.003
refers to the egg-shaped City Hall.

213
00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.903
The "pickle" in the 4th line refers to

214
00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:47.703
a building called the Gherkins

215
00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:49.403
that is shaped like a young cucumber.

216
00:11:49.403 --> 00:11:51.303
We've figured this out.

217
00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:55.403
But the problem is, things having to do with Holmes

218
00:11:55.403 --> 00:11:56.903
are scattered near all these places.

219
00:11:56.903 --> 00:11:58.303
Like, what kind of things?

220
00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:01.503
A doll was found by the City Hall, and on its chest...

221
00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:04.503
A something Stone was written...

222
00:12:06.603 --> 00:12:08.703
Mazarin Stone was written!

223
00:12:08.703 --> 00:12:10.403
Since you once mentioned that

224
00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:12.103
there was a scene in that story where Holmes said

225
00:12:12.103 --> 00:12:14.303
"all the sentences except the top part are add-ons",

226
00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:16.003
that's why I...

227
00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:17.903
I pulled the head of the doll off

228
00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.803
and found the letter "T"!

229
00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:22.403
I see.

230
00:12:22.403 --> 00:12:24.203
Taking into consideration Holmes' dialogues

231
00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:26.603
that are in the story of that title...

232
00:12:26.603 --> 00:12:30.003
they lead to key words that provide hints to solving the case.

233
00:12:30.003 --> 00:12:33.503
Yep! I found a lot of strange scratched up pens on the ground,

234
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.603
near the building called the Gherkin too.

235
00:12:36.603 --> 00:12:39.603
The words "Dancing Men" are written on the barrel of the pen.

236
00:12:39.603 --> 00:12:42.603
This is the title of another one of Holmes' story, isn't it?

237
00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:45.503
Yeah. Dancing men.

238
00:12:45.503 --> 00:12:48.703
So, I thought there may be something hidden here too

239
00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:51.403
and took off the caps on the top and bottom part,

240
00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.203
but found nothing.

241
00:12:53.203 --> 00:12:56.103
Then, take the caps of the top and bottom

242
00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:57.903
and try matching the two up!

243
00:12:57.903 --> 00:13:00.503
The scratches will most likely match up in a certain place.

244
00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:05.403
I found it! It's the letter N!

245
00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:07.603
But, how did you know?

246
00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:11.103
He said so in the story!

247
00:13:11.103 --> 00:13:14.003
"Get rid of all the deductions part way,

248
00:13:14.003 --> 00:13:17.703
and indicate only the starting point and the conclusion.

249
00:13:17.703 --> 00:13:19.303
Though it may seem meretricious,

250
00:13:19.303 --> 00:13:22.503
it will have a sufficiently surprising effect!"

251
00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:26.503
I see! That's why the barrel in the middle

252
00:13:26.603 --> 00:13:29.503
had to be taken away before matching top and bottom caps together!

253
00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:31.903
Then, maybe there's something near Big Ben

254
00:13:31.903 --> 00:13:35.003
that was mentioned in the beginning too?

255
00:13:35.003 --> 00:13:37.603
I thought so too and came here,

256
00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:40.203
but I can't find anything.

257
00:13:40.203 --> 00:13:42.703
There's a strange arrow drawn on the road

258
00:13:42.703 --> 00:13:46.303
in front of the gate of Big Ben that dad found, but...

259
00:13:46.303 --> 00:13:48.303
-An arrow? -Yep.

260
00:13:48.303 --> 00:13:51.203
You know that there's a bridge right beside Big Ben, right?

261
00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:53.403
It seems to be pointing in that direction.

262
00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:57.203
I get it!

263
00:13:59.303 --> 00:14:00.803
Part way across the bridge

264
00:14:00.803 --> 00:14:02.303
beside the drain with the lid removed,

265
00:14:02.303 --> 00:14:04.203
there was something written.

266
00:14:04.203 --> 00:14:06.903
The Valley of Fear.

267
00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:09.403
It's The Valley of Fear!

268
00:14:09.403 --> 00:14:11.803
I found it! I found it, Shinichi!

269
00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:14.603
Where is the keyword hidden?

270
00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.403
The Valley of Fear...

271
00:14:16.403 --> 00:14:18.603
It was a long story.

272
00:14:18.603 --> 00:14:21.503
I wonder if any bridge came out in that story?

273
00:14:21.503 --> 00:14:24.303
No, it doesn't necessarily have to be a bridge.

274
00:14:24.303 --> 00:14:28.203
A drain... river... water...

275
00:14:28.203 --> 00:14:29.403
Water?

276
00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:31.803
Don't you see anything in the river?

277
00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:33.103
Huh?

278
00:14:33.103 --> 00:14:36.603
"If something heavy is gone near the water,

279
00:14:36.603 --> 00:14:41.303
there's no doubt that something was sunk into the water."

280
00:14:41.303 --> 00:14:43.403
This is Holmes' dialogue.

281
00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:47.003
That's why I think that there's something sunk into the Thames.

282
00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:52.503
On the lamppost that is on the railing of the bridge...

283
00:14:52.503 --> 00:14:54.403
There is a thin rope tied on,

284
00:14:54.403 --> 00:14:57.103
and the tip of the rope is sunk into the river!

285
00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:10.003
It's the alphabet "A"! "A" is carved on it!

286
00:15:10.003 --> 00:15:13.203
So, the letters you found are T, N, and A.

287
00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:14.803
Hey, Shinichi.

288
00:15:14.803 --> 00:15:19.103
I think the next place is going to be something like a cake,

289
00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:21.203
but where should I go?

290
00:15:22.503 --> 00:15:24.503
Talking on the phone is getting us nowhere!

291
00:15:24.503 --> 00:15:27.203
You wait there, because I'll be right over!

292
00:15:35.508 --> 00:15:37.608
The phone will do just fine.

293
00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:40.708
You see, we somehow managed to find

294
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.708
the 3 keywords up to now, too.

295
00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:46.608
Huh? If that detective kid is here in London,

296
00:15:46.608 --> 00:15:49.108
wouldn't it be faster if we got together

297
00:15:49.108 --> 00:15:50.808
and solved the code with him?

298
00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:55.508
Or, do you have a reason for not wanting him to come?

299
00:15:55.508 --> 00:15:57.008
No, it's nothing like that!

300
00:15:57.008 --> 00:15:58.408
Oh?

301
00:15:58.408 --> 00:16:00.608
You're the girl I ran into yesterday!

302
00:16:00.608 --> 00:16:03.308
Minerva Grass!

303
00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:06.408
Minerva Grass, that tennis player?

304
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:08.508
Is it alright for you to be walking around outside?

305
00:16:08.508 --> 00:16:11.508
The finals for the ladies' single match is tomorrow, isn't it?

306
00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:15.208
Yes. I'm taking a break from training right now.

307
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.108
Are you all right?

308
00:16:17.108 --> 00:16:19.308
The thing that was bothering you last night.

309
00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:22.608
Don't tell me that he's your boyfriend?

310
00:16:22.608 --> 00:16:24.708
He's my father.

311
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:28.108
Besides, I'm more concerned over the code right now.

312
00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:29.608
Code?

313
00:16:29.608 --> 00:16:32.408
Then, it's the same as my younger brother Apollo!

314
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.408
My brother received a piece of paper from a strange man,

315
00:16:34.408 --> 00:16:35.808
and seems to have given that paper with codes written on it

316
00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:38.108
to a boy who claimed to be Holmes' disciple.

317
00:16:38.108 --> 00:16:40.308
Holmes' disciple?

318
00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:42.408
I think his name was Conan.

319
00:16:42.408 --> 00:16:43.608
I see!

320
00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:46.808
The Apollo that Conan was talking about was you!

321
00:16:46.808 --> 00:16:49.508
Huh? Do you know him?

322
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.608
Yes.

323
00:16:50.608 --> 00:16:53.908
But today's he's sleeping back at the hotel because of a cold.

324
00:16:55.408 --> 00:16:57.408
Did you hear that? Shinichi!

325
00:16:57.408 --> 00:16:59.508
I coincidentally ran into a boy named Apollo

326
00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:03.308
that gave the paper with the code on it to Conan.

327
00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:04.808
Shinichi?

328
00:17:04.808 --> 00:17:06.608
Sorry.

329
00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:09.908
I've come up with an urgent matter,

330
00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:13.208
and can't go over there.

331
00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:14.808
Is that so?

332
00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:18.208
Yeah. I just got mail from a client of another case

333
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:21.408
who says he's coming over to see me now.

334
00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.908
Well, if it's urgent, it can't be helped.

335
00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:25.708
Well, I'll be at the hotel,

336
00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.908
so just call me anytime!

337
00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:29.508
The one sending out the code

338
00:17:29.508 --> 00:17:32.208
is a nefarious criminal called Hades Sabara,

339
00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:35.108
we've got to decipher the code as soon as possible.

340
00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:36.608
If that boy Apollo is with you,

341
00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:38.208
have him go around with you!

342
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:40.808
Because I'm sure that he knows London more than you two do!

343
00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:43.108
Okay, I got you!

344
00:17:44.208 --> 00:17:46.008
You know what, Apollo!

345
00:17:46.008 --> 00:17:48.208
Will you come along and help us decipher the code?

346
00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:50.008
Yep! Okay!

347
00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:52.108
I'll be at the hotel.

348
00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:54.308
I've got a masseur coming.

349
00:17:54.308 --> 00:17:57.308
Please take good care of him!

350
00:17:57.308 --> 00:17:58.708
Sure thing!

351
00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:03.808
But the next code is cake, isn't it?

352
00:18:03.808 --> 00:18:07.308
Is there a building in London that's shaped like that?

353
00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:08.608
Cake?

354
00:18:08.608 --> 00:18:10.208
Yep, I know where it is!

355
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:11.308
-Huh? -Huh?

356
00:18:14.008 --> 00:18:17.508
Wow! It really looks like a wedding cake!

357
00:18:17.508 --> 00:18:19.508
Of course it looks just like one!

358
00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:21.408
The wedding cake is said to have been designed

359
00:18:21.408 --> 00:18:24.108
after the shape of this church!

360
00:18:24.108 --> 00:18:27.208
Even the name is St. Bride Church.

361
00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:29.508
It really sounds like a joke.

362
00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.008
Apollo, I'm amazed you knew about it!

363
00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:35.108
It's because big sis used to bring me here a lot.

364
00:18:35.108 --> 00:18:37.808
She says that she going to get married to Ales

365
00:18:37.808 --> 00:18:39.508
one day at this church.

366
00:18:39.508 --> 00:18:41.108
Who's Ales?

367
00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:43.108
Big sis' ex-coach!

368
00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:47.308
Daddy used to be Ales' coach before though!

369
00:18:47.308 --> 00:18:50.408
Your father died in a traffic accident.

370
00:18:50.408 --> 00:18:54.208
Yep! On his way to watch Ales' match.

371
00:18:54.208 --> 00:18:58.008
Big sis was at home that day with mother because of a cold,

372
00:18:58.008 --> 00:19:01.308
and I was still in mother's stomach back then.

373
00:19:01.308 --> 00:19:02.808
That's why I heard that Ales...

374
00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.408
suddenly retired from being a player

375
00:19:04.408 --> 00:19:07.708
and became big sis' coach!

376
00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:10.908
Because it seems to have been daddy's dream

377
00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:13.508
to make big sis a winner at the Wimbledon!

378
00:19:13.508 --> 00:19:15.608
Then, his dream has been granted!

379
00:19:15.608 --> 00:19:17.008
Yep!

380
00:19:17.008 --> 00:19:23.308
But Ales still blames himself for the death of daddy.

381
00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:25.808
So, he got into a fight with big sis

382
00:19:25.808 --> 00:19:27.908
and quit being her coach.

383
00:19:27.908 --> 00:19:30.808
I know that Ales likes big sis too, and yet...

384
00:19:30.808 --> 00:19:33.208
He's bluffing being strong saying stuff like, "In Tennis, love is zero.

385
00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:34.908
No matter how much you accumulate on zero,

386
00:19:34.908 --> 00:19:38.708
all you get from it is defeat."

387
00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:41.508
In tennis, love is zero.

388
00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:44.408
I see. That's why she said what she did.

389
00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:49.108
Then, you're troubled over love?

390
00:19:49.108 --> 00:19:52.508
But I'm no longer troubled, though.

391
00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:55.608
Love is zero.

392
00:19:55.608 --> 00:19:57.608
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

393
00:19:57.608 --> 00:19:59.608
the result is miserable defeat.

394
00:20:03.108 --> 00:20:06.208
Rather, I completely forgot to tell her

395
00:20:06.208 --> 00:20:08.108
what I was supposed to!

396
00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:11.008
Who are you going to tell what to?

397
00:20:11.008 --> 00:20:12.208
It's nothing.

398
00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:14.608
Don't we have to look for it?

399
00:20:14.608 --> 00:20:18.008
Somewhere in this church there is a hidden keyword

400
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.208
that has something to do with Holmes, right?

401
00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:23.108
Right. We've got to look for it!

402
00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:31.608
"A Scandal in Bohemia"

403
00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:32.908
What?

404
00:20:32.908 --> 00:20:35.208
You found paper on the ground around the church

405
00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:37.308
that was shaped like a wedding cake?

406
00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:39.908
And? What's written on the paper?

407
00:20:39.908 --> 00:20:41.808
It's handwritten and reads...

408
00:20:41.808 --> 00:20:45.008
"A Scandal in Bohemia."

409
00:20:45.008 --> 00:20:47.308
A Scandal in Bohemia...

410
00:20:47.308 --> 00:20:50.108
is the story that Irene Adler appears in.

411
00:20:50.108 --> 00:20:52.108
And, is there anything besides the title

412
00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:53.708
that is written on that paper

413
00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:55.508
or is there something strange about it?

414
00:20:55.508 --> 00:20:58.008
The color of the paper is light pink

415
00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:01.208
and the words seem to be written in black ink.

416
00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:04.908
There's nothing else strange about it.

417
00:21:04.908 --> 00:21:07.408
The paper is thick and you can't see through it.

418
00:21:07.408 --> 00:21:09.608
You can't tell because you're just looking at it

419
00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:11.608
and not really scrutinizing it.

420
00:21:11.608 --> 00:21:14.808
How rude! I am scrutinizing it!

421
00:21:14.808 --> 00:21:15.908
No.

422
00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:17.508
That's the dialogue that

423
00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:20.308
Holmes said to Watson in that story.

424
00:21:20.308 --> 00:21:21.608
There was a scene where Holmes

425
00:21:21.608 --> 00:21:24.008
showed a letter of that color to Watson.

426
00:21:24.008 --> 00:21:25.208
If I want to take a closer look at it,

427
00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:27.508
I'll have to take it out of the plastic bag.

428
00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:30.308
Huh? Is it in a plastic bag?

429
00:21:30.308 --> 00:21:33.108
-Yep. -Then, take the paper out of the bag

430
00:21:33.108 --> 00:21:34.708
and wet it with water!

431
00:21:34.708 --> 00:21:38.008
The plastic bag is a hint that tells you to wet it!

432
00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:46.208
The letters are fading because of the water.

433
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:49.208
Only the letter "S" is left clearly legible!

434
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:50.408
It seems that only the letter "S"

435
00:21:50.408 --> 00:21:52.508
is written with an oil based pen.

436
00:21:52.508 --> 00:21:57.008
Yeah! The paper is thick in order to hide this!

437
00:21:57.008 --> 00:21:58.108
If the paper is thin,

438
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.308
only the letter that is written with an oil based pen will smear

439
00:22:00.308 --> 00:22:03.208
and all the way to the back of the paper.

440
00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:05.308
Which means...

441
00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:07.308
that the keyword for the St. Bride Church

442
00:22:07.308 --> 00:22:09.308
that is shaped like a cake is...

443
00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:10.608
"S"!

444
00:22:10.608 --> 00:22:13.208
The egg-shaped City Hall is...

445
00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:14.308
"T"!

446
00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:17.708
The pickle shaped building Gherkin is...

447
00:22:17.708 --> 00:22:19.108
"N"!

448
00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:21.908
And the loud ringing sound of Big Ben...

449
00:22:21.908 --> 00:22:23.208
"A"!

450
00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:26.708
In the coded sentences Big Ben comes out twice,

451
00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:29.008
so I guess we can say that the letter "A" will appear twice.

452
00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:34.308
Satan!

453
00:22:34.308 --> 00:22:36.308
It's the devil.

454
00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.708
"Next Episode" -A massacre...

455
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.508
may occur here in London, you know!

456
00:24:07.508 --> 00:24:10.408
Did you see anyone suspicious

457
00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:13.708
at the place where you found the coded sentences?

458
00:24:13.708 --> 00:24:15.108
Come to think of it,

459
00:24:15.108 --> 00:24:17.808
there was a woman wearing sunglasses there.

460
00:24:17.808 --> 00:24:20.708
Maybe that guy Hades is planning to attach a bomb

461
00:24:20.708 --> 00:24:23.108
to a balloon and let go of it?

462
00:24:23.108 --> 00:24:25.808
See, look!

463
00:24:25.808 --> 00:24:27.408
No way?

464
00:24:27.408 --> 00:24:28.908
Next Conan,

465
00:24:28.908 --> 00:24:32.929
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Code Break)"

466
00:24:33.635 --> 00:24:36.235
Next Conan's Hint:

467
00:24:36.235 --> 00:24:38.035
"Saturn"

468
00:24:38.035 --> 00:24:40.835
Shinichi, who's more important to you, me or Holmes?

469
00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:42.772
Why, that's obvious. Of course it's...
