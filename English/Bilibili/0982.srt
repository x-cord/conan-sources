8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,370
Judging by the situation,

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,500
the culprit was someone
working at this restaurant

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,510
that recreates the world of
Natsume Soseki's novel "Bocchan."

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,070
Suspicion initially fell
on the manager Red Shirt,

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,220
who was involved in a romantic rivalry
over the waitress Madonna-san.

all had motives for murder
and didn't have alibis.

24
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,520
However, the next day, Red Shirt
was found hanging from the neck,

25
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,120
and the police determined
that he was the culprit

But I won't be fooled.

30
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,410
It wasn't Red Shirt who killed Uranari-san,

31
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,510
and Red Shirt's hanging was
faked by the true culprit.

32
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,560
The search for the truth begins now.

33
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,550
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

34
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,500
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,240
Behind the restaurant murders are
relationships that extend beyond the novel!

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,810
Always determining the one truth

37
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,610
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

38
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,950
his name is Detective Conan!

00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:11,467
Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant

Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant

Welcome to Bocchan Restaurant
(Part Two)

42
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,097
How do you know that?

43
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:25,977
The night before last, Uranari-san
was actually killed here.

44
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,607
Because that cat happened
to be here at the same time,

45
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:32,607
they were harmed by the culprit.

46
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:37,777
The culprit who stabbed Uranari-san
used a car or something

47
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,867
to transport the body to Bocchan Restaurant

48
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:45,227
in order to convince us that
Sanshiro Lake was the crime scene.

49
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:50,627
So they could frame Red Shirt,
who lives at the restaurant.

50
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:54,957
Yeah. No culprit deliberately
makes themselves look suspicious.

51
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,407
You're right.

52
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,967
Which means Red Shirt is innocent.

53
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,847
Then there was no reason
for him to kill himself.

54
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,197
Which means...

55
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:10,227
That suicide was faked by
the true culprit as well.

56
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:15,737
So that Red Shirt would be framed
and the investigation would end.

57
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:21,987
But who among Bocchan, Yamaarashi,
and Nodaiko is the culprit?

58
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:25,757
In any case, we should tell Inspector Megure
and the old man about our reasoning so farâ€”

59
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:26,877
Conan-kun!

60
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:31,077
I want us to be the ones who find the
culprit who was so cruel to that kitty.

61
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,677
You're right.

62
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:35,957
Let's find the culprit responsible for
that and nail both of them at once.

63
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,247
Indeed.

64
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,217
Yeah.

65
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,467
Let's go talk to those three again.

66
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:43,217
Yeah!

67
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:48,947
Got it.

68
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:54,207
The autopsy discovered something
strange about Red Shirt's body.

69
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,397
Something strange?

70
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:59,107
It's about the ladder that
was left by his feet.

71
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:03,147
When a person is hanged
using a step of that height,

72
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:07,077
not much force should be applied to the neck.

73
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:13,097
But there were signs that a rather strong
force was applied to the body's neck.

74
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,707
What does that mean?

75
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:18,377
I'm not sure, but it's possible
that a third party was involved.

76
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:19,797
Which means...

77
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:24,967
I see! Red Shirt's murder was
made to look like a suicide,

78
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:28,717
and the culprit is one of
Bocchan, Yamaarashi, or Nodaiko.

79
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:31,747
What?

80
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,357
They're in the waiting room.

81
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,287
The police and Mori-san are talking to them.

82
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,737
They beat us to it.

83
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:48,307
So, you don't have alibis for
around midnight last night,

84
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:52,867
which is the time of Red Shirt's death?

85
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,887
What's with the weird phrasing?

86
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,907
You think we did it?

87
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,627
Didn't the boss kill himself?

88
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:04,107
No. Judging by the strength of the
force applied to his neck,

89
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,257
we believe there was a third party involved.

90
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,967
A powerful force was applied
to his neck?

91
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,967
They didn't just lift the body
and hang him by the neck?

92
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,217
Then how did the culprit...?

93
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:25,667
The motive for Red Shirt's murder
was revenge for Uranari-san's death.

94
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,077
Revenge?

95
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:32,657
I feel like he's already wrong based on his
assumption that Red Shirt killed Uranari-san.

96
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:36,207
Furthermore, how did he come up with revenge?

97
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:42,217
You guys know that we hated Uranari.

98
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,627
He yelled at us all the time.

99
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:49,007
Why would we consider revenge?

100
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:56,967
He's just claiming he hated him and
actually enjoyed being yelled at.

101
00:06:56,967 --> 00:07:01,357
The culprit had that kind
of peculiar side to them.

102
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,607
Are you serious?

103
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:08,417
Uh, regarding the motive...

104
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:13,747
There's no way we'd kill the boss!

105
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:20,397
This guy's an ill-natured twisted man,

106
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,507
and this guy's an effeminate crybaby.

107
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:26,007
And I'm inflexible and stubborn.

108
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,507
There aren't many jobs that we can do.

109
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:33,737
But the boss hired us one year ago.

110
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:37,417
He said he was opening a place called Bocchan
Restaurant and asked if we wanted to work there.

111
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:41,687
He recruited us just after looking at
us while I was walking around town.

112
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,737
We may have despised Uranari,

113
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:50,067
but we didn't quit because our
considerate boss paid us a high salary.

114
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:54,827
But now that he's dead, this
restaurant is done for.

115
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:59,207
What are we supposed to do?

116
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:03,707
What kind of idiot would
hurt themselves like that?

117
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,207
Exactly.

118
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:07,357
I-I see...

119
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,787
Those three probably aren't lying.

120
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:15,887
They didn't kill Red Shirt.

121
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:20,587
Besides, even if it's possible that they
hated Uranari-san enough to kill him,

122
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:24,857
they wouldn't have tried
to frame Red Shirt for it.

123
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:30,237
In other words, those three
are innocent of both murders.

124
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:35,237
But that leaves zero people
who had motive and no alibi.

125
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,867
Who's the culprit?

126
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,417
Who hated Uranari-san enough to kill him?

127
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:46,417
And kill Red Shirt in order to frame him?

128
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:49,927
It could be the opposite.

129
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,297
The opposite?

130
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:55,587
It was Red Shirt that the
culprit wanted to kill.

131
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,747
To do that, it was best to
make it look like a suicide,

132
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,817
but they needed a motive for suicide.

133
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:04,077
So in order to create a false motive,

134
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,937
they murdered Uranari-san and directed
suspicion towards Red Shirt.

135
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,687
That sounds possible.

136
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:14,027
But regardless of who
their true target wasâ€”

137
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:19,977
If all the waitstaff are innocent,

138
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,877
that means someone else
must be the culprit, right?

139
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:26,437
Maybe this guy hated him.

140
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:29,257
He's being made to dance even
though he's the head chef.

141
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,537
Tanuki...

142
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,087
We brought a gift for the
little detective crew.

00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,297
He must've come to spy on us.

146
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,977
Also, you like these, don't you?

147
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:49,607
I don't like grasshoppers!

148
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,187
You were eating them earlier.

149
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:58,617
By the way, where were you last
night and the night before last?

150
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,657
Sleeping at home. What about it?

151
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,157
Nothing.

152
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:05,377
They're confirming the alibis
of everyone involved.

153
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:08,347

They're confirming the alibis
of everyone involved.

154
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:08,837
Then no one can verify mine. I live alone.

Then no one can verify mine. I live alone.

156
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:18,487
We were lucky again.

157
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,227
You were at my place last night, right?

158
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,667
You stayed over again?

159
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,717
What is it?!

160
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,197
What's gotten into them?

161
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,817
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

162
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,787
Is it Tanuki after all?

163
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:51,297
What I figured out is how the
culprit hanged Red Shirt.

164
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:54,087
So you didn't find the culprit?

165
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,107
You can't expect things to go that smoothly.

166
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,277
What were you going to say earlier?

167
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:05,347
About regardless of whether
it was Uranari-san or Red Shirt?

168
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:11,607
Either way, maybe the culprit used
their romantic rivalry against them.

169
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:16,107
It doesn't sound like there were
any other problems between them.

170
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:23,617
Their romantic rivalry started when that
lady started working here six months ago, right?

171
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:27,997
I believe she said it was because her
younger sister died of an illness.

172
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:33,017
She wanted to fulfill the desire of her
sister who loved the novel "Bocchan,"

173
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:36,007
and said she wanted to work here.

174
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,887
So she applied for the job instead.

175
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:44,487
The sister passed away from
subarachnoid hemorrhaging, right?

176
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,057
Yeah. Is it a rare disease?

177
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,157
No, not really.

178
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,487
But if she was her younger sister,
then she must've still been young.

179
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:55,897
What is it?

180
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,157
I see. If they really wanted to...

181
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,657
You seem to have figured something out.

182
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:11,587
The question is how to prove it.

183
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:23,594
If that's true, that
would explain everything.

184
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,534
But we need evidence.

185
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:30,694
Yeah. Let's split up and investigate.

186
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:32,984
I'm counting on you guys.

187
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,694
Waiting Room

188
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:44,424
Hardware Store Beika

189
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,554
They don't have it here.
Hardware Store Beika

190
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:48,004
Let's check the next store.
Hardware Store Beika

191
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,004
Toto General Hospital

192
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,464
Outpatient Reception

193
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,634
Hardware Store Manaka

194
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:15,444
All right.

195
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,184
We've got all the evidence now.

196
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,494
But we're still missing the key piece.

197
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:23,994
Well, it's just speculation, but that'sâ€”

198
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,794
How long are you brats going to stay here?

199
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:30,334
Mori-kun, can't you give us a break already?

200
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,714
Are you almost there, Mori-san?

201
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,004
Can't you go to sleep soon?

202
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,714
Regarding the motive,

203
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:42,304
ultimately we'll have to get
the culprit to admit it.

204
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:47,754
What?

205
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,894
You're saying I lied?

206
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:55,274
About Red Shirt and Uranari-san.

207
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,944
Is that true?

208
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:01,094
Did they both harbor
romantic feelings for me?

209
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,324
You didn't know?

210
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,454
I thought they were simply pretending

211
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:09,584
in front of our customers as
part of our business strategy.

212
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,644
That was a lie, wasn't it?

213
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:15,944
After all, you pushed them towards
becoming romantic rivals.

214
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,004
We checked.

215
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:24,054
With Bocchan, Nodaiko-san,
and Yamaarashi-san.

216
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,804
Of course Red Shirt and
Uranari had feelings for her.

217
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:32,564
After all, she made both of
them think she liked them.

218
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:36,314
It's only natural that they
became romantic rivals.

219
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,754
You set it up beforehand, didn't you?

220
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:43,824
In order to frame Red Shirt
for Uranari-san's murder.

221
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:49,584
I don't know why you think I
did it, but I have an alibi.

222
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:52,954
Both the night before last
when Uranari-san was killed

223
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:57,574
and last night when Red Shirt was
hanged, you stayed at Kiyo-san's house.

224
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:01,314
The night before last you
just happened to visit,

225
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:05,674
and last night it was because
the murder scared you.

226
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,224
Isn't that what you said?

227
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,414
Because it's true.

228
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:13,354
But even if you stayed over, it was
still possible for you to do it.

229
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:17,394
Both cases happened in
the middle of the night.

230
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,374
As long as you slipped out
while Kiyo-san was asleep...

231
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,364
Kiyo-san said so herself.

232
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,714
Normally I wake up to use the
bathroom during the night,

233
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:30,374
but oddly, these past two nights
I've slept soundly until morning.

234
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,544
As though she'd been drugged
with sleeping pills.

235
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:38,654
You created a fake alibi

236
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:42,804
and first invited Uranari-san to
the park the night before last.

237
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,884
Why did you want to meet
in the middle of the night?

238
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:51,394
I...

239
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:58,054
You stabbed him to death.

240
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:05,064
Then...

241
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,334
In order to make it seem like
the crime scene was here,

242
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,114
you threw Uranari-san's body into the lake.

243
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:23,034
Ultimately, suspicion fell on Red Shirt, who
lives at the restaurant, just as you planned.

244
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,264
You created a motive for Red Shirt's suicide.

245
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:33,014
Last night, you asked Red Shirt
to meet you, knocked him out,

246
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,044
and killed him by stringing
him up with a rope.

247
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:40,354
Then you made it look like a suicide.

248
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:43,364
Inspector, this was found on
the altar in Red Shirt's home!

249
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,364
That's probably the weapon
used in Uranari's murder.

250
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,714
After killing his romantic rival Uranari,

251
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:54,244
he realized he couldn't escape his
guilt, so he took his own life.

252
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:59,654
If you just wanted Red Shirt's
death to look like a suicide,

253
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:02,694
you could have lifted the
unconscious Red Shirt

254
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:05,754
and wrapped a rope around his neck.

255
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:12,264
But you chose that method because you wanted
to get revenge with your own hands, didn't you?

256
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:14,514
The police told us.

257
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,104
Madonna seems plain,

258
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:20,484
but she wrestled as a student.

259
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:24,484
With your strength, you could've done it.

260
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,404
But if I lifted a person using the rope,

261
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,864
wouldn't there be scrapes on the branch?

262
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,114
You used ice, didn't you?

263
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:39,244
For example, ice shaped like a horse saddle.

264
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,714
This wouldn't leave any scrape marks behind,

265
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:44,544
and the ice would melt by morning.

266
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:49,964
But there were traces left of the ice.

267
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:55,894
The branch was strangely damp, and
Red Shirt's hair was wet, too.

268
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,724
There's one more thing
that proves your guilt.

269
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:05,864
You had to make sure the ice
wouldn't melt before you used it.

270
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:08,614
You needed a cooler and dry ice.

271
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,244
The store employee remembered
you buying them.

272
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:15,494
Since you're so pretty, you
must've made an impression.

273
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,744
Madonna
Since you're so pretty, you
must've made an impression.

274
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:23,084
My alibi isn't ironclad.

275
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:27,634
I am strong, and I did
buy a cooler and dry ice.

276
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:32,444
But why would I kill the two of them?

277
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,134
I have no motive.

278
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:37,894
Really?

279
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,034
You really have no idea?

280
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:47,654
You told me about your younger sister.

281
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:54,154
Subarachnoid hemorrhaging
can appear in young people,

282
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:57,664
but it also happens if you
hit your head really hard.

283
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:04,164
I looked into the circumstances
of your sister's death.

284
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:14,444
Natsumi was pushed four
days ago by two drunk men.

285
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,064
She hit her head then.

286
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,344
I can't think of anything else.

287
00:19:19,714 --> 00:19:21,974
That may be the cause.

288
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:25,564
Even if the patient seems fine at the time,
they sometimes suddenly pass away later.

289
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:31,134
If she'd been seen by a doctor immediately,

290
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:34,574
they may have been able to determine
if it caused her symptoms,

291
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,074
but now that it's been several days...

292
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,244
No...

293
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:43,914
Her life was taken, but
they'd never be charged.

294
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,714
So you swore revenge, didn't you?

295
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:50,584
And those two drunk men...

296
00:19:53,164 --> 00:19:56,424
You were close with your sister, weren't you?

297
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,804
Very close, right?

298
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:05,714
Yes.

299
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:08,814
After all, she was my only sister.

300
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:10,984
It was her birthday.

301
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,884
Toyama Natsumi (21)
Madonna's Younger Sister
It was her birthday.

302
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:13,324
Toyama Natsumi (21)
Madonna's Younger Sister

303
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:16,164
The problem is the girl who plays Madonna.

304
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:19,854
Yeah. The current girl does a good job,

305
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,324
but she leaves something to be desired.

306
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:27,204
Natsumi!

307
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,244
Ouch...

308
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,954
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:31,964
Are you all right?

310
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:34,964
I'm totally fine.

311
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,984
Aren't there any suitable girls around?

312
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,974
A Madonna.

313
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,394
I wonder what they mean by Madonna.

314
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:49,234
More importantly, are you sure you're okay?

315
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,354
You always make too big a deal out of things.

316
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:59,574
But four days later, Natsumi passed away.

317
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:03,124
It may not have been malicious,
but those two killed my sister.

318
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,124
So you looked for them.

319
00:21:09,094 --> 00:21:10,434
Madonna.

320
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,994
That word was my only clue,

321
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:16,854
and it led me to Bocchan Restaurant.

322
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:20,764
I got a job, spent six months
developing their romantic rivalry,

323
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,754
and with these hands...

324
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:29,024
Though ultimately, you Detective
Boys figured it out.

325
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:33,194
But this is for the best.

326
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,904
If I'm not punished, it would be a lie.

327
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:41,804
If I'd forced Natsumi to go the
the hospital six months ago,

328
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:44,284
maybe she wouldn't have died.

329
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:57,544
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but we're
questioning everyone again.

330
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:01,394
You have something you want
to tell them, too, right?

331
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,424
After the store closed, those guys...

332
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:34,064
Formed a theater company, right?

333
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:36,644
I'm glad you got better, kitty.

334
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:38,364
Mii-chan!

335
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:39,274
What?

336
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,614
Mii-chan!

337
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:46,784
Sis, Mii-chan came back!

338
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:48,554
That's great!
