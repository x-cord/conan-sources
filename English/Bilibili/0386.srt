1
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,840
The musical tone of the famed musical instrument brings about murder.

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,440
The disaster that befalls a family of musicians.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,940
Suddenly takes an unexpected turn!

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,625
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,725
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,225
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,625
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,225
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,425
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,125
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:13,625
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,525
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,525
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:23,325
Who's cigarette butt is this?

18
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,025
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

19
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,025
That brand is the one...

20
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:30,725
that Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

21
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:31,825
Come to think of it,

22
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:35,325
he stopped by here before going to the annex.

23
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,125
If so, then...

24
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,125
this is...

25
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,525
Kid, where do you think you're going?

26
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,425
Just as I thought.

27
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:50,225
This is not an accident, but murder.

28
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:53,525
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,

29
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,225
the next target is...

30
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:02,625
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Interlude!"

31
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,325
What? You mean this fire is arson?

32
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:10,025
Yes. The cause of the fire is because he fell asleep while smoking,

33
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,525
and the source of the fire is around this ashtray.

34
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,525
But...

35
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:16,425
See, look at this cigarette butt

36
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,525
and this is the cigarette

37
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:21,525
that Genzaburo was smoking back at the main house.

38
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:22,925
The brand is the same,

39
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,425
and there's nothing odd about it.

40
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:26,825
There is a trace of it being bitten.

41
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:28,725
See.

42
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,925
Just like you, Pops...

43
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,525
People who work and talk while they smoke

44
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:37,125
have a habit of biting the filter of their cigarette.

45
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,925
But there is no trace of this cigarette butt being bitten.

46
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,825
Don't you think it's strange?

47
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,425
I see.

48
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,425
In order to make it look as if he fell asleep while smoking,

49
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,725
that the killer smoked several cigarettes

50
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,325
before setting the place on fire.

51
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,925
That is what you want to say, right?

52
00:03:55,925 --> 00:04:01,225
But, the door of this room can only be locked from the inside.

53
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,525
How'd the killer leave the room then?

54
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,825
You've come across an idea of the kind of trick

55
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,125
that may have been used, right?

56
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,825
Oh no, not yet...

57
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,325
You're just a kid after all.

58
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,325
He could've just happened to bite the cigarette

59
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:17,125
that he smoked back at the main house, you know.

60
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:22,325
Besides, Genzaburo used to hate people cleaning up his room.

61
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,425
Despite that, isn't it strange

62
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:28,325
that there isn't even one cigarette filter that has bite traces?

63
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:29,825
"Benio Tsumagari (54)" -There's nothing strange about it.

64
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:31,125
"Steward for the Shitara family" -Because Genzaburo

65
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:35,425
used to always throw out the rubbish before going out.

66
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:38,725
But, it's amazing how you dashed out of the room.

67
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,825
Well, the fact is, this kid informed me.

68
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:43,625
But if he threw out the rubbish, it's strange after all,

69
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,425
that he would smoke several cigarettes before falling asleep.

70
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:49,625
You idiot! That's not unusual at all.

71
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:54,525
He probably got sleepy when he was smoking his last cigarette.

72
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,325
That could be it, but...

73
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,725
I wonder if it's okay?

74
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,925
This could be a serial murder case.

75
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,725
What?

76
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,325
You shouldn't make such an irresponsible remark.

77
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,725
The name...

78
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,325
The initial of the name of the person,

79
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:14,625
Danjiro who died after being attacked by a robber is "D".

80
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,625
The initial of Eimi who died

81
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,325
after falling off the stairs two years ago is "E".

82
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:22,125
The initial of Furuto who fell off the veranda

83
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,425
and died a year ago is "F".

84
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,925
And the initial of Genzaburo who died tonight is "G".

85
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:31,025
D-E-F-G...

86
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,725
It's in alphabetical order.

87
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:36,725
If what all these people have in common

88
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:41,425
is the birthday of the head of this household, Mr. Choichiro Shitara.

89
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,025
It could be as the kid says.

90
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,125
There's something fishy going on?

91
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,625
Wait!

92
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,425
D-E-F-G...

93
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:52,425
then the next target is Hasuki with the initial H.

94
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,225
Oh no! She shouldn't be left alone!

95
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,725
What? I'm the next target?

96
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:04,325
Oh no, no way.

97
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,025
But alphabetically your name is next in line.

98
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,825
"Kyosuke Haga (32), Choichiro's nephew" -Now that you mentioned it,

99
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,725
it's true that starting with Father Danjiro's initial D,

100
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:11,825
it continues E-F-G...

101
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,225
"Hasuki Shitara (23)" -in alphabetical order.

102
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:16,225
"Choichiro's granddaughter" -Come on, it's just a coincidence.

103
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:19,025
I guess so...

104
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,825
But, we have a problem.

105
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,125
What about tonight's requiem?

106
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,925
Requiem?

107
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,525
It's been a custom for generations in the Shitara family

108
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:30,325
that when someone passes away, someone plays the requiem.

109
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,925
Genzaburo played till last year.

110
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:37,325
Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Shitara is in no condition to play as you can see.

111
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,725
I... I can't possibly play either!

112
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,325
Okay, I guess I'll play it then.

113
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:46,125
Why don't you all join us too?

114
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,625
A live performance by Kyosuke Haga

115
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,425
is not something you can listen to everyday, you know.

116
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,625
But, most of the musical instruments were in the annex.

117
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,525
The only instruments left are the piano and that...

118
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,925
Hey, hey, not that Stradivarius,

119
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,525
my hands'll shake.

120
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,625
You can use my violin, then.

121
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,625
No, I'll use the one I usually use that's in my car,

122
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,025
although it'll never come close

123
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,425
to that famed musical instrument that was made 300 years ago.

124
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:12,825
It's the only gift that Father ever gave me.

125
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,625
When it comes to tone quality,

126
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,825
it's second to none.

127
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,225
I don't want to use that famed musical instrument again

128
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,925
and have something happen.

129
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,025
Besides, if I take it out without asking Aunt Ayane,

130
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,525
I think she'll be troubled.

131
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,925
Be troubled?

132
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:34,125
For Mrs. Shitara, that Stradivarius is her son, Furuto himself.

133
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,925
That famed musical instrument that Furuto played

134
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:39,125
in front of Mr. Shitara just before his death is...

135
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:44,625
So, ever since then, at the stroke of midnight...

136
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:52,925
"Ayane Shitara (68), Choichiro's wife"

137
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:01,425
"Choichiro Shitara (72), The head of the Shitara family"

138
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:05,025
Does Choichiro know about this?

139
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,725
Yes, most likely...

140
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,625
The storeroom for the Stradivarius

141
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,725
is between Grandfather and Grandmother's room.

142
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,825
I'm sure that Grandmother still sees

143
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:21,325
my Father Furuto back then, in her heart.

144
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,325
Then, I shall begin.

145
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,125
Composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, "Requiem".

146
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,325
Concerto in D major K-626.

147
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,225
How nice.

148
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:20,025
Yes, Uncle Kyosuke graduated a music university in Germany with honors.

149
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,225
Why did he open the window, Kyosuke?

150
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:26,725
Probably so that Grandfather and Grandmother could listen to him play too.

151
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:29,525
Grandmother's bedroom is right above.

152
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,825
You mean that grandmother's room is connected

153
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:42,725
with grandfather's room with the storeroom of the Stradivarius in between?

154
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,625
If locked from the inside,

155
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,525
you cannot go through from the storeroom.

156
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,425
You can go inside from the corridor though,

157
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:51,125
with the master key that Ms. Tsumagari has.

158
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,725
They sleep in different rooms even if they're married.

159
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:56,825
Grandfather is a heavy smoker

160
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:58,625
and Grandmother hated the smoke.

161
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,325
He didn't quit until he came down with lung cancer.

162
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:06,725
If Grandfather dies, who's going to receive that expensive violin?

163
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:09,325
Great Uncle Genzaburo would have...

164
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,025
Maybe Grandmother?

165
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,325
I wonder what Grandfather will do.

166
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:21,425
I feel that it is most appropriate for a musical genius

167
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,425
like Uncle Kyosuke to have it, though.

168
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:26,125
Conan, listen quietly, will you.

169
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:45,925
What's that sound?

170
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:04,625
Don't tell me that was?

171
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:23,888
Grandmother.

172
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,988
Hurry, get an ambulance!

173
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:29,988
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:43,788
Grandmother's name is Ayane, so her initial is "A".

175
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,188
What does this mean?

176
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,688
I won't give it to anybody.

177
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,688
It's mine.

178
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,488
Where's the storeroom?

179
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,588
To the right beyond.

180
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,988
Hey.

181
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,388
The door is locked from inside.

182
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,688
And the chair beside the window.

183
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:08,988
Could it be suicide after all?

184
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,688
Well, well...

185
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,588
Mr. Mouri, another encounter with Death.

186
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:25,588
Come on. It's mere coincidence.

187
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:28,888
Inspector, and besides it's the saga of renown detectives,

188
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,288
to become involved in cases like these no matter where they go.

189
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:34,688
Then, I'd rather you stay still at home.

190
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,988
The estimated time of the incident is around midnight.

191
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,788
The site is that window on the 3rd floor.

192
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,688
It seems to be her bedroom.

193
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,688
Where were you at that time?

194
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,988
Yes, sir. I was in the room right below with everyone else

195
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:49,688
listening to Kyosuke playing the Requiem.

196
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,288
Requiem?

197
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,788
Yes, it seems to have been a custom handed down

198
00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:56,788
for generations at the Shitara residence.

199
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,188
Genzaburo, who burned to death

200
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,388
was the youngest of 3 brothers.

201
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,088
The oldest is Choichiro.

202
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:05,788
The 2nd son Danjiro, who died 30 years ago

203
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,988
is Kyosuke's father.

204
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,588
So, famed detective,

205
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,588
what do you think her motive for suicide was?

206
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,688
Oh, well, as to that... I have no idea yet.

207
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:17,188
I think it's the violin.

208
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:22,088
She's the steward for the Shitara family.

209
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,488
Let's go to Mrs. Shitara's room.

210
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:27,688
This is...

211
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,688
Straduvarius.

212
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:31,788
Don't tell me that a robber broke in

213
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,888
and Ayane fell out the window accidentally.

214
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,888
But this room was locked.

215
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,388
There are no signs of any struggling either.

216
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:42,388
There are no signs of anyone having come in here either.

217
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,888
The violin was probably already broken by someone

218
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,688
before Mrs. Shitara opened the case.

219
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,288
Maybe it was from that shock.

220
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,688
But, would she do something like that

221
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,988
-just because a musical instrument broke... -Don't you know,

222
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,488
that violin is a legendary violin that costs several billions of yen!

223
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,988
Moreover, Ayane was cherishing it

224
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:02,288
as if it were the double of her son, who died.

225
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,788
If someone broke it,

226
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:06,188
I'm pretty sure that she'd feel like jumping out the window.

227
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,588
-Wrong. -What?

228
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:11,488
I think she broke it herself.

229
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,288
Not again, this brat...

230
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:16,088
By herself? What makes you think so?

231
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,288
See, look at the new scratch on that table.

232
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,188
Grandmother probably threw this violin against it.

233
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:25,988
You idiot! She's not like Inspector Megure

234
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,288
who knows nothing of violins you know.

235
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,888
She would never do something like that!

236
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,988
Yes, I think so too.

237
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,988
But, that's only if this violin is genuine.

238
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:37,688
What?

239
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:46,288
Look at the label that is stuck to the inside of the violin.

240
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,188
The mark says "G.A"

241
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,788
If Antonio Stradivari made it,

242
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:54,388
the label should show "A.S"!

243
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,688
How come you know something like that?

244
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,688
Shinichi told me so some time ago.

245
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,688
You mean that detective kid?

246
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,888
Come to think of it, Shinichi was really knowledgeable

247
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,988
when it came to violins.

248
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,388
Maybe because Holmes used to play it?

249
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,688
Then, what does "G.A" stand for?

250
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,388
The violin maker who made that violin

251
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,188
was just being playful and put his initial on the mark

252
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,388
that was a replica of the real one.

253
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,588
The replica is also famous

254
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:29,788
and a large amount had been made since some time ago.

255
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,288
See, underneath the label,

256
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:35,288
it says "Made In Germany".

257
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:37,088
It's a 100% replica.

258
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:38,088
He's...

259
00:15:38,088 --> 00:15:41,388
Kyosuke that I mentioned a while ago.

260
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:45,488
Can you tell me who was listening to his Requiem in the room below?

261
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,388
Yes, sir, Ran and I,

262
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,788
that kid over there,

263
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:52,588
Hasuki, and the steward, Ms. Tsumagari, all four of us.

264
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:55,888
And Ayane fell to her death during this performance.

265
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,988
But, why did Grandmother have to commit suicide,

266
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:06,488
after Uncle Kyosuke risked his life to save her from the flames?

267
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:09,488
Save her?

268
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:12,488
Yes, Kyosuke and Conan saved Ayane

269
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,488
who didn't make it in time out of the fire.

270
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:18,188
I still don't understand.

271
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,588
Why did she break the replica?

272
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,988
Don't tell me she thought it was genuine all this time

273
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:25,288
but realized only now that it was a replica.

274
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,188
That's isn't possible.

275
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,588
Mr. Shitara's violin has been appraised

276
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,888
and is guaranteed to be genuine.

277
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,888
But, this case is genuine.

278
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,688
Isn't this the one?

279
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:43,788
Grandfather.

280
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,888
It was hidden behind the bed.

281
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,988
That Ayane, she dare treat it so carelessly.

282
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,488
It has the label of Antonio Stradivari.

283
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:54,888
So this is genuine.

284
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,188
When I saw it I knew it was.

285
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,988
Would you like me to play it?

286
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:01,788
No, that won't be necessary if you say so.

287
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,188
What we see is good enough.

288
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,888
If so, what on earth is that?

289
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:11,288
Maybe another Stradivarius was placed here to surprise everyone.

290
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,488
But, after finding out that it was a replica, she was shocked and...

291
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,988
I see, so before her husband finds out

292
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:17,288
that she spent a lot of money on trash,

293
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,788
she committed suicide.

294
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,788
If so, everything falls into place.

295
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:22,488
Wrong!

296
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,688
When I came into this room a while ago,

297
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,088
I checked the bed but nothing was there!

298
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,188
I'm sure that someone...

299
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:30,888
came to secretly replace the replica that was once exchanged

300
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:31,888
for the genuine Stradivarius,

301
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,588
again with the genuine one.

302
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,788
Somebody for some reason came into this room

303
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,088
-after I did and... -Conan

304
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:42,888
Maybe you should check the fingerprints that are on it.

305
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:46,088
Well, I'm sure you'll find fingerprints everywhere though.

306
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,888
Mine too, all over the place.

307
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:52,788
Because I was tuning the Stradivarius

308
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,688
in preparation for Uncle Choichiro's birthday since yesterday afternoon.

309
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,288
-In this room? -Yes, sir.

310
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,688
I handed it over to Hasuki after that, right?

311
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:03,788
Yes, I played it a little too,

312
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,288
so my fingerprints are also on it...

313
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,788
Was there anyone else there back then?

314
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,188
I was alone.

315
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,588
Uncle Kyosuke left taking Grandmother with him to the garden,

316
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:15,688
so that she wouldn't bother me.

317
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,588
I was showing Mr. Mouri the Stradivarius

318
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,688
when he arrived a while later

319
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,988
then we saw the annex on fire.

320
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:26,488
In the meantime, I took the Stradivarius that was left as is on the table,

321
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:29,188
to the storeroom.

322
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:37,388
Which means, anyone of you could've switched the violin.

323
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:41,488
But, Inspector, that doesn't matter now, does it?

324
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,488
The genuine one is back

325
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:47,388
and that kid over there is just saying what he wishes.

326
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,888
But, something's strange about this incident!

327
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:52,288
What's so strange! This room was locked,

328
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:55,388
and the door of that storeroom was locked too.

329
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,188
Moreover, there is a chair by the window.

330
00:18:57,188 --> 00:18:59,688
No matter how you look at it, it's suicide!

331
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,888
Where's the spare key to this room?

332
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,888
Other than what Mrs. Shitara was using,

333
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:06,988
I have the master key.

334
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:10,688
Inspector, I found the key among the belongings of the corpse.

335
00:19:11,688 --> 00:19:16,088
-I see. -See, this is not a serial murder case!

336
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,888
Serial murder?

337
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:19,688
Well, according to this kid,

338
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,888
he says that the killings started 30 years ago

339
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,688
with the initial of the names of the members of the family,

340
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:26,388
D-E-F-G in alphabetical order.

341
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:30,388
But, after the letter "G" of Genzaburo who died in the fire.

342
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:32,388
Ayane, with the initial "A" committed suicide.

343
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,788
That is, there was no connection.

344
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,788
-Maybe it's the musical scale? -What?

345
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:42,688
D-E-F-G-A.

346
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:45,188
In Italian it would be Do-Re-Mi,

347
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:49,388
but in English it is C-D-E-F-G-A-B.

348
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,788
Like they say the "C" chord.

349
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:53,788
I see.

350
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,588
Which means that the next alphabet would be "B".

351
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:59,788
But, who has the initial "B"...

352
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,688
Benio Tsumagari

353
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:05,488
You mean the next target is I?

354
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,388
Come to think of it, 30 years ago,

355
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:08,688
when I first started working here,

356
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,888
Mr. Shitara mentioned,

357
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,588
"If you belonged to our family,

358
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:17,188
we could go right up the scale from C to B"

359
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,988
I see, since Choichiro starts with a "C",

360
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,588
that'll make C-D-E-F-G-A-B,

361
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,688
the entire musical scale.

362
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,988
I wonder if I said something like that.

363
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:31,988
Well, I'd like you all to wait inside your rooms for now, then.

364
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,688
Inspector, they're her footprints.

365
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:37,788
From the looks of it,

366
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,388
it seems she jumped down without a tinge of hesitation.

367
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,388
Without a tinge of hesitation?

368
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,788
Inspector, I'm sure that it's suicide after all.

369
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:47,388
I mean this room was locked.

370
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:49,288
Locked...

371
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,288
Come to think of it,

372
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:53,488
the room that Genzaburo burned to death in was also locked.

373
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:56,188
Before the fire, everyone was at the annex,

374
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,688
so the anyone of the four could've set fire to it.

375
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:03,888
But this room was also locked.

376
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,488
I'm sure there's something to it.

377
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:10,088
What's that?

378
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,188
See by the top of the window,

379
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,288
there's something transparent. That square thing.

380
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,388
Is it a scotch tape or something?

381
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:21,188
There is the same to the right too.

382
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,188
Mr. Mouri was asking

383
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,988
if you saw anything strange near the corpse.

384
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:36,888
Come to think of it...

385
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,488
And one more thing.

386
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:46,088
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick

387
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:53,488
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

388
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:56,788
Right, shaped something like this,

389
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:59,388
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

390
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:03,388
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

391
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,888
Right, if that is used,

392
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,388
it would be possible to kill Ayane.

393
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:10,488
The only thing left to solve is the locked room mystery.

394
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:21,188
I see, so that's the story.

395
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:24,188
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

396
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:29,188
What is the killer so hung up on?

397
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,688
"Next Episode" -You've figured out the killer.

398
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:06,688
The truth of what has been happening here at this house from two years ago.

399
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:10,988
Why would this Stradivarius have anything to do with solving the mystery?

400
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,788
There's just one thing I don't understand...

401
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,588
Cacophony. When notes that are alongside each other are played

402
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,888
it sounds disharmonic...

403
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,488
Don't tell me that...

404
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,288
Grandfather!

405
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,988
Conan?

406
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:25,588
Next Conan,

407
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:29,488
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!"

408
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,415
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,315
"Perfect pitch"

410
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:37,115
You've got to watch Conan's perfect pitching.

411
00:24:37,115 --> 00:24:39,115
What a play on words.
