1
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.370
I wonder what Conan is doing right now.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
The Dr. Agasa said he suddenly had to go to Hokkaido.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.470
He's probably stuffing himself full of tasty foods, like eel.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.670
Yeah, right. He's not you.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.970
So...

6
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.370
"Farmer's Market" -Tada!

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
We should go to this event without him.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.570
The Beika City Farmer's Market?

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.170
"Beika City Farmer's Market" -It's an event where farmers

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.770
bring their produce to sell.

11
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.470
Lots of food trucks are coming, too.

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.470
And kids in grade school or younger eat free.

13
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.470
I see. So that's what you're after.

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.870
There's a police event, too.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.770
See? He's wearing his uniform,

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.470
but this is Inspector Megure, right?

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.870
You're right.

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.270
Forget that. Let's hurry.

19
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.370
I'm hungry.

20
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.770
What?

21
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.470
What do you mean it won't arrive in time?

22
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.770
Didn't you say you ordered it?

23
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.670
Hey, keep your voice down.

24
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.370
"Yuji Yamawaki (33)" -The shipping company made a mistake.

25
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.170
What can we do?

26
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.270
We'll have to give up on today.

27
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.270
"Kaori Kanno (29)" -We can't!

28
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.470
What do you think we've been preparing for?

29
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.570
If the stuff won't arrive today, we can just go buy it.

30
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.670
Yeah, but...

31
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.170
No.

32
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
"Nobuo Kadokura (32)" -There's still time. It could still work out.

33
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.570
You're right. Let's have an explosive time,

34
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.570
just like we planned.

35
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.670
What?

36
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.470
Did you hear that?

37
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.470
Yeah.

38
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.170
She said something about having an explosive time.

39
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.370
Speaking of explosions...

40
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.470
A bomb!

41
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.270
What's wrong?

42
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.570
Did something happen?

43
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.670
I thought I heard someone.

44
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.570
Must've been my imagination.

45
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.770
It sounds like they're planning to set off a bomb at this event.

46
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.770
But it's just a farmer's market.

47
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.270
What are they going to explode?

48
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.470
Inspector Megure?

49
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.170
In my eyes are maximum creation.

50
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.870
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

51
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.470
The Youth Detective Squad are minus Conan!

52
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.270
How will they handle the bombing case?

53
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.970
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.270
His name is Detective Conan!

56
00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:24.786
"Intrigue at the Food Court"

57
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:32.486
We overheard something terrible.

58
00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:33.786
What should we do?

59
00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:37.186
You're asking me? What can we do?

60
00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:41.386
Well, shouldn't we tell the police?

61
00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:43.586
But will they believe us?

62
00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:47.486
It'll probably end with them shooing us away like they always do.

63
00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.186
If only Conan were here...

64
00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:54.286
Nicely done, Ayumi.

65
00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:56.586
You realized something important.

66
00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:59.286
If you want the police to believe you,

67
00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:02.286
you need to calmly come up with a plan.

68
00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:03.486
That's it!

69
00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.286
Let's calmly come up with a plan

70
00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.586
so the police will believe us.

71
00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:09.986
What? That's easier said than done.

72
00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:15.886
I hate to admit it, but I wish Conan were here.

73
00:05:15.886 --> 00:05:17.886
Come on.

74
00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:20.386
Aren't you The Youth Detective Squad?

75
00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:25.186
What's the most important part of a police investigation?

76
00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:29.686
Is it evidence?

77
00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:31.986
So you do know the answer.

78
00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:34.186
If you want the police to act,

79
00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:36.086
you need evidence first.

80
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.286
That's it!

81
00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:41.886
We need evidence that they're planning to set off a bomb.

82
00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:43.886
Then the police will believe us.

83
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.586
See you guys in an hour.

84
00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:48.286
-Got it. -Make sure there aren't any leaks.

85
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:50.286
We know.

86
00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:52.886
Hey, they're leaving.

87
00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.086
What should we do?

88
00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:56.586
We should split up and follow them.

89
00:05:56.586 --> 00:06:00.386
What? But I'm hungry.

90
00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:02.086
Excuse me, Genta.

91
00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:04.086
If you catch the bad guys,

92
00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:08.686
you might be rewarded with lots of tasty food.

93
00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:09.686
What?

94
00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:14.186
And the other two are counting on you.

95
00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:17.886
Oh, right. Yeah, you're right.

96
00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:20.786
Okay, let's split up and follow them.

97
00:06:20.786 --> 00:06:22.186
Didn't I just say that?

98
00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:23.386
Yeah.

99
00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:27.286
Officer Sato, security is in place.

100
00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:30.286
We just finished combing the area for suspicious persons, too.

101
00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:31.886
The background checks on the food truck owners

102
00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:34.386
and vendors came back clean?

103
00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:36.386
Yes. We've asked them to present

104
00:06:36.386 --> 00:06:38.986
the identification papers they prepared beforehand

105
00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:40.486
when they enter the park.

106
00:06:40.486 --> 00:06:44.486
Okay. Inspector Megure's speech is in about two hours.

107
00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:47.686
Let's patrol the area again.

108
00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:50.886
What? Roger...

109
00:06:51.986 --> 00:06:54.186
What?

110
00:06:54.186 --> 00:06:57.186
Officer Takagi, what are you doing? Let's go.

111
00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:58.186
Sorry.

112
00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:03.886
This guy...

113
00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:08.886
Darn bad guys.

114
00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:12.986
How far is he going?

115
00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:13.986
This is bad.

116
00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:25.686
Genta.

117
00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:28.186
Try to calm down.

118
00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:29.586
Okay.

119
00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:33.186
And you should stay a little farther back.

120
00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.286
I know that.

121
00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.286
Genta, Genta.

122
00:07:42.286 --> 00:07:45.286
You can't just look at his face.

123
00:07:45.286 --> 00:07:47.786
Memorize his clothes and possessions

124
00:07:47.786 --> 00:07:49.486
and use them to spot him.

125
00:07:49.486 --> 00:07:50.986
All right.

126
00:08:11.186 --> 00:08:12.186
"Vegetable Oil"

127
00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:21.186
What's he buying all that stuff for?

128
00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:23.986
They're all highly flammable objects.

129
00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.386
What? Then are they actually...

130
00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:49.486
"Singaporean Restaurant"

131
00:09:02.786 --> 00:09:04.786
What's wrong, Ayumi?

132
00:09:04.786 --> 00:09:07.286
There's a strange sound coming from inside.

133
00:09:07.286 --> 00:09:10.386
It's okay. I'm here for you.

134
00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:11.386
Okay.

135
00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.086
Watch your step.

136
00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:26.586
Walk slowly and carefully.

137
00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:27.586
Okay.

138
00:09:38.086 --> 00:09:39.486
Who are you?

139
00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:14.486
Hello?

140
00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:31.486
Why are you making that face, Mitsuhiko?

141
00:10:31.486 --> 00:10:34.986
There's something strange about his actions,

142
00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:37.786
but I don't know what it is.

143
00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:42.186
Good grief. I thought you were smarter than this.

144
00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:48.186
Don't I always tell you how important it is to observe?

145
00:10:48.186 --> 00:10:51.986
Think back on the things you saw.

146
00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:53.286
You're right.

147
00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.986
He was sitting in the non-smoking section.

148
00:10:56.986 --> 00:10:58.786
But after taking a seat once,

149
00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:01.786
he switched to a different table closer to the front.

150
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.286
Why did he do that?

151
00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:07.786
I know!

152
00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:10.686
The back of the restaurant is near the smoking section.

153
00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:13.086
The smell of cigarettes bothered him.

154
00:11:13.086 --> 00:11:15.886
So he hates cigarettes.

155
00:11:15.886 --> 00:11:20.286
Why did he stop at a cigarette shop?

156
00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:29.286
He bought something.

157
00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:31.386
Something's definitely fishy.

158
00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:32.386
Yes.

159
00:11:45.686 --> 00:11:47.286
Hey, kid.

160
00:11:47.286 --> 00:11:49.386
You got some business with me?

161
00:12:15.453 --> 00:12:18.453
I see. So you overheard us.

162
00:12:18.453 --> 00:12:21.753
Explain yourselves.

163
00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.953
What's so funny?

164
00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:30.853
Sorry. An explosive time, huh?

165
00:12:30.853 --> 00:12:32.053
I see.

166
00:12:32.053 --> 00:12:36.153
That certainly sounds like we're setting up a bomb.

167
00:12:36.153 --> 00:12:38.153
What? You're not?

168
00:12:38.153 --> 00:12:40.753
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:12:40.753 --> 00:12:42.753
Who's the kid?

170
00:12:42.753 --> 00:12:44.253
Mitsuhiko!

171
00:12:44.253 --> 00:12:45.653
Be careful!

172
00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:49.353
He was buying oil and gas at the hardware store!

173
00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:52.253
They must be planning to build a bomb with it!

174
00:12:53.853 --> 00:12:54.953
No way.

175
00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:59.753
Listen, this is a misunderstanding.

176
00:12:59.753 --> 00:13:02.653
This is our food truck.

177
00:13:02.653 --> 00:13:06.953
We're trying to sell our chicken rice here today.

178
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.353
Chicken rice?

179
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:11.853
It's a famous Singaporean dish.

180
00:13:11.853 --> 00:13:16.253
We work at a nearby restaurant called Marina.

181
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.153
We decided to participate in this event

182
00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:20.753
to show off our best dish.

183
00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:22.653
If we do well today,

184
00:13:22.653 --> 00:13:26.053
the restaurant will get lots of customers starting tomorrow.

185
00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:29.353
The explosive time you heard us talking about

186
00:13:29.353 --> 00:13:32.553
was in reference to explosive sales.

187
00:13:32.553 --> 00:13:36.353
Chicken rice, huh? That sounds good.

188
00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:39.553
Then what did you get at the cigarette shop?

189
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:44.553
These. I had a printer friend make them for me.

190
00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:46.953
Since I ordered them late,

191
00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:49.153
they weren't finished until today.

192
00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:53.353
I was supposed to pick them up at a cafe,

193
00:13:53.353 --> 00:13:54.753
but he was too busy to come,

194
00:13:54.753 --> 00:13:56.753
so he called to say he left them

195
00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.253
with that shop he regularly visits.

196
00:14:03.453 --> 00:14:04.853
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

197
00:14:07.853 --> 00:14:11.153
It seems like we were confused.

198
00:14:11.153 --> 00:14:14.053
They're not bad people.

199
00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:16.053
Where'd you find this girl?

200
00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:19.053
I ran into her when I returned to the restaurant

201
00:14:19.053 --> 00:14:20.753
to pick up the prepped chicken.

202
00:14:20.753 --> 00:14:24.453
Since I had the apron and knife we use to butcher chicken,

203
00:14:24.453 --> 00:14:26.553
I scared her.

204
00:14:27.653 --> 00:14:30.253
They were just trying to cook.

205
00:14:30.253 --> 00:14:32.253
Chicken rice, huh?

206
00:14:33.453 --> 00:14:37.353
Are you going to back down now, detective?

207
00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:39.053
Of course not!

208
00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:42.153
Then hold out a little longer.

209
00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:44.453
Hold out?

210
00:14:45.753 --> 00:14:49.553
But why do you need so much oil and gas?

211
00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:52.353
There was a mistake, and our stuff didn't arrive.

212
00:14:52.353 --> 00:14:54.553
We did the basic prep work at the restaurant,

213
00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:57.353
but we heat up the soup and make the sauce

214
00:14:57.353 --> 00:15:00.453
inside the food truck.

215
00:15:00.453 --> 00:15:02.753
We received our eating and cooking utensils,

216
00:15:02.753 --> 00:15:05.453
but we don't have any oil or gas.

217
00:15:05.453 --> 00:15:08.353
We considered giving up,

218
00:15:08.353 --> 00:15:09.753
but we managed to get everything in time

219
00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:12.553
by going out and buying it.

220
00:15:12.553 --> 00:15:14.653
Although the unnecessary expense

221
00:15:14.653 --> 00:15:17.253
will probably put us in the red.

222
00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:20.653
Don't worry. If we spread the name Marina here,

223
00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:22.053
starting tomorrow...

224
00:15:22.053 --> 00:15:25.653
Our sales could explode!

225
00:15:28.753 --> 00:15:32.853
This might have been a misunderstanding on our part.

226
00:15:32.853 --> 00:15:36.953
After all, they say there's no such thing as an evil cook.

227
00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:39.353
Yeah, you're right.

228
00:15:39.353 --> 00:15:41.953
Sounds like it was a misunderstanding.

229
00:15:41.953 --> 00:15:42.953
Yes.

230
00:15:42.953 --> 00:15:44.853
Well, don't worry about it.

231
00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:47.053
Detectives are bound to make mistakes.

232
00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:55.053
Ayumi, are you sure you want to give up?

233
00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:58.553
Isn't there one last thing you need to confirm?

234
00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:02.253
Let us eat your chicken rice.

235
00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.353
-What? -What?

236
00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:06.453
If you really work in a restaurant,

237
00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.953
you should be able to make some chicken rice.

238
00:16:10.353 --> 00:16:11.853
Good grief.

239
00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:13.553
We don't have a choice.

240
00:16:13.553 --> 00:16:15.353
We're not open yet, but...

241
00:16:15.353 --> 00:16:17.553
We'll make an exception for you.

242
00:16:17.553 --> 00:16:18.853
All right!

243
00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:25.853
Three chicken rices ready.

244
00:16:25.853 --> 00:16:27.353
Got it.

245
00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.653
Thanks for waiting.

246
00:16:29.653 --> 00:16:31.453
Use as much sauce as you'd like.

247
00:16:31.453 --> 00:16:33.253
We didn't make it too spicy.

248
00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:36.053
What? This is chicken rice?

249
00:16:36.053 --> 00:16:39.153
It's nothing like what I imagined.

250
00:16:39.153 --> 00:16:40.753
It's not red.

251
00:16:42.553 --> 00:16:44.553
What you normally eat

252
00:16:44.553 --> 00:16:48.353
is fried rice flavored with ketchup, right?

253
00:16:48.353 --> 00:16:50.653
Singaporean chicken rice

254
00:16:50.653 --> 00:16:53.353
is rice cooked in chicken broth

255
00:16:53.353 --> 00:16:55.853
and topped with steamed chicken.

256
00:16:55.853 --> 00:16:59.453
Then you cover it with whatever sauces you want and eat it.

257
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:02.953
It's the national dish of Singapore.

258
00:17:02.953 --> 00:17:04.753
-Thanks for the food! -Thanks for the food!

259
00:17:08.353 --> 00:17:10.553
It's delicious!

260
00:17:10.553 --> 00:17:11.953
It's good!

261
00:17:11.953 --> 00:17:15.053
This sauce goes perfectly with chicken!

262
00:17:15.053 --> 00:17:17.453
Has this resolved our misunderstanding?

263
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.153
Yeah.

264
00:17:19.153 --> 00:17:20.553
More!

265
00:17:21.553 --> 00:17:23.253
We're really sorry.

266
00:17:23.253 --> 00:17:25.253
We were just confused.

267
00:17:26.353 --> 00:17:29.053
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

268
00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.353
Thanks for the food.

269
00:17:35.353 --> 00:17:36.753
It was great.

270
00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:39.353
Can I ask you something?

271
00:17:39.353 --> 00:17:40.353
What is it?

272
00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:44.953
Why do you have a giant star on your food truck?

273
00:17:46.453 --> 00:17:47.953
What? Oh, this?

274
00:17:47.953 --> 00:17:51.253
We like stargazing.

275
00:17:51.253 --> 00:17:54.453
On our days off, we always go stargazing.

276
00:17:54.453 --> 00:17:56.953
We just went last week.

277
00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:57.953
Really?

278
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:01.553
Be careful on your way home.

279
00:18:01.553 --> 00:18:03.253
And come to our restaurant.

280
00:18:03.253 --> 00:18:04.853
-Okay. -Okay.

281
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.353
Huh? You kids.

282
00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:11.353
Officer Sato and Officer Takagi.

283
00:18:11.353 --> 00:18:14.753
What are you doing? The event hasn't opened yet.

284
00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:16.753
Oh, this and that.

285
00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:21.153
Those guys made us chicken rice.

286
00:18:25.253 --> 00:18:28.553
Chicken rice? You mean rice flavored with ketchup?

287
00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:32.853
No! Singaporean chicken rice is totally different!

288
00:18:32.853 --> 00:18:34.753
You serve steamed chicken over rice

289
00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:37.253
and eat it with all kinds of sauces.

290
00:18:37.253 --> 00:18:40.153
It's the national dish of Singapore.

291
00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:43.353
Did they teach you that?

292
00:18:43.353 --> 00:18:44.853
-Yes! -Yes!

293
00:18:44.853 --> 00:18:48.053
They certainly must work at a Singaporean restaurant.

294
00:18:51.053 --> 00:18:54.453
That's quite the flashy food truck, though.

295
00:18:54.453 --> 00:18:57.053
There's a giant star on it.

296
00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.453
Oh, that's...

297
00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:01.353
They said it's because they like stargazing.

298
00:19:01.353 --> 00:19:04.453
They go stargazing on their days off.

299
00:19:05.653 --> 00:19:08.453
Really? Is that so?

300
00:19:08.453 --> 00:19:11.353
Well, we've got work to do.

301
00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:14.753
-Bye! -Bye!

302
00:19:18.253 --> 00:19:21.653
Jeez. Those kids were odd.

303
00:19:21.653 --> 00:19:23.953
I wasn't sure what to do

304
00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:26.353
when she followed me to the restaurant.

305
00:19:26.353 --> 00:19:30.353
They were strangely intelligent,

306
00:19:30.353 --> 00:19:32.353
but kids are kids.

307
00:19:34.753 --> 00:19:37.053
The deal is done.

308
00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:42.853
If that old woman learned a bomb was exchanged at her shop,

309
00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:44.753
she'd be paralyzed with fear.

310
00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.853
Will it work?

311
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.253
It doesn't seem very powerful.

312
00:19:50.253 --> 00:19:52.253
We're inside a car.

313
00:19:52.253 --> 00:19:54.353
If we set it up near the gas tank,

314
00:19:54.353 --> 00:19:57.153
the truck itself will be a bomb.

315
00:19:57.153 --> 00:20:01.653
And we've got oil, gas tanks, and fuel accelerants.

316
00:20:01.653 --> 00:20:05.953
I was worried when I heard the bomb wouldn't arrive

317
00:20:05.953 --> 00:20:07.953
because of the shipping company's mistake.

318
00:20:07.953 --> 00:20:10.453
But if all this stuff explodes at once,

319
00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.653
he won't stand a chance.

320
00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:15.153
Not Megure.

321
00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:18.453
What about me?

322
00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.053
Don't move!

323
00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:29.353
I remember you.

324
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:32.153
We arrested you when you tried to rob a bank

325
00:20:32.153 --> 00:20:33.953
seven years ago.

326
00:20:33.953 --> 00:20:36.053
I heard you'd gotten out,

327
00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:38.653
but to think you'd do this for revenge.

328
00:20:38.653 --> 00:20:43.353
All of Marina's employees are under our protection.

329
00:20:43.353 --> 00:20:46.053
After entering the restaurant before opening

330
00:20:46.053 --> 00:20:49.953
and stealing the ID's of the employees,

331
00:20:49.953 --> 00:20:51.753
they had them prep the chicken rice

332
00:20:51.753 --> 00:20:54.953
before tying them up and trapping them in storage.

333
00:20:54.953 --> 00:21:00.153
And plotted to blow us up in the park.

334
00:21:00.153 --> 00:21:03.853
They bought the bomb on an illegal website.

335
00:21:03.853 --> 00:21:07.353
The cigarette shop was just used as a drop-off location.

336
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:11.753
The cyber crimes unit identified the bomb maker

337
00:21:11.753 --> 00:21:13.753
and arrested him.

338
00:21:13.753 --> 00:21:16.153
I thought our plan was perfect.

339
00:21:16.153 --> 00:21:17.953
How did you figure it out?

340
00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:20.053
Thanks to some detectives.

341
00:21:20.053 --> 00:21:25.353
You didn't know what the star on this food truck meant.

342
00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:26.653
What?

343
00:21:26.653 --> 00:21:28.453
America is sometimes called "rice country,"

344
00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:31.653
and Russia is sometimes called "dew country."

345
00:21:31.653 --> 00:21:33.753
What about Singapore?

346
00:21:33.753 --> 00:21:35.753
Is it...

347
00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:38.153
That's right. It's "star country."

348
00:21:38.153 --> 00:21:41.153
I thought it was strange that someone working

349
00:21:41.153 --> 00:21:44.753
at a Singaporean restaurant wouldn't know that.

350
00:21:45.753 --> 00:21:47.653
Darn it!

351
00:21:47.653 --> 00:21:53.653
The Youth Detective Squad actually did a good job this time.

352
00:23:16.053 --> 00:23:18.753
I hope Conan comes home soon.

353
00:23:18.753 --> 00:23:21.653
I was so sure it was a case.

354
00:23:21.653 --> 00:23:24.653
Who cares? The chicken rice was good.

355
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.853
Hey, why don't we stop by Dr. Agasa's place?

356
00:23:27.853 --> 00:23:28.953
Good idea.

357
00:23:28.953 --> 00:23:31.853
He might have some tasty food.

358
00:23:31.853 --> 00:23:33.353
You're still hungry?

359
00:23:33.353 --> 00:23:35.053
For dessert.

360
00:23:37.053 --> 00:23:39.853
-Dr. Agasa! -Dr. Agasa!

361
00:23:43.153 --> 00:23:46.253
While the kids were visiting the Dr. Agasa,

362
00:23:46.253 --> 00:23:51.453
we were caught up in a terrible plot because of him.

363
00:23:54.553 --> 00:23:56.453
"Next Episode" -It's Sun Wukong.

364
00:23:56.453 --> 00:23:58.853
That's right. He's riding the Jindou cloud.

365
00:24:02.153 --> 00:24:03.653
What a beautiful ship.

366
00:24:05.853 --> 00:24:07.953
It's Talos.

367
00:24:07.953 --> 00:24:10.953
If they don't stop, the company won't last.

368
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.053
