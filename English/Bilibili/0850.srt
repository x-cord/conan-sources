1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.970
Yumi of the transportation department,

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.070
threw the important envelope she received from Master Haneda

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.770
away with her trash!

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.070
Luckily, the manager of the condo had retrieved it for her, but...

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.670
By the way, what I want to ask you

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.070
is about the stuff that was stuck between the pages of the magazine

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.770
that I threw out as trash this morning.

8
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.270
Is this it?

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.170
You... Don't tell me...

10
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.570
"Shukichi Haneda" -You looked inside the envelope?

11
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.370
Why should you care?

12
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.470
You threw it out as trash, anyway.

13
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.370
You old fart!

14
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.270
But all is well!

15
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.070
Since the content is really a marriage registration form!

16
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.470
Give it back to me!

17
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.270
On the registration form for the husband's employment field,

18
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.170
it showed seven crowns title holder professional shogi player.

19
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.070
I can tell that he filled out that form

20
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.170
with extraordinary resolution and determination!

21
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.070
I know that.

22
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.570
But in this championship match,

23
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.270
Taiko is really having a tough time.

24
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.670
If Taiko were to lose this Osho Title match...

25
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.670
This marriage registration form that indicates "7th Crown Holder"

26
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670
would become invalid!

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.070
So you know where the envelope is, don't you?

28
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

29
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.270
Show me your resolution then!

30
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.270
Resolution?

31
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.970
That you'll stand by Master Taiko no matter what it takes.

32
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.870
How resolute you are about that!

33
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.570
Hey, maybe this is it?

34
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.570
What?

35
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.470
It says to insert the 8-digit password.

36
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.570
Moreover, it says only Yodogimi is authorized to enter the password!

37
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.270
Then, what shall we do?

38
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.770
It's easy!

39
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.570
We need to find the 8-digit number some place in this room

40
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.270
and if Yumi enters it into the computer,

41
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.370
we'll be able to locate where the envelope is.

42
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.870
Isn't that right, meany old gramps?

43
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.170
Yeah.

44
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.270
Now that we know, let's all look for it!

45
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.170
Aye...

46
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
However, although we searched the entire room,

47
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.770
all we found was

48
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.070
one piece of paper with mysterious code like things on it.

49
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.570
What is this?

50
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.270
Are they figures or letters or symbols?

51
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.670
Gosh. I can't find a clue.

52
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.170
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

53
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

54
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470
Decipher the super difficult code.

55
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.670
Where will the thoughts of the couple settle?

56
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.370
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.070
His name is Detective Conan!

59
00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:29.828
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 2)"

60
00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:32.528
That's right.

61
00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:34.528
I heard from Miike

62
00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:36.428
that you made her drive the mini police car of MPD

63
00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:39.028
all the way to the Yamanashi Prefecture?

64
00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.928
That's right. Because Chukichi said that

65
00:04:41.928 --> 00:04:44.828
he wasn't going to make it in time for a certain match.

66
00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:47.228
But you're fantastic, Mr. Haneda.

67
00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:49.428
Today was an important day of a match for him

68
00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:52.928
and yet he stood it up just for you, Yumi.

69
00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:55.228
What match?

70
00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:57.628
I had a Meijin title match to attend to today.

71
00:04:57.628 --> 00:04:59.128
Meijin title match?

72
00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:01.728
Where at and at what time?

73
00:05:01.728 --> 00:05:06.228
That is, if I can get to the Yamanashi Prefecture's Tokiwa Hotel by 3:00.

74
00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:09.128
But there's less than an hour and a half to go, so...

75
00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:13.128
Chukichi, don't take this car lightly.

76
00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:17.328
Hey! That Benz over there!

77
00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:19.628
Change lanes and open the way!

78
00:05:20.728 --> 00:05:23.528
Stop dilly dallying and move it!

79
00:05:23.528 --> 00:05:26.728
Yumi, you're taking it too far!

80
00:05:26.728 --> 00:05:30.128
Thinking back, it must've been a shogi match.

81
00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:32.128
Do you know Tokiwa Hotel?

82
00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:33.728
I wonder.

83
00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:35.828
The Tokiwa Hotel in Yamanashi is the tournament hall

84
00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:40.328
where Meiji Match was held for the 7th Crown title that Master Taiko won.

85
00:05:40.328 --> 00:05:43.428
I heard that he made it just before his time was up,

86
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:45.928
but I didn't think he got there on a police car.

87
00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:50.628
And it was great that he got to the tournament hall

88
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:53.728
but Chukichi got panicky saying that he lost my picture

89
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.928
that he was keeping as a good luck charm.

90
00:05:57.128 --> 00:06:00.128
So, I kissed him and sent him off.

91
00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:02.228
With a great big smack.

92
00:06:05.128 --> 00:06:08.728
I thought that she was Chacha,

93
00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:10.328
but maybe...

94
00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:13.828
Look, look.

95
00:06:13.828 --> 00:06:15.728
I did it!

96
00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.828
How many moves can I make?

97
00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:19.728
10,000?

98
00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.728
The game will end if you move that many!

99
00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:25.928
They're bored of searching

100
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:28.628
and started playing Mawari Shogi.

101
00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:31.228
Well, we searched quite a bit, but can't find anything

102
00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:33.228
so I guess it can't be helped.

103
00:06:33.228 --> 00:06:38.628
Which means, this one piece of paper is the only code there is.

104
00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:42.728
By the way, don't you think that this room is a bit cold?

105
00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:44.228
Yeah.

106
00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:47.228
Gramps, will you turn on the heater, please?

107
00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:51.428
The thing is, I'd like to if I could,

108
00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:54.728
but the air conditioner's been broken from yesterday.

109
00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:57.228
It won't move at all.

110
00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:59.428
I'm sorry, but you've got to put up with the cold.

111
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:00.728
What?

112
00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:03.328
When we first came into this room,

113
00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:07.528
it was a bit warm so I'm sure that the heater was on.

114
00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:11.028
Then, why is this old man hiding the fact?

115
00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:13.928
Hey.

116
00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:17.728
Is this a code that you thought up to begin with?

117
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.628
Yeah, that's right.

118
00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:21.028
Why do you ask?

119
00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:25.728
Because this code is a copy and not directly written!

120
00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:27.728
What? Is that right?

121
00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:30.528
Shoots! I took a photo of it right away

122
00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:32.828
so I didn't check the original out.

123
00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:39.828
So, I'm asking if you copied the code from someone who wrote it?

124
00:07:39.828 --> 00:07:44.128
That's 100% what I wrote.

125
00:07:44.128 --> 00:07:47.628
I copied it just for the sake of it.

126
00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:51.828
No.

127
00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:54.928
Just by the looks of it, there is no copy machine in this room.

128
00:07:54.928 --> 00:07:56.528
In order to make a copy,

129
00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:58.028
he would have to walk over to the convenience store

130
00:07:58.028 --> 00:08:00.628
about a 10 minute walk from here.

131
00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:04.328
Moreover, the paper of copy machines are rectangular.

132
00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:07.228
In order to make it into a square like this paper with the codes on it

133
00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:09.728
you'll have to work on it manually.

134
00:08:09.728 --> 00:08:12.928
He didn't copy it just for the sake of it.

135
00:08:12.928 --> 00:08:16.728
He had no choice but to copy it.

136
00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:19.328
But, what on earth could the reason be?

137
00:08:19.328 --> 00:08:22.628
Maybe he didn't want anybody to see the draft?

138
00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:26.728
He didn't want to show the parts that he fixed with white out?

139
00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:28.428
Or...

140
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:30.728
If you really made this code,

141
00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:35.028
why don't you give us a hint? You know, a hint!

142
00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:37.228
Even if there's no hint,

143
00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:42.528
if you are determined to become man and wife with Master Taiko,

144
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.228
you'd be able to decipher the code right away!

145
00:08:46.228 --> 00:08:50.928
If you have the resolution to become a true married couple.

146
00:08:53.128 --> 00:08:54.428
A married couple?

147
00:08:56.928 --> 00:08:58.528
One again.

148
00:08:58.528 --> 00:09:00.928
I almost goaled, and then...

149
00:09:00.928 --> 00:09:03.528
You had a good start, though.

150
00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:07.528
Well, life is full of ups and downs!

151
00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:10.328
Ups and downs...

152
00:09:11.428 --> 00:09:13.528
Wait a sec.

153
00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:18.628
That code was in the wastebasket, right?

154
00:09:18.628 --> 00:09:21.728
Then, if that paper with the code on it

155
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.628
is shaped into "that" form...

156
00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:27.528
Will you lend it to me?

157
00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:29.228
Hey!

158
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:31.528
Conan?

159
00:09:31.528 --> 00:09:33.828
Maybe you came up with something?

160
00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:38.328
Why would he? He's just playing!

161
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:41.228
But in his case, I don't think so.

162
00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:43.628
See? Look at him!

163
00:09:43.628 --> 00:09:45.928
Does he look like he's deciphering a code?

164
00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:47.628
I guess not.

165
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:51.628
Isn't this origami that we used to play with when we were children?

166
00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:02.328
What?

167
00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:05.628
Fantastic! It's a letter!

168
00:10:05.628 --> 00:10:08.828
Then, Yumi! Key in the 8-digit number!

169
00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:11.128
Okay! Let's see.

170
00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.628
But...

171
00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:14.728
That's not a number.

172
00:10:14.728 --> 00:10:16.928
It's katakana, isn't it?

173
00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:18.428
No problem!

174
00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:23.328
Most adults can remember the 8-digit number if they see that.

175
00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:25.428
-Yeah. -What?

176
00:10:25.428 --> 00:10:29.228
Moreover, the code is not only what I just showed you.

177
00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:31.328
It's a pair.

178
00:10:33.228 --> 00:10:35.428
Hey, Miwako.

179
00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:38.128
Is this correct?

180
00:10:38.128 --> 00:10:39.828
Probably.

181
00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:44.028
Then, I'll click the ENTER key and input it.

182
00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:46.328
Wait!

183
00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:49.228
Let's try and confirm it on the internet just in case.

184
00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:50.628
What?

185
00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:52.428
Just one mistake

186
00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:55.028
and it seems we won't be able to find the envelope

187
00:10:55.028 --> 00:10:57.228
with the marriage registration inside.

188
00:10:57.228 --> 00:10:59.328
I guess so.

189
00:10:59.328 --> 00:11:03.228
Wow! It's just as Ai said.

190
00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:06.828
Yumi entered the 8 figures really smoothly!

191
00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:09.828
And the code was Katakana, too.

192
00:11:09.828 --> 00:11:12.428
I wonder how that Katakana appeared

193
00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:14.828
when you folded the paper with the code on it, in the first place?

194
00:11:14.828 --> 00:11:17.128
You had no hint and yet.

195
00:11:17.128 --> 00:11:19.428
I had hints.

196
00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.128
What?

197
00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:25.028
The hints were that the paper with the code on it was deliberately copied

198
00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:28.928
and that it was found in the wastebasket.

199
00:11:42.095 --> 00:11:43.895
A copy?

200
00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:47.295
What would've been apparent if he didn't make a copy?

201
00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:53.295
Like a draft or corrections made with white out?

202
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.595
Then, take this sheet with the code that I just folded.

203
00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:59.895
What disappears when you make a copy?

204
00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:04.995
I get it!

205
00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.495
The folding lines!

206
00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:09.695
Right!

207
00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:12.395
-The folded lines? -Really?

208
00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:13.495
Yeah!

209
00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:15.695
If there were creases on the paper to begin with,

210
00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:19.695
we would've know right away how to fold the paper.

211
00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:22.195
But on the other hand, with no creases,

212
00:12:22.195 --> 00:12:24.995
we wouldn't know how to fold it.

213
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:28.295
That's why this code was in the wastebasket!

214
00:12:28.295 --> 00:12:29.495
What?

215
00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:31.495
Did he try to throw it away?

216
00:12:31.495 --> 00:12:32.695
No.

217
00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:34.395
There's an old proverb that goes...

218
00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:36.895
"A crane in a dump heap."

219
00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:40.895
It refers to someone exceptionally talented

220
00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:43.695
or beautiful mixed among a group of people of little account.

221
00:12:45.395 --> 00:12:47.195
Exactly!

222
00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:50.295
A dump heap is a place where you dispose of trash.

223
00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:53.395
Since this code was in the wastebasket,

224
00:12:53.395 --> 00:12:56.595
it's telling you to fold a crane with this.

225
00:12:56.595 --> 00:13:01.795
So if you fold it into a crane, with the code facing up...

226
00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:08.695
See? This is what you get.

227
00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:13.095
The word "root" and "number 5" appear!

228
00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:16.095
What's "root 5"?

229
00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.195
The number you square to get 5

230
00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:21.695
is called the square foot of 5 or root 5.

231
00:13:21.695 --> 00:13:23.795
But when most people get to be an intermediate or high school student,

232
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:27.695
they're taught to memorize the first 8 digits!

233
00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:29.295
Eight whole digits?

234
00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:31.695
That's too much to memorize!

235
00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:33.095
Nothing to worry about.

236
00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:35.595
There's a phrase to remember it by!

237
00:13:35.595 --> 00:13:37.695
A rhyme to help memorize?

238
00:13:37.695 --> 00:13:39.095
For root 5,

239
00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:41.595
you memorize, "A parrot cries at the base of Mr. Fuji".

240
00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:46.295
Which will help you come up with the numbers 2.2360679!

241
00:13:46.295 --> 00:13:49.895
So, if she enters the 8 digits...

242
00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.095
Yep, that seems to be correct!

243
00:13:52.095 --> 00:13:54.895
Okay, here goes!

244
00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.395
What?

245
00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:01.195
Enter the other 8 digits?

246
00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:04.295
Root 5 wasn't the only password?

247
00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:05.795
Don't worry!

248
00:14:05.795 --> 00:14:09.195
All we have to do is fold another crane with the same sheet!

249
00:14:09.195 --> 00:14:10.195
What?

250
00:14:10.195 --> 00:14:14.995
The old man who made this crane gave the hint married couple!

251
00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:18.695
So first, we fold it back to this shape

252
00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:21.795
with the small overlapping squares

253
00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:24.495
and fold here like this.

254
00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:27.795
Then, you just fold the crane in the same way as when you started.

255
00:14:27.795 --> 00:14:31.795
Then a symbol like root 5 should appear.

256
00:14:35.295 --> 00:14:38.795
This time it doesn't look like Katakana.

257
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.695
There's a strange drawing on the back, too.

258
00:14:42.695 --> 00:14:46.195
The symbol on top of the circle is the square root symbol,

259
00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:50.295
so I think we need to figure out what number goes into the circle.

260
00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:53.695
But the only hint is this queer drawing.

261
00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:56.895
Maybe it's a 9?

262
00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.795
Why do you think so?

263
00:14:58.795 --> 00:15:01.195
If the circle on top is the moon

264
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:02.695
and the thing underneath is a sake cup,

265
00:15:02.695 --> 00:15:04.395
it could be signifying moon viewing, right?

266
00:15:04.395 --> 00:15:06.995
Right. And moon viewing is in September

267
00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:10.595
so you think that the number to be placed in the circle is a 9.

268
00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:12.495
But the square root of 9 is 3,

269
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.195
so it's not 8 digits.

270
00:15:14.195 --> 00:15:16.495
Really? So, I'm wrong?

271
00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:18.495
My father always says, he wants to enjoy a drink (Ippai)

272
00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:21.995
while gazing at the moon.

273
00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:23.495
A drink? (Ippai)

274
00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:25.595
I see.

275
00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:27.395
So that's it!

276
00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:47.195
Shall we begin the post match discussion?

277
00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.895
What? Sonant marks?

278
00:15:53.895 --> 00:15:57.495
You mean the two dots that are on the upper right corner

279
00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.495
of the sake cup sonant marks?

280
00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:00.595
Yeah!

281
00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:02.395
What's a sonant mark?

282
00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:05.095
It's a mark that is used to change the sound of a character.

283
00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:06.895
Huh?

284
00:16:06.895 --> 00:16:08.495
The "ge" in your name is pronounced that way

285
00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:10.395
because a sonant mark is added to the character "ke", right?

286
00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:12.595
Oh, that!

287
00:16:12.595 --> 00:16:16.595
But how does that help you decide what goes into the circle?

288
00:16:16.695 --> 00:16:18.995
Then, try counting from 1!

289
00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.295
What?

290
00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:22.695
How do you count fingers?

291
00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:26.795
Ippon, nihon, sanbon, yonhon.

292
00:16:26.795 --> 00:16:28.195
What about mice?

293
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:32.595
Ippiki, nihiki, sanbiki, yonhiki.

294
00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:33.895
And drinks?

295
00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:37.795
Ippai, nihai, sanbai, yonhai.

296
00:16:38.795 --> 00:16:40.295
You got it already, right?

297
00:16:40.295 --> 00:16:43.395
When counting, what number is marked with sonant marks?

298
00:16:43.395 --> 00:16:44.795
The number three!

299
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.595
Bingo!

300
00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:49.495
I guess you enter root 3.

301
00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:50.495
What?

302
00:16:50.495 --> 00:16:55.295
Well, root 3 is "Treat me like you'd treat anybody else",

303
00:16:55.295 --> 00:16:59.295
so it's 17320508.

304
00:17:00.595 --> 00:17:03.295
"Treat me like you'd treat anybody else."

305
00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:04.595
Okay!

306
00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:09.995
Hey, what's this?

307
00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.295
The screen just switched to

308
00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:15.195
what's being captured by the camera on the computer!

309
00:17:15.195 --> 00:17:17.995
Where's the envelope?

310
00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:20.295
Take a good look!

311
00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:23.495
Take a good look...

312
00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:28.295
The envelope's in my chest pocket!

313
00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:33.095
All right!

314
00:17:33.095 --> 00:17:34.695
I see.

315
00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:36.295
When Yumi bumped into you at the entrance,

316
00:17:36.295 --> 00:17:38.795
you used your pickpocketing skills

317
00:17:38.795 --> 00:17:42.995
to hide the envelope in Yumi's chest pocket.

318
00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.295
That's why he turned off the heat

319
00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:48.495
so that she wouldn't take off her jacket.

320
00:17:48.495 --> 00:17:51.495
Chukichi's marriage registration is mine!

321
00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:53.495
The Osho title match

322
00:17:53.495 --> 00:17:55.595
is being held at the Jinya Inn in Kanagawa Prefecture.

323
00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:58.395
It seems that they'll be on lunch break till one in the afternoon.

324
00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:00.895
If we take a cab, we can still make it in time!

325
00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:03.295
Yes.

326
00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:04.595
A phone call?

327
00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:06.795
From Chukichi?

328
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:09.495
Hello?

329
00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:11.695
Chukichi?

330
00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:15.395
Hey, you're not supposed to be using your cell phone now, are you?

331
00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:16.595
It's okay.

332
00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.595
What do you mean, it's okay?

333
00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:26.295
The match is over.

334
00:18:26.295 --> 00:18:29.795
It's over?

335
00:18:29.795 --> 00:18:34.595
So, please throw that envelope away.

336
00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:37.395
It's meaningless already.

337
00:18:37.395 --> 00:18:41.795
What? What do you mean? Throw away the envelope?

338
00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:43.495
Oh, no! Bad news!

339
00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:47.995
They're reporting online that Master Taiko lost the Osho title match!

340
00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:49.395
What?

341
00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:53.895
Let's see.

342
00:18:53.895 --> 00:18:56.395
Apparently worried about something other than the match,

343
00:18:56.395 --> 00:19:00.095
Master Taiko made one poor move after another

344
00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:04.995
and lost the match before lunch, it seems.

345
00:19:06.795 --> 00:19:08.895
But, Chukichi...

346
00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:11.495
I'll keep to my initial intention.

347
00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:17.195
This was the motto of my brother-in law, Koji Haneda

348
00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:19.795
a shogi player that I really respected.

349
00:19:19.795 --> 00:19:23.195
Koji Haneda?

350
00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.195
I'm sorry, Yumi.

351
00:19:26.195 --> 00:19:29.695
Men don't like to go back on their word.

352
00:19:37.795 --> 00:19:39.695
Is that so?

353
00:19:42.095 --> 00:19:43.695
What?

354
00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:47.495
Yumi.

355
00:19:47.495 --> 00:19:49.595
You...

356
00:19:49.595 --> 00:19:53.395
I don't know what you put into that envelope.

357
00:19:53.395 --> 00:19:55.295
But if you have something you want to say to me,

358
00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:57.695
say it to my face!

359
00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:00.795
If you ever get your seven or eight whatnots

360
00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:02.895
and become the king or whatever...

361
00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:07.295
Then, at that time... I guess I, the great Yumi

362
00:20:07.295 --> 00:20:09.895
will have no choice but to hear you out.

363
00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:13.395
So...

364
00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:16.095
Until then, don't you dare lose to anyone!

365
00:20:16.095 --> 00:20:18.095
You balding mouse!

366
00:20:18.095 --> 00:20:20.095
Yes, madam!

367
00:20:25.295 --> 00:20:27.795
Yumi, you're awesome.

368
00:20:27.795 --> 00:20:30.195
I thought she was Chacha,

369
00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.095
but she is Nene after all.

370
00:20:34.895 --> 00:20:38.395
I can see him getting henpecked.

371
00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:43.995
Rather, I think that was Nobunaga?

372
00:22:05.795 --> 00:22:08.195
What? No.

373
00:22:08.195 --> 00:22:11.295
You mean the Osho Title match is only held once every year?

374
00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:12.495
Yes.

375
00:22:12.495 --> 00:22:15.995
So the earliest you get to hear Master Taiko to propose to you

376
00:22:15.995 --> 00:22:18.695
will be at the earliest a year from now.

377
00:22:18.695 --> 00:22:21.595
What? Really?

378
00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:24.695
I thought they had it once a month or something.

379
00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:27.995
Beside, Master Taiko is a 6th Crown holder now,

380
00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:30.395
but if he loses a title like he did today,

381
00:22:30.395 --> 00:22:32.495
he has to start all over from there again.

382
00:22:33.995 --> 00:22:37.395
God knows when your wedding will be, Yumi.

383
00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:40.595
I'll call him right now

384
00:22:40.595 --> 00:22:41.995
and tell him that I don't care how many crowns he gets,

385
00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:44.095
so to just stamp a seal on the marriage registration form right now!

386
00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:47.495
Don't! I mean, after you acted so awesome!

387
00:22:47.495 --> 00:22:50.195
If they love each other, they should just get married right away!

388
00:22:50.195 --> 00:22:51.595
Yeah.

389
00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:55.095
Maybe adults have all kinds of things to think about.

390
00:22:55.095 --> 00:22:58.795
Hey. Do you know?

391
00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.395
Koji Haneda.

392
00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:03.095
Yeah! He was a genius shogi player

393
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:05.895
who was closest to winning all seven titles,

394
00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:10.295
but he left for the States to play in a chess tournament,

395
00:23:10.295 --> 00:23:11.495
and during that time,

396
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:14.995
he got involved in some incident and passed away, right?

397
00:23:14.995 --> 00:23:17.295
Since his last name was also Haneda,

398
00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.695
I thought they might be related

399
00:23:19.695 --> 00:23:23.195
but I didn't think he was Master Taiko's brother-in-law.

400
00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:28.195
What about him?

401
00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:30.295
That name...

402
00:23:30.295 --> 00:23:32.095
I remember seeing it.

403
00:23:32.095 --> 00:23:34.395
What?

404
00:23:34.395 --> 00:23:39.195
It was two names below yours on the list of people

405
00:23:39.195 --> 00:23:42.095
who were administered APTX 4869.

406
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:52.995
"Shinichi Kudo - Missing. Koji Haneda - Deceased"

407
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:56.195
"Next Episode"

408
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:00.595
Conan!

409
00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:02.395
There's nobody else here,

410
00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:04.095
so why don't you come here?

411
00:24:04.095 --> 00:24:07.095
Idiot, you're there.

412
00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:10.595
Are you all right?

413
00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:11.995
A red ogre...

414
00:24:11.995 --> 00:24:13.595
Red ogre?

415
00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:20.395
Next Conan,

416
00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:24.295
"The Descent into the Hell Tour of Love (Beppu Edition)"

417
00:24:24.538 --> 00:24:25.538
Ready, and...

418
00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:27.238
Next Conan's Hint:

419
00:24:27.238 --> 00:24:29.338
"An airport shuttle"

420
00:24:29.338 --> 00:24:31.438
Takagi, did you really get time off?

421
00:24:31.438 --> 00:24:32.538
Yeah, no problem.

422
00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:34.238
Liar.
