1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,760
All the horses have turned the final corner!

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,960
The last 200 meters,

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,960
-which one's going to come out front? -Come...

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,360
-Will it be the favorite Iron Blade? -Come...

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,960
Please, come!

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,960
For the sake of the future of the Mouri Detective Agency!

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,460
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,860
Saturday nights are for mystery.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,760
The clue is a large scar.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Make sure to choose your first love and not the suspect.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,660
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,560
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,630
"The Scar of First Love"

15
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,130
Half of Iron Blade's head in lane four is in the lead!

16
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,430
From outside in lane 6 is Masked Yaiba!

17
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,930
-From inside in lane 8 is Black Chaser! -Come...

18
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,330
-It's Devil Typhoon in lane 2! Its come up front! -Come...

19
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,730
-Devil Typhoon... It's Devil Typhoon! -Come...

20
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,530
It's over! Devil Typhoon in lane 2 is the winner!

21
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,630
There is a loud stir among the spectators...

22
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,130
-at this much too unexpected result! -It's come!

23
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,230
No way! You won?

24
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,830
Yeah! Super dark horse, 3 million yen!

25
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,730
3 million?

26
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,030
God was watching over this agency

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,030
and knew that we were having in tough this month.

28
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,930
We had practically no clients last month.

29
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,030
Hold it. The re-judge lamp is on!

30
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,730
Did something happen during the final heated competition?

31
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,930
Oh, my. Devil Typhoon in lane 2 slanted out of line

32
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,530
and has been disqualified.

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,130
The order of the horses making goal has changed,

34
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,130
and the winner is Iron Blade in lane 4!

35
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,130
Isn't God on the side of the needy?

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,030
Come to think of it, just the other day

37
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,330
I heard on the news that a girl of a prestigious family

38
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,030
bought a lottery ticket just for fun and won 1 billion yen!

39
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,330
What?

40
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,830
And she was saying that

41
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,330
she was planning to give that winning ticket to somebody.

42
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,730
Something about when she was a child and on a trip,

43
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,230
she got into a traffic accident.

44
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,230
And she wants the boy who was badly wounded

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,730
after trying to protect her to come out front,

46
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,130
so that she can thank him

47
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,330
and give him the 1 million as a token of her gratitude.

48
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,830
And? Did that lucky boy appear?

49
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,830
I wonder...

50
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,530
That girl who was also hurt in that accident

51
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,530
has lost her sight because of it.

52
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,630
She said that since that boy was still a child too,

53
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,930
she can't tell if it's him from his face or voice.

54
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,830
Then, how is she going to be able to tell if it's really that boy or not?

55
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,930
It seems that the scar he got during the accident is the key!

56
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,430
She says that since it was a big scar,

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,230
the scar should still be there even after he grows up.

58
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,930
I also have a scar.

59
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,530
The scar on my shoulder I got when I played sandlot baseball

60
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,630
and did a head slide 2 years ago!

61
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,130
Do you think I can fake it through with this?

62
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,330
Fake it?

63
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,030
Hey, hey. Come off it, old man.

64
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,230
It's not on his shoulder.

65
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,730
I remember clearly that his t-shirt was slashed in a straight line

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,030
and blood came seeping out.

67
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,830
After that, my eyesight started to fail,

68
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,930
but I haven't forgotten what I saw back then.

69
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,830
She's the person, you know the 1 billion yen.

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,330
Which means you want me to use the scar as a clue

71
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,430
and find that boy for you?

72
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,330
A person saying that he's the one has appeared.

73
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,530
But there are two of them.

74
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,930
Two?

75
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,330
I see.

76
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,130
So, you want me to figure out which is the real one?

77
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,130
Yes.

78
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,130
Because the person who saved me back then was alone.

79
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,730
Which means that one of them is an imposter.

80
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,030
How dare he pose as the boy of your memory

81
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,830
just because he wants the money.

82
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,930
What a jerk.

83
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,830
Talk for yourself...

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,830
And, did you see the scars of the two?

85
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,430
Yes, sir. I did take a look at it.

86
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,730
But the man with the brown hair has a scar on his back

87
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,830
and the tanned man has one on his chest.

88
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,030
They each have a large scar for sure.

89
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,730
Huh? On the back and chest?

90
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,030
You don't know where the scar is supposed to be, Ms.?

91
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,230
No. All I remember is that

92
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,430
the scar was a big one that extended from one side to the other.

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,030
By the way, where did the accident occur?

94
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,630
It was during summer vacation some 30 years ago.

95
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,130
I went on vacation with my parents to Izu.

96
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,430
I became friends with the boy

97
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,830
who looked to be the same age as I at the beach,

98
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,930
and played with him practically every day.

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,130
He was very knowledgeable about the ocean and fish

100
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,030
and always drank ginger ale.

101
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,830
His white teeth against his tanned face

102
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,230
that showed at times were fantastic

103
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,630
that I fell in love at first sight.

104
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,330
However, those dream-like days didn't last for long.

105
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,930
When I cried saying that I didn't want to go home

106
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,630
on the last day of summer vacation,

107
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,430
he said, "Stay here, then! I'll protect you."

108
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,830
How old were you back then?

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,130
I think I was in the 2nd grade of elementary school.

110
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,530
Lovey-dovey in 2nd grade of elementary.

111
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,330
And? How did you get into a traffic accident?

112
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,330
I begged my parents to let me stay

113
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,030
just one more day in Izu and they approved.

114
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,730
I wanted to tell him about this

115
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,930
and ran over to him, who was walking along the coast.

116
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,330
But, just then a driver who fell asleep at the wheels

117
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,630
came towards us and we were hit.

118
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,030
After that, I was unconscious for 3 days.

119
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,330
And I was sleeping on the hospital bed when I got up.

120
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,330
Then, you don't know what happened to that boy after that, do you?

121
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,530
No.

122
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,130
Although I heard that the boy, despite being badly wounded himself,

123
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,030
carried me all the way to the hospital.

124
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,830
He seems to have left

125
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,130
after saying that he would bring his parents along,

126
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,430
but he never came back since.

127
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,630
But you at least know what his name is, don't you?

128
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,930
After all, you played with him practically every day.

129
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,530
Gari!

130
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,730
I saw you on TV saying that he told you to call him Gari

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,030
because all his classmates called him that, right?

132
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,130
Yes.

133
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,230
Gari gives us no clue to what his name is.

134
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,930
And, where are the two that appeared saying they the ones?

135
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,830
The two have been staying over at our place since the other day.

136
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,530
What a grand mansion!

137
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,130
With a place so big, I'll bet cleaning this place is tough too?

138
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,930
Yes. Mr. Hoya and two maids

139
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,130
are doing what they can to maintain the place.

140
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,230
But since there are only four of us living here including me,

141
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,030
we don't mess the place up much either.

142
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,530
Nah, I'm sure it's tough getting rid of dust here too.

143
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,230
Four of you? Your parents?

144
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,530
My mother died early because of an illness.

145
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,730
And my father who was looking after me all this time

146
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,630
also died 3 years ago because of the same illness.

147
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,030
Just before father passed away,

148
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,330
Mr. Hoya was hired as the butler and forced to look after me.

149
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,730
No, it's not that he forced you on me.

150
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,030
Well... now, including the two men that have come,

151
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,630
including all too, it makes 9.

152
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,030
It looks like we're going to be having a gay dinner tonight.

153
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,230
So good, so good!

154
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,430
Having a meal with a lot of people is cheerful after all.

155
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,030
I wonder.

156
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,530
It seems that there's at least one person who's not fit to be here.

157
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,730
Huh?

158
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,530
Maybe it's about time you come out and identify yourself, imposter.

159
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,830
That's my line, you jerk!

160
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,430
Well, as to that, I'm sure Mr. Mouri will see through

161
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,030
who the imposter is a while later.

162
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,830
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

163
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,430
Well, for the time being,

164
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,930
I would like to hear you all out one at a time in another room.

165
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,830
See you, Mr. Detective.

166
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,030
-See you later. -Yeah.

167
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,530
Please check them over thoroughly.

168
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,330
Both of them could be imposters too, you know.

169
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,430
Yeah.

170
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,630
After all, it's something that happened 30 years ago.

171
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,630
It could be that the boy is no longer here in this world, too.

172
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,130
No! He's here!

173
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,230
That person is unmistakably in this house!

174
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,830
I couldn't help feeling that way,

175
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,430
so that's why I called the famous Detective Mouri over here!

176
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm a bit tired.

177
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,830
I'm going to my room and rest a while.

178
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,830
Please let me know as soon as you get the results.

179
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,130
Yes.

180
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,430
Don't tell me that she already knows

181
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,530
which of the two is the one she's looking for.

182
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,530
Hey, Conan.

183
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,830
Conan?

184
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,930
What's the matter?

185
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,630
What do you see outside?

186
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,130
Don't you sense it?

187
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,730
Like somebody's watching you.

188
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,630
That kind of feeling.

189
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,530
No, I don't feel anything.

190
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,030
Later Pops asked the two about what happened 30 year ago.

191
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,230
But all they did was repeat the exact same answer over and over.

192
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,630
And it wasn't surprising that they would do so.

193
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,930
What?

194
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,330
She talked about the circumstances back then in detail

195
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,530
-on a TV interview? -Yeah.

196
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,530
The date of the accident, the model of the car that hit them,

197
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,130
including the hospital that she was hospitalized in too.

198
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,030
No wonder they both gave the exact same answer.

199
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,830
There's no way I can tell who the real guy is, then.

200
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,430
There's someone around after all.

201
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,430
And it's not just one or two.

202
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,630
Pops, please come here!

203
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,930
What the heck are we doing outside?

204
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,730
Who is it?

205
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,230
Officer Takagi and Chiba?

206
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,330
Just what're you guys doing here?

207
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,630
Well...

208
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,430
This is a stake out.

209
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,830
The suspect of 15 years ago!

210
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,030
15 years ago?

211
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,130
Did you forget, Mouri?

212
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,530
The culprit of that incident that's responsible for scarring my face.

213
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,430
Superintendent Matsumoto?

214
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,230
But, Superintendent...

215
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,330
15 years ago, Mr. Mouri just became a police detective,

216
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,630
so I don't think he knows about it.

217
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,930
I see.

218
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,030
But, Superintendent...

219
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,730
I think you already had that scar when I was appointed here.

220
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,230
Yeah, this scar was made 5 years earlier

221
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,630
with the same sword that the culprit flung.

222
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,730
Which makes it... 20 years ago.

223
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,130
I cornered the culprit alone at a certain pier.

224
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,630
He took a slash at me so I grabbed the sword

225
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,430
and swung it at him instead.

226
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,130
I slashed his body in one straight line!

227
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,930
In one straight line...

228
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,030
Then, don't tell me that...

229
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,430
Yes, I saw her on the news the other day,

230
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,630
and figured that it's possible that

231
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,130
the culprit would come here to show his scar.

232
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,430
That's why I came here.

233
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,530
And, where did you slash the culprit with the sword?

234
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,530
In the back or on the chest?

235
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,430
The thing is, I don't remember clearly.

236
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,230
I undoubtedly slashed him though.

237
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,030
Is that so?

238
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,630
You too?

239
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,930
Well, it seems that back then

240
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,930
Superintendent was wounded in the left eye and felt a bit faint.

241
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,930
But it seems as though, I was right to have come here.

242
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,630
Huh?

243
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,230
It's throbbing with pain. This scar on my left eye.

244
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,430
As if it's telling me that the culprit is in this house.

245
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,270
What?

246
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,070
The serial killer of 15 years ago is in this house?

247
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,370
He may be here, that is.

248
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,370
Then, the thing Conan was saying a while ago

249
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,470
about feeling like being watched by somebody...

250
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,370
They were the police.

251
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,770
Something about Superintendent Matsumoto

252
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,170
is pursuing that culprit right through.

253
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,770
That killer is also the one who scarred Superintendent's face.

254
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,770
But I hear that Superintendent back then grabbed the culprit's sword

255
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,970
and slashed a straight line across his body, too.

256
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,670
In a straight line... Don't tell me...

257
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,770
Yeah, the same scar is supposed to be

258
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,370
on the serial killer's body too.

259
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,070
A very big sword slash

260
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,970
extending from one side of the body to the other.

261
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,970
But why would a murderer come to this house?

262
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,870
The culprit's after the 1 billion yen that the lady won!

263
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,170
Using the scar that the Superintendent left on his body to his advantage!

264
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,870
In other words,

265
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,970
either the man with the brown hair, Mr. Kusumoto

266
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,570
or the tanned man Mr. Banba, is the person she's looking for.

267
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,970
And whichever is not, may turn out to be the serial killer.

268
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,770
And, just where on the body is the scar of the killer?

269
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,570
If I remember correctly, Mr. Kusumoto's scar is on his back

270
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,170
and Mr. Banba's is on his chest.

271
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,370
The thing is, the Superintendent says he doesn't remember very clearly

272
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,970
because it was right after he was hurt in the eye.

273
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,970
You mean there's no other clue than the scar?

274
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,770
Well, the culprit was wearing gloves,

275
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,470
so no fingerprints were found on the sword

276
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,770
that the Superintendent snatched from him.

277
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,370
That sword was the murder weapon for the serial killings

278
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,170
and seems to have been smeared with the blood of the victims too,

279
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,570
so it seems to have been difficult to pin down the culprit's blood.

280
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,570
No one knows what he looks like either?

281
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,870
Long haired, wearing a cap and beard.

282
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,470
It's so obviously a disguise.

283
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,370
Then, there's no way anything can be confirmed.

284
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,470
The whistle!

285
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,270
-Whistle? -Yep!

286
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,170
There's a tune that the killer was always whistling,

287
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,870
so the Superintendent told me to secretly confirm

288
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,370
which of the two is doing so.

289
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,270
What kind of tune is it?

290
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,070
I have no idea.

291
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,670
He wouldn't tell me because he said

292
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,570
he didn't want to give me preconceived ideas

293
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,870
that would make me ask questions that would give away the fact

294
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,570
that a police investigation is underway.

295
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,370
But if such a dangerous person is around,

296
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,970
why would he deliberately make Conan come back here?

297
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,170
I was the one that forced him to let me stay here.

298
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,770
Besides, if I suddenly disappear, the killer may get suspicious

299
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,670
and realize that officers are staking out outside.

300
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,870
And like I just said, a while ago,

301
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,770
it's not that we're 100% sure that one of the two is the killer.

302
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,470
True, but...

303
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,670
Yes.

304
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,570
If you'd like to take a bath, it's ready.

305
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,370
You mean we were served dinner, and we get to take a bath here too?

306
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,470
Well, then, thank you so much.

307
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,170
But there's only one bath tub.

308
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,970
So if you're going to take a bath,

309
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,670
I think that young lady should do so first.

310
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,170
-What? -Go take a bath!

311
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,670
You won't get to take a bath in a gorgeous house like this ever again!

312
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,070
I guess you're right.

313
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,570
Okay then, Conan, let's take a bath together!

314
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,270
It's been a long time since we washed each other's back.

315
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,370
No, I didn't bring any change with me besides.

316
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,770
And I took a bath last night, so...

317
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,070
Really?

318
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,770
But...

319
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,970
if you insist, then!

320
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,170
-See you. -Yeah.

321
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,570
I decided not to take a bath

322
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,170
since it seemed like you didn't want to take a bath, Conan.

323
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,870
Okay.

324
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,570
Well, we've got to worry more about the killer

325
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,270
than taking a bath right now anyway.

326
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,770
But we don't even know what tune the killer was whistling,

327
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,170
so we have no way of checking.

328
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,270
The only thing we can do for now is to figure out

329
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,170
which of the two men is the one that the lady is looking for.

330
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,970
Pops was talking to Mr. Kusumoto and Mr. Banba a while ago, right?

331
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,170
Yes, as to the date the accident occurred

332
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,170
and the hospital that she was taken to.

333
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,770
Their answers were exactly the same.

334
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,570
Was it really the same?

335
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,770
Wasn't there anything that was different?

336
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,870
My, how unusual.

337
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,870
You were close by too, Conan, and you weren't listening?

338
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,870
No.

339
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,570
I was distracted by the officers who were staking the house out.

340
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,470
Well, if I were to pick out what was different...

341
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,670
Mr. Kusumoto repeated time and again that

342
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,370
he was skinny when he was a child.

343
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,070
And Mr. Banba kept emphasizing the fact that he used to be a bookworm.

344
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,270
Is that all?

345
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,870
Yes.

346
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,070
Would you like to go ask the lady now?

347
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,070
But...

348
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,370
I can't help feeling that the lady

349
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,970
already knows who the man of her memories is.

350
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,670
I've seen these in dramas and on movies, but...

351
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,370
I sure am surprised

352
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,870
to find that there is actually a gorgeous bath like this.

353
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,870
Hey there, Mr. Detective.

354
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,270
We're going to join you.

355
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,570
You're both taking a bath together?

356
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,470
You two get along quite well, don't you?

357
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,370
No, it's just coincidence.

358
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,570
Since I heard that you were taking a bath,

359
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,170
I decided to come and ask you how much you knew.

360
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,770
And? How about it?

361
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,770
You already know which one of us is the real one, right?

362
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,170
No, that's confidential.

363
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,570
This is great.

364
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,170
Now I don't have to go out of my way to ask them

365
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,470
about the tune that the Superintendent asked me to check on.

366
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,570
Butler.

367
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,770
Are you taking a bath, too?

368
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,370
No.

369
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,470
Kurumi asked me wash the detective's back,

370
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,170
that's why I'm here.

371
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,970
That's taking things too far.

372
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,170
If I knew which of them was the one I'm looking for,

373
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,570
I wouldn't do such a thing as to call Detective Mouri over.

374
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,970
I guess not.

375
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,770
Isn't there anything about that person

376
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,870
that you want to meet that you haven't mentioned on TV?

377
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,970
I wonder... I think I said everything there is to say.

378
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,470
Well, he was a very honest person

379
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,770
so I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will also soon find out who he is.

380
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,570
Very honest?

381
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,670
Yes. When he went out to buy a pack of sushi for lunch,

382
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,770
he received 100 yen more in change than he should've.

383
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,670
He went all the way back to the shop to return it, right?

384
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,070
Yes. He said he had to because it doesn't belong to him.

385
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,570
He liked sushi.

386
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,770
Yes. The other thing I remember is

387
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,670
the fried noodles we both ate at the beach house.

388
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:13,170
I was surprised at the large amount of red ginger he put on the noodles.

389
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,470
Maybe this is the first time I heard about this.

390
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,670
Is that so?

391
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,870
Then, please tell Mr. Mouri about it.

392
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,670
Thank you so very much.

393
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,970
No problem at all.

394
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,370
Taking a bath like this,

395
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,470
it make you want to hum a tune, doesn't it, you two?

396
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,470
-Yes. -Right.

397
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,070
Do you have a tune you like?

398
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,770
Well, yeah.

399
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,970
There's a tune that I hum a lot.

400
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,070
Superintendent, it's mail from Mr. Mouri.

401
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,070
And?

402
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,170
The man with the brown hair hums jazz

403
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,070
and the tanned man likes soul music.

404
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,970
That's all.

405
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,870
Send Mouri back mail.

406
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,170
The contents...

407
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,370
Keep checking?

408
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,770
But how do I keep checking when I've already run out of things to say?

409
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,870
Are you all right, butler?

410
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,970
You're sweating profusely.

411
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,370
Yes, well...

412
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,370
The air conditioner of the bathroom

413
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,770
has been out of order from the other day.

414
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,970
In view through his shirt that is damp with sweat on his back...

415
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,470
He has a scar?

416
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,070
Which means...

417
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,070
There are three men who have a scar extending in a straight line,

418
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,670
in this house right now.

419
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,070
"Next Episode" -The nickname his classmates gave him...

420
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,570
was "Gari"!

421
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,470
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

422
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,770
Natural stuff is delicious after all.

423
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,070
No, this is cultivated stuff.

424
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,470
Natural or cultivated, you say?

425
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,870
Who cares about something like that!

426
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,270
A certain letter on the victim's body...

427
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,170
Next Conan, "The Scar that Invokes the Past"

428
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,070
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,770
"Sushi"

430
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,170
Go ahead and order what you want.

431
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,770
Okay! Tuna, medium fatty tuna and super fatty tuna.

432
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,370
Two eggs.
