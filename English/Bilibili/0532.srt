1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:02,457
All the horses have turned the final corner!

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:03,657
The last 200 meters,

3
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:05,657
-which one's going to come out front? -Come...

4
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:08,057
-Will it be the favorite Iron Blade? -Come...

5
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:10,657
Please, come!

6
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,657
For the sake of the future of the Mouri Detective Agency!

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,157
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

8
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:20,557
Saturday nights are for mystery.

9
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:22,457
The clue is a large scar.

10
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,857
Make sure to choose your first love and not the suspect.

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,357
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:28,257
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:30,257
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:02,984
The order of the horses making goal has changed,

15
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:03,984
and the winner is Iron Blade in lane 4!

16
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,984
Isn't God on the side of the needy?

17
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,884
Come to think of it, just the other day

18
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,184
I heard on the news that a girl of a prestigious family

19
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:19,884
bought a lottery ticket just for fun and won 1 billion yen!

20
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,184
What?

21
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:22,684
And she was saying that

22
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:26,184
she was planning to give that winning ticket to somebody.

23
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,584
Something about when she was a child and on a trip,

24
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,084
she got into a traffic accident.

25
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,084
And she wants the boy who was badly wounded

26
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,584
after trying to protect her to come out front,

27
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,984
so that she can thank him

28
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:37,184
and give him the 1 million as a token of her gratitude.

29
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,684
And? Did that lucky boy appear?

30
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,684
I wonder...

31
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:44,384
That girl who was also hurt in that accident

32
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,384
has lost her sight because of it.

33
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,484
She said that since that boy was still a child too,

34
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:51,784
she can't tell if it's him from his face or voice.

35
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:55,684
Then, how is she going to be able to tell if it's really that boy or not?

36
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:58,784
It seems that the scar he got during the accident is the key!

37
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,284
She says that since it was a big scar,

38
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:04,084
the scar should still be there even after he grows up.

39
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:06,784
I also have a scar.

40
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,384
The scar on my shoulder I got when I played sandlot baseball

41
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,484
and did a head slide 2 years ago!

42
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,984
Do you think I can fake it through with this?

43
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:16,184
Fake it?

44
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,884
Hey, hey. Come off it, old man.

45
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,084
It's not on his shoulder.

46
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,584
I remember clearly that his t-shirt was slashed in a straight line

47
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,884
and blood came seeping out.

48
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:40,684
After that, my eyesight started to fail,

49
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:43,784
but I haven't forgotten what I saw back then.

50
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,684
She's the person, you know the 1 billion yen.

51
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:50,184
Which means you want me to use the scar as a clue

52
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:53,284
and find that boy for you?

53
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:59,184
A person saying that he's the one has appeared.

54
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:02,384
But there are two of them.

55
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,784
Two?

56
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,184
I see.

57
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:12,984
So, you want me to figure out which is the real one?

58
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:13,984
Yes.

59
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:17,984
Because the person who saved me back then was alone.

60
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,584
Which means that one of them is an imposter.

61
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,884
How dare he pose as the boy of your memory

62
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,684
just because he wants the money.

63
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:27,784
What a jerk.

64
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:29,684
Talk for yourself...

65
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:33,684
And, did you see the scars of the two?

66
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:37,284
Yes, sir. I did take a look at it.

67
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:43,584
But the man with the brown hair has a scar on his back

68
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,684
and the tanned man has one on his chest.

69
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:48,884
They each have a large scar for sure.

70
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,584
Huh? On the back and chest?

71
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:55,884
You don't know where the scar is supposed to be, Ms.?

72
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:58,084
No. All I remember is that

73
00:05:58,084 --> 00:06:02,284
the scar was a big one that extended from one side to the other.

74
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,884
By the way, where did the accident occur?

75
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:09,484
It was during summer vacation some 30 years ago.

76
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,984
I went on vacation with my parents to Izu.

77
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:15,284
I became friends with the boy

78
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,684
who looked to be the same age as I at the beach,

79
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,784
and played with him practically every day.

80
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:23,984
He was very knowledgeable about the ocean and fish

81
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,884
and always drank ginger ale.

82
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:28,684
His white teeth against his tanned face

83
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:31,084
that showed at times were fantastic

84
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:33,484
that I fell in love at first sight.

85
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:39,184
However, those dream-like days didn't last for long.

86
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:40,784
When I cried saying that I didn't want to go home

87
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:43,484
on the last day of summer vacation,

88
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:49,284
he said, "Stay here, then! I'll protect you."

89
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,684
How old were you back then?

90
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:54,984
I think I was in the 2nd grade of elementary school.

91
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:58,384
Lovey-dovey in 2nd grade of elementary.

92
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,184
And? How did you get into a traffic accident?

93
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,184
I begged my parents to let me stay

94
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,884
just one more day in Izu and they approved.

95
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,584
I wanted to tell him about this

96
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,784
and ran over to him, who was walking along the coast.

97
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,184
But, just then a driver who fell asleep at the wheels

98
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,484
came towards us and we were hit.

99
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,884
After that, I was unconscious for 3 days.

100
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,184
And I was sleeping on the hospital bed when I got up.

101
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:31,184
Then, you don't know what happened to that boy after that, do you?

102
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,384
No.

103
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,984
Although I heard that the boy, despite being badly wounded himself,

104
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:39,884
carried me all the way to the hospital.

105
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,684
He seems to have left

106
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:43,984
after saying that he would bring his parents along,

107
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,284
but he never came back since.

108
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:49,484
But you at least know what his name is, don't you?

109
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:52,784
After all, you played with him practically every day.

110
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,384
Gari!

111
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:58,584
I saw you on TV saying that he told you to call him Gari

112
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,884
because all his classmates called him that, right?

113
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:01,984
Yes.

114
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:05,084
Gari gives us no clue to what his name is.

115
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,784
And, where are the two that appeared saying they the ones?

116
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,684
The two have been staying over at our place since the other day.

117
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,384
What a grand mansion!

118
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:21,984
With a place so big, I'll bet cleaning this place is tough too?

119
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,784
Yes. Mr. Hoya and two maids

120
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:26,984
are doing what they can to maintain the place.

121
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:31,084
But since there are only four of us living here including me,

122
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:33,884
we don't mess the place up much either.

123
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:37,384
Nah, I'm sure it's tough getting rid of dust here too.

124
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,084
Four of you? Your parents?

125
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,384
My mother died early because of an illness.

126
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:45,584
And my father who was looking after me all this time

127
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:48,484
also died 3 years ago because of the same illness.

128
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,884
Just before father passed away,

129
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:56,184
Mr. Hoya was hired as the butler and forced to look after me.

130
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:59,584
No, it's not that he forced you on me.

131
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:03,884
Well... now, including the two men that have come,

132
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:06,484
including all too, it makes 9.

133
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:11,884
It looks like we're going to be having a gay dinner tonight.

134
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,084
So good, so good!

135
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:20,284
Having a meal with a lot of people is cheerful after all.

136
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,884
I wonder.

137
00:09:23,884 --> 00:09:28,384
It seems that there's at least one person who's not fit to be here.

138
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,584
Huh?

139
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:35,384
Maybe it's about time you come out and identify yourself, imposter.

140
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:38,684
That's my line, you jerk!

141
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:41,284
Well, as to that, I'm sure Mr. Mouri will see through

142
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,884
who the imposter is a while later.

143
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,684
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

144
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:48,284
Well, for the time being,

145
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,784
I would like to hear you all out one at a time in another room.

146
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,684
See you, Mr. Detective.

147
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,884
-See you later. -Yeah.

148
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:03,384
Please check them over thoroughly.

149
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,184
Both of them could be imposters too, you know.

150
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,284
Yeah.

151
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:10,484
After all, it's something that happened 30 years ago.

152
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,484
It could be that the boy is no longer here in this world, too.

153
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:16,984
No! He's here!

154
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,084
That person is unmistakably in this house!

155
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:22,684
I couldn't help feeling that way,

156
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:26,284
so that's why I called the famous Detective Mouri over here!

157
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,884
I'm a bit tired.

158
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:32,684
I'm going to my room and rest a while.

159
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:36,684
Please let me know as soon as you get the results.

160
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,984
Yes.

161
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:49,284
Don't tell me that she already knows

162
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:52,384
which of the two is the one she's looking for.

163
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,384
Hey, Conan.

164
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:56,684
Conan?

165
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,784
What's the matter?

166
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,484
What do you see outside?

167
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:02,984
Don't you sense it?

168
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,584
Like somebody's watching you.

169
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,484
That kind of feeling.

170
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:12,384
No, I don't feel anything.

171
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:23,884
Later Pops asked the two about what happened 30 year ago.

172
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:28,084
But all they did was repeat the exact same answer over and over.

173
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:29,484
And it wasn't surprising that they would do so.

174
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:30,784
What?

175
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:34,184
She talked about the circumstances back then in detail

176
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,384
-on a TV interview? -Yeah.

177
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:39,384
The date of the accident, the model of the car that hit them,

178
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:41,984
including the hospital that she was hospitalized in too.

179
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,884
No wonder they both gave the exact same answer.

180
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:48,684
There's no way I can tell who the real guy is, then.

181
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,284
There's someone around after all.

182
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:55,284
And it's not just one or two.

183
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,484
Pops, please come here!

184
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,784
What the heck are we doing outside?

185
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:05,584
Who is it?

186
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,084
Officer Takagi and Chiba?

187
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:10,184
Just what're you guys doing here?

188
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:12,484
Well...

189
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,284
This is a stake out.

190
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:18,684
The suspect of 15 years ago!

191
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,884
15 years ago?

192
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,984
Did you forget, Mouri?

193
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:29,384
The culprit of that incident that's responsible for scarring my face.

194
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:32,284
Superintendent Matsumoto?

195
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,084
But, Superintendent...

196
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:38,184
15 years ago, Mr. Mouri just became a police detective,

197
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:40,484
so I don't think he knows about it.

198
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:41,784
I see.

199
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,884
But, Superintendent...

200
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:48,584
I think you already had that scar when I was appointed here.

201
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:52,084
Yeah, this scar was made 5 years earlier

202
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:55,484
with the same sword that the culprit flung.

203
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,584
Which makes it... 20 years ago.

204
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:01,984
I cornered the culprit alone at a certain pier.

205
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,484
He took a slash at me so I grabbed the sword

206
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,284
and swung it at him instead.

207
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,984
I slashed his body in one straight line!

208
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:13,784
In one straight line...

209
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:15,884
Then, don't tell me that...

210
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:20,284
Yes, I saw her on the news the other day,

211
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:21,484
and figured that it's possible that

212
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,984
the culprit would come here to show his scar.

213
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,284
That's why I came here.

214
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,384
And, where did you slash the culprit with the sword?

215
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:30,384
In the back or on the chest?

216
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:33,284
The thing is, I don't remember clearly.

217
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:36,084
I undoubtedly slashed him though.

218
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,884
Is that so?

219
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,484
You too?

220
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,784
Well, it seems that back then

221
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:45,784
Superintendent was wounded in the left eye and felt a bit faint.

222
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,784
But it seems as though, I was right to have come here.

223
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,484
Huh?

224
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:54,084
It's throbbing with pain. This scar on my left eye.

225
00:13:56,884 --> 00:14:00,284
As if it's telling me that the culprit is in this house.

226
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:46,036
that the Superintendent snatched from him.

227
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,636
That sword was the murder weapon for the serial killings

228
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,436
and seems to have been smeared with the blood of the victims too,

229
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:55,836
so it seems to have been difficult to pin down the culprit's blood.

230
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:58,836
No one knows what he looks like either?

231
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:01,136
Long haired, wearing a cap and beard.

232
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:03,736
It's so obviously a disguise.

233
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:06,636
Then, there's no way anything can be confirmed.

234
00:16:06,636 --> 00:16:08,736
The whistle!

235
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,536
-Whistle? -Yep!

236
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,436
There's a tune that the killer was always whistling,

237
00:16:14,436 --> 00:16:16,136
so the Superintendent told me to secretly confirm

238
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:19,636
which of the two is doing so.

239
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,536
What kind of tune is it?

240
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:23,336
I have no idea.

241
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:24,936
He wouldn't tell me because he said

242
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:27,836
he didn't want to give me preconceived ideas

243
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:31,136
that would make me ask questions that would give away the fact

244
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:32,836
that a police investigation is underway.

245
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,636
But if such a dangerous person is around,

246
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:39,236
why would he deliberately make Conan come back here?

247
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:42,436
I was the one that forced him to let me stay here.

248
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:46,036
Besides, if I suddenly disappear, the killer may get suspicious

249
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:49,936
and realize that officers are staking out outside.

250
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:53,136
And like I just said, a while ago,

251
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:58,036
it's not that we're 100% sure that one of the two is the killer.

252
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,736
True, but...

253
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:02,936
Yes.

254
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,836
If you'd like to take a bath, it's ready.

255
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:10,636
You mean we were served dinner, and we get to take a bath here too?

256
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:13,736
Well, then, thank you so much.

257
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,436
But there's only one bath tub.

258
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,236
So if you're going to take a bath,

259
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,936
I think that young lady should do so first.

260
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,436
-What? -Go take a bath!

261
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:25,936
You won't get to take a bath in a gorgeous house like this ever again!

262
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,336
I guess you're right.

263
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:31,836
Okay then, Conan, let's take a bath together!

264
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:36,536
It's been a long time since we washed each other's back.

265
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:40,636
No, I didn't bring any change with me besides.

266
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:44,036
And I took a bath last night, so...

267
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,336
Really?

268
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:49,036
But...

269
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:52,236
if you insist, then!

270
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,436
-See you. -Yeah.

271
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,836
I decided not to take a bath

272
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:02,436
since it seemed like you didn't want to take a bath, Conan.

273
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,136
Okay.

274
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:05,836
Well, we've got to worry more about the killer

275
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,536
than taking a bath right now anyway.

276
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:11,036
But we don't even know what tune the killer was whistling,

277
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:14,436
so we have no way of checking.

278
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,536
The only thing we can do for now is to figure out

279
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:20,436
which of the two men is the one that the lady is looking for.

280
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:27,236
Pops was talking to Mr. Kusumoto and Mr. Banba a while ago, right?

281
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,436
Yes, as to the date the accident occurred

282
00:18:29,436 --> 00:18:32,436
and the hospital that she was taken to.

283
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:35,036
Their answers were exactly the same.

284
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,836
Was it really the same?

285
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:39,036
Wasn't there anything that was different?

286
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,136
My, how unusual.

287
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:44,136
You were close by too, Conan, and you weren't listening?

288
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:45,136
No.

289
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:48,836
I was distracted by the officers who were staking the house out.

290
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,736
Well, if I were to pick out what was different...

291
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:54,936
Mr. Kusumoto repeated time and again that

292
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,636
he was skinny when he was a child.

293
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:01,336
And Mr. Banba kept emphasizing the fact that he used to be a bookworm.

294
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,536
Is that all?

295
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,136
Yes.

296
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:08,336
Would you like to go ask the lady now?

297
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,336
But...

298
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,636
I can't help feeling that the lady

299
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:17,236
already knows who the man of her memories is.

300
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:23,936
I've seen these in dramas and on movies, but...

301
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,636
I sure am surprised

302
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:28,136
to find that there is actually a gorgeous bath like this.

303
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,136
Hey there, Mr. Detective.

304
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,536
We're going to join you.

305
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:37,836
You're both taking a bath together?

306
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:39,736
You two get along quite well, don't you?

307
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,636
No, it's just coincidence.

308
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,836
Since I heard that you were taking a bath,

309
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:48,436
I decided to come and ask you how much you knew.

310
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:51,036
And? How about it?

311
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:54,036
You already know which one of us is the real one, right?

312
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:57,436
No, that's confidential.

313
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:58,836
This is great.

314
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:01,436
Now I don't have to go out of my way to ask them

315
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:04,736
about the tune that the Superintendent asked me to check on.

316
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,836
Butler.

317
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:12,036
Are you taking a bath, too?

318
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,636
No.

319
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:16,736
Kurumi asked me wash the detective's back,

320
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:19,436
that's why I'm here.

321
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:25,236
That's taking things too far.

322
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:28,436
If I knew which of them was the one I'm looking for,

323
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,836
I wouldn't do such a thing as to call Detective Mouri over.

324
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,236
I guess not.

325
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:36,036
Isn't there anything about that person

326
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,136
that you want to meet that you haven't mentioned on TV?

327
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,236
I wonder... I think I said everything there is to say.

328
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:44,736
Well, he was a very honest person

329
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:49,036
so I'm sure that Mr. Mouri will also soon find out who he is.

330
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:50,836
Very honest?

331
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:54,936
Yes. When he went out to buy a pack of sushi for lunch,

332
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,036
he received 100 yen more in change than he should've.

333
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,936
He went all the way back to the shop to return it, right?

334
00:20:59,936 --> 00:21:03,336
Yes. He said he had to because it doesn't belong to him.

335
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,836
He liked sushi.

336
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:08,036
Yes. The other thing I remember is

337
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,936
the fried noodles we both ate at the beach house.

338
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:14,436
I was surprised at the large amount of red ginger he put on the noodles.

339
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:16,736
Maybe this is the first time I heard about this.

340
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:17,936
Is that so?

341
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:21,136
Then, please tell Mr. Mouri about it.

342
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,936
Thank you so very much.

343
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:29,236
No problem at all.

344
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:31,636
Taking a bath like this,

345
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:35,736
it make you want to hum a tune, doesn't it, you two?

346
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,736
-Yes. -Right.

347
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:41,336
Do you have a tune you like?

348
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,036
Well, yeah.

349
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:46,236
There's a tune that I hum a lot.

350
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:58,336
Superintendent, it's mail from Mr. Mouri.

351
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,336
And?

352
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,436
The man with the brown hair hums jazz

353
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,336
and the tanned man likes soul music.

354
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,236
That's all.

355
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:10,136
Send Mouri back mail.

356
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:11,436
The contents...

357
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:15,636
Keep checking?

358
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:20,036
But how do I keep checking when I've already run out of things to say?

359
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:22,136
Are you all right, butler?

360
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,236
You're sweating profusely.

361
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:25,636
Yes, well...

362
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,636
The air conditioner of the bathroom

363
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,036
has been out of order from the other day.

364
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,236
In view through his shirt that is damp with sweat on his back...

365
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:34,736
He has a scar?

366
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,336
Which means...

367
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:41,336
There are three men who have a scar extending in a straight line,

368
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,936
in this house right now.

369
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:10,336
"Next Episode" -The nickname his classmates gave him...

370
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:11,836
was "Gari"!

371
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:15,736
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

372
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:19,036
Natural stuff is delicious after all.

373
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:21,336
No, this is cultivated stuff.

374
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:24,736
Natural or cultivated, you say?

375
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:27,136
Who cares about something like that!

376
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,536
A certain letter on the victim's body...

377
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:36,436
Next Conan, "The Scar that Invokes the Past"

378
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:54,336
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:56,036
"Sushi"

380
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,436
Go ahead and order what you want.

381
00:24:57,436 --> 00:25:00,036
Okay! Tuna, medium fatty tuna and super fatty tuna.

382
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:01,624
Two eggs.
