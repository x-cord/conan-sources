1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Soon after the killing of Design Company President

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,540
Kohei Wakamatsu in his villa in Karuizawa,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,040
his son Ikuro was poisoned to death in his house in Tokyo.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,240
For some strange reason,

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,840
the pieces other than those that Ikuro ate

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,840
didn't have poison on them.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,140
How on earth did the culprit poison Ikuro to death?

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,940
Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Prefectural Police realized that

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,140
the bath room that President Wakamatsu was killed in

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,940
was made with tiles that cause an illusion

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,940
called "Crazy Diamond".

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,840
Although President Wakamatsu's dying message

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,740
that had vanished was revived...

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,040
Three letters of the alphabet were written, "S-O-N"!

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,640
Son.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,940
His son?

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,540
If all cases were men,

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,540
all hidden mysteries are women.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,740
Crazy Diamond is newly discovered. The mystery of poison.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,740
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:56,421
"Design of Poison and Illusion (Poison)"

24
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:59,521
Hey! Are you serious?

25
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,821
You mean the one who was killed in Tokyo tonight

26
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:04,721
is the son of the president who was killed in the villa

27
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,921
in Karuizawa a month ago?

28
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,721
Yeah, no doubt about it!

29
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:13,321
Maybe the culprit deliberately left those letters behind

30
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,521
to set the son up as the killer.

31
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,221
If so, I'm sure the culprit

32
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,921
would've left the body easier to discover.

33
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,021
The culprit wouldn't have gone through the trouble

34
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:26,721
of using the crazy diamond illusion to hide the message.

35
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,221
If so, it's highly probable

36
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,621
that somebody held a grudge of some sort.

37
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:33,221
Yes. The culprit who knew that the son had killed the president,

38
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,721
avenged the president's death.

39
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:39,121
I guess this deduction is appropriate.

40
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:41,721
Well, there's also a probability

41
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,221
that an accomplice tried to shut him up.

42
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,421
"SON" is the only message left.

43
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,721
It's only natural to believe that

44
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,121
-this is the doing of one culprit then? -So, that's the story!

45
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,221
I gave you all this information already,

46
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,721
so don't you dare come up with any other victims, get that!

47
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,721
Yeah.

48
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,321
So the person who deliberately called us over

49
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,221
to the president's residence in Osaka

50
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,721
and showed us the trick of the vanishing letters is...

51
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:07,221
Could most probably be the culprit who killed his son, Ikuro this time.

52
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:08,621
Yeah.

53
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,821
It seems as if the culprit wanted to tell us to hurry

54
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:13,421
and realize the illusionary trick of the crazy diamond.

55
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,821
It's hard to think that the culprit Ikuro

56
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,421
would ever give out such a clue besides.

57
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:19,021
The question is

58
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,821
why the President's wife hid the fact about the tiles of this bath room

59
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,521
being the same as those of the villa in Karuizawa.

60
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:30,121
If the culprit wanted us to realize the crazy diamond effect,

61
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:34,021
it could be that the wife was getting in the way.

62
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,621
You know, sonny?

63
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,221
You seem to be talking differently

64
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,621
from the way you were a while ago.

65
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,521
Because when you were with everyone,

66
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,921
you were talking like an ordinary child would.

67
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,721
But, now you're talking just like a detective would.

68
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:47,421
You see, well...

69
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,121
We're just playing detective!

70
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,721
I'm keeping this brat company playing detective!

71
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:57,621
Sonny, make sure you don't get in the way of investigation!

72
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:02,321
Because he's a really sharp high school detective, you see!

73
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,421
Okay.

74
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:08,421
By the way, did the president talk of me that way to everybody?

75
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:11,021
Yes, with every chance he had.

76
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,821
He used to say, he wish that he had a successor like Heiji, and yet...

77
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:18,821
grieved that his son was no good.

78
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,121
His son was no good?

79
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,521
Did he have a daughter or something?

80
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,521
No. I just think he meant compared to you, Heiji.

81
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,921
I would like to confirm once more.

82
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:39,521
Is the position that you're standing in right now

83
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,921
is the same as the time when Ikuro ate the poisoned baumkuchen and fell?

84
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,321
-Yes. -Yes.

85
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,721
Ms. Yonehara!

86
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,521
Where were you back then?

87
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,921
Oh, yes.

88
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,421
I was at that position you're in right now, Inspector,

89
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,721
holding the tray with the baumkuchen on it.

90
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,621
What?

91
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,121
Not so loud!

92
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:01,921
You mean the one who killed the president was his son, Ikuro?

93
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,121
-It's a secret, okay? -What?

94
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,421
Everybody thinks that the incident of the president

95
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,321
and Ikuro being killed

96
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,521
was committed by somebody who had a grudge against both of them

97
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:12,821
and is one and the same culprit, right?

98
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,921
If so, maybe it'd be better to keep it a secret, no?

99
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,421
Right. The motive of the culprit this time

100
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,721
is probably different from the motive of having killed the president.

101
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,021
It could be a grudge against the president

102
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,321
having been killed, you see.

103
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:30,421
So, Officer Takagi, won't you ask everybody secretly?

104
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:33,621
Especially find out if there was anyone who specially cared for him.

105
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,521
A secret from the Inspector?

106
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,721
If you want to deceive the enemy,

107
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,821
you have to first deceive the people on your side.

108
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:44,421
Heiji, I wonder what Officer Takagi and he are talking about in secret?

109
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,621
Beats me.

110
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,721
Talking about talking, what was that thing a while ago about?

111
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:53,021
You said that you had something you had to talk to me about.

112
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,521
It's not something that I should be talking about

113
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:56,121
at a time like this though.

114
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,121
The thing is...

115
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,921
What?

116
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,121
Shinichi did?

117
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,421
-What? -Don't worry about it.

118
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,621
Ghads.

119
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:10,821
Hey, hey.

120
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:14,321
What a thing to talk about at a murder site?

121
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,621
And? No one else

122
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:20,621
but Ms. Satake and Ms. Yonehara touched the baumkuchen?

123
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,821
You mean Shinichi really confessed to you?

124
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:25,121
Yeah.

125
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:28,221
I took a trip to London the other day, you see.

126
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:30,921
And Shinichi coincidentally happened to be there, too.

127
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,321
All of a sudden in front of Big Ben...

128
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,821
How lucky, Ran! How I envy you!

129
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,721
Really romantic.

130
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:42,721
And then? What happened after that?

131
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:45,521
Nothing really...

132
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,721
You met him and called him too, didn't you?

133
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,621
Nothing in particular.

134
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:55,421
Then, you should've called him!

135
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:59,021
But it's like I forced him to confess.

136
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,821
And besides, I wanted to keep prolonging

137
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,321
this sense of happiness for a little longer, you see...

138
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,821
I sort of felt like if I called him from my side,

139
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,821
this dreamy incident would somehow shatter to pieces.

140
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:15,421
You're being sort of lukewarm, Ran.

141
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,721
Your partner's already cornered

142
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,021
and raising a white flag, you know.

143
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,121
Why didn't you push him a little farther and soak yourself in victory?

144
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,621
Victory...

145
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:28,421
Then, I'll tell you what we'll do!

146
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,321
I'll conjure up courage and confess to Heiji, too!

147
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,321
What?

148
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,221
After that, you should conjure up courage too

149
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,721
and confirm with Shinichi whether it was a dream or not too!

150
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:39,421
-What do you think? -What?

151
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:41,521
Hey, you guys.

152
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,021
What are you guys fussing over from a while ago?

153
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:46,921
We're in the midst of on-the-site-inspection, you know?

154
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,521
We're in the midst of an inspection conference!

155
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,821
So, keep out of it, thank you.

156
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,321
What?

157
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:56,621
How lucky, Ran! Promise, okay?

158
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,921
Okay. I'll show Ran what I can do for her sake, too.

159
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,221
Heiji, get ready for this, I'm coming for you!

160
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,521
How frightening!

161
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:13,821
I wonder what the heck she's glaring at me for.

162
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,621
Inspector.

163
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,721
I think it's meaningless to go any further, don't you?

164
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,621
Right. The question is,

165
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:24,121
not where everyone was standing at the time of the incident,

166
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,721
but how the culprit made that stupid son pick up

167
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,721
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left, isn't it?

168
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:31,821
Unless that mystery is solved,

169
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,021
no matter how much on-site investigation there is...

170
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,621
No. This is not an official on site investigation,

171
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,021
but rather, an informal on site investigation performed voluntarily.

172
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,221
What?

173
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,721
If it's an official on site investigation,

174
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:46,521
you need a warrant issued from court on hand

175
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,921
before starting the investigation

176
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,521
and be able to show it at the scene.

177
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,121
They would have to make us understand

178
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,421
the contents of the warrant, too.

179
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:56,021
Have it on hand before starting?

180
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,321
Need them to understand the contents?

181
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,621
That's right!

182
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,821
That method still existed!

183
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,621
Inspector!

184
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:06,221
I'm going to borrow the housekeeper again for a while!

185
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,221
Huh?

186
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:10,121
And, we'll borrow the forensic officer who is outside too!

187
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,421
Huh?

188
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:14,021
Sorry, but will you conjure some story up for us in the meantime!

189
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,821
Ghads, going off on their own like that...

190
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:20,421
-So, there it is? -Yeah.

191
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:25,021
It seems that powdered poison's been sprinkled on the door knob.

192
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,221
There's no mistake about this being Ikuro's room, is there?

193
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,021
No.

194
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,221
But why would there be poison in a place like this?

195
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,621
Ikuro didn't coincidentally pick up

196
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:38,821
the poisoned baumkuchen out of the two that were left.

197
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,021
He had poison on his hand even before he picked it up!

198
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,121
Poison was already on his hand when he left this room,

199
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,421
grabbed the door knob and closed the door!

200
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:52,421
So, if it were Ikuro who always ate cake with his hands,

201
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,521
no matter which baumkuchen he picked up,

202
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,821
he would've swallowed the poison along with it!

203
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,021
I see!

204
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:03,821
The problem is, who put the poison on the doorknob.

205
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:08,621
Is there poison on the floor too?

206
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:11,421
Yeah. On the floor.

207
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:16,521
Maybe that poison powder was cut off about 10 centimeters?

208
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,921
Yeah.

209
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:22,921
There was about that much open space on the floor.

210
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,321
But, how did you know about it?

211
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,821
I see.

212
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,321
If so, it's not difficult to figure out who put poison on the doorknob.

213
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,321
If only we can find it!

214
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:33,521
What?

215
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:36,321
Let you check the slippers?

216
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,621
What the heck is going on from a while ago?

217
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,721
We're in the midst of interrogation!

218
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,721
Come on, loosen up!

219
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,721
It's important!

220
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:48,021
Of course we need your slippers too, Inspector!

221
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,421
It goes for all of you waiting outside the room too, you know!

222
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,821
Put the slippers you're wearing right now

223
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:56,521
into the bag with your name on it!

224
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:03,021
Then, you don't really have any idea of anyone

225
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:07,121
who may have had a grudge against the president or Ikuro?

226
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,221
No. I don't know about the son,

227
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:12,921
but I think the president was liked by everybody, wasn't he?

228
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,721
The president was a workaholic

229
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:16,621
and left his family to fend for themselves, so...

230
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:20,021
It seems that he's been divorced twice, though.

231
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,621
Divorced twice...

232
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,621
Then, on the contrary,

233
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,021
was there anyone who cared for the president?

234
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,321
Huh?

235
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,521
Aren't you talking about people who had a grudge against him?

236
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,921
Yes, just for your reference.

237
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,721
I guess that would be Managing Director Shiina.

238
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,521
It seems that they used to go around together

239
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,621
since the establishment of the company.

240
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,621
Yes. I was classmates with the president at the university

241
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,921
and have been acquainted with him for quite some time.

242
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:50,321
Several years ago, I received a bronze fountain pen from him

243
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:54,021
in celebration of my 30th anniversary working for him too.

244
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:55,421
That's...

245
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,521
the fountain pen that you lend Mrs. Wakamatsu a while ago?

246
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:02,721
Yes. It seems he gave the other employees

247
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:05,221
bronze wristwatches, though.

248
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,921
By the way, is there anyone

249
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,121
who cared for the president more than you?

250
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,721
Secretary Satake, I guess.

251
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,821
She took care of the president to the point

252
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,521
where his previous wife used to get jealous, you see.

253
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:22,721
It's only natural that a secretary

254
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,921
takes care of the president, isn't it?

255
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:29,121
But, what does this have to do with anything?

256
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,121
Just to be sure, I just wanted to know

257
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,621
how much the president was loved.

258
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:35,021
If so, I don't think anyone cared more for him

259
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,621
than the housekeeper Ms. Yonehara.

260
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:38,521
Because her mother, who was a single parent

261
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:40,421
also worked as a housekeeper for this family

262
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:43,521
and when she died of an illness,

263
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,521
he took Sakurako in

264
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,421
and raised her like she were his real daughter,

265
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:50,821
then eventually hired her as a housekeeper here.

266
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:54,421
Yes.

267
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:56,521
I have no words that can express

268
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:58,221
the gratitude I feel for the president.

269
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,821
He also paid for my school tuition.

270
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:05,021
But I think Mr. Fujinami the chief designer, liked him even more.

271
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:07,121
Due to his foul mouth,

272
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,121
he was fired from various companies,

273
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:12,021
but he said that the president saw through his skills

274
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:14,721
and picked him up.

275
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,921
Even at the president's funeral,

276
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,321
he was the one who was crying most too.

277
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,121
I see, I see.

278
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,421
Hey, Mrs. Wakamatsu.

279
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:28,921
You're there, aren't you?

280
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:32,021
All we need now are your slippers, you know!

281
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,821
We found no poison detected

282
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:36,621
on the slippers of the others, you see.

283
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:39,921
The poison powder got on the slippers because

284
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,465
when poison was sprinkled onto the doorknob of Ikuro's room,

285
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,688
Mrs. Wakamatsu...

286
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,022
Oh, no!

287
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,317
The cause of death hydrogen cyanide again.

288
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,194
Looks to be so.

289
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,990
But, isn't this suicide?

290
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,200
When we left this study,

291
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,287
the last one who closed the door was that Inspector, wasn't it?

292
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:09,499
But, back then, the vice-president was still alive.

293
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,418
If the detective boy from Osaka and his friend were the first ones

294
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,086
to open the door of this room and find the corpse,

295
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,088
of the vice-president who was in the study,

296
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:18,383
where the police officer was on guard,

297
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,219
what else can it be but suicide!

298
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:24,222
True. If this is to be considered a homicide,

299
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,724
it's a locked room murder.

300
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,185
In other words, an impossible crime.

301
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:30,103
True.

302
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:32,898
It's not impossible to commit, though.

303
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,485
Because there are many suspicious looking things on the table!

304
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,616
The black tea that housekeeper Yonehara served us

305
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,409
is still only half drunk.

306
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,619
The cap of the fountain pen

307
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,787
that Managing Director, Shiina lent Mrs. Wakamatsu,

308
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,623
is on the end tip of the top of the pen,

309
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:51,708
with the lid sticking out.

310
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,418
The contract that the secretary Ms. Satake

311
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:57,088
had asked Mrs. Wakamatsu to sign and stamp is only half done.

312
00:15:57,088 --> 00:16:00,008
And the eye drops that

313
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,593
she received from Mr. Fujinami the chief designer

314
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,305
seems to have been used just a little!

315
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,516
They're all suspicious, don't you think?

316
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,017
In other words...

317
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,895
If you use the things on this desk right,

318
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,897
you don't have to be in this study

319
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:18,193
to poison Mrs. Wakamatsu to death!

320
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:21,321
The thick dictionary that was on the ground near her,

321
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,699
and the case that it was inside is super suspicious, too.

322
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,495
It seems that the "wa" part was opened.

323
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,205
Judging from the circumstances,

324
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,707
it is highly likely that she tried to look for something

325
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:36,002
using that dictionary, and touched the poison.

326
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,505
For example, maybe she wanted to look up

327
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,007
a Kanji character that she couldn't read.

328
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:47,097
If so, the contract that Mrs. Wakamatsu was asked to sign and stamp

329
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:50,809
or the instructions sheet of the eye drops are fishy.

330
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,186
Yes. The culprit who knew that

331
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,688
there were some difficult kanji characters

332
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:57,524
or sentences in the contract probably made it

333
00:16:57,524 --> 00:17:02,404
so that she would pick up the dictionary that had poison on it.

334
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,989
Hey, hold it!

335
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,615
I don't think there're any words

336
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:07,117
that the vice-president couldn't read.

337
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:10,120
She held the top grade kanji evaluation degree.

338
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,290
Besides, if you're going to suspect us,

339
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,709
please do so after you read the letter in the envelope

340
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,294
that she gave to me.

341
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:18,920
Letter in an envelope?

342
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,589
The vice-president had asked me

343
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,009
to submit that enveloped letter to the police

344
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,721
if in case something should ever happen to her.

345
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:32,183
That enveloped letter was kept in the safe of this house.

346
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:35,520
The content was Mrs. Wakamatsu's letter of confession.

347
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,606
When we rushed to the bath room

348
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:41,109
after hearing that the president was stabbed to death in Karuizawa.

349
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,611
The fact was, his son was standing hiding behind the door

350
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:46,406
holding a knife and smeared with blood.

351
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,408
She had written a confession in her own handwriting

352
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:51,286
that she, without thinking decided to protect her son.

353
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:54,497
She protected him because the president's son knew that

354
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:58,209
she was the one who had been embezzling money from the company.

355
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,211
That's why she made the son cling to his father's corpse

356
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,588
to cover up the blood that had splattered on him

357
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,506
when he stabbed his father.

358
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:04,716
Before the police arrived,

359
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,801
she left traces of an outsider having committed the crime,

360
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,386
hid the murder weapon

361
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,889
and on a later date got rid of it.

362
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,308
She also confessed that she hid the dying message

363
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,393
written by the president by using illusion,

364
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:18,605
but it dawned on her that maybe she may be killed by the son one day

365
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:22,692
to shut her up because she knew of the crime he committed.

366
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:26,196
So, she had written that she would like that dying message

367
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:28,823
submitted to the police as evidence if ever such a day should come.

368
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:32,118
This is how the letter of confession ended.

369
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:35,705
Were you the only one as her secretary

370
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,500
who knew of the existence of this enveloped letter?

371
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,210
Yes, most probably.

372
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,214
The vice-president seemed to have been opening

373
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:45,215
and checking the safe every night

374
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,384
to see if the envelope had been opened or not.

375
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:50,887
So, maybe there were others who were suspicious of her.

376
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:54,682
I thought that Mrs. Wakamatsu was hiding something, too.

377
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,685
When I came inside to clean this room,

378
00:18:57,685 --> 00:19:00,313
I saw her in front of the safe.

379
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:03,483
"Knock before you come into the room!"

380
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:06,486
So saying, she scolded me severely.

381
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:07,695
But, as far as this is concerned,

382
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:11,282
I think the others were also aware of it.

383
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,118
Because Mrs. Wakamatsu used to invite

384
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,788
a lot of company people over to discuss things.

385
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,417
Which means, that although not clearly,

386
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,710
all of you knew of the existence of this enveloped letter.

387
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,920
Inspector!

388
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,090
Poison was detected on Mrs. Wakamatsu's slippers!

389
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,299
What?

390
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,386
It seems that she's the one who sprinkled poison powder

391
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:34,889
onto the door knob of Ikuro's room!

392
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,307
There was a residue of poison detected

393
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,810
in between the space of the wooden floor right below the door knob.

394
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,603
Moreover, the space taken up by the slippers

395
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:43,523
matched the space where no poison powder was spilled o the floor.

396
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:45,483
I see.

397
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:49,612
Because she feared that she may be killed one day,

398
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:52,407
Mrs. Wakamatsu took measures beforehand.

399
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,284
Oh, no.

400
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,995
It could be so.

401
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:01,583
Because it would presumably be very difficult to change her slippers,

402
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,294
and make her wear slippers with poison on them instead.

403
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:07,005
And poison was also detected from the Japanese dictionary

404
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,008
that was found on the floor near Mrs. Wakamatsu's corpse.

405
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,801
Poison was found only on the bottom

406
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:15,221
left of the side that the book is opened from.

407
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,724
But inside the case that the dictionary was put inside,

408
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,518
was a bag with poison pasted on

409
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:23,104
and it was slightly torn.

410
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,690
It could've been that someone hid the poison there,

411
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,193
where the bag ripped accidentally

412
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,903
and so the poison spilled onto the part of the dictionary

413
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:32,113
where poison was detected.

414
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:36,910
If so, it could've been Mrs. Wakamatsu who hid it there.

415
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,703
It could be.

416
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,914
After poisoning the son to death,

417
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,708
she hid the bag of poison there.

418
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,585
It is also thinkable that be it he was the president's son,

419
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:47,420
a son is still a son.

420
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,005
After having killed him,

421
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:51,382
she was probably overwhelmed by feelings of regret.

422
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,384
So, she put the poison that spilled out of the bag

423
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:57,096
into her mouth and killed herself.

424
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,391
Maybe she didn't participate in the informal voluntary

425
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:01,893
on site investigation because...

426
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,187
She was already planning to kill herself

427
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:06,105
as soon as she got to be alone.

428
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:10,985
Didn't you find anything on top of the desk in the study?

429
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:14,405
No. No poison was detected.

430
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:17,116
There seems to have been no difficult words on the contract

431
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:20,203
or the instruction sheet of the eye drops either.

432
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,121
Then who was it that called me over

433
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,998
to the president's house in Osaka

434
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:28,586
so that I would see through the crazy diamond illusion?

435
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:33,716
Maybe she used you to try it out.

436
00:21:33,716 --> 00:21:37,595
Since her husband kept telling her that you were a great detective,

437
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,514
she probably figured that if you couldn't solve the illusionary trick,

438
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,099
no one else would!

439
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,685
She didn't dream at all that you would be bringing along

440
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:47,021
a genuine famed detective with you.

441
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,816
Then, are you saying that she deliberately committed a murder

442
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:52,402
right in front of that great detective?

443
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:53,903
How should I know?

444
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:57,991
Maybe she couldn't stop because she already laced the poison!

445
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:00,410
I mean, I hate to say this but...

446
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,620
If the vice-president is the killer,

447
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,205
can we go home already?

448
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,791
It's almost time for the last train, too.

449
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,795
I've got to go home and discuss tonight's matters with my wife.

450
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:13,506
I'll stick around as long as you need me, though.

451
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,384
Well, I'd like to ask you

452
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,511
how Mrs. Wakamatsu was acting before she died, too.

453
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:22,098
Please cooperate with our investigation a little while longer.

454
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:44,722
"Next Episode" -Talking about baumkuchen,

455
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,892
is making me want to eat fish cake.

456
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,102
I get it!

457
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:51,312
An eye for an eye!

458
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,523
Then, how did the make that stupid son

459
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:56,317
pick up the poisoned baumkuchen?

460
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:58,611
Then, why don't you try it too, sir?

461
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,698
You have to make like you're starved like Ikuro was!

462
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:05,201
Like how do you make like you're starved.

463
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,495
This is...

464
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:12,917
Next Conan, "Design of Poison and Illusion (Illusion)"

465
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,685
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:32,895
"Wristwatch"

467
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:34,105
Today is Children's Day.

468
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,315
Conan, how old are you now after yesterday?

469
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,109
A secret.
