1
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.840
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.540
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.440
Ran's suspicion has finally come to the truth.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.040
The password brings her even closer to the truth.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740
It's a one-on-one battle between love and deduction.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.225
I'm done.

10
00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:09.825
It was delicious.

11
00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:13.225
Then off to bed you go. It's already after midnight.

12
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:14.225
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:16.725
Wait.

14
00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.625
What is it, Ran?

15
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.625
Well, you know...

16
00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.325
Brush your teeth and go to sleep now.

17
00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:29.625
Yes, I know.

18
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:32.525
What's with him?

19
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.625
He seems oddly jittery.

20
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.825
I guess he sort of realize it after all.

21
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.425
That I'm suspicious of his true identity.

22
00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:44.825
Shinichi.

23
00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:47.925
Oh, no.

24
00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.425
I may have forgotten to lock the door of the office.

25
00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:53.525
Make sure you lock it before going to bed then.

26
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:55.825
Boy, I am sleepy.

27
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.525
There's only one way for me to check...

28
00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.725
whether what I suspect is true or not.

29
00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:29.325
"Suspicious Ran"

30
00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.625
I've got to go return the car.

31
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:39.625
Okay.

32
00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:55.425
Conan's cell phone.

33
00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:59.525
If the mail that I sent is inside,

34
00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:02.525
it'll serve as a definite evidence that Conan is Shinichi.

35
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:06.325
Just as I thought.

36
00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:08.125
The cell phone is switched off

37
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.925
so that the sound of my mail sent out to him won't ring.

38
00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.925
But you've no choice already, Shinichi.

39
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:14.925
Once the cell phone's switched on, everything will become clear.

40
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:18.725
Wait. Is this what you really want?

41
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.825
What if Conan is really Shinichi?

42
00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:24.725
How are you going to face up to him?

43
00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.625
This boy...

44
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.525
is cute.

45
00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:31.925
My heart...

46
00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:35.425
He is a deduction freak who has always been mean since his childhood days

47
00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:36.925
and always full of confidence.

48
00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:40.125
But he has always been there in time of need.

49
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.925
He's so cool.

50
00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:44.125
I like Shinichi more than anyone else.

51
00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:50.425
I can't sleep.

52
00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:54.425
It was sure a lot of fun washing each other's back, wasn't it?

53
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:59.225
Your nose is bleeding? Maybe the water was too hot?

54
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:03.725
Maybe I should just wait until he decides to tell me.

55
00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.125
He must have a reason.

56
00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:09.325
And besides, it's not nice peeking into other people's cell phone.

57
00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:14.825
But all I'm going to do is check whether the mail I sent is inside or not.

58
00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:17.625
If that's all I'm going to do, it's okay, isn't it?

59
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.225
Sorry, Shinichi.

60
00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:24.925
I see.

61
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.225
Just as I expected.

62
00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:31.925
But most of the times, the password would be his birthday or something.

63
00:05:35.525 --> 00:05:38.425
I guess it's not all that simple.

64
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:40.425
Now what?

65
00:05:40.425 --> 00:05:43.225
There are 10,000 possible matches for 4 digit numbers,

66
00:05:43.225 --> 00:05:46.325
and it would take at least 8 hours to try them all out.

67
00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:48.425
What other possibility could there be?

68
00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:52.925
Maybe my birthday?

69
00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:58.625
How silly. Of course not.

70
00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:05.325
Impossible.

71
00:06:05.325 --> 00:06:07.025
That's impossible.

72
00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:09.525
But I guess there's no harm trying, right?

73
00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.425
Mine is...

74
00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:17.125
But what shall I do?

75
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:21.125
If it is, what should I do?

76
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:29.525
I see. It's not after all.

77
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.725
What number is it?

78
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:39.125
Tell me what it is.

79
00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.425
No, Ran. Cool down your head.

80
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:49.425
It seems they both went to sleep.

81
00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.725
Nobody will bother me here.

82
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.625
And a slight sound won't be heard.

83
00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.925
I've got all the time in the world, too.

84
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:06.725
2036, 2037.

85
00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:09.825
2038, 2039.

86
00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:12.725
2040, 2041.

87
00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:14.825
2042.

88
00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.125
No good.

89
00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.625
At this rate, it's going to take me till morning.

90
00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:23.025
I guess I'll just have to try to figure out

91
00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:25.325
the numbers that Shinichi is most likely to use.

92
00:07:25.325 --> 00:07:26.925
Let's see...

93
00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:30.625
He likes Holmes.

94
00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.525
Maybe the number is the year in which Holmes handled a case?

95
00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:37.125
No, that can't be it.

96
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:40.925
Because I checked all the numbers from 1 to over 2,000 just a while ago.

97
00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:55.625
Gosh. That noise!

98
00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:01.525
Hello it says (46-49, yoroshiku).

99
00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:04.025
What a jerk. Being noisy at this time of night.

100
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:09.025
Come to think of it a while back...

101
00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:18.125
Love romance movies are great after all.

102
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.925
They're really touching.

103
00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:24.725
Plagiarism. Touch up.

104
00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:27.525
That actress was really beautiful.

105
00:08:27.525 --> 00:08:29.025
Ugly.

106
00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.425
What? Ugly?

107
00:08:31.425 --> 00:08:34.125
No, maybe it's "big brother goes..."

108
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:37.325
Just what're you talking about, Shinichi?

109
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:40.225
What? The number plate of that car.

110
00:08:40.225 --> 00:08:41.325
What?

111
00:08:41.325 --> 00:08:44.325
10-39 is pronounced as "tosaku" (plagiarism),

112
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:46.925
and the other car's plate is 23-19

113
00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:48.325
which is pronounced as "busaiku" (ugly)

114
00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.825
or pronounced "nii-san iku" (big brother goes).

115
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:53.525
In other words, I'm playing words with the number on cars' plate.

116
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.225
What are you doing something like?

117
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:58.925
Exercising my brain because I'm a detective.

118
00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.525
It also serves as practice for solving codes.

119
00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:02.725
Oh, my.

120
00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:05.225
34-2 stands for "misshitsu" (behind closed-doors).

121
00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:07.925
93-89 stands for "kusayakyu" (amateur baseball).

122
00:09:10.725 --> 00:09:12.225
48-6?

123
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:13.525
Pronounced as "yowamushi" (weakling).

124
00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:15.025
89-31.

125
00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:16.225
Pronounced as "hakusai" (Chinese cabbage).

126
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:19.025
It's amazing that you can think it up one after the other.

127
00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.925
The one that made me laugh the other day was...

128
00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:22.825
Despite it being a flower shop vehicle,

129
00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:24.825
the number plate was 80-83.

130
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.925
80-83?

131
00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:30.625
"Yaoya-san" (A vegetable shop)?

132
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:31.625
Yes.

133
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.925
A flower shop should be 87-8.

134
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:36.525
You can say that again.

135
00:09:36.525 --> 00:09:38.325
Oh, wait.

136
00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:43.125
Meat shop is 29-83.

137
00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:45.925
And fish shop is 37-83, right?

138
00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:47.425
There's still more, Ran.

139
00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:50.625
A bath shop is 26-8.

140
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:53.125
And bean curd shop without the "san" at the end would be...

141
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:55.125
-10-2. -10-2.

142
00:09:58.025 --> 00:10:00.025
Recently, people get to choose the numbers they want to use

143
00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:03.225
for their number plates as long as they request it,

144
00:10:03.225 --> 00:10:07.225
but before this law was passed, there were no numbers ending in 42 or 49.

145
00:10:07.225 --> 00:10:09.225
Why not?

146
00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.025
42 is pronounced as "shining" (dead person).

147
00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:13.925
And 49 is pronounced as "shako" (death and suffering).

148
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:16.525
Dead people? Death and suffering?

149
00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:19.725
But recently, people doesn't seem to be bothered by things like that.

150
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:23.325
See, look at that.

151
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:26.525
46-49 or pronounced as "yoroshiku" (hello) seems to be quite popular.

152
00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:31.525
The numbers that are really popular

153
00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:34.325
can't be acquired unless you win the lottery for the numbers.

154
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:37.325
For instance, 11-22.

155
00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:39.225
11-22?

156
00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:40.925
Pronounced as "iifufu" (a married couple who gets along great).

157
00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:42.725
See, look over there.

158
00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:51.525
A married couple who gets along great.

159
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:56.125
I sure would like Dad to use a number like that if he ever buys a car.

160
00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:03.825
No. Your Dad's taste would be something like...

161
00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:07.325
10-70 or 81-09.

162
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:10.825
10-70 or 81-09?

163
00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:12.225
10-70 pronounced as "ii onna" (foxy lady)

164
00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:13.625
or 81-09 pronounced as "hairegu" (high cut revealing outfit)!

165
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.825
Gosh! How rude.

166
00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:23.125
Shinichi, what numbers would you prefer?

167
00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.225
Huh?

168
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.925
41-910 for Shinichi Kudo.

169
00:11:27.925 --> 00:11:29.925
-Huh? -There's one extra number there.

170
00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:35.525
I get it. 41-1.

171
00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:38.125
41-10...

172
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:39.425
That's quite good.

173
00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:41.125
Right?

174
00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:42.525
But too bad.

175
00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:43.825
Huh?

176
00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:45.625
Hiragana characters can't be chosen.

177
00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:46.625
Moreover,

178
00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:48.525
the Hiraganas that are in the "A" and "KA" rows of the Japanese alphabet

179
00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:50.325
cannot be used for cars for private use.

180
00:11:50.325 --> 00:11:52.525
Is that so?

181
00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:55.225
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

182
00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:00.325
That car...

183
00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:03.325
Shinichi?

184
00:12:03.325 --> 00:12:05.025
What about that car?

185
00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.825
Hey.

186
00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:11.625
Watch out.

187
00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.425
Please sit down.

188
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:20.425
Shoots.

189
00:12:20.425 --> 00:12:22.825
Driver, can you...

190
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.325
Of course he can't go after that car.

191
00:12:26.725 --> 00:12:28.425
We'll be stopping at the next stop.

192
00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:31.425
Hey. What's up, Shinichi?

193
00:12:48.025 --> 00:12:49.825
Shinichi?

194
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:27.388
Darn it!

195
00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:31.888
Officer!

196
00:13:31.888 --> 00:13:34.288
A car with a fraudulent license plate just went by.

197
00:13:34.288 --> 00:13:35.788
A fraudulent license plate?

198
00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:41.088
It's a black sedan with the plate number "Shinjuku 510-shi 15-64".

199
00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:45.488
But how do you know that the car has a fraudulent license plate number?

200
00:13:47.488 --> 00:13:50.788
15-64 pronounced as "hitogoroshi" (murderer).

201
00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:58.488
I mean you guys, just because the number can be read as "murderer"...

202
00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:01.788
The point is not the numbers, but rather, the Hiragana character.

203
00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:02.888
There should be no license plate numbers

204
00:14:02.888 --> 00:14:05.188
with the characters "shi" and "he".

205
00:14:07.788 --> 00:14:11.488
Going around like that with a fraudulent license plate numbers

206
00:14:11.488 --> 00:14:17.288
shows that they've planned out a crime and are about to execute it.

207
00:14:17.288 --> 00:14:18.888
You've got to go after them!

208
00:14:18.888 --> 00:14:19.988
Okay.

209
00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:22.988
Leave it to me!

210
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.488
Ran, you should go home.

211
00:14:25.488 --> 00:14:27.788
Shinichi.

212
00:14:34.088 --> 00:14:35.888
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

213
00:14:35.888 --> 00:14:37.288
Shinichi.

214
00:14:37.288 --> 00:14:40.288
So what happened after that?

215
00:14:40.288 --> 00:14:41.688
I was worried.

216
00:14:41.688 --> 00:14:43.188
Sorry, sorry.

217
00:14:43.188 --> 00:14:49.188
Those guys fell under the category number 510 and not 15-64.

218
00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.988
510?

219
00:14:50.988 --> 00:14:52.588
It's "goto" (robber).

220
00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:56.788
But thanks to my deduction it ended with just an attempt.

221
00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:58.688
So they were arrested?

222
00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:01.888
Sort of. Those idiots used numbers

223
00:15:01.888 --> 00:15:07.488
that symbolized "robber and murderer" to challenge the police.

224
00:15:07.488 --> 00:15:10.188
But placing "shi" on the number plate was taking it a bit too far.

225
00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:13.488
By the way, about your father,

226
00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:17.288
if he were to choose a number plate, how about 55-45?

227
00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:21.088
55-45?

228
00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:22.888
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

229
00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:24.688
Shinichi.

230
00:15:29.388 --> 00:15:32.088
Hey, Dad. If you were to buy a car...

231
00:15:32.088 --> 00:15:35.688
Shut up. Yoko Okino's coming on air soon.

232
00:15:35.688 --> 00:15:36.788
Yoko!

233
00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:41.588
You viewers out there get to see my live concert today!

234
00:15:41.588 --> 00:15:43.488
Go! Go!

235
00:15:43.488 --> 00:15:46.188
Let's go, Yoko!

236
00:15:46.188 --> 00:15:48.588
Yoko... Go, go...

237
00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:52.288
It's 55-45 (Go! Go! Yoko).

238
00:15:56.788 --> 00:15:59.788
5545.

239
00:15:59.788 --> 00:16:01.888
I'll try it, just in case.

240
00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:08.288
I guess not. After all he's not Dad.

241
00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:12.688
But back then, if I remember it correctly...

242
00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:18.288
Well, if I were to choose, it would be...

243
00:16:18.288 --> 00:16:21.188
I wonder what Shinichi was trying to say.

244
00:16:22.188 --> 00:16:26.488
If it's a four digit number, he could be using it as a password.

245
00:16:35.388 --> 00:16:38.688
But it might be a good idea to it out.

246
00:16:38.688 --> 00:16:40.288
For instance...

247
00:16:40.288 --> 00:16:44.688
Right. Like 4062 for Holmes.

248
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.888
No good. It's still locked.

249
00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:50.888
Lock.

250
00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:55.488
Right, Holmes' first name is Sherlock.

251
00:16:55.488 --> 00:16:58.188
4862.

252
00:16:58.188 --> 00:16:59.888
Well, I guess I'll try it.

253
00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:06.488
What?

254
00:17:06.488 --> 00:17:08.588
Seriuosly? It opened!

255
00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:10.888
What shall I do? What shall I do?

256
00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:12.688
Oh, no.

257
00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:14.388
I've unlocked it.

258
00:17:22.388 --> 00:17:24.488
I've got to check.

259
00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:28.788
I've got to check whether he received my mail or not.

260
00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:38.388
My mail isn't here?

261
00:17:38.388 --> 00:17:42.888
I see. He deleted it just in case.

262
00:17:42.888 --> 00:17:45.788
But that won't work cautious detective!

263
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:50.788
All I have to do is re-send this morning's mail to find out.

264
00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:56.588
Huh? It's not coming in.

265
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:01.688
Why?

266
00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:04.888
Why?

267
00:18:04.888 --> 00:18:09.488
How strange. The mail address is correct.

268
00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:10.888
Strange.

269
00:18:13.988 --> 00:18:15.388
The telephone!

270
00:18:15.388 --> 00:18:16.388
Telephone?

271
00:18:18.988 --> 00:18:20.388
Yes, hello?

272
00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:21.588
What is it?

273
00:18:21.588 --> 00:18:22.688
What?

274
00:18:22.688 --> 00:18:25.488
Sending the same mail over and over.

275
00:18:25.488 --> 00:18:27.588
What's the matter with you?

276
00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:28.888
Shinichi?

277
00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:33.288
Just what time do you think it is now?

278
00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:34.288
It's in the middle of the night you know?

279
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:35.388
Who is it?

280
00:18:40.688 --> 00:18:46.488
I'm working day in and day out on cases and are fast asleep.

281
00:18:46.488 --> 00:18:48.088
Until you call and wake me up.

282
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.088
Conan?

283
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.088
Do you know where my cell phone is?

284
00:18:53.088 --> 00:18:55.688
I've been searching for it for a while.

285
00:18:57.288 --> 00:18:58.588
Isn't that mine?

286
00:18:58.588 --> 00:19:00.888
-Think about me, will you? -Sorry.

287
00:19:00.888 --> 00:19:04.088
I picked it up in the car, and forgot to tell you about it.

288
00:19:07.788 --> 00:19:09.188
Huh?

289
00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:11.988
It was supposed to have been locked.

290
00:19:11.988 --> 00:19:13.288
Did you look inside?

291
00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:15.588
Nope.

292
00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:16.988
I didn't look inside.

293
00:19:16.988 --> 00:19:18.788
But why are you so concerned?

294
00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:25.088
Because mails from the girl I like are in here, too.

295
00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:27.988
Oh, I see. Right.

296
00:19:27.988 --> 00:19:30.188
Let me give you a piece of my mind.

297
00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:33.288
Goodnight.

298
00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:34.988
Okay, goodnight.

299
00:19:34.988 --> 00:19:36.888
You've always been like that.

300
00:19:36.888 --> 00:19:40.688
-I see, that's why Conan was so flustered. -Hey, are you listening?

301
00:19:40.688 --> 00:19:43.888
-He didn't want me to see the mails he received from girls. -I'm sleepy.

302
00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:50.688
You keep on repeating the same thing over and over and over.

303
00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:55.488
Tell me once and I get the message.

304
00:19:55.488 --> 00:19:58.388
Hey, Ran. Are you listening?

305
00:19:58.388 --> 00:20:01.288
What was that mail about anyway?

306
00:20:01.288 --> 00:20:03.188
I'm sorry, Shinichi.

307
00:20:03.188 --> 00:20:06.688
I must've been mistaken about something again.

308
00:20:07.988 --> 00:20:11.488
I'm sure glad Doc's cell phone was the same type as mine.

309
00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:12.688
You can't tell the difference between the two

310
00:20:12.688 --> 00:20:14.588
after the straps are exchanged.

311
00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:18.888
It sure took a while before I got mail from Ran though.

312
00:20:18.888 --> 00:20:21.288
I locked the cell phone to buy time,

313
00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:25.488
but maybe the password 4869 (Sherlock) was a bit too difficult.

314
00:20:25.488 --> 00:20:27.988
But that's the word numbers I could find

315
00:20:27.988 --> 00:20:30.788
that was common for both Conan and I.

316
00:20:30.788 --> 00:20:35.188
I'm so happy I got to hear Shinichi's voice after such a long time.

317
00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:38.988
Because even if I want to hear his voice,

318
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.088
it's hard for me to get a hold of him from my side.

319
00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:43.088
Please don't get me wrong.

320
00:20:43.088 --> 00:20:46.488
There's no deep meaning to it.

321
00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:50.188
You idiot. Take a good look at your cell phone display.

322
00:20:52.888 --> 00:20:55.588
What? This is...

323
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.888
This is your phone number, Shinichi?

324
00:20:57.888 --> 00:21:00.988
You mean, you don't mind giving it to me?

325
00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:03.488
I may call you at the wrong time, you know?

326
00:21:03.488 --> 00:21:04.888
No.

327
00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:08.388
But I'm so busy that most times all you'll get is my answerphone.

328
00:21:10.188 --> 00:21:12.588
I figured that sometimes there are things that can't be relayed correctly

329
00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:13.788
unless they are spoken.

330
00:21:15.588 --> 00:21:16.788
That's right.

331
00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:21.988
It's a bit risky telling her what my number is, but...

332
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:24.288
Well, if it's this kind of risk,

333
00:21:24.288 --> 00:21:26.188
it's worth it.

334
00:23:04.688 --> 00:23:07.288
Hey, what's with you two? Didn't you guys get enough sleep?

335
00:23:07.288 --> 00:23:09.588
Well, sort of.

336
00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:13.888
I couldn't help but remembered about a case that happened half a year ago.

337
00:23:13.888 --> 00:23:15.588
Half a year ago?

338
00:23:15.588 --> 00:23:17.788
Half a year ago?

339
00:23:17.788 --> 00:23:21.688
What's the license number plate of Mother's car, Dad?

340
00:23:21.688 --> 00:23:22.688
Eri's?

341
00:23:22.688 --> 00:23:25.188
I think it was "Shinjuku"...

342
00:23:28.288 --> 00:23:31.688
It's "36-ge 87-07".

343
00:23:31.688 --> 00:23:34.588
What? The Hiragana "ge"?

344
00:23:34.588 --> 00:23:37.788
Look at that. "36-ge 87-07."

345
00:23:39.388 --> 00:23:41.588
See! What a revolting woman!

346
00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:49.488
Gosh. Dad!

347
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:52.588
Well, I guess they'll continue living separated for a while yet.

348
00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:54.288
22-97 (tsuzuku-na) which means will continue.

349
00:23:54.288 --> 00:23:56.688
Conan, what did you just say? Something about continuing?

350
00:23:56.688 --> 00:23:57.688
What?

351
00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:08.688
"Next Episode"

352
00:24:08.688 --> 00:24:09.788
He smiled?

353
00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:29.588
Next Conan, "A Jewel Thief Caught Red-Handed (Part 1)"

354
00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.515
Next Conan's Hint:

355
00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:34.715
"Broche"

356
