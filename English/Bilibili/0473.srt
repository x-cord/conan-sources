1
00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.699
Younger brother!

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:04.999
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:06.299
Disclose the surprising secret hidden in the red light

4
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.299
that brings back memories even after ten years!

5
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.699
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.099
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.999
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:59.625
Ms. Kobayashi finds a leather wallet in the library.

9
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.825
In the wallet was a message that Ran wrote when she was in first grade.

10
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.825
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

11
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.725
Ten years ago,

12
00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.825
we were given a code in the school library from a man

13
00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:14.825
who claimed to be "Shinichi's younger brother",

14
00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:17.025
and end up going on a treasure hunt.

15
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.525
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

16
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:23.725
"The mark of Okuho."

17
00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:26.725
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

18
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:34.125
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 2)"

19
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.225
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

20
00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:36.625
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

21
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.625
"Okuho" is the name of a town and may be referring to Okuho-cho,

22
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.325
but the word after that is Greek to me.

23
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:46.525
Maybe it's a dentist?

24
00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:48.125
It says, "Clench your teeth"...

25
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.625
No, that's too simple.

26
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.325
Then, what was it?

27
00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.325
Quick, tell us Conan!

28
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.425
Hold your horses.

29
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.225
Try figuring out "Erase the mark of Okuho" first.

30
00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.425
I get it.

31
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.025
That's a supermarket!

32
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:03.725
Huh? A supermarket?

33
00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.325
You mean the leaflet that comes with the newspaper?

34
00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:07.325
Why?

35
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:09.225
Pa often says,

36
00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:13.325
"It's ma's job and up to her to do away with the reds."

37
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.525
That's why ma is always in a fix when shopping.

38
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:18.325
Wrong!

39
00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:21.125
It's not "akaji" (Means red words), but "akashi" (Means mark).

40
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:23.225
It means something that certifies

41
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.925
or a seal for something.

42
00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.925
If it means looking for a seal

43
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.225
it probably means scratching the silver off a lottery ticket with a coin.

44
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.025
But, it says erase the seal.

45
00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:34.425
A postmark?

46
00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:36.025
Don't tell me that the place is?

47
00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:39.025
Yeah, Ran was saying that.

48
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:42.825
Ten years ago, the young boy called Shinichi realized that too...

49
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:47.925
"Ten years ago" -What? Okuho Post Office?

50
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:50.225
Then, did you decipher the code, Shinichi?

51
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.625
Yeah, half of it.

52
00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.725
That word proof means mark, right?

53
00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:57.625
And it's saying to erase that so...

54
00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.825
I see! Postmark.

55
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:01.425
A postmark is stamped as proof that stamps

56
00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.825
and postcards have been used

57
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.725
So, it's the post office!

58
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:05.825
But...

59
00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:08.725
The people at the post office don't have strange voices.

60
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:09.825
No, they don't.

61
00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:12.925
I don't know about the part after that yet

62
00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:15.325
but if it's the post office, there's no harm going there.

63
00:04:15.325 --> 00:04:17.025
Huh, why?

64
00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:20.325
Because up to now, we figured out the place,

65
00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:22.425
went there and looked for something red

66
00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:24.425
then we found the next code.

67
00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:25.725
It was a repetition of that, right?

68
00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:27.625
The first red was a fire hydrant.

69
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.425
The next was a red alarm!

70
00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:32.725
And if this third code is a post office...

71
00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:36.925
I love red things.

72
00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:40.625
I got it! It's the post box, a bright red one!

73
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:42.025
Right!

74
00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:48.825
What? He took Ran with him again?

75
00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.325
Shinichi?

76
00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:53.725
Yes, they went out together with Mr. Agasa, our next door neighbor.

77
00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:57.025
I'm sure they said they were going to Haido Harbor...

78
00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.225
Haido Harbor?

79
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:01.825
That's where a murder was committed last night!

80
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:03.925
Well, there's nothing to worry about.

81
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.425
I hear that the case was solved this morning.

82
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.025
It's a holiday too.

83
00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:14.025
It's better than staying inside and watching TV and playing games.

84
00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:19.225
I think they should be able to go beyond the doors on a grand adventure.

85
00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:25.125
Well, our bookworm son was indoors reading book after book.

86
00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.325
So I'd like to thank your daughter for taking him out!

87
00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:31.425
I just said that Shinichi is the one who took her out!

88
00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.525
Come... Don't worry!

89
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:34.725
Geez...

90
00:05:34.725 --> 00:05:37.925
I mean Yuki, you're always so easygoing and happy-go-lucky.

91
00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:39.225
Oh, that's right.

92
00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:43.025
There was a call from the metropolitan police for Yusaku.

93
00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:45.325
They said to tell you, "Thank you for your cooperation."

94
00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:48.325
"Thanks to you the jewelry was protected."

95
00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:50.325
Oh, that case the other day.

96
00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:51.625
That case about that thief, whatever his name was,

97
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:54.025
that Yusaku brushed away.

98
00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.525
No... About that...

99
00:05:56.525 --> 00:06:00.225
It's more like the thief made a perfect escape.

100
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:05.125
But, why did they call you, Eri?

101
00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:08.925
Because they tried to call you a lot of times but they couldn't reach you.

102
00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:10.425
Oh, I get it, Yuu.

103
00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:12.025
You pulled out the telephone line again, didn't you?

104
00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:14.125
Oh, well, I wanted to concentrate on my manuscript

105
00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.725
because it's almost deadline.

106
00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:19.425
At any rate, tell those children to come home right away

107
00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.925
when you see them!

108
00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:24.125
Are you leaving already?

109
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.325
I really don't have that much time.

110
00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:28.525
I've got a court hearing coming up next week,

111
00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:30.325
so I've got arrangements to make.

112
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:33.625
I see. It's your first court hearing.

113
00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:34.625
Good luck!

114
00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:35.725
Thank you.

115
00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:39.025
Well, I may be beaten to a pulp because it's my first time.

116
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:41.225
If that happens please comfort me...

117
00:06:41.225 --> 00:06:42.825
All right!

118
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:49.225
Didn't you have to make arrangements with somebody yourself too?

119
00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:54.125
Remember, with the magician that you said you became a disciple of,

120
00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:55.625
in order to act out your role.

121
00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:57.825
I'd completely forgotten.

122
00:06:57.825 --> 00:07:00.425
I promised to meet him in order to write my essay!

123
00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:01.725
Was that today?

124
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:05.025
"Okuho Post Office" -Hey, Shinichi, the post box is here.

125
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.125
But there's nothing on it.

126
00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:11.425
Strange, I was sure this is the place.

127
00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:13.325
It seems that we have to decipher the phrase,

128
00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:17.225
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice" first.

129
00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.225
Hello! Here's the evening newspaper!

130
00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:22.525
How're you doing?

131
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.725
As you can see, it's "kanko dori" (Means virtually no business).

132
00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:26.025
"Kanko dori"?

133
00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:28.925
What's "Kanko dori"?

134
00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:30.825
It's "kakko" (Means cuckoo).

135
00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.525
It's referring to the "gakko" (Means school)!

136
00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:33.825
Let's go, Mouri!

137
00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:35.625
What? Mouri?

138
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:38.925
Okay.

139
00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:42.825
Hey, Shinichi!

140
00:07:42.825 --> 00:07:44.425
Shinichi!

141
00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:46.825
Geez. I told you before,

142
00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:48.925
not to call me by my first name at school!

143
00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:50.725
It's so embarrassing.

144
00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.725
But, Shinichi's your name and you're Shinichi, right?

145
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:54.625
Call me Kudo!

146
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:58.025
I'll call you Mouri.

147
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:02.225
Well, we're not little kids anymore,

148
00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:04.825
so please, okay, Mouri?

149
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.625
This is the only red thing near the school.

150
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.925
No, it doesn't seem like anything is pasted on anywhere.

151
00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:18.925
Look carefully because there's got to be something.

152
00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:21.025
It's just not up here.

153
00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:26.225
There's something pasted over here!

154
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:29.725
I see, this is a code made for children to decipher.

155
00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:32.925
That's why it's pasted on where we can reach it.

156
00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:35.025
What's this?

157
00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:36.625
It's all kanji characters.

158
00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:40.825
You mean you can't read it either, Doc?

159
00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:42.925
No, from everything we've seen so far,

160
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:47.425
I think that Beika at the top refers to Beika-cho, but...

161
00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:49.025
I wonder if it's Chinese?

162
00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:52.025
The word next to Beika is read as "Chuugoku" (Means China), right?

163
00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:56.625
True, but we can't say for sure that it's Chinese just yet.

164
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:57.925
"Beikachu"

165
00:08:57.925 --> 00:09:00.425
Beika Middle School...

166
00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:01.625
Was there any Beika Middle School?

167
00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:04.125
No, they have a university and high school

168
00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:05.825
but no Beika Middle School.

169
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:10.825
Besides, why is only the last word enclosed in a square?

170
00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:12.825
True...

171
00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:14.425
"East"

172
00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:16.225
This looks familiar.

173
00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:22.625
Ran!

174
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.525
Dad?

175
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.125
What're you doing here?

176
00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:30.525
Oh, well, you see, there's a reason for this...

177
00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:35.825
We're playing a game trying to decipher the code that Doc made.

178
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.425
Right, Doc?

179
00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:38.825
Yeah, well, sort of.

180
00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:42.925
-A code? -What brings you here, dad?

181
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:45.825
Well, it seems that the culprit we arrested this morning

182
00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:49.325
used to work at the post office over there,

183
00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:51.225
so I'm here to conduct interrogations with Inspector Megure!

184
00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:55.025
Codes sure sound nostalgic, though!

185
00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:59.725
I used to play spy games with my friends when I was a child too!

186
00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:02.525
But, it's so hard that we can't figure it out.

187
00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:04.525
Let's see, let me take a look!

188
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:07.125
Okay, but it's really difficult.

189
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.425
Gosh! What're you talking about?

190
00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:10.425
We're police officers, you know?

191
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:14.725
A child's code like this is duck soup. One look and...

192
00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:25.225
Hey, Mouri, can you figure it out?

193
00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.225
No, I have no idea.

194
00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:30.425
Well, at any rate,

195
00:10:30.425 --> 00:10:33.325
it's a very well made code.

196
00:10:33.325 --> 00:10:35.725
So you can't solve it after all.

197
00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:37.525
Oh, Inspector!

198
00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:39.925
Since it's been a while, how about playing a game of mahjong tonight?

199
00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:43.125
Oh! I was thinking the same thing!

200
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.925
I don't know why but after looking at that code,

201
00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:48.125
I suddenly felt this urge to play mahjong.

202
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.725
Oh, you too?

203
00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:52.825
"East" -Mahjong?

204
00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:56.225
Okay then, Ran, make sure you're home before dinner.

205
00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:57.525
Okay!

206
00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:09.433
Shinichi,

207
00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:13.233
this is a game called mahjong that was introduced to Japan from China.

208
00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.433
Like in the card game seven bridge,

209
00:11:15.433 --> 00:11:17.333
you have to draw the tile you need yourself,

210
00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:19.933
or wait for someone to throw the tile you need to win a game.

211
00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:22.133
Only, unlike seven bridge,

212
00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:25.233
in mahjong, like poker, you can have a complete hand.

213
00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:26.533
This, which is either "Tonba" (Means east wind)

214
00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:27.833
or "Nanba" (Means south wind),

215
00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:31.733
is the rule that call "ba" (Means wind) to control the game.

216
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.333
What? Mahjong?

217
00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:37.533
Are you saying that this code is related to mahjong?

218
00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:41.033
Yes, try thinking of it applying mahjong to it.

219
00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:44.633
It's true that the third character "Chu" (Means center)

220
00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:48.833
and the last character "East" are written on mahjong tiles,

221
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.333
but the other characters are not.

222
00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.133
The first two characters "kome" and "hana" (Same sound as Beika)

223
00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:55.333
indicate the names of towns,

224
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.333
therefore, Beika-cho is correct.

225
00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.733
The last character "East" that is drawn inside a square

226
00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:01.933
refers to the prevailing "ba" (Means wind) being played in mahjong.

227
00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:03.533
It's called "nanba" (Means south wind), "tonba" (Means east wind)

228
00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:05.033
and so forth, right?

229
00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:07.633
The above that "Kuni" and "Shi" refers to "Kokushi".

230
00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:08.933
In other words, it is the name of a special winning hand,

231
00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:10.233
"Kokushimuso" which consists of the number 1 and 9 of all the suits

232
00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:12.333
plus all the honor and flower tiles.

233
00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.233
Then, what about the character "Chu" (Means center) that's above it?

234
00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:17.433
Since "Chu" (Means center) is one of the mahjong tiles,

235
00:12:17.433 --> 00:12:19.933
so it could be "dora" but rather, if you have a "kokushi" hand,

236
00:12:19.933 --> 00:12:22.333
you'd be "machi" for the tile of your choice...

237
00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:23.733
"Machi" (Means waiting)?

238
00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:26.933
So, if you put all three characters together?

239
00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:30.133
"Machi" (Means city), "yaku" (Means role),

240
00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:31.133
"ba" (Means place).

241
00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.033
I see, it's City hall!

242
00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:39.233
I see, but there is no city hall in Beika-cho,

243
00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:41.933
it would be the ward office or the branch office!

244
00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:44.233
Okay, let's go there next then!

245
00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:47.833
"Beika Branch Office" -Nothing...

246
00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.133
Strange.

247
00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:53.133
There's no red thing anywhere, Shinichi.

248
00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:56.033
Well, it's already sunset.

249
00:12:56.033 --> 00:12:58.733
Shinichi, why don't we go home today for now

250
00:12:58.733 --> 00:13:00.233
and continue again tomorrow?

251
00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:03.033
After all, tomorrow's also observed holiday.

252
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.333
Observed holiday?

253
00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.833
I see! Today's a public holiday!

254
00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:10.433
What? What do you mean?

255
00:13:10.433 --> 00:13:13.233
There should be one standing on the roof of any government office.

256
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:22.233
"End" -The end?

257
00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:27.933
Is this English?

258
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:31.633
It's just the alphabets W and S.

259
00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:35.233
But, I don't understand the meaning of this arrow at all.

260
00:13:35.233 --> 00:13:39.033
Since "the end", is written on it, could this be the last code?

261
00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:43.433
Hey, could the alphabets W and S have some sort of meaning as is?

262
00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:45.233
W and S...

263
00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:47.933
I see! It's direction!

264
00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:50.733
S stands for south

265
00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:53.533
and W stands for west!

266
00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:57.533
Then does this arrow mean to go from south to west?

267
00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:03.933
Maybe it means to "look that way too" or simply, "look that way"?

268
00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:06.533
If so, south is this way.

269
00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:07.833
So, west is...

270
00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:08.933
This way.

271
00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:17.033
How beautiful!

272
00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.733
I see. That's what it is.

273
00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:23.733
-What? -I know now.

274
00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:26.133
I've figured out who thought up this code.

275
00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:27.933
Who did?

276
00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:29.633
My Dad.

277
00:14:29.633 --> 00:14:33.033
Dad asked one of his friends and used the code

278
00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:36.133
to bring us all the way here!

279
00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:38.933
Just to show us this sunset!

280
00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:40.333
I guess he did this

281
00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:41.933
because I've been cooped up at home recently

282
00:14:41.933 --> 00:14:44.833
doing nothing but reading books.

283
00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:48.233
But, wasn't it just a coincidence that

284
00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:52.133
you met the man who gave you that code?

285
00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:56.933
Sonoko said that she heard that a ghost appears in the library at school

286
00:14:56.933 --> 00:14:59.333
from a man who came to deliver new books.

287
00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.933
It's most likely that the man Sonoko was referring to was the man we saw.

288
00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:04.033
I see.

289
00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.333
Telling Ran's friend about it

290
00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:08.433
would guarantee that you would hear about it too.

291
00:15:08.433 --> 00:15:10.733
And since you can't resist mystery stories,

292
00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:12.833
you would be lured to go to school.

293
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.333
Exactly!

294
00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:19.333
In other words, dad manipulated us just the way he wanted to!

295
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:20.833
But it's nice

296
00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:23.533
that we got to see this beautiful sunset too.

297
00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.633
Oh, I hate to admit it,

298
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.933
but I totally agree, Ran.

299
00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:31.133
Oh, sorry, Mouri.

300
00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:32.933
Come off it! Ran's okay!

301
00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:34.733
I prefer you calling me Ran!

302
00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:40.533
Is it no good?

303
00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:44.233
If...

304
00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:46.933
if that's the way you want it then...

305
00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:48.633
I guess it's okay with me.

306
00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:49.833
Really?

307
00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:51.833
All right, Shinichi!

308
00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:53.633
Hey!

309
00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:55.233
Cut it out!

310
00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:59.533
I've got to thank your father!

311
00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:01.433
Oh, come on, if you're going to thank anybody,

312
00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:03.233
thank the man who gave us this code,

313
00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:05.733
that's still hanging around nearby.

314
00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:07.433
-What? -What?

315
00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:10.033
Is that guy somewhere nearby?

316
00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:13.233
Yeah. In order to make sure that we get to see this beautiful sunset,

317
00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:16.333
he's got to be glued to us, right?

318
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:20.033
Because he would have no idea how long it would take us to solve the code!

319
00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:23.433
I see! He would have to watch us right through,

320
00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:26.733
then make it to the next place before us and get the next code ready,

321
00:16:26.733 --> 00:16:28.233
adjusting the time and all.

322
00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:30.633
In other words, so long as he got us to come here,

323
00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:33.533
the codes that were found in between could've been anything!

324
00:16:33.533 --> 00:16:37.433
But, maybe he's your father.

325
00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:40.333
No, dad would already have appeared saying something like,

326
00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:43.433
"What took you so long?"

327
00:16:43.433 --> 00:16:46.033
Hey, Mr. Yesterday Night!

328
00:16:46.033 --> 00:16:48.133
I know you're somewhere listening!

329
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.933
I'll leave my opinion in this wallet that you gave me last night

330
00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:53.133
so come and get it!

331
00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:57.433
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

332
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.533
Come for sure!

333
00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:06.333
That's why the message,

334
00:17:06.333 --> 00:17:09.933
"Thank you, 1st grade, class A, Ran Mouri"

335
00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:11.633
is written on the paper inside the wallet!

336
00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:14.233
What a nice story.

337
00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:18.033
But the book that the wallet was found behind...

338
00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:20.633
Wasn't "Gentleman Burglar", was it?

339
00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:22.533
It can't be helped.

340
00:17:22.533 --> 00:17:24.433
Ten years have already gone by.

341
00:17:24.433 --> 00:17:27.233
So, even the location of the book's been changed several times.

342
00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:31.633
I guess the man never came to get the book, though.

343
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:33.833
I would think that he'd know where the original place the book was

344
00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:36.933
even if its location were to be changed, right?

345
00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:38.433
I guess so too.

346
00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.733
But, the man who thought up the code,

347
00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:42.833
seems to have run out of everything at the end.

348
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.433
Huh, why do you think so?

349
00:17:44.433 --> 00:17:47.933
Because although the riddles were interesting till part way,

350
00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:50.333
towards the end, all it had were the codes "S" and "W"

351
00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.333
and "look to the west."

352
00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:53.933
It kind of fizzled out at the end.

353
00:17:57.133 --> 00:17:58.233
No.

354
00:17:58.233 --> 00:18:00.033
My deduction is wrong!

355
00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:02.333
If he wanted us to see the setting sun,

356
00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:04.033
"W" would've sufficed.

357
00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:07.033
The "S" and arrow wouldn't be necessary.

358
00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:08.633
Then, why the arrow?

359
00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:11.633
What are the "S", "W" and "arrow" supposed to be then?

360
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:16.333
And why only at the end, there are symbols that indicate directions?

361
00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:18.933
Direction?

362
00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:20.133
Conan?

363
00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.433
I'm sure the first was...

364
00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:23.533
Harbor.

365
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.233
"Toriya Castle Ruins" -Next, is the castle ruins...

366
00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:32.333
The "flood gate" with the same name.

367
00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:34.933
A post office.

368
00:18:34.933 --> 00:18:36.333
A middle school.

369
00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:40.633
"Beika Branch Office"

370
00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:43.933
City hall.

371
00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.033
They're symbols used on maps.

372
00:18:47.133 --> 00:18:49.533
Come to think of it, the symbol for post office

373
00:18:49.533 --> 00:18:52.033
is the character "proof" inside a circle.

374
00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:54.433
So, "erase this" means...

375
00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.933
This?

376
00:18:57.133 --> 00:19:00.533
Only the symbol of the ward office was drawn vertically,

377
00:19:00.533 --> 00:19:04.933
so it must mean to change the position of this symbol like this...

378
00:19:04.933 --> 00:19:07.233
and as for the "S", "arrow" and "W",

379
00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:08.733
means from south to west.

380
00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:11.333
So, if this is placed this way.

381
00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:18.833
Oxhide?

382
00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.933
Leather?

383
00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:22.333
It's this wallet!

384
00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.033
We were wrong!

385
00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:31.133
I mistakenly thought that the one who made the code was nearby...

386
00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:35.833
I'll hide it behind the book "Gentleman Burglar" that you were reading!

387
00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:38.233
Come for sure!

388
00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:40.133
-Conan? -Hey?

389
00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:41.533
What's going on?

390
00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:43.933
I see. I get it.

391
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.833
No kid could figure out a code like this.

392
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.333
It was for dad.

393
00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:51.433
This code was made for dad to figure out to begin with.

394
00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:52.833
If I couldn't figure it out,

395
00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:56.033
the man figured I would beg dad to help me decipher it.

396
00:19:56.033 --> 00:19:59.033
That means, ten years ago...

397
00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.933
But, if so, how would what happened?

398
00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:04.933
"Ten years ago"

399
00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:08.733
Thank you so much for today.

400
00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:10.733
Oh, did you catch cold?

401
00:20:10.733 --> 00:20:15.233
No, maybe somebody's talking stink about me.

402
00:20:15.233 --> 00:20:17.533
Because after all, we magicians thrive on deceiving people,

403
00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:21.033
in other words, we're swindlers.

404
00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:23.933
No way! You're not a swindler.

405
00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:28.033
But it's too bad Mr. Kudo couldn't come here.

406
00:20:28.033 --> 00:20:31.933
Rather, it would probably be more accurate to say I was relieved.

407
00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:36.133
To Kudo, magic is like constructing a building on sand.

408
00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:38.733
He would see through the trick in an instant.

409
00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:40.333
My, how modest.

410
00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.833
You're the "seventh knight" that I have encountered,

411
00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:45.833
Toichi Kuroba of all people.

412
00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:49.133
I read that essay every time.

413
00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:50.533
My wife is a great fan.

414
00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:53.733
I'll give you this,

415
00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:55.033
because middle-aged lady is beautiful!

416
00:20:55.033 --> 00:20:57.733
Huh?

417
00:20:57.733 --> 00:21:00.433
Hey, Kaito! Stay still.

418
00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:03.233
My, what a peppy young lad!

419
00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:05.133
But, sonny,

420
00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:09.533
the words beautiful and middle-aged lady don't match!

421
00:21:12.433 --> 00:21:14.333
Since I won't get to see Kudo,

422
00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.033
could you tell him to mail his reply to the friend of mine

423
00:21:16.033 --> 00:21:19.333
that I mentioned the other day, whose letter that will be delivered here,

424
00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.533
to this address.

425
00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:23.633
Oh, about the letter from a fan of Yusaku, right?

426
00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:25.033
When I told him about it,

427
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:29.133
he said he already wrote an answer for me to take it to that person.

428
00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:32.733
But, his answer was not one you would call a letter or anything like that.

429
00:21:32.733 --> 00:21:34.333
Wait!

430
00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:38.433
Could it have been just one exclamation point?

431
00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:39.633
Am I right?

432
00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:40.933
What?

433
00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:42.633
Yes.

434
00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:44.633
But, how did you know?

435
00:21:45.733 --> 00:21:48.033
Just as would be expected of the one who gave me my name.

436
00:21:48.033 --> 00:21:49.133
Huh?

437
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:52.433
That certain friend that I'm referring to

438
00:21:52.433 --> 00:21:56.433
also wrote a similar letter consisting of just one symbol.

439
00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:02.233
"Dear Yusaku Kudo".

440
00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:05.333
"Kaito No. 1412".

441
00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:07.233
Come to think of it, the other day...

442
00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:10.233
Did you know that Yusaku is the one who gave Thief Kid his name?

443
00:22:10.233 --> 00:22:11.933
He misread the scribble of the notes of a reporter

444
00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:16.333
and thought that the number 1412 that was written was "K-I-D."

445
00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:20.133
I'm your sibling.

446
00:22:20.133 --> 00:22:23.033
Rather, I should say, your younger brother.

447
00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:25.133
That's why back then, he...

448
00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:28.333
Are you gonna be able to stop me next time?

449
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:31.233
Yeah. Of course.

450
00:22:31.233 --> 00:22:33.333
But, what's the meaning of this?

451
00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:34.933
This question mark.

452
00:24:02.633 --> 00:24:06.933
"Next Episode" -I wonder who's the man in the picture with mom.

453
00:24:06.933 --> 00:24:10.733
Come to think of it, she wasn't wearing her ring.

454
00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:13.233
Which means that maybe...

455
00:24:14.833 --> 00:24:15.833
She's having an affair?

456
00:24:15.833 --> 00:24:17.833
Let's go after her, Conan!

457
00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:20.733
It's full of scratches.

458
00:24:20.733 --> 00:24:24.333
The words that came out with tears.

459
00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:26.633
I see. So that's what it was.

460
00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:28.533
Next Conan,

461
00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:32.633
"Attorney Eri Kisaki Falls in Love"

462
00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:50.833
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:52.633
"Baby talk"

464
00:24:52.633 --> 00:24:54.233
I'm dating in the next episode!

465
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:56.433
-With who? -Attorney Kisaki.

466
00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:57.533
-What? -What?
