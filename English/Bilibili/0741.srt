1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,540
Ran and I, in order to have lunch with Ran's mother, Attorney at Law Kisaki

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,240
went to the condo where she was working to wait for her.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
There, we coincidentally run into Masumi Sera.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Masumi asks Ran to help out with the investigation and she agrees.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,140
As a part of the investigation,

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,640
we look for a resident of that condo.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,440
Waka?

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,340
Please get a hold of yourself! Waka!

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,940
Waka...

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,940
are slashed by the light of deduction.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,940
Sera's deduction and another mystery.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,940
A shrewd trick that you'd want to close your eyes on.

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,840
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:42,453
"The Restroom Where Ran Also Collapsed (Part 2)".

18
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,753
A detective?

19
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,053
"Kenya Settsu (22), University student" -What do you mean, Rumi?

20
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,253
"Rumi Kitao (21), University student" -There's rumor going around

21
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,853
that you haven't broken up with Waka yet,

22
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,353
so I...

23
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,353
Rumi, you...

24
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,553
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:02,153
At any rate...

26
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,153
Circumstances show that

27
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,153
"Mitsuaki Kaga (22), University student" -either one of you is the perp!

28
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:13,053
That's true,

29
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,453
but there's still another possibility.

30
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,153
Rumi.

31
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:23,153
I found this picture in the living room.

32
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,853
In the picture, all of you are wearing glasses.

33
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:28,553
Why's nobody wearing glasses now?

34
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,653
That picture was taken about two years ago.

35
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,253
Everybody's using contacts now.

36
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,453
What?

37
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,953
The murder weapon was found?

38
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:43,053
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,553
Luminol reaction was detected

40
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:47,853
on the golf club that was found in the living room.

41
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,053
In addition, a tiny bottle of chloroform and syringe

42
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,853
were found in the drain of the sink.

43
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:56,353
And from the drain of the bathroom,

44
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,353
a red paint-like fluid was found.

45
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:01,053
Red paint?

46
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:03,653
Why would something like that be...

47
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:05,953
The shower that was left running in the bathtub

48
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,853
was also strange to begin with.

49
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,253
In order to camouflage the estimated time of death

50
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:11,853
without lowering the temperature of the rectum,

51
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,853
all you'd normally do is shower the water directly on the body, no?

52
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:19,353
What the hell's going on with this case anyway?

53
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:24,453
Ran. Rumi's the one who used the spare key

54
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,453
to open the door of this room, right?

55
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,453
Yes.

56
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:30,153
Did she has some difficulty back then?

57
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,353
No, not really.

58
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:35,253
It looked like she was used to doing so.

59
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:40,253
But when she took the key out of her pocket like this...

60
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,853
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,653
Pick it up for me, please.

62
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:48,853
Give me a break.

63
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,053
Oh, well...

64
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,953
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,653
Thank you for helping me pick them up!

66
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:56,753
Here you go.

67
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,953
Be careful not to drop it again.

68
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,653
Just as I thought.

69
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,453
So, that's the story!

70
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:10,353
The fact that I realized this means she probably did too.

71
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,653
Telephone?

72
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,153
With who?

73
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:19,153
Hey, is my deduction wrong?

74
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:23,853
At any rate,

75
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:27,053
the ones who were able to slug the resident of this room, Waka Hashitani,

76
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,853
to death

77
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:31,653
are you, Mr. Settsu, who was going with her until six months ago

78
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:34,653
and still had the spare key to the room

79
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,153
and you, Mr. Kaga,

80
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:40,153
the one who was here drinking with the victim till 5:00 this morning,

81
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:43,553
and had the possibility of having taken the key home.

82
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,653
Just the two of you!

83
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:50,453
It seems that you were supposed to meet the victim at this condo

84
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,853
for a lunch date.

85
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,353
Mr. Settsu goes to the restroom 30 minutes before the scheduled time.

86
00:05:58,353 --> 00:06:01,753
And Mr. Kaga comes to the lobby after noon,

87
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:04,553
but your whereabouts before that are unknown.

88
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:06,253
Come on, and spit it out!

89
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:09,153
One of you two did it, didn't you?

90
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,253
Hey, hold it.

91
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:14,853
Waka was collapsed on the floor of a bathroom

92
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:16,253
filled with chloroform, you know!

93
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:17,753
If we're the perps,

94
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,453
why would we have to set the bathroom up like that?

95
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,053
I'll bet you were planning

96
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,553
to put Rumi who went to call the victim to sleep,

97
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,253
in order to delay the discovery of the corpse or something.

98
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,853
The more delayed,

99
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:36,153
the more ambiguous the estimated time of death becomes.

100
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:39,353
Rumi's saying that until she went to call Waka,

101
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:43,353
she was together with a detective or something,

102
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,553
but who knows if that's really true.

103
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,553
Kenya...

104
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:51,153
Since Rumi used to room share this condo room with Waka,

105
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,853
she may still have had the key on her too.

106
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,753
It could be that she's pairing up with that detective

107
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,953
to match their story.

108
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,653
Don't the pieces fit in too well?

109
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,353
She suddenly comes out

110
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,953
and says that Rumi has an alibi

111
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:06,553
because they were together right through.

112
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:10,853
No, I never said that Rumi has an alibi.

113
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:14,853
All I said was that,

114
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:16,953
if Ran who went to Waka's room together with Rumi,

115
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,553
found Waka's dead body,

116
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:23,253
the perp is one of you two men.

117
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:27,653
If that corpse wasn't Waka,

118
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,353
it would be a different story.

119
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,453
What?

120
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,253
But I...

121
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,753
Really, it was Waka's body.

122
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:39,453
Maybe you just think it was?

123
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:42,753
You've never met Waka before, have you?

124
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,353
That's true.

125
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,153
On top of that, the corpse was face down,

126
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:48,553
with a facial pack on her face

127
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,953
and a towel wrapped around her head.

128
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,153
And the bathroom was smoky

129
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,853
because of the steam from the shower too, right?

130
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:58,553
Even if somebody else was disguised as her,

131
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:01,153
you wouldn't have been able to tell.

132
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:04,853
Hey, Conan, don't you think so too?

133
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:06,053
Yep.

134
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,353
She... Don't tell me...

135
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,653
Somebody was disguised as her?

136
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:14,053
Just who are you saying was disguised as Waka?

137
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:17,053
She was lying on the floor wrapped only in a bath towel, right?

138
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:18,153
Yes.

139
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:21,053
I'm sure it was a woman.

140
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,253
If so,

141
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,653
the only one who could've done that

142
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:27,653
would be the one who came to call Waka with you...

143
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,853
Rumi, right?

144
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:35,353
In other words,

145
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:37,953
when Rumi came here with Ran,

146
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,653
she pretended to go to the living room

147
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:45,053
then made Ran goes to the bedroom that was on the opposite side,

148
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,053
and made her look for Waka.

149
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,453
Then, Rumi, goes into the bathroom

150
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,553
and changes into a bath towel while Ran isn't looking

151
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,453
and puts facial pack on her face.

152
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:01,453
She then wraps a towel around her head,

153
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,953
and pours drops of red paint her head,

154
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,353
to make it look as if she's dead.

155
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,553
In just about the time that Ran would come

156
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:13,553
and find the body in the bathroom,

157
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,253
Rumi used the syringe

158
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,853
to inject chloroform into the air

159
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,453
and let it evaporate.

160
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,453
Are you all right?

161
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:24,753
Waka?

162
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,453
Ran who goes into the bathroom...

163
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:33,253
then fainted.

164
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:39,053
Of course all this time, Rumi holds her breath.

165
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,453
Hold it!

166
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,553
Where was the victim at that time?

167
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,753
I think she was sleeping in the living room.

168
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:48,553
Because like they said, Waka previously also slept

169
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:53,053
on the veranda by the living room when she got drunk.

170
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:59,453
If Rumi knew that Waka and Mr. Kaga were drinking here till morning...

171
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,353
"Waka Hashitani" -After Mr. Kaga leaves,

172
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:08,653
and at just about that time, Rumi calls Waka on the phone

173
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:13,553
and urges her to go to the veranda to sober up.

174
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:16,853
It would've been easy for her to put Waka to sleep as is.

175
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:19,253
Right.

176
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,753
After Ran fainted,

177
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,553
Rumi leaves the bathroom once

178
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:26,553
and airs the chloroform out

179
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:29,853
and washed away the red paint.

180
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:34,853
Rumi puts on her clothes wakes Waka, who is sleeping in the living room up,

181
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:37,553
and tells her that an unknown girl is collapsed on the floor

182
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,153
in order to make her go to the bathroom.

183
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,953
Then she finds Ran collapsed on the floor.

184
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,353
While Waka is in shock at what she sees,

185
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,053
Rumi slugs her to death with a golf club from behind.

186
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:51,353
Rumi then wraps a towel around Waka's body,

187
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,053
puts facial pack on her face

188
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,353
and wraps a towel around her head.

189
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,953
Then, she fills the bathroom up with chloroform again.

190
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,953
And this time, she really inhales it and faints.

191
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,953
Rumi waits for all the others to come.

192
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:10,453
Who would ever think that the one who went to check on the victim

193
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:14,553
would in such a short time disguise herself as the dead body?

194
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,153
You're wrong!

195
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,153
I didn't do that!

196
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:20,753
Besides, I went to the living room

197
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,853
only because I got a call from Kenya.

198
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,153
But you said that you were going to look for

199
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,953
the thing that Mr. Settsu forgot in the living room

200
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,353
even if you didn't get a call from him, right?

201
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:30,553
Yes.

202
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:34,253
Well, even if you didn't have the spare key that Mr. Settsu gave you,

203
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:37,153
you would've probably said you were planning to return the key

204
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,653
that you had since the time you were room sharing with Waka

205
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,053
and use it anyway.

206
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,453
If you hired me as a detective

207
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:49,253
to make me witness you being the corpse in disguise,

208
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:51,253
everything falls into place.

209
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:55,653
Well, I had Ran substitute for me this time though.

210
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,053
You could've

211
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:00,853
let your younger sister who was supposed to come to lunch with you today

212
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,853
play this role too,

213
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,953
but since you probably figured that your younger sister

214
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,853
would see through this trick,

215
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,753
you decided to have someone else do it for you.

216
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,153
No. I...

217
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,253
Inspector!

218
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,553
Fingerprints have been detected from the chloroform bottle.

219
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:22,353
Hey, don't tell me it's the fingerprints of Rumi Kitao?

220
00:12:22,353 --> 00:12:23,353
Yes, sir!

221
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:26,253
Great deduction!

222
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,753
You're pretty good, young one!

223
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:29,953
Yeah.

224
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:31,353
That deduction...

225
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,753
doesn't feel right, does it?

226
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,137
Doesn't feel right?

227
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,037
What're you talking about?

228
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,237
It's wasn't me.

229
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:55,337
Shinichi who heard about the case from Conan

230
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:57,737
told me to tell you, so...

231
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,937
I'll put my phone on speaker phone.

232
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,037
Shinichi Kudo...

233
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:04,237
I don't know where you come from or who you are,

234
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:05,237
but outsiders should keep their noses out of this.

235
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,937
What concerns me are the following three points.

236
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,637
Although it was explained

237
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:15,237
that the victim was made to sleep in the living room like she once did,

238
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:19,437
but back then, that just happened by chance.

239
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:22,537
Even if you were able to lead somebody conveniently to the living room,

240
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,937
I don't think you could also make that person go to sleep.

241
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,937
Let's say that luckily that person fell asleep,

242
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:30,737
it's doubtful whether that person would keep on sleeping

243
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:33,837
until somebody comes to get her.

244
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:37,137
There's also the risk that she may awake with the ringing of the doorbell.

245
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:41,937
Then, what if Rumi had put Waka to sleep using chloroform

246
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:45,437
way before we came here?

247
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:48,337
If so, the doorbell wouldn't wake her, would it?

248
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,637
That's the second problem.

249
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,937
If it was so,

250
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:57,237
why did Rumi lock the front door?

251
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,937
"Shinichi" -If Mr. Settsu didn't coincidentally give her the spare key?

252
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:06,737
If she had to use the key that she had forgotten to return to Waka?

253
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:10,737
She would end up being the primary suspect, wouldn't she?

254
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:14,337
Besides, if she had put Waka to sleep beforehand,

255
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:19,637
it'd been safer to make Waka play the role of the dead body herself.

256
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:22,437
She wouldn't have had to go out of her way to hold her breath

257
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,037
in order to play the role of the dead body herself.

258
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,337
And the third point is that

259
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:30,837
the dead body was lying on its stomach

260
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,837
with only a bath towel wrapped around its body.

261
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:39,037
People are never really aware how they look from behind.

262
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:43,837
They may have moles and marks they themselves don't even know about.

263
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,537
If Ran sees that and finds out that

264
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:48,037
the body is not who it's supposed to be, everything goes down the drain.

265
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:52,637
It's the worst style and position that an imposter would want to be in.

266
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:56,237
But the facial pack covered her face

267
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:59,037
and steam obstructed visibility.

268
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,537
No matter how you look at it...

269
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,337
That's just it.

270
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:04,337
If the face of the corpse was hidden

271
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,737
and the visibility was bad,

272
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:10,037
there would be suspicion that the body would've been another person.

273
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:13,937
That was indeed what the perp had in mind to begin with!

274
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:17,537
The body was wrapped in a bath towel and placed on its stomach

275
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,137
because the perp wanted whoever discovered the corpse

276
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,037
to think that the face of the corpse was hidden,

277
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:25,437
as well as to immediately tell at first glance that it was a woman.

278
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,737
If so,

279
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:29,437
the one who was acting as the corpse would've had to be a woman therefore,

280
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,637
you'd be jotted off the list of suspects,

281
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:35,137
as well as successfully frame Rumi up as being the perp.

282
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,837
Isn't that right?

283
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,837
You came here and left

284
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,837
to use the restroom 30 minutes before the scheduled time,

285
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,737
slugged Waka to death

286
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,937
and set up the trick I just mentioned.

287
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:47,737
Her ex-boyfriend...

288
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,337
Mr. Kenya Settsu?

289
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:56,537
-What the? -Right.

290
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:59,537
You came here

291
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,937
and when Waka was off guard,

292
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,837
you made her sniff chloroform and put her to sleep.

293
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,137
After carrying Waka to the bathroom,

294
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:09,037
you removed her clothes and wrapped her in a bath towel.

295
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:10,837
You covered her face with facial pack,

296
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,837
and after wrapping her head with a towel,

297
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,937
you slugged her to death with a golf club.

298
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,037
Then you finished off

299
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:20,437
by washing the red paint down the drain of the bathroom

300
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,137
and filled the room up with chloroform.

301
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:27,237
You called Rumi who went to get Waka,

302
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,437
led her to the living room

303
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:33,437
and made time for her to disguise herself as the corpse.

304
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:37,237
After the incident, if Rumi's fingerprints are detected from

305
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,537
the bottle of chloroform that was hidden,

306
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:44,337
you figured that you could deceive the police.

307
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,837
By the way, the bottle with the fingerprints on it

308
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:51,037
is probably something that Mr. Settsu made Rumi touch beforehand.

309
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,937
If the two were going together,

310
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:55,237
all he had to do was line it up on the seasoning shelf or something,

311
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,337
to make her touch it.

312
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,737
Hey, I don't know who you are,

313
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:05,137
but if it's the trick you just mentioned, even Kaga could've...

314
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,637
That's why I had Conan try it out.

315
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:10,837
You had him try it out?

316
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:14,737
Remember? When I had you two pick up the coins for me?

317
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:17,037
Back then, I showed you the palm of my hand

318
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,837
and told you to give them to me, right?

319
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,937
You put the coins on the palm of my hand for me, Mr. Kaga.

320
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:26,437
But Mr. Settsu, you stuck your palm out to me

321
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:29,337
and told me to take it myself, right?

322
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,337
That's how I found out, Mr. Settsu,

323
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,937
that you couldn't measure the distance.

324
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:37,837
That's why you couldn't put the coins on my hand.

325
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:40,937
Despite me holding the palm of my hand out,

326
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:45,137
you went out of your way to make me take the coins from your hand.

327
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:49,337
Well, you dropped the spare key for the same reason

328
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:52,037
when you gave it to Rumi,

329
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,537
so it's understandable that it was the only thing you could do.

330
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,937
Just what're you talking about?

331
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,837
Contact lens.

332
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:02,837
One of the contact lens of Mr. Settsu's eyes wasn't on.

333
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,237
It probably came off when

334
00:18:05,237 --> 00:18:07,137
Waka struggled to pull free of him

335
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:09,237
when he tried to make her sniff chloroform.

336
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:14,137
He hurriedly looked for his lens on the floor but couldn't find it.

337
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,337
Why, because,

338
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:19,737
Waka who was made to sniff the drug,

339
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:23,037
even as she was going faint, picked it up and hid it.

340
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,437
Hid it, where?

341
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,037
The victim's clothes was totally removed after that, you know.

342
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:30,337
Like you were saying too, Inspector, remember?

343
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:32,837
Something's strange about the corpse.

344
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,237
I see, the wink!

345
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:40,037
The victim hid it in her own eyes!

346
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,737
-Check the corpse out on the double! -Yes, sir!

347
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:47,137
Even if the contact lens were to be found in the room later,

348
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:51,137
he was probably going to say he lost it when he was going with her

349
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:54,237
but couldn't find it then, and play dumb.

350
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:56,837
If the lens is in her eye

351
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:59,337
and if none is found in yours,

352
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,337
that's concrete evidence.

353
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:05,337
Your fingerprints should be on the contact lens too.

354
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,937
Hey, it's not true, is it, Settsu?

355
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:10,537
Why on earth would you do something like that to Waka?

356
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:13,337
Didn't you guys break up?

357
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:16,937
Yeah. In order to start going with the daughter of the chairman.

358
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:20,237
The daughter of the chairman, you mean that freshman?

359
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:22,137
I had no choice.

360
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,837
Waka's father is senior executive managing director.

361
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:27,837
The other is the chairman of all the affiliate companies, you know.

362
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,837
If I get to successfully marry her,

363
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,737
I'd be super rich.

364
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,737
I was also already unofficially promised a post in the company too,

365
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:37,037
and insured a promotion.

366
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:38,537
But, if you guys split up,

367
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:41,337
you didn't have to kill her, did you?

368
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,137
Waka was threatening me.

369
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:46,037
She said that she would disclose

370
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:49,437
all the evil things I did till now the moment I made the new girl my own.

371
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,837
I did bring a lot of tears

372
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:54,037
to a countless number of girls till I met Waka, you see.

373
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:56,037
Then, what was I to you?

374
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:59,537
Why did you start going with me?

375
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,337
If the chick that I was going with is killed right after we split,

376
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:04,837
I'd be suspected, right?

377
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,437
If rumor goes around

378
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,637
that I'm going with you but still haven't really split up with Waka,

379
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:14,237
you'd have a motive to kill Waka out of jealously.

380
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:17,737
Well, at least you got to go with me for half a year.

381
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,737
Just make good memories out of it, okay?

382
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:29,737
Sorry.

383
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:33,737
My head gets itchy when I hear stupid stories

384
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,937
that my elbow jabs unconsciously.

385
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:39,237
If you go on telling stupid stories,

386
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,437
next my buttocks are going to get itchy

387
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:43,637
and my knees may just jab into you.

388
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:45,837
Would you like that?

389
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:47,137
No.

390
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:55,937
But, how amazing!

391
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:58,537
To see right through that deception, fantastic!

392
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:01,737
It's not me, but Shinichi who did it.

393
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:07,237
No joke. Shinichi hung up.

394
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,737
Come to think of it, Shinichi said,

395
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,437
that he figured out the deception after hearing that mascara

396
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,437
was dripping from the corner of Waka's eye.

397
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:15,537
It seems that the perp realized

398
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:17,637
that if facial pack was going to be put on the face,

399
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:21,437
first make-up had to be removed, so the lipstick was wiped off.

400
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:23,337
If the perp were a woman,

401
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,937
she would never have overlooked the mascara.

402
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:30,037
He said that Masumi probably never used mascara,

403
00:21:30,037 --> 00:21:32,337
so she overlooked it.

404
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:33,937
I see.

405
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,537
"Incoming calls: Shinichi"

406
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:42,437
I don't think Shinichi ever used mascara either.

407
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:08,437
You were messed up in a murder case?

408
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:11,437
Why didn't you tell me about it?

409
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:14,637
Well, Masumi the detective was there too.

410
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:18,337
Shinichi actually solved the case, though.

411
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:21,237
Bye. See you.

412
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:22,637
Oh, she's...

413
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,537
Huh? Do you know Masumi?

414
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:30,337
Yes. Just before noon, I came down to this lobby

415
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,137
in order to let you know that my work

416
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,537
was going to take more time than expected.

417
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:37,437
But you two weren't here yet

418
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:39,937
and that girl was on the phone.

419
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:42,137
The phone? With who?

420
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,237
I wonder.

421
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:46,537
But she was saying something like "big brother" after a person's name.

422
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,837
It could've been her big brother.

423
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:57,037
"Next Episode"

424
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:00,937
Are you here with your girlfriend today to watch the soccer game?

425
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:03,237
That's why player Sanada...

426
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:06,037
aimed for the upper left corner of the same goal.

427
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,137
A strong straight ball.

428
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:11,437
Mr. Sanada, No big deal, no big deal!

429
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:13,937
That man...

430
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:15,937
Looks suspicious.

431
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,637
Next Conan,

432
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:21,637
"Promise with the J-Leaguer".

433
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,237
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:39,237 --> 00:24:41,737
"Sanada Takahiro".

435
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:43,537
Kudo, the genius of make-up.

436
00:24:43,537 --> 00:24:44,937
It's deduction based knowledge.

437
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:46,537
Somehow I feel more upset.
