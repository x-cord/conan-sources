"Kagami Studio"

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.570
The Youth Detective Squad and Ran

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.570
came to tour a studio run by an acquaintance of Dr. Agasa.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.470
It's the bronze giant.

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.970
-Talos! -Talos!

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.470
It even looks like bronze up close.

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.270
It looks so heavy.

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.070
I hope we get to see the completed Talos soon!

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.170
I'm so excited!

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.670
Mr. Yamagata.

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.770
Yeah. We were right.

12
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.670
Your sense of professional self-satisfaction won't fix the problem.

13
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.170
Whether we live or die

14
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.870
is a matter of business.

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.670
"President's Office" -I'll say it again!

16
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.170
I'm rejecting your plan!

17
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.370
Do you understand?

18
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670
I wracked my brain

19
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.270
because I understood your daughter's suffering.

20
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.570
How can you say that without hearing me out?

21
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.670
You've lost your humanity.

22
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.370
You've gone too far.

23
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.170
Why shouldn't I?

24
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.970
Because of your cowardice,

25
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.770
Mr. Yamagata will never be able to show off his talents.

26
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.870
What was that sound?

27
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.170
Could it be?

28
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.470
Tadashi?

29
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.070
Tadashi!

30
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.070
Where are you?

31
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.870
Answer us!

32
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.070
Come out if you're okay!

33
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.170
Look!

34
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.370
Isn't that Mr. Hanyu?

35
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.470
What?

36
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.670
"Tadashi Hanyu (25)" -Tadashi...

37
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.670
In my eyes are maximum creation.

38
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.370
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

39
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.570
A sad reality lurks within a studio of dreams!

40
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.470
What happened on the observation deck?

41
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.970
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.770
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.270
His name is Detective Conan!

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:11.069
"The Killer Fist of Talos (Part 2)"

45
00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.169
What? It wasn't an accident?

46
00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.369
No.

47
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.969
Judging by the wound on his head,

48
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.769
it's hard to imagine this was an accident.

49
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.869
"Tokuichi Yamagata (35)" -Which means the culprit is still...

50
00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:24.669
Somewhere around here.

51
00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.269
Hey, what's going on?

52
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:27.469
"Eizo Kagami (58), Kagami Studio President" -Hanyu!

53
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.469
What's happening?

54
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.069
Manager Hanyu?

55
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.469
He's still breathing.

56
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.969
We've already called an ambulance.

57
00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.069
More importantly...

58
00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.869
It's likely the culprit is still lurking nearby.

59
00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:42.569
Search the area.

60
00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.369
-Please. -Yes, sir!

61
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.169
The culprit might have a weapon.

62
00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.069
Be careful.

63
00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.369
Got it.

64
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.969
Everyone, please stay there.

65
00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.569
"Shinobu Kagami (23)" -What is this?

66
00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.469
What is it, Ms. Shinobu?

67
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.369
I found this on my hand.

68
00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:11.169
I think it was next to Tadashi's injury.

69
00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.369
I recognize that color.

70
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.069
Isn't that the color of Talos?

71
00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.369
Could it be?

72
00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.569
Did those fists strike Mr. Hanyu?

73
00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:21.569
That's impossible.

74
00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.869
Talos has no legs.

75
00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:24.469
It couldn't do that.

76
00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.969
We didn't find any suspicious persons inside the dome,

77
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.069
just figures and models that fell

78
00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.869
when the power went out.

79
00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.369
Could they have entered through a window or vent?

80
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:40.969
There were no signs of that either.

81
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.069
We're checking the security camera footage right now,

82
00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.269
but we haven't found any suspicious persons.

83
00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:50.769
Then who hit Hanyu?

84
00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.369
Take good care of Hanyu.

85
00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.269
He's very important to us.

86
00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:59.369
I will.

87
00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.969
So the culprit

88
00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.669
took advantage of the opportunity to escape.

89
00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.469
But we ran here as soon as we heard him scream.

90
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.469
I don't think they had time to do that.

91
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:15.669
Hey!

92
00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.369
No one came through here.

93
00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.869
I didn't see any suspicious persons either.

94
00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:22.169
Me neither.

95
00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.969
We came in a hurry so we can't be certain.

96
00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.469
Either way,

97
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.269
this had to be the work of someone

98
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:32.269
who intimately familiar with the facility.

99
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.169
It's natural to assume the culprit used the situation created

100
00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.069
by the loss of power and falling models to hit Mr. Hanyu,

101
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.669
but that wouldn't have given them enough time to flee.

102
00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.369
Then there's the bronze paint...

103
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:53.069
Why was it on Mr. Hanyu's wound?

104
00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.469
An outsider snuck in?

105
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.369
We're known domestically and internationally

106
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.069
for our products with originality.

107
00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.969
I think it's possible.

108
00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:07.269
Then shouldn't your security be tight?

109
00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:10.969
It's just a possibility.

110
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.169
It would be wise to have our security guards look into it.

111
00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.869
We should tell them.

112
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:19.169
You're right.

113
00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:20.869
Is there something bothering you?

114
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:22.169
Yes.

115
00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.169
The service entrance door was broken.

116
00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.769
It couldn't be locked.

117
00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:31.269
That's it. The culprit must've entered through there.

118
00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:32.469
Wrong!

119
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:35.669
-What? -That door's fine.

120
00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.969
After all, I made sure it couldn't be opened.

121
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:44.169
You're right. It doesn't look like it was moved.

122
00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:48.569
This and the security camera footage

123
00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.269
eliminates the possibility

124
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.069
that a suspicious person entered

125
00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.569
through the main or service entrance.

126
00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:55.569
Nice work, Genta.

127
00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:56.969
Yes!

128
00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:59.769
In other words, one of us is the culprit.

129
00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:02.769
Just before the crime,

130
00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:05.369
we were saying hello to Mr. Yamagata.

131
00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:09.469
Ms. Shinobu was with us the whole time.

132
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:12.369
Agasa, are you saying I did it?

133
00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:14.169
Of course not!

134
00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:15.969
That's not what I'm saying.

135
00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:19.269
I was just stating the truth.

136
00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.469
They've been friends since college.

137
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:26.069
Apparently they argued often as students.

138
00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:27.469
I see.

139
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:28.969
Hey, Mr. President.

140
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:33.069
How many remotes are there that control the dome's facilities?

141
00:08:33.069 --> 00:08:34.269
There are two.

142
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:38.869
Yamagata and the tour guide, Shinobu, each have one.

143
00:08:38.869 --> 00:08:41.969
Mr.Yamagata, do you have your remote with you right now?

144
00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:44.269
Yeah...

145
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:46.369
You must mean this.

146
00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:48.969
Can you differentiate it from the other remote?

147
00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:51.969
No. They're both the same shape.

148
00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:58.569
We'll start by asking everyone for their alibi.

149
00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:01.169
President Kagami, what were you doing?

150
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:05.069
When I heard Hanyu scream,

151
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:06.869
I'd just concluded a deal over the phone

152
00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:09.969
and was preparing to leave in my office.

153
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:13.469
The security guards were just returning...

154
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.769
Right?

155
00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.769
Yes, that's right.

156
00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:19.969
What I'm wondering is

157
00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:22.769
why Mr. Hanyu was on the observation deck?

158
00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:26.469
Why was it necessary to shut off power to the dome?

159
00:09:26.469 --> 00:09:29.069
The dome's lights shut off,

160
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:31.069
and we heard the models fall

161
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:33.569
after Mr. Hanyu's scream.

162
00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:36.769
Since the lights came back on immediately afterwards...

163
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:42.169
it's likely Mr. Hanyu had a remote.

164
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:48.069
Which means he should have dropped it around here.

165
00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:49.669
Looking for something?

166
00:09:50.969 --> 00:09:52.569
Good timing.

167
00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:56.169
Could you split up and look for a remote?

168
00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:59.169
You can stay within a 10 m radius.

169
00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.069
Got it.

170
00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:09.469
Why are we looking for a remote?

171
00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:12.669
Remember how the dome's lights shut off?

172
00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:15.569
But they immediately came back on, so...

173
00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:16.769
So?

174
00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:20.669
So that means Mr. Hanyu had the remote until then.

175
00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:22.769
Mr. Hanyu used it to shut off the power

176
00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:26.469
while standing there.

177
00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:28.569
Maybe the power shut off because he dropped the remote

178
00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:30.469
when he was attacked.

179
00:10:30.469 --> 00:10:31.469
No.

180
00:10:31.469 --> 00:10:33.769
If that were the case, the power would have gone out

181
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:36.269
after Mr. Hanyu screamed.

182
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.069
Right.

183
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:42.669
Which means Mr. Hanyu chose to shut off the power.

184
00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:45.369
But why?

185
00:10:45.369 --> 00:10:47.469
We searched pretty thoroughly,

186
00:10:47.469 --> 00:10:49.069
but we didn't find the remote.

187
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:52.769
Maybe the culprit took it with them.

188
00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:53.869
That's it.

189
00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:55.669
That must be it.

190
00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:57.069
Yeah.

191
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:59.869
Even if the culprit did,

192
00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:02.269
they didn't have time to leave

193
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:04.569
without being spotted by us.

194
00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:06.269
That's right.

195
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:07.369
Huh?

196
00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:08.369
What?

197
00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:09.569
What is it?

198
00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.969
During the tour...

199
00:11:19.969 --> 00:11:23.469
Ayumi, you took a picture of the floating boat, right?

200
00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:25.569
What? Yeah.

201
00:11:25.569 --> 00:11:26.969
Let me see for a while.

202
00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:29.469
Here.

203
00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:31.869
Thank you.

204
00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:34.569
I knew it!

205
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.269
Look.

206
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:39.069
This is the last place we saw the floating boat

207
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.269
during the tour.

208
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.769
But now, it's over there.

209
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:47.269
You're right!

210
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.469
The boat is in a different location.

211
00:11:49.469 --> 00:11:50.869
But why?

212
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:54.569
Maybe it moved when the power shut off.

213
00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:57.869
It may be a light fiberglass boat,

214
00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:01.769
but would losing power make it move that far?

215
00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:05.969
I found this on my hand.

216
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:10.569
I see. So that's how it is.

217
00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:22.136
Anything unusual?

218
00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:25.236
No matter how small.

219
00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:26.636
Is there anything at all?

220
00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:28.036
Come to think of it,

221
00:12:28.036 --> 00:12:30.936
while I was on the phone,

222
00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:34.536
someone visited my office.

223
00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:38.736
I heard the door open and close twice.

224
00:12:38.736 --> 00:12:39.736
Twice?

225
00:12:39.736 --> 00:12:43.536
That means someone entered and then left.

226
00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:46.736
Do you have any idea who it was?

227
00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:50.136
I thought it was Hanyu or Yamagata.

228
00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.136
Was it you?

229
00:12:52.136 --> 00:12:54.836
No. It wasn't me.

230
00:12:54.836 --> 00:12:57.536
Then it must've been Hanyu.

231
00:12:57.536 --> 00:13:01.536
Or maybe the culprit had already snuck in by then.

232
00:13:01.536 --> 00:13:04.536
Inspector, we still haven't found any signs

233
00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:06.536
that anyone entered or left the studio

234
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:09.836
around the time of the crime.

235
00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:13.736
We'll have to thoroughly search the studio.

236
00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:16.736
Please find the culprit.

237
00:13:16.736 --> 00:13:19.536
This man's ideas alone

238
00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:21.836
are a treasure trove for anyone in this industry.

239
00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:24.736
Please don't, president.

240
00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:27.436
Don't be modest.

241
00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:29.736
You should hold your head high.

242
00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:34.436
But I burn so much money...

243
00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:41.536
It's my job as well as Hanyu's to complain about you.

244
00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:44.036
Don't worry so much about it, you fool.

245
00:13:47.336 --> 00:13:48.836
There are plenty of places for the culprit to hide

246
00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:51.736
like offices and storage rooms.

247
00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:54.436
If they came for our industry secrets,

248
00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:56.936
then while they were looking for treasure...

249
00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.836
I see.

250
00:13:58.836 --> 00:14:03.836
It's possible they ran into Hanyu then.

251
00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:05.436
What is it, Conan?

252
00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:10.436
There's something I want to ask Ms. Shinobu.

253
00:14:16.536 --> 00:14:17.836
It's me.

254
00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:21.036
How is Hanyu?

255
00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:23.236
You're crying too much to understand.

256
00:14:23.236 --> 00:14:25.736
Pull yourself together.

257
00:14:25.736 --> 00:14:28.136
He's in critical condition.

258
00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:30.236
What should I do, dad?

259
00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:33.536
Why don't you believe in him?

260
00:14:33.536 --> 00:14:34.736
When he wakes up,

261
00:14:34.736 --> 00:14:38.636
the first thing he'll want to see is you looking well.

262
00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:42.136
You're right. Thanks, Dad.

263
00:14:42.136 --> 00:14:44.936
What about the culprit?

264
00:14:44.936 --> 00:14:47.136
Unfortunately, they still haven't...

265
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.936
What?

266
00:14:48.936 --> 00:14:50.436
Please...

267
00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:51.636
What is it?

268
00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.336
You're a nuisance, aren't you?

269
00:14:53.336 --> 00:14:54.536
He sure is.

270
00:14:54.536 --> 00:14:59.336
Sorry, but could you do as he asks?

271
00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:01.036
What are you talking about?

272
00:15:01.036 --> 00:15:03.436
Take this kid and...

273
00:15:05.536 --> 00:15:07.536
Tell me.

274
00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:08.736
Tell you what?

275
00:15:08.736 --> 00:15:11.236
Do you have your remote with you?

276
00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:14.536
What are you doing?

277
00:15:14.536 --> 00:15:16.036
I have it.

278
00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:19.436
What about this?

279
00:15:19.436 --> 00:15:21.036
Never mind, then.

280
00:15:21.036 --> 00:15:22.436
Thanks.

281
00:15:24.436 --> 00:15:26.936
You mischievous brat!

282
00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:29.036
Who is he?

283
00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:36.636
Looks like you solved the mystery.

284
00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:38.736
Yeah, more or less.

285
00:15:38.736 --> 00:15:42.736
Dr. Agasa, there's one more thing I want to confirm.

286
00:15:42.736 --> 00:15:43.736
What?

287
00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:48.936
We'll begin thoroughly searching

288
00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:51.236
the entire studio for the culprit.

289
00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:53.236
We appreciate your cooperation.

290
00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:56.936
-Yes, sir. -There's no need for that.

291
00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:02.236
Dr. Agasa, what do you mean?

292
00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:04.436
I know who did it.

293
00:16:04.436 --> 00:16:06.536
-What? -The culprit?

294
00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:07.736
Who is it?

295
00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:09.836
Now... Calm down.

296
00:16:12.036 --> 00:16:15.436
Well, what's next?

297
00:16:17.536 --> 00:16:21.036
Dr. Agasa, he said something about the remote.

298
00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:23.536
Oh, yeah. That's right.

299
00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:24.936
Are you listening?

300
00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:28.636
There are two remotes that control the dome's facilities.

301
00:16:28.636 --> 00:16:30.936
Isn't that right, President Kagami?

302
00:16:30.936 --> 00:16:32.736
Yes, that's correct.

303
00:16:32.736 --> 00:16:37.836
And one of those was used during the crime.

304
00:16:37.836 --> 00:16:40.936
The power came back on immediately after it was shut off, but...

305
00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:45.236
During that moment,

306
00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:48.636
all the models floating in the air fell.

307
00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:52.836
But one of them behaved unnaturally

308
00:16:52.836 --> 00:16:54.836
which is...

309
00:16:54.836 --> 00:16:56.836
the floating boat.

310
00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:01.036
When the power goes out,

311
00:17:01.036 --> 00:17:04.736
the no longer suspended swinging boat

312
00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:08.936
should fall to its lowest point.

313
00:17:08.936 --> 00:17:11.936
However, the floating boat is over there,

314
00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:13.636
in a different position

315
00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:15.636
from the one it was in before the attack.

316
00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:18.336
How did that happen?

317
00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:20.236
Uh, well...

318
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:21.836
That...

319
00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:24.636
I was the first to notice.

320
00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:27.536
I was looking at the photos Ayumi took.

321
00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:29.136
See?

322
00:17:29.136 --> 00:17:33.636
This was the floating boat's final position during our tour

323
00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:38.436
and now it's over there after the attack.

324
00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:40.436
You're right. It moved.

325
00:17:40.436 --> 00:17:44.136
Someone must've moved it using the remote.

326
00:17:44.136 --> 00:17:47.336
Mr. Yamagata, do you know anything?

327
00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:49.536
I...

328
00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:51.436
Or maybe...

329
00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:56.236
Mr. Hanyu had a remote during the attack.

330
00:17:56.236 --> 00:17:58.536
As the last to arrive,

331
00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:02.436
wouldn't you have had the opportunity to retrieve the remote

332
00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:05.336
while we were distracted by discovering the injured Hanyu?

333
00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:08.436
I don't know anything.

334
00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:09.736
Mr. Yamagata,

335
00:18:09.736 --> 00:18:12.936
aren't you the one who overheard my conversation

336
00:18:12.936 --> 00:18:14.436
with Kagami in his office?

337
00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:16.836
Doesn't this studio exist

338
00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:18.836
because of Mr. Yamagata's talent?

339
00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:21.136
You don't know anything.

340
00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:22.836
My company's been in the red

341
00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:24.536
since his father worked here.

342
00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:26.036
No way...

343
00:18:36.236 --> 00:18:37.436
What's this?

344
00:18:39.836 --> 00:18:42.336
Then you should hate me.

345
00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:45.836
Why did you attack Hanyu?

346
00:18:45.836 --> 00:18:48.236
That's right.

347
00:18:48.236 --> 00:18:50.736
You were my target!

348
00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:53.436
I tried to set a trap for you!

349
00:18:54.536 --> 00:18:57.136
I've created something I'm proud of.

350
00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:00.436
Use your remote in the dome.

351
00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:04.036
You'll see something incredible when the power goes out.

352
00:19:06.136 --> 00:19:08.736
I left you a note.

353
00:19:08.736 --> 00:19:11.836
I wasn't expecting Hanyu to be there.

354
00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:16.536
I finally get it now.

355
00:19:16.536 --> 00:19:18.536
Hanyu wanted to present your new product

356
00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:23.436
to the Suzuki Financial Group as a gift.

357
00:19:25.136 --> 00:19:27.736
Without realizing it was a trap.

358
00:19:32.736 --> 00:19:35.336
Your target was President Kagami,

359
00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:38.236
but Mr. Hanyu fell for your trap instead.

360
00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:42.036
You can tell us all about it at the station.

361
00:19:43.236 --> 00:19:45.936
There's no point in running!

362
00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:47.836
There's no exit that way!

363
00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:48.836
Could it be?

364
00:19:48.836 --> 00:19:50.836
Stay back!

365
00:19:50.836 --> 00:19:52.636
Watch out! Everyone, get down!

366
00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:57.436
It vanished?

367
00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.736
What?

368
00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:07.236
What is that?

369
00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:09.536
Talos's hand!

370
00:20:09.536 --> 00:20:10.836
Run!

371
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:12.236
Yamagata!

372
00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:19.636
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:23.736 --> 00:20:25.436
No, you don't!

374
00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:38.436
"Kagami Studio"

375
00:20:47.536 --> 00:20:48.636
Yamagata!

376
00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:51.336
Listen to me.

377
00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:55.136
I just made a deal with Franklin Planning.

378
00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:57.836
This studio will become Franklin's Japanese branch.

379
00:20:57.836 --> 00:21:00.036
None of the employees will be laid off.

380
00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:01.836
We'll keep the whole staff.

381
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:05.536
The Kagami name and I will be gone,

382
00:21:05.536 --> 00:21:07.136
but the studio will continue operating

383
00:21:07.136 --> 00:21:10.236
under the name Yamagata Room on a trial basis.

384
00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:13.436
You should be grateful, you fool!

385
00:21:18.636 --> 00:21:20.236
Once you've gotten that through your head,

386
00:21:20.236 --> 00:21:23.236
go do your job.

387
00:21:23.236 --> 00:21:27.636
Everyone's waiting for you, you fool.

388
00:21:36.436 --> 00:21:38.036
I'm sorry for the trouble.

389
00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:07.936
Dad, Tadashi has regained consciousness.

390
00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:10.536
The hospital director said he's fine

391
00:23:10.536 --> 00:23:12.536
and not to worry.

392
00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:16.036
I see. That's great news, Shinobu.

393
00:23:16.036 --> 00:23:18.736
Did you find the culprit?

394
00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:23.936
What's wrong, Dad?

395
00:23:28.736 --> 00:23:30.836
Don't worry, Shinobu.

396
00:23:30.836 --> 00:23:33.636
The case has been solved.

397
00:23:33.636 --> 00:23:37.436
Your father was a good man after all.

398
00:23:42.236 --> 00:23:44.836
I'm sure Talos will get his day eventually.

399
00:23:44.836 --> 00:23:46.636
Yeah.

400
00:23:46.636 --> 00:23:49.836
I'm sure the giant's entire body will be completed.

401
00:23:49.836 --> 00:23:51.036
Someday.

402
00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:55.836
"Next Episode" -You may not be strong

403
00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:57.936
but you've got money.

404
00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:00.136
You'll pay, won't you?

405
00:24:00.136 --> 00:24:04.136
Apparently they've found dinosaur bones and footprints before.

406
00:24:04.136 --> 00:24:07.636
All right! Let's find an ammonite!

407
00:24:07.636 --> 00:24:10.836
Which means someone poisoned the bathroom beforehand

408
00:24:10.836 --> 00:24:15.436
and made the victim touch it.

409
00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:24.336
Next Conan, "The Dangerous Fossil Finding Trip"

410
00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:27.779
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.579
"Insects"

412
00:24:29.579 --> 00:24:31.379
-Golden Week! -Over the ten day break...

413
00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:33.779
-Playing at the movie theater is... -"The Fist of Blue Sapphire"!
