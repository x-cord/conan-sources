1
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,109
Today's case is hard to take in.

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,709
It may not be right,

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,709
but a person's warmth is hard to erase.

4
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:13,309
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,109
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,909
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,409
You see, today is a special day.

8
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,412
My lover's coming over.

9
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:46,997
Really?

10
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:52,377
Sachiko is a super career woman.

11
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:56,006
I didn't think she was interested at all in men,

12
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:58,800
but I'm surprised she has a boyfriend.

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,013
Somebody that she can cook for...

14
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,681
Ran.

15
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,476
You have people you can cook for too, Ran.

16
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:12,606
But Shinichi hasn't been home at all.

17
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:15,484
No, I meant Pops and me.

18
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,278
Right!

19
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,781
However, the following day...

20
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,993
She was killed?

21
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,704
She was living alone.

22
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:35,879
Sachiko!

23
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:43,011
"Illusionary Spring Lover"

24
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,305
"Nishimura"

25
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:46,890
Mr. Mouri, this is not a case where we need you

26
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,184
to have come all the way here.

27
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:53,814
My daughter owes her a lot.

28
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,190
I'd like to at least be informed of the circumstances.

29
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,485
The body was found by

30
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,779
a colleague of hers that had doubts about her not coming to work

31
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,614
without reporting her absence, came to visit her.

32
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:04,991
The cause of death is a fractured skull

33
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,910
from a sharp blow on the back of her head.

34
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,789
The weapon is a bronze figurine that was found in the room.

35
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,585
The estimated time of her death is last night from 7:30 pm to 8 pm.

36
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:18,296
In the middle of dinner...

37
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,883
Was Sachiko a smoker?

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,596
If not, this side is Sachiko's seat

39
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:30,100
and the other side is the seat of her guest who was a smoker.

40
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,895
It's no doubt that someone such as her boyfriend came to visit her.

41
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,105
At about 7:30 pm,

42
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:37,899
The woman living next door heard

43
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:40,193
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

44
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:44,197
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

45
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,699
It's not fair that you go to see

46
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,784
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

47
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:52,789
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,003
It seems that her boyfriend's hobby was mountain climbing.

49
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,213
We found this picture here.

50
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:08,013
Her boyfriend's probably responsible for this crime.

51
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,681
Why?

52
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:15,103
If someone came in and attacked Sachiko all of a sudden,

53
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:17,814
where did her boyfriend disappear to

54
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:19,816
without even reporting the incident to the police?

55
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:21,484
Well...

56
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,694
True.

57
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:26,281
Like I was saying, it's not an incident that calls for your help.

58
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,201
The police thinks that her boyfriend is the killer, too?

59
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,078
There is no other possibility taking into consideration the circumstances.

60
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,082
Takagi here.

61
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,877
None? Not even one?

62
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,714
All right.

63
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,591
It's from the forensic officer.

64
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,593
They found no fingerprints what so ever

65
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,094
other than that of Ms. Sachiko Nishimura from the bronze figurine

66
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:50,096
that is thought to be the murder weapon,

67
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:54,100
the picture of the mountain, or the wine glass

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,103
that they both were thought to have toasted with.

69
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:59,189
No fingerprints left?

70
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,691
No traces of them being wiped off either.

71
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:06,196
If so, this is a carefully planned homicide.

72
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:10,909
He came to visit her after he made sure that

73
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,577
no fingerprints would be left behind.

74
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:22,796
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

75
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,012
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

76
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:34,182
And a while after they began eating...

77
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:38,311
He made Sachiko get up from her seat.

78
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,402
Why?

79
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:49,114
Why do you say it's her boyfriend that did that?

80
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,783
He was after her money.

81
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:53,201
There is nothing valuable

82
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,078
such as money and jewelry anywhere in sight.

83
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:59,416
That's hard to believe, isn't it, Conan?

84
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,086
Because Sachiko looked so happy yesterday, didn't she?

85
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,297
Today is a special day.

86
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,675
My lover's coming over.

87
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:12,887
That boyfriend...

88
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,098
couldn't have killed her!

89
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,475
Right, Conan?

90
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,477
Yes.

91
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:24,607
If so then, Ran, where did that man disappear to?

92
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,277
It's strange that he left no fingerprints behind either.

93
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:34,200
Something doesn't feel right.

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,077
I wonder what it is?

95
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:39,205
I confirmed with a colleague of hers.

96
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,291
I was told that she started going with her boyfriend

97
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,501
about six months ago.

98
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,587
However, it seemed that he was really busy or something

99
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:50,008
that he only came to visit her on the 25th of each month.

100
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,594
So, it seemed that Ms. Nishimura

101
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:56,389
always seemed excited from morning on the 25th.

102
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,892
Yesterday was also the 25th.

103
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:01,978
I wonder if there's any meaning to the fact

104
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,316
that he only comes to visit her on the 25th of each month?

105
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:09,194
It seems that even that colleague though,

106
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:12,614
was never told what her boyfriend's name was.

107
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:15,075
Which means we have no clue what so ever?

108
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,577
I went to visit her best friend since her school days

109
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,788
who lives nearby too, but...

110
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:23,583
No way! Sachiko was?

111
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,211
I just swung at air.

112
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:32,509
She didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

113
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,303
She hid the fact from her best friend?

114
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:36,888
Why?

115
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:40,683
At any rate, it's her boyfriend did it, Ran.

116
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,399
We'll try to crack who the killer is

117
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,901
from among her acquaintances as soon as possible.

118
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,778
Yeah, please do so.

119
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:55,490
I'll try and trace what the victim did yesterday.

120
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,493
Maybe I'll get a lead to her boyfriend.

121
00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:59,702
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,708
Now that they know who the killer is,

123
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,794
I guess there's no role for a detective to play.

124
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:09,212
Let's go home.

125
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:12,382
Officer Takagi!

126
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,384
Please let me go with you.

127
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:18,012
I just can't believe that her boyfriend is the killer.

128
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,682
Ran.

129
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:33,695
What?

130
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:37,282
You saw Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend come running out?

131
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,785
Yes. I think it was around 8 pm last night.

132
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:55,592
But, how did you know that the man was Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend?

133
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:59,387
I think it was on the 25th of last month.

134
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,181
There was a big fire.

135
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:06,811
My apartment is right opposite Ms. Nishimura's condo.

136
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,314
When I happened to look out casually...

137
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:16,279
You mean the man that you saw a month ago during the fire

138
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,615
was the same man who came running out last night?

139
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:21,409
His eyes were blood-shot, and he ran like he was lurching forward.

140
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:25,079
Excuse me. May I have your name, please?

141
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,582
Me? I'm Suenaga.

142
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:28,708
Mr. Suenaga.

143
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,712
Will you help us make a composite picture of that man?

144
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,589
Okay.

145
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,799
But let me go tell the boss.

146
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,388
There's even eye-witness.

147
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:44,390
I guess this is it.

148
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,683
Ran.

149
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,395
With a composite picture in hand,

150
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,397
if they go asking around the vicinity where the victim lived,

151
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:55,193
it's just a matter of time before they find the killer.

152
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:58,988
But there's something that bothers me.

153
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:00,615
I wonder what it is.

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,494
It's about time!

155
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,792
What's the matter? Eat, you guys.

156
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,377
Okay.

157
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,795
Conan?

158
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:16,005
What? Yes.

159
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:20,802
What?

160
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:23,596
-Good? -It's really good.

161
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,890
I'm glad.

162
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,977
What's this? Did you make me check to see if it was okay or what?

163
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,896
No, it's not that.

164
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,983
But I wasn't sure if it was seasoned enough.

165
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:41,614
Ran, Sachiko must have been really hungry.

166
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:42,907
Why?

167
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:47,412
Because the steak and salad on her side of the table were eaten,

168
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:50,999
but her boyfriend's side was untouched.

169
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:58,506
So what, you brat?

170
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:00,300
Not possible.

171
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,594
That's strange, really strange.

172
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:05,305
What's so strange?

173
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:07,599
Maybe...

174
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,100
But...

175
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,978
The woman living next door heard

176
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,314
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

177
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,985
She only heard Sachiko's voice.

178
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,404
Yeah. If that's how it was,

179
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,906
it's understandable that there were no other fingerprints.

180
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:28,703
If so, why did she put on such an act?

181
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,585
Hey, what's up with you all of a sudden?

182
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,795
I'm going with her because I'm kind of worried!

183
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:40,298
Hey! You too?

184
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,008
I'm going to eat all this up, you know?

185
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,679
Like I told the officer,

186
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,183
I really never heard that she had a boyfriend.

187
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,393
She did have one before though.

188
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:54,896
She did... before?

189
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,689
About 5 years ago.

190
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,276
A man called Mr. Henmi, whose hobby was mountain climbing.

191
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,113
"Henmi"

192
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:06,616
When was this?

193
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,409
About 6 months ago.

194
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,913
Was it on the 25th, 6 months ago?

195
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:17,210
Right! It was my husband's pay day.

196
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,003
Just as I thought.

197
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,092
What? Wait...

198
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:26,594
The real killer is not her boyfriend?

199
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:30,014
It's impossible for Sachiko's boyfriend to have killed her.

200
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,599
That's totally impossible!

201
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,018
Totally impossible...

202
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:38,606
If it wasn't her boyfriend,

203
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,316
then the real killer is none other than that person.

204
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,702
Mr. Izaki?

205
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:56,705
Yes. And who are you?

206
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,794
There's something I'd like to ask you.

207
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,901
-Mr. Suenaga. -Yes?

208
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:29,905
About this composite picture...

209
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:33,868
I can't remember anything more in detail than that.

210
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:38,581
No. It was impossible to make a composite picture to begin with.

211
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,874
What?

212
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,295
Because there was no boyfriend

213
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,381
that could've come to Ms. Nishimura at all.

214
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,387
Because...

215
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:56,182
This is strange.

216
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,477
If she prepared this for a boyfriend that she was seeing after a month,

217
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:01,979
first, her boyfriend would take a bite,

218
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,773
and she would wait for him to say something about her cooking.

219
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,484
It's only natural for her to start eating

220
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:08,777
after hearing what he had to say.

221
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,571
It's unthinkable for a woman

222
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:14,200
to start eating and drinking before her guest.

223
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:21,290
In other words, nobody came to visit her last night.

224
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,793
Then, why is everything prepared for two?

225
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:27,004
It's for her boyfriend.

226
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:29,673
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:33,469
Ms. Nishimura happily told her colleagues and Ran

228
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:37,181
that her boyfriend was going to come visit her.

229
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:39,892
But that was...

230
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,477
A lie!

231
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,780
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

232
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,198
It's not fair that you go to see

233
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:56,200
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

234
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,501
She bought wine again yesterday,

235
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,878
saying that her boyfriend was coming.

236
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,589
I went to check it out yesterday!

237
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,300
Please, no!

238
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,970
Please leave! Because he's coming!

239
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:21,976
Where is he? This boyfriend of yours?

240
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,894
I'm calling the police!

241
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:38,200
It's your fault for lying to me.

242
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:44,290
She didn't even have a boyfriend, but put on a front of having one!

243
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,708
If she wanted to just put on a front,

244
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,086
wouldn't it have been enough for her just to by steak for two?

245
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:50,796
She wouldn't have had to really cook the steak

246
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,507
or pour the wine into the glass, right?

247
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:55,676
Well...

248
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:59,096
It was a lie, but not really a lie.

249
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:04,184
Yesterday, her boyfriend really did visit her

250
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,187
and he probably sat down in that chair.

251
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:12,067
Her boyfriend called Mr. Henmi.

252
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,570
"Kawamura" -Sachiko had a boyfriend...

253
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,073
during her school days called Mr. Henmi.

254
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,577
But five years ago...

255
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:28,876
I'll be fine. I'll be back on the 25th.

256
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,003
The 25th?

257
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,297
I'll prepare a nice meal and wait for you then.

258
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:37,092
I'd like steak then. A thick one like this!

259
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:43,474
But Mr. Henmi never returned.

260
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,684
His body wasn't found either.

261
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:50,272
But 6 months ago, 5 years later...

262
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:53,984
Mr. Henmi's knapsack was found in the mountains.

263
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,989
And inside the knapsack, they found films that were already developed.

264
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:02,368
I had second thoughts about showing this to you after 5 years.

265
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:06,288
But I thought that he would've liked for you to see it, too.

266
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:09,708
Mr. Henmi came home.

267
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:16,173
Just as he promised on the 25th.

268
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:21,178
It was on the 25th, 6 months ago.

269
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,308
Since then, on the 25th of each month,

270
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:29,603
Mr. Henmi visited her.

271
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:34,608
In Sachiko's heart, even last night.

272
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:42,908
She decided to believe in him and wait.

273
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:45,369
She believed that by doing so, he would return.

274
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,705
That her boyfriend would never betray her.

275
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,301
Ran.

276
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,308
Which means for these past 6 months on the 25th,

277
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:34,269
she was talking all by herself?

278
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,105
I just said she wasn't alone!

279
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:40,901
Ran.

280
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:45,072
I'm sure that Shinichi will come back one day, too.

281
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:48,200
Thank you, Conan.

282
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,286
He'll open that door and say, "Hey, Ran!"

283
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:55,290
If he does...

284
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,377
Hey, Shinichi! Where and what were you doing till now?

285
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,170
The first thing I'll do is spin kick him!

286
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,588
What?

287
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:05,300
She has no intention of welcoming me kindly.

288
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,470
Not only will I spin kick him! I'll do a heel-drop.

289
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,472
I'm training for that time!

290
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:13,183
I don't think I'll be coming home for a while yet.

291
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:20,107
"Next Episode"

292
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:26,071
No, I... I really went to a class reunion.

293
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:27,406
That's...

294
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:33,370
This is not something...

295
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,206
all that great, but...

296
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,667
What is this?

297
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:46,800
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

298
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:04,901
Next Conan's Hint:

299
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,987
"Daypack"

300
00:21:06,987 --> 00:21:08,280
The next episode involves two police officers.

301
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,198
A date ought to be planned, right?

302
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:11,575
I wonder about that.
