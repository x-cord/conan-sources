1
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.109
Today's case is hard to take in.

2
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.709
It may not be right,

3
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.709
but a person's warmth is hard to erase.

4
00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.309
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.109
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.909
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.689
You see, today is a special day.

8
00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.689
My lover's coming over.

9
00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.289
Really?

10
00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.689
Sachiko is a super career woman.

11
00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.289
I didn't think she was interested at all in men,

12
00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.089
but I'm surprised she has a boyfriend.

13
00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:47.289
Somebody that she can cook for...

14
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:48.989
Ran.

15
00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.789
You have people you can cook for too, Ran.

16
00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.889
But Shinichi hasn't been home at all.

17
00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.789
No, I meant Pops and me.

18
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.589
Right!

19
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.089
However, the following day...

20
00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.289
She was killed?

21
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.989
She was living alone.

22
00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.189
Sachiko!

23
00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.289
"Illusionary Spring Lover"

24
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.589
"Nishimura"

25
00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.189
Mr. Mouri, this is not a case where we need you

26
00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.489
to have come all the way here.

27
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:38.089
My daughter owes her a lot.

28
00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:39.489
I'd like to at least be informed of the circumstances.

29
00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.789
The body was found by

30
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.089
a colleague of hers that had doubts about her not coming to work

31
00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:46.889
without reporting her absence, came to visit her.

32
00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.289
The cause of death is a fractured skull

33
00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:51.189
from a sharp blow on the back of her head.

34
00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.089
The weapon is a bronze figurine that was found in the room.

35
00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.889
The estimated time of her death is last night from 7:30 pm to 8 pm.

36
00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.589
In the middle of dinner...

37
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.189
Was Sachiko a smoker?

38
00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.889
If not, this side is Sachiko's seat

39
00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.389
and the other side is the seat of her guest who was a smoker.

40
00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.189
It's no doubt that someone such as her boyfriend came to visit her.

41
00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.389
At about 7:30 pm,

42
00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.189
The woman living next door heard

43
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.489
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

44
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.489
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

45
00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:29.989
It's not fair that you go to see

46
00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:32.089
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

47
00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:37.089
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

48
00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.289
It seems that her boyfriend's hobby was mountain climbing.

49
00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.489
We found this picture here.

50
00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.289
Her boyfriend's probably responsible for this crime.

51
00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.989
Why?

52
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:59.389
If someone came in and attacked Sachiko all of a sudden,

53
00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.089
where did her boyfriend disappear to

54
00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:04.089
without even reporting the incident to the police?

55
00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.789
Well...

56
00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:06.989
True.

57
00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:10.589
Like I was saying, it's not an incident that calls for your help.

58
00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.489
The police thinks that her boyfriend is the killer, too?

59
00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:16.389
There is no other possibility taking into consideration the circumstances.

60
00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.389
Takagi here.

61
00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.189
None? Not even one?

62
00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.989
All right.

63
00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:28.889
It's from the forensic officer.

64
00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.889
They found no fingerprints what so ever

65
00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.389
other than that of Ms. Sachiko Nishimura from the bronze figurine

66
00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.389
that is thought to be the murder weapon,

67
00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.389
the picture of the mountain, or the wine glass

68
00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.389
that they both were thought to have toasted with.

69
00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.489
No fingerprints left?

70
00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.989
No traces of them being wiped off either.

71
00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:50.489
If so, this is a carefully planned homicide.

72
00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:55.189
He came to visit her after he made sure that

73
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.889
no fingerprints would be left behind.

74
00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.089
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

75
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.289
Maybe I over cooked the steak.

76
00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.489
And a while after they began eating...

77
00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.589
He made Sachiko get up from her seat.

78
00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:29.689
Why?

79
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.389
Why do you say it's her boyfriend that did that?

80
00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.089
He was after her money.

81
00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:37.489
There is nothing valuable

82
00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:39.389
such as money and jewelry anywhere in sight.

83
00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:43.689
That's hard to believe, isn't it, Conan?

84
00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.389
Because Sachiko looked so happy yesterday, didn't she?

85
00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.589
Today is a special day.

86
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.989
My lover's coming over.

87
00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:57.189
That boyfriend...

88
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.389
couldn't have killed her!

89
00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.789
Right, Conan?

90
00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:03.789
Yes.

91
00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.889
If so then, Ran, where did that man disappear to?

92
00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.589
It's strange that he left no fingerprints behind either.

93
00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:18.489
Something doesn't feel right.

94
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.389
I wonder what it is?

95
00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.489
I confirmed with a colleague of hers.

96
00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.589
I was told that she started going with her boyfriend

97
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.789
about six months ago.

98
00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:29.889
However, it seemed that he was really busy or something

99
00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.289
that he only came to visit her on the 25th of each month.

100
00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.889
So, it seemed that Ms. Nishimura

101
00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.689
always seemed excited from morning on the 25th.

102
00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.189
Yesterday was also the 25th.

103
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.289
I wonder if there's any meaning to the fact

104
00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:50.589
that he only comes to visit her on the 25th of each month?

105
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:53.489
It seems that even that colleague though,

106
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:56.889
was never told what her boyfriend's name was.

107
00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.389
Which means we have no clue what so ever?

108
00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.889
I went to visit her best friend since her school days

109
00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.089
who lives nearby too, but...

110
00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:07.889
No way! Sachiko was?

111
00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:10.489
I just swung at air.

112
00:08:12.489 --> 00:08:16.789
She didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

113
00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:19.589
She hid the fact from her best friend?

114
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:21.189
Why?

115
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:24.989
At any rate, it's her boyfriend did it, Ran.

116
00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:31.689
We'll try to crack who the killer is

117
00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:34.189
from among her acquaintances as soon as possible.

118
00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:36.089
Yeah, please do so.

119
00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.789
I'll try and trace what the victim did yesterday.

120
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.789
Maybe I'll get a lead to her boyfriend.

121
00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.989
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.989
Now that they know who the killer is,

123
00:08:49.989 --> 00:08:52.089
I guess there's no role for a detective to play.

124
00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:53.489
Let's go home.

125
00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:56.689
Officer Takagi!

126
00:08:56.689 --> 00:08:58.689
Please let me go with you.

127
00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:02.289
I just can't believe that her boyfriend is the killer.

128
00:09:02.289 --> 00:09:04.989
Ran.

129
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.989
What?

130
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:21.589
You saw Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend come running out?

131
00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:25.089
Yes. I think it was around 8 pm last night.

132
00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:39.889
But, how did you know that the man was Ms. Nishimura's boyfriend?

133
00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:43.689
I think it was on the 25th of last month.

134
00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:45.489
There was a big fire.

135
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:51.089
My apartment is right opposite Ms. Nishimura's condo.

136
00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:53.589
When I happened to look out casually...

137
00:09:55.989 --> 00:10:00.589
You mean the man that you saw a month ago during the fire

138
00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:02.889
was the same man who came running out last night?

139
00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:05.689
His eyes were blood-shot, and he ran like he was lurching forward.

140
00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:09.389
Excuse me. May I have your name, please?

141
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:11.889
Me? I'm Suenaga.

142
00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:12.989
Mr. Suenaga.

143
00:10:12.989 --> 00:10:16.989
Will you help us make a composite picture of that man?

144
00:10:16.989 --> 00:10:18.889
Okay.

145
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.089
But let me go tell the boss.

146
00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:26.689
There's even eye-witness.

147
00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:28.689
I guess this is it.

148
00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:29.989
Ran.

149
00:10:32.489 --> 00:10:33.689
With a composite picture in hand,

150
00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:35.689
if they go asking around the vicinity where the victim lived,

151
00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:39.489
it's just a matter of time before they find the killer.

152
00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:43.289
But there's something that bothers me.

153
00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:44.889
I wonder what it is.

154
00:10:46.489 --> 00:10:48.789
It's about time!

155
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:55.089
What's the matter? Eat, you guys.

156
00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:56.689
Okay.

157
00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.089
Conan?

158
00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:00.289
What? Yes.

159
00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:05.089
What?

160
00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:07.889
-Good? -It's really good.

161
00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:10.189
I'm glad.

162
00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:13.289
What's this? Did you make me check to see if it was okay or what?

163
00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:16.189
No, it's not that.

164
00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:19.289
But I wasn't sure if it was seasoned enough.

165
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:25.889
Ran, Sachiko must have been really hungry.

166
00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:27.189
Why?

167
00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:31.689
Because the steak and salad on her side of the table were eaten,

168
00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:35.289
but her boyfriend's side was untouched.

169
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:42.789
So what, you brat?

170
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:44.589
Not possible.

171
00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:46.889
That's strange, really strange.

172
00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:49.589
What's so strange?

173
00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:51.889
Maybe...

174
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:53.389
But...

175
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:56.289
The woman living next door heard

176
00:11:56.289 --> 00:11:58.589
Ms. Nishimura talking to her boyfriend.

177
00:12:00.489 --> 00:12:03.289
She only heard Sachiko's voice.

178
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.689
Yeah. If that's how it was,

179
00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:08.189
it's understandable that there were no other fingerprints.

180
00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:12.989
If so, why did she put on such an act?

181
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:19.889
Hey, what's up with you all of a sudden?

182
00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:22.089
I'm going with her because I'm kind of worried!

183
00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:24.589
Hey! You too?

184
00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:26.289
I'm going to eat all this up, you know?

185
00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:30.989
Like I told the officer,

186
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:34.489
I really never heard that she had a boyfriend.

187
00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:36.689
She did have one before though.

188
00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.189
She did... before?

189
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:40.989
About 5 years ago.

190
00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:44.589
A man called Mr. Henmi, whose hobby was mountain climbing.

191
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:48.389
"Henmi"

192
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.889
When was this?

193
00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:52.689
About 6 months ago.

194
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:56.189
Was it on the 25th, 6 months ago?

195
00:12:57.189 --> 00:13:01.489
Right! It was my husband's pay day.

196
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.289
Just as I thought.

197
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:08.389
What? Wait...

198
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:10.889
The real killer is not her boyfriend?

199
00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:14.289
It's impossible for Sachiko's boyfriend to have killed her.

200
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:15.889
That's totally impossible!

201
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:18.289
Totally impossible...

202
00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:22.889
If it wasn't her boyfriend,

203
00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:24.589
then the real killer is none other than that person.

204
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:34.389
Mr. Izaki?

205
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:37.389
Yes. And who are you?

206
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:42.489
There's something I'd like to ask you.

207
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:06.589
-Mr. Suenaga. -Yes?

208
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:10.589
About this composite picture...

209
00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:14.589
I can't remember anything more in detail than that.

210
00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:19.289
No. It was impossible to make a composite picture to begin with.

211
00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:20.589
What?

212
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:24.989
Because there was no boyfriend

213
00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:28.089
that could've come to Ms. Nishimura at all.

214
00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:34.089
Because...

215
00:16:34.089 --> 00:16:36.889
This is strange.

216
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:40.189
If she prepared this for a boyfriend that she was seeing after a month,

217
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:42.689
first, her boyfriend would take a bite,

218
00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:45.489
and she would wait for him to say something about her cooking.

219
00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:47.189
It's only natural for her to start eating

220
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:49.489
after hearing what he had to say.

221
00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:51.289
It's unthinkable for a woman

222
00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:54.889
to start eating and drinking before her guest.

223
00:16:56.189 --> 00:17:01.989
In other words, nobody came to visit her last night.

224
00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:05.489
Then, why is everything prepared for two?

225
00:17:05.489 --> 00:17:07.689
It's for her boyfriend.

226
00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:10.389
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:17:10.389 --> 00:17:14.189
Ms. Nishimura happily told her colleagues and Ran

228
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:17.889
that her boyfriend was going to come visit her.

229
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.589
But that was...

230
00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:22.189
A lie!

231
00:17:30.189 --> 00:17:33.489
Promise that you'll take me with you next time.

232
00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:34.889
It's not fair that you go to see

233
00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:36.889
such a wonderful scenery all by yourself.

234
00:17:43.285 --> 00:17:46.185
She bought wine again yesterday,

235
00:17:46.185 --> 00:17:48.585
saying that her boyfriend was coming.

236
00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:51.285
I went to check it out yesterday!

237
00:17:51.285 --> 00:17:53.985
Please, no!

238
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.685
Please leave! Because he's coming!

239
00:17:59.385 --> 00:18:02.685
Where is he? This boyfriend of yours?

240
00:18:02.685 --> 00:18:04.585
I'm calling the police!

241
00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:18.885
It's your fault for lying to me.

242
00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:24.985
She didn't even have a boyfriend, but put on a front of having one!

243
00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:26.385
If she wanted to just put on a front,

244
00:18:26.385 --> 00:18:29.785
wouldn't it have been enough for her just to by steak for two?

245
00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:31.485
She wouldn't have had to really cook the steak

246
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:34.185
or pour the wine into the glass, right?

247
00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:36.385
Well...

248
00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:39.785
It was a lie, but not really a lie.

249
00:18:41.185 --> 00:18:44.885
Yesterday, her boyfriend really did visit her

250
00:18:44.885 --> 00:18:47.885
and he probably sat down in that chair.

251
00:18:49.585 --> 00:18:52.785
Her boyfriend called Mr. Henmi.

252
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:55.285
"Kawamura" -Sachiko had a boyfriend...

253
00:18:55.285 --> 00:18:58.785
during her school days called Mr. Henmi.

254
00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:02.285
But five years ago...

255
00:19:05.585 --> 00:19:09.585
I'll be fine. I'll be back on the 25th.

256
00:19:09.585 --> 00:19:11.685
The 25th?

257
00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.985
I'll prepare a nice meal and wait for you then.

258
00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:17.785
I'd like steak then. A thick one like this!

259
00:19:18.985 --> 00:19:24.185
But Mr. Henmi never returned.

260
00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:26.385
His body wasn't found either.

261
00:19:27.785 --> 00:19:30.985
But 6 months ago, 5 years later...

262
00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:34.685
Mr. Henmi's knapsack was found in the mountains.

263
00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:39.685
And inside the knapsack, they found films that were already developed.

264
00:19:39.685 --> 00:19:43.085
I had second thoughts about showing this to you after 5 years.

265
00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:46.985
But I thought that he would've liked for you to see it, too.

266
00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:50.385
Mr. Henmi came home.

267
00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:56.885
Just as he promised on the 25th.

268
00:19:58.085 --> 00:20:01.885
It was on the 25th, 6 months ago.

269
00:20:04.085 --> 00:20:06.985
Since then, on the 25th of each month,

270
00:20:06.985 --> 00:20:10.285
Mr. Henmi visited her.

271
00:20:10.285 --> 00:20:15.285
In Sachiko's heart, even last night.

272
00:20:21.085 --> 00:20:23.585
She decided to believe in him and wait.

273
00:20:23.585 --> 00:20:26.085
She believed that by doing so, he would return.

274
00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:28.385
That her boyfriend would never betray her.

275
00:20:40.785 --> 00:20:41.985
Ran.

276
00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:11.985
Which means for these past 6 months on the 25th,

277
00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:14.985
she was talking all by herself?

278
00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:17.785
I just said she wasn't alone!

279
00:22:18.985 --> 00:22:21.585
Ran.

280
00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:25.785
I'm sure that Shinichi will come back one day, too.

281
00:22:25.785 --> 00:22:28.885
Thank you, Conan.

282
00:22:28.885 --> 00:22:31.985
He'll open that door and say, "Hey, Ran!"

283
00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:35.985
If he does...

284
00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:39.085
Hey, Shinichi! Where and what were you doing till now?

285
00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:40.885
The first thing I'll do is spin kick him!

286
00:22:40.885 --> 00:22:42.285
What?

287
00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:45.985
She has no intention of welcoming me kindly.

288
00:22:45.985 --> 00:22:49.185
Not only will I spin kick him! I'll do a heel-drop.

289
00:22:49.185 --> 00:22:51.185
I'm training for that time!

290
00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:53.885
I don't think I'll be coming home for a while yet.

291
00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:00.785
"Next Episode"

292
00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:06.785
No, I... I really went to a class reunion.

293
00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.085
That's...

294
00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:14.085
This is not something...

295
00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:16.885
all that great, but...

296
00:23:17.685 --> 00:23:19.385
What is this?

297
00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:27.485
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

298
00:23:43.085 --> 00:23:45.585
Next Conan's Hint:

299
00:23:45.585 --> 00:23:47.685
"Daypack"

300
00:23:47.685 --> 00:23:48.985
The next episode involves two police officers.

301
00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:50.885
A date ought to be planned, right?

302
00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:52.285
I wonder about that.
