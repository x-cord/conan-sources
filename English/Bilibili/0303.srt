1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,140
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,940
Is a case like this truly exists?

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,840
You can't recycle crime!

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:47,528
On that day, we set off to Akebono-cho

9
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:50,428
in order to arrest a serial thief.

10
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:53,828
Conan, let's catch the thief no matter what it takes, okay?

11
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,528
Yeah.

12
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:56,928
But...

13
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:59,628
Doesn't it feel a bit eerie?

14
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:03,328
To have other people take over and use what can still be used,

15
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,728
cherishing what limited resources we have,

16
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,428
I'd say it's a splendid arrangement.

17
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,928
Oh, you mean recycling.

18
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:16,628
But, you don't know who the stuff was being used by previously.

19
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:17,628
Right, Conan?

20
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,128
No need for worry, because there is nobody

21
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:23,828
who rubs snot on everything like you do, Genta.

22
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,328
You really do, Genta?

23
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:27,928
You rat!

24
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,528
What a thing to say?

25
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,328
Stop it, don't touch me!

26
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,528
Oh, there's the bus headed for Akebono-cho.

27
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,228
Oh, right!

28
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:47,328
"The Victim Returns"

29
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:56,228
It sure is quiet.

30
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,528
There's nobody in sight.

31
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,928
Maybe that's why the thief targets this area.

32
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,628
If you see any suspicious looking people, be careful.

33
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:07,728
Geez, what the heck am I doing?

34
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,428
Is it that room?

35
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,328
Wait up, Conan!

36
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:20,228
What's going on?

37
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:24,928
Excuse me!

38
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,028
-Sorry for disturbing you... -Is this okay, Conan?

39
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,528
This is...

40
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:48,228
The cause of death is cerebral contusion

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,528
from being hit in the back of his head with a blunt object.

42
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:51,828
The estimated time of death

43
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:55,528
is between 14:00 to 15:00 yesterday.

44
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,828
She had nothing on her that would help us identify her.

45
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:04,628
Ms. Hosono, will you please explain in detail the condition

46
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:06,828
in which you found the corpse?

47
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,228
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,628
That sofa, is what I bought yesterday

49
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:15,028
at sundown at a recycle shop at Beika-cho.

50
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,528
And I had it delivered here at about 10 this morning.

51
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,028
By the way, after taking a good look,

52
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,328
the sheet was a little out of place

53
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,128
so I attempted to put it back in place.

54
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:38,628
I found that lady inside the sofa.

55
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,428
I see.

56
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:43,428
And do you have any idea who the victim is?

57
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,128
Not at all.

58
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:49,428
Where were you yesterday between the hours of 14:00 and 15:00?

59
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:52,328
Are you suspecting me?

60
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:56,328
No, no, it's just routine procedure to ask.

61
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,228
I was at the movies yesterday afternoon!

62
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,328
Was somebody else with you?

63
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,328
I went alone.

64
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:07,028
I wonder if Inspector Megure suspects her.

65
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,128
Yeah.

66
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,428
"402, Sanae Hosono"

67
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,628
There are two things that are thinkable.

68
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:16,728
Ms. Sanae Hosono killed the victim

69
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:19,828
and made it look like the corpse was inside

70
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:21,728
the sofa that was delivered.

71
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,128
The other is, a sofa with the corpse inside it is

72
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:26,628
was delivered just like she said.

73
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:32,128
But when we went over there, she really looked surprised and pale!

74
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:35,828
It didn't look like she was putting on an act at all!

75
00:05:35,828 --> 00:05:37,228
Right.

76
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,428
Yeah.

77
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:42,828
It's the job of the police to consider all possibilities.

78
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:43,828
But...

79
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:53,928
Inspector, the old lady's shoes were also inside the sofa.

80
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:57,228
I wonder why she wasn't wearing her shoes.

81
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:02,428
When she was killed, she was probably not wearing her shoes.

82
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,928
I see! Which means she was killed in the room.

83
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,428
If she is the culprit, the site of the crime is in this room.

84
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,928
Officer Takagi, go and question the neighbourhood!

85
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,028
Yes, sir!

86
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,128
Inspector.

87
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:26,828
What... the room next door...

88
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:29,028
Excuse me, may I ask your name?

89
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:31,728
Tokunaga.

90
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,528
Did something happen?

91
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,628
Well, at your next door neighbour, Ms. Hosono's room,

92
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,328
a corpse was found in the sofa.

93
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:40,328
What?

94
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:45,228
And, Mr. Tokunaga, were you in your room

95
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:47,128
between the hours of 14:00 to15:00 yesterday?

96
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,628
Yes.

97
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:51,528
I work in the evening.

98
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:52,928
Around 15:00,

99
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:57,428
did you hear any strange sounds or voices from next door?

100
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,428
Please try to remember.

101
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:07,228
Come to think of it, I sort of heard somebody arguing.

102
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,128
You heard somebody arguing?

103
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,428
Yes.

104
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:15,028
And, what was the argument about?

105
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:19,128
I'm not sure of the details.

106
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:22,228
Oh, all right. Thank you.

107
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:25,228
I think I'll be asking you about it again later.

108
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,328
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:36,128
I wonder if what he said just now is true.

110
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:38,928
It's sort of hard to believe, isn't it?

111
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:44,828
The thing about her going to the movies seems to be a lie.

112
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,528
Inspector.

113
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:48,128
What is it?

114
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:52,628
I would like to go ask around the recycle shop.

115
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:56,628
I got curious on what the children was talking about.

116
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,528
Officer Takagi.

117
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,128
Okay.

118
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:02,228
Yeah, please do so then.

119
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,328
Yes, sir!

120
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,128
Oh, that sofa.

121
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,828
It's an item that we bought from a customer yesterday.

122
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,728
Yesterday?

123
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:16,028
You mean you bought it and put it out for sale right away?

124
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:22,528
Yes, we put the items that we purchase out for sale right away.

125
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:26,228
That way, we can sell the item for a cheaper price.

126
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,228
What about after Ms. Hosono bought it?

127
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,928
It was here right through till closing time.

128
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,528
Then it was loaded on the truck for delivery.

129
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,328
Is there any possibility that someone from outside

130
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:40,228
can get near the truck?

131
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,028
That's impossible

132
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:45,128
because the truck is parked inside the warehouse.

133
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:48,028
And, of course, the warehouse is locked.

134
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,228
Oh, is that so...

135
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,228
Which means that...

136
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:58,028
The old lady was in there already when it was purchased.

137
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,428
Does that mean that the previous owner of that sofa

138
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,028
is the culprit?

139
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,428
The fact is, that sofa

140
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:13,228
is not something that we bought from a customer.

141
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:14,228
What?

142
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:17,428
But, Mr. Hirose, I thought you said

143
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,528
that you were told to take the sofa, even if it were for free.

144
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,928
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,028
Yesterday afternoon, on the way back

146
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,328
after I went to purchase items in several places in town,

147
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:29,828
I think it was around 16:00...

148
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,028
What's the matter, Mr. Hirose?

149
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,428
Look at that, what a waste.

150
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,328
It still looks very usable.

151
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,328
You can say that again.

152
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:52,828
You picked it up at a trash dump that you happened to pass?

153
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:54,028
Right.

154
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,428
But manager, I felt it so wasteful to be thrown away like that

155
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:01,228
when it still looked so usable, so I...

156
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,728
I'm sorry I lied.

157
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,328
Well, I do understand your feelings of wanting to cherish things.

158
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:11,728
But, if you picked it up from a trash dump...

159
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:16,028
We have no idea who the culprit is.

160
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,728
Right.

161
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,628
But, Officer Takagi...

162
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,028
It's hard to think that

163
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:25,428
the culprit carried the corpse a long way, isn't it?

164
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:26,928
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:30,728
Where is the trash dump that you picked that sofa up from?

166
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,428
If I'm not mistaken, I think it was...

167
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,928
Akebono-cho, on 3rd Street.

168
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,028
Akebono-cho!

169
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:56,628
We're back where we started.

170
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:58,428
In other words, that old lady...

171
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:03,128
Yeah, she was left here about 16:00 yesterday,

172
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:05,428
and via the recycle shop,

173
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:10,228
came back to the original place about 10 this morning.

174
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:13,928
I'm sure the culprit is living somewhere near here,

175
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,228
but how do we go about looking for the culprit...

176
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:21,228
Besides, why did the culprit put the body into a sofa in the trash dump?

177
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,328
Why else?

178
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,128
Right, the culprit didn't think that

179
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:29,028
anyone would pick up a sofa that was thrown away.

180
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,128
But!

181
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:33,028
Oh, there you go again Conan with your "Buts".

182
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:37,528
It's a bad habit of yours of not looking at the situation as is.

183
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,128
Talk for yourself.

184
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:44,528
Mr. Tokunaga was a little creepy.

185
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,228
I saw him at that family restaurant this morning,

186
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,628
where he was drinking and all smiles.

187
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,828
Oh, so he smiles?

188
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,128
He always looks so super square.

189
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:59,128
So, something really good must've happened?

190
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,528
Tokunaga?

191
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,128
He's the one that we saw this morning, right?

192
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,228
Ms. Sanae Hosono's next door neighbour.

193
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:10,628
What're you doing here?

194
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:13,128
Inspector Megure.

195
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:15,628
What're you doing here, Inspector Megure?

196
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:20,028
I came to tell Ms. Hosono that her alibi's been backed up.

197
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:24,628
The person at the theater remembered her.

198
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,228
I'm glad!

199
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:29,128
But, if so...

200
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:32,328
The voice that Mr. Tokunaga said he heard,

201
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:33,928
must've been a mistake or something.

202
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:35,228
A mistake?

203
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,528
The thing is,

204
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,728
while we were tracing the source of where the sofa came from,

205
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,328
we ended back to where we started.

206
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,728
But, there is no mistake about the fact that

207
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,428
the victim was put inside the sofa here.

208
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,228
I'll go look for a witness.

209
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,228
Yeah, do that, will you?

210
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,028
I got it! I figured out who the culprit is!

211
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,128
Are you serious, Mitsuhiko?

212
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,228
Yes!

213
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,528
Mr. Tokunaga's testimony about having heard an argument

214
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:09,428
is probably not a mistake!

215
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:11,428
But, just a while ago, Inspector Megure...

216
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:16,528
So, the culprit is Mr. Tokunaga!

217
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,528
What?

218
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,228
He's the culprit?

219
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:35,592
It's just as those ladies were saying after all!

220
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,492
This morning, that man called Tokunaga

221
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:39,492
seemed to be in a super good mood.

222
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,392
So, my deduction's been backed up.

223
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:44,892
Mr. Tokunaga must be the suspect!

224
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,892
Conan, when a culprit wants to hide the corpse,

225
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,992
what do you think the purpose of the culprit usually is?

226
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:54,092
The culprit doesn't want anyone to find the corpse, right?

227
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,092
If the body is found, the victim will be identified.

228
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,092
And the people who are around the victim will be thoroughly checked.

229
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:03,592
The hands of the police will eventually reach the culprit.

230
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,492
The corpse is hidden to prevent this.

231
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:07,892
Exactly.

232
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,192
But if the culprit really wants to hide the body,

233
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:14,792
the body could be buried in the mountains, or sunk into the sea.

234
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,992
However, why didn't the culprit do so this time?

235
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:21,492
Yeah, that's the point's that hard to understand.

236
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:22,892
Right.

237
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:25,492
There is only one answer.

238
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:30,092
The culprit wanted to go hide the corpse in the mountains this time too.

239
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:32,892
But, the culprit had reasons for not being able to go.

240
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:36,492
So, what was the culprit's reason for not doing so?

241
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:38,992
He was saying that

242
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:41,292
he works from sundown.

243
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:44,592
That's why he couldn't go far to hide the body!

244
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:50,592
I see. Adults can't take off from work so...

245
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:53,192
Right, Officer Takagi?

246
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,992
Yeah...

247
00:14:54,992 --> 00:15:00,292
That's why the culprit hid the corpse inside the sofa for the time being.

248
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,092
For the time being?

249
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,092
Yes!

250
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,192
The culprit was going to throw it away somewhere

251
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:07,792
after coming back from work!

252
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,992
But, when he returned from work...

253
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,792
Before the culprit could get to the sofa,

254
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,392
the truck of the recycle shop had already taken the sofa away!

255
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:19,492
Right.

256
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:25,892
I'm sure the culprit was surprised when he got home from work.

257
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,592
Because the sofa had suddenly disappeared.

258
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:33,892
And after he was surprised, delight filled his heart.

259
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,392
Because after all someone had taken care of the corpse for him.

260
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:41,192
He was spared the trouble of getting rid of the corpse himself.

261
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:45,492
Unable to hold back his joy, he went to celebrate on his own.

262
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,092
However, when he got back to the condo,

263
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,992
he found out the worse had happened.

264
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,492
The corpse that had disappeared somewhere

265
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:58,392
was found in the room next to his.

266
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:04,192
But the culprit who finds that the police suspects Sanae Hosono,

267
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:09,892
the one who first finds the corpse, remarks...

268
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:14,792
"Come to think of it, I heard the voices of people arguing."

269
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,492
It was no mistake,

270
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:22,892
but rather a lie to frame Sanae Hosono up as the culprit.

271
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,892
Everything falls right into place, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,192
Wow!

273
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:29,892
Nah, it's really no big deal.

274
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,492
What's the matter, Conan?

275
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,792
Even if the culprit had to go to work,

276
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,992
why did he have to go out of the way to move the corpse?

277
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:44,392
If he left it in his room until he got back,

278
00:16:44,392 --> 00:16:47,192
nobody would've seem him, right?

279
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:50,192
Now that you mentioned it.

280
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:54,992
What did we come here to Akebono-cho today for in the first place?

281
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:57,692
To arrest the serial thief that's been raiding the houses

282
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,492
in this vicinity, right?

283
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:04,092
The culprit was afraid that the thief would break into his house!

284
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:08,992
I see! If the thief breaks in and finds the dead old lady,

285
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:12,692
the police may be contacted!

286
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,192
Exactly!

287
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:17,492
That's why he couldn't leave it in the house!

288
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:20,692
Your deduction is perfect, Mitsuhiko!

289
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:24,692
No, that won't do after all, Mitsuhiko.

290
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,292
Huh?

291
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:32,292
Think about it.

292
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,692
The possibility of someone witnessing him hiding the corpse

293
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:38,692
is higher than the possibility of a thief breaking into his house,

294
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,692
don't you think?

295
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,992
Besides, will he really be happy when he finds out that

296
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,992
the sofa where the corpse is hidden disappears?

297
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,892
I think it would be more natural for him to worry

298
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,792
that it may have been discovered by the police, don't you?

299
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,892
Besides, it wouldn't hurt to take a day off from work,

300
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,692
if just for a day.

301
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:03,792
In other words, deducing Mr. Tokunaga as being the culprit

302
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,192
is all an illusion created in your head.

303
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:08,692
This is homicide,

304
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,192
let's think about it more seriously, okay?

305
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,092
I'm thinking about it seriously too!

306
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,792
Just who is the one that is overtaken by illusion?

307
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,392
Although you say, normally this and normally that,

308
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:21,092
I'm sure there a people who get anxious over

309
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:23,392
thieves breaking into their houses.

310
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,492
I'm sure there are people who think themselves lucky

311
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,892
about the corpse disappearing too, don't you?

312
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,892
If someone who had never taken a day off from work does so,

313
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,892
the people around him may get suspicious.

314
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:34,992
Therefore, he may go to work as usual.

315
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:37,592
That's possible too, isn't it?

316
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,992
According to the manager of the condo, it seems that Mr. Tokunaga

317
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:53,992
is running a small pub in the neighbouring town.

318
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,392
It seems he's having a tough time,

319
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:59,292
but he seems to be running the pub without resting even one day.

320
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,392
The manager also commented that

321
00:19:01,392 --> 00:19:03,992
Mr. Tokunaga is a square and timid personality.

322
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:07,792
It's just as Mitsuhiko had portrayed him.

323
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,492
Since he has to make preparations before opening the shop,

324
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:12,392
it seems he always goes out around this time.

325
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,192
It's 15:00 now.

326
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:20,292
But, no matter how timid he is, I wonder if he would be afraid of

327
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,192
a thief that he's not sure will break in or not.

328
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:27,492
Serial break ins have been reported in this area,

329
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:32,092
so please be sure to lock your doors when going out.

330
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:34,092
This is the Akebono Police Station.

331
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:35,292
Hey!

332
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,192
Please stop!

333
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,592
This is Officer Takagi from police headquarters!

334
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:43,092
Did you patrol this area yesterday too?

335
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,292
Yes, sir. But maybe yesterday we patrolled this area

336
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,092
about 10 minutes earlier than today.

337
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:49,692
Officer Takagi!

338
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:52,792
Yeah! So, that's the story!

339
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:58,492
Mr. Tokunaga was probably panic after killed the victim

340
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:03,192
and heard the voice from this police car.

341
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:06,492
This is the Akebono Police Station.

342
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:11,492
Serial break ins have been reported in this area.

343
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,192
Therefore, you were frightened

344
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:17,792
and hid the corpse inside the sofa

345
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,992
that you found in the trash dump nearby.

346
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,792
Isn't that right, Mr. Tokunaga?

347
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,592
I...

348
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:33,092
I owed that old lady money.

349
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:40,692
And I asked her to wait just another week for me to pay her back.

350
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:43,692
Then, she came to my condo and yelled at me

351
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,392
saying that if I didn't pay her back by the due date,

352
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:48,592
she would take this shop away from me.

353
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,592
That's why I...

354
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:53,792
That's why I lost my temper and...

355
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:59,892
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,392
Mr. Tokunaga, please come to the station with me.

357
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:05,592
Yes, sir.

358
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,392
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

359
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,492
Great!

360
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:13,192
Good deduction work, Mitsuhiko,

361
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:16,892
thanks to being free of preconceived opinions.

362
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:57,092
What? The thief who had been breaking into house in Akebono-cho

363
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,792
was arrested long time ago?

364
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:02,492
Yeah. Last week a man who was arrested on charges of theft

365
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:05,492
confessed to the other crimes as well.

366
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:06,992
Oh, boy.

367
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:10,092
We were all out to get him and then...

368
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:13,592
What a bummer, I even lost out on bus fare!

369
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,592
Which means that Mr. Tokunaga

370
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:18,192
didn't have to go out of the way

371
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:21,692
to hide the corpse in the sofa at the trash dump?

372
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,392
Yeah, if he left the corpse inside his room,

373
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:27,792
maybe the case would've never come to light.

374
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:31,392
He sure is an unlucky character, isn't he?

375
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,292
You can say that again.

376
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:41,992
Gee, it's a homicide case and no laughing matter.

377
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,092
Mail that you can't delete...

378
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:52,592
It's been three years now.

379
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:56,392
They listened to it. The same words of the devil.

380
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,592
-Matsuda! -Don't, Sato!

381
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:01,392
No! The mercury lever will operate!

382
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,292
Conan!

383
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,592
The next episode is a 2-hour special,

384
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:15,992
"Unsettled Police Department, 12 Million Hostages"

385
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:18,819
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:21,119
"Map symbol"

387
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,619
The next episode is the New Year's 2-hour Special.

388
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,519
-On January 6. -Monday, 7pm.

389
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,965
See you next year.
