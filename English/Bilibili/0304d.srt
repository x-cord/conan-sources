1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,340
Takagi!

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,240
Conan! Hurry, what's next?

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,640
What? What the...

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,440
The slightest shake will set the bomb off!

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Huh?

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,740
I was too scared to die after all,

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,940
so I cut the rest of the cord and stopped the bomb.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,640
What?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,140
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Then, you stopped partway through the hint.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Yes. With only the letters "EVIT",

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,240
we can't tell where the other bomb is.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
Well, it can't be helped.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,340
Let's call the rescue squad and have them come rescue us.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,240
So, they went chicken after all.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,640
The kid's the one who stopped the bomb,

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,940
but the people will think the police made him stop it.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,340
They'll think that the police sacrificed the lives of a lot of people

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,540
just to save their own skin.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,140
Please listen to the people cheer!

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,440
The bomb has safely been stopped!

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,140
Moreover, the one who disassembled the bomb

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,840
was boy who was trapped in the elevator!

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,540
Let's ask the boy some questions then.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,440
I'll bet you were scared, sonny?

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,640
"The Hero! A Primary Schooler" -Yes!

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,740
Shinichi?

28
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,940
But the police taught me how to do it really well,

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,140
so I had an easy time taking it apart.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,540
Officer Takagi.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,540
Officer Sato.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,240
Stupid. Don't blame yourself.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,640
Two hours and a half left to go.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,340
Let's go look for the other bomb!

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,940
But the thing is...

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm glad you're okay!

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,240
I knew you'd do it, Conan!

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,340
Just as would be expected of my following!

39
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Well, you did right to stop the bomb.

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,340
It's a silly thing to sacrifice your life

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,240
for people you don't even know.

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Yeah, I guess so.

43
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm sure that's what the bomber thought, too.

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,240
Finally, only one more subject to go!

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,640
What's the matter, Ran? You look depressed.

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,940
The next subject is your best subject, Japanese.

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,140
Yes.

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,140
I was just thinking that there sure are

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,840
a lot of cars going in and out today.

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,940
It's probably because they loading the ping-pong table

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,740
into the warehouse of the gym in the basement.

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,840
It seems that the next ping-pong tournament

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,040
is going to be held at our school.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,840
While they're at it, they should take the space-consuming drum cans

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,740
that are inside the warehouse with them, too.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,440
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,740
Don't you know?

58
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,240
Because of those 5 big cans.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,740
It's so hard to take out the tennis net.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,940
So, they couldn't find it after all.

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,640
Well, even if they were to find it now,

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
they wouldn't be able to evacuate.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,740
There's only 5 seconds left to go.

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,040
4, 3, 2, 1...

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,540
0...

66
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,140
Boom!

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,840
Why? Why isn't it exploding?

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,540
Gosh! It can't be helped.

69
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,340
I'll have to set the bomb off with remote control.

70
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm sorry to say that your partner can't talk to you anymore.

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,740
The bomb disposal squad secretly went into school quietly taking care

72
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,640
not to leave any voices on the wiretap that you set up

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,540
and took apart all 5 of the bombs

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,540
that you set up in the drum cans.

75
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,540
You look as if you're wondering how we located the bombs.

76
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,840
We deciphered the code you sent of Toto Tower

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,340
and the time of bombing as follows.

78
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,240
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
No use getting ready a good stopper.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,340
Because I will win in the end."

82
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,140
The phrase "Major Leaguer" means

83
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,240
to change everything into English.

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,940
A good stopper means

85
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,840
a pitcher with good earned run average.

86
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,240
Extended game in English

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,240
is called Extra inning game.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,740
The abbreviation of earned run average is ERA.

89
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,840
If you remove the no use words "ERA" from the word "EXTRA",

90
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,740
you get "XT".

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,440
XT is written vertically and when it is "turned over",

92
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,640
it becomes the Japanese Kanji character, "Wen".

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,940
That's the map symbol that stands for school.

94
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,040
And the hint that was displayed on the LCD panel of the first bomb,

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,140
"EVIT" is the English spelling of "Detective",

96
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,440
that is, a part of it, spelled reverse.

97
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,740
And if the Japanese for "Detective" is reversed,

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,040
it becomes "Teitan".

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,840
The school with the name Teitan has a grade school,

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,740
intermediate school, high school and university,

101
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,540
but the only school where a lot of students gather during winter vacation

102
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,640
is only Teitan High School

103
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,640
that is holding national trial exams.

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,940
You didn't plant a fake bomb at the baseball park

105
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,340
is because you wanted to keep everyone's attention away

106
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,840
from the schools with baseball grounds.

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,940
Well, but I guess you took us lightly

108
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,140
looking through your binoculars from a conspicuous place like this,

109
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,740
keeping watch over Teitan High School. You lose this time.

110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,440
Look out!

111
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,440
Gosh!

112
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,940
-Sato... -Officer Sato!

113
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,440
Gosh!

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
No!

115
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,740
Officer Sato!

116
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,540
Wait!

117
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,940
I'm not the one...

118
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,640
It's one of those things that occur frequently.

119
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,240
I heard it in my head, a child's voice.

120
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
It told me to kill the police.

121
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,040
No, it told me to kill anybody.

122
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,440
Yeah.

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,640
That's why it's not my fault.

124
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,940
To think that he was killed by a guy like this...

125
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,340
A guy like this!

126
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,140
A guy like this!

127
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,540
Officer Sato!

128
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,740
What do you think you're doing? Don't bother me!

129
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,440
No, Officer Sato!

130
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Let me go! Let me go, I said!

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,740
To think that he had to die for a guy like that!

132
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,040
So, let me go!

133
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,040
Just what do you think you're doing, Officer Sato?

134
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,640
Wasn't it you who always said

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
to contribute to the nation and the citizens

136
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,940
with pride and a sense of mission,

137
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,240
never to cringe in fear and hate

138
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,340
and at all times to respect the rights of people,

139
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,040
and perform our duties as police officers with justice.

140
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,140
That's what you always said, right?

141
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,040
But...

142
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,240
Acting the way you are now,

143
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm sure that Officer Matsuda will scold you.

144
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,340
Stupid...

145
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,040
I want to forget him, but you...

146
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,240
Let me forget him!

147
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,740
You idiot!

148
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,340
You shouldn't forget him.

149
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,340
If it's a precious memory, you shouldn't forget it.

150
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
Once a person dies,

151
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,240
that person can only live within one's memory.

152
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,140
Officer Takagi.

153
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,440
Officer Takagi.

154
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,640
Hey! What was that gun shot just now?

155
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,540
Well...

156
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,040
I fired one warning shot.

157
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,940
Don't tell me you wounded him or something?

158
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,640
We weren't kissing!

159
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,440
But it's really amazing that you stopped it.

160
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,940
You had less than 3 seconds to cut the cord, didn't you?

161
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,340
I had the wire cutter in hand

162
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,340
in case I figured out the clue midway.

163
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,740
Besides, I couldn't afford to let Officer Takagi die.

164
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,540
But you're really something to figure out that

165
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,640
just by seeing "EVIT" it's the reverse of "Detective".

166
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
You can say that again!

167
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,540
Idiot. Of course I'd figure it out.

168
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,840
I've been hoping that it wouldn't be there.

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,040
I've been hoping from the very start that it wouldn't be there.

170
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,540
Hey, Sato.

171
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,340
We're going to visit Shiratori at the hospital.

172
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,440
Yes, I'm coming!

173
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,840
"Erase message?"

174
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,440
"Deleted"

175
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,940
Goodbye, Officer Matsuda.

176
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,240
But...

177
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,640
But I won't forget you.

178
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,020
Next Conan's Hint:

179
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
"Door glass"
