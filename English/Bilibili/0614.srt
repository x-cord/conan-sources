1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,740
Hey, we're in trouble, the culprit's still here!

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,040
At any rate, let's get out of here!

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,740
But, we've got to rescue that boy!

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,340
Hey, you guys! Stay close to me!

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,740
Right. If we split up, that's it.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,940
We could end up like that boy.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,540
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,840
You must be true to yourself.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,940
The sound of piano playing echoes throughout the empty villa,

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,040
together with the secret of a diary.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,340
His name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:31,662
Shoots! And we were supposed to have mushroom rice

15
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:35,162
for dinner at Doc's house tonight!

16
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:38,162
Rain?

17
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:40,362
No... no joke?

18
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:43,262
We don't have umbrellas!

19
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:47,662
Come to think of it, the place we passed by a while ago

20
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:49,262
was a villa district,

21
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,462
so why don't we go take shelter from the rain there.

22
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,162
Good idea.

23
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,862
Hey, Conan. Nobody seems to be here.

24
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,562
Well, it's off season.

25
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,362
True.

26
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:06,862
It's getting dark.

27
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:09,862
Why don't we take shelter under the eaves for now?

28
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:16,362
And, can't you get hold of Doc yet?

29
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,762
No.

30
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,962
I've been trying to call him from a while ago,

31
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:22,162
but it seems his cell is switched off.

32
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,662
It's from Doc's house?

33
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,862
Hey, just what do you think you're doing, Doc!

34
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,262
I'm sorry, so sorry...

35
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:35,862
I didn't want to lose my wallet and cell phone

36
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,562
while I was picking bamboo-shoot.

37
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:42,962
I'd forgotten that I had put them in Ai's knapsack.

38
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,562
So, I came all the way home to get them,

39
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,662
that's why I'm late.

40
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,162
I'm heading over there from now with a rental car,

41
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:53,562
so hang in there for another 2 hours, will you?

42
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,062
So he says!

43
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:58,562
What? We have to wait two hours?

44
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,862
No joke!

45
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:03,162
Oh boy... and it's starting to rain harder too!

46
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:04,762
Hang in there!

47
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:08,962
Getting angry isn't going to fill your stomach up.

48
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,962
She's right.

49
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:21,662
The sound of a piano.

50
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,462
I hear it.

51
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,962
It's coming from that house.

52
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,562
We have heard that music before, right?

53
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:34,662
Yeah?

54
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:37,662
I heard it being played on the violin before.

55
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:40,762
What was the title of the song? Conan, do you know?

56
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:44,362
No, I'm really not at home with music.

57
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:47,262
Composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

58
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:52,162
The Orchestral Suites, Suite no. 3 in D major.

59
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,562
2nd movement, "Air".

60
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,062
Commonly known as...

61
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,562
"Air" on the G String.

62
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,362
I've heard that title before!

63
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:04,462
The player is as good as a professional pianist.

64
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:07,262
Okay then, let's go ask if we can take shelter there.

65
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,262
Okay!

66
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,762
I wonder if they'll make us bamboo rice?

67
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:13,162
I don't think so.

68
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,662
The piano stopped.

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,662
A hope it's someone nice!

70
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,862
No one's coming.

71
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:42,762
There's no answer on the interphone.

72
00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,562
Strange.

73
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,962
The door's not locked.

74
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:02,862
Hello!

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,262
We'd like to take shelter from the rain here for a while!

76
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:09,762
It's... pitch dark.

77
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,562
I wonder why the lights aren't turned on?

78
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,962
I stepped on something!

79
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,962
Potato chips?

80
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:30,162
They're scattered all over the floor.

81
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:33,362
There seems to be a misbehaved child here.

82
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:45,862
Hey,

83
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,762
come over here everybody!

84
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,862
I found the piano!

85
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,862
But, if the person was playing this piano,

86
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,562
why didn't he or she come out to greet us?

87
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,962
Maybe nobody was playing.

88
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,862
Because there are a lot of audio devices and CDs here.

89
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:10,562
It could be that one of the CDs here was being played.

90
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,062
The pianist was too good too.

91
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:16,562
No, it was the sound of this piano without a doubt.

92
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,862
That music that was being played a while ago.

93
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:23,262
Only this sound was a bit off tune.

94
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,262
You've got a good ear,

95
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,962
despite being as tone-deaf as you are.

96
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:28,362
Leave me alone.

97
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:31,062
I'll play you something!

98
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,562
I can play the Flea Waltz!

99
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:36,162
Don't, you'll get scolded!

100
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:39,062
We'd better look for the owner of the house.

101
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:47,262
Mitsuhiko?

102
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:49,562
A tall person was staring in

103
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,662
from the window of that door!

104
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,662
Maybe it's the owner of the house!

105
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:58,762
We've got to say hello.

106
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:06,162
It's stuck.

107
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,362
A cart?

108
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:15,662
Hey! Didn't we turn on the corridor lights?

109
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,262
Yes!

110
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,962
Does that mean someone turned it off?

111
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:23,762
Maybe he plans to lock us in here.

112
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,662
No way.

113
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:27,562
We're sorry!

114
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:31,062
We're not bad people!

115
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:33,562
Please come out here!

116
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,162
There's a room with the lights on!

117
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:46,962
Really.

118
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,562
Maybe somebody's there!

119
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,662
This seems to be the kitchen.

120
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,562
But, what's with the top of this table.

121
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:02,962
There are a lot of left-overs of fried chicken, bread and ham.

122
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:06,062
It looks like a dog or something ate here and messed up.

123
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,162
The owner of the house must sure be some wild person.

124
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,462
The wine glass is left toppled over too.

125
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,162
A notebook?

126
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,862
Does it belong to the owner of this villa?

127
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,662
April 20th, sunny.

128
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,262
After talking to him, I found that he was quite a nice child.

129
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,562
He laughs a lot and plays a lot.

130
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:31,762
But, I'm not sure if he understands the situation he is in now.

131
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,262
I only know that this child seems

132
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:36,262
to have spent a greatly oppressed life.

133
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,962
At any rate, it's only two days more.

134
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,962
Patience till then.

135
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,462
April 22, cloudy.

136
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:47,062
Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven.

137
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,262
They're all melodies that touch the heart.

138
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,562
A genius born in the same era.

139
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:54,762
I envy that talent.

140
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,162
It's not a suitable song to play under this circumstance,

141
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,662
but I can forget the passing of time.

142
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:04,662
Please let one more day go by peacefully.

143
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,262
April 23rd, rain.

144
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,262
It's bad.

145
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:12,262
It seems that this boy knows who I am.

146
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,862
If he were to announce it to the public,

147
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,062
it would ruin my future.

148
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,262
I feel sorry for him,

149
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:18,962
but I guess I have no choice but to kill him.

150
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:20,662
Kill?

151
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,362
Just what does that mean?

152
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,162
He was probably kidnapped.

153
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:27,662
Somebody kidnapped a little boy

154
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:29,462
and confined him in this house.

155
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,962
Oh, no.

156
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,862
What's written on the next page?

157
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,662
The pages are stuck together.

158
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,762
And I can't peel it off.

159
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:47,562
A blackout?

160
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:51,962
By the way, the page just now had something red on it?

161
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:54,762
Isn't... it blood?

162
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,562
Moreover, the content says,

163
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:59,962
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

164
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,462
The... sound of the piano.

165
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,762
It... it's the song that was being played a while ago.

166
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:10,462
We've got trouble! The culprit's still here?

167
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,862
At any rate, let... let's hurry and get out of here!

168
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,662
But, we've got to rescue the boy!

169
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,462
Hey! Wait a sec!

170
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,662
You guys stay close to me!

171
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:30,562
Right. If we split up, that's it.

172
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:33,162
We may end up like the boy.

173
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,462
A coffin!

174
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:42,862
Hey! Didn't the Air on the G String gain popularity...

175
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:45,962
100 years after Bach's death.

176
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:50,162
Maybe the culprit intended to leave the boy asleep for that long

177
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,162
in this coffin.

178
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,462
Conan, what're you going to do about this?

179
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,909
Well, I guess we'll just have to open it.

180
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,509
Please wait!

181
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:14,209
From the contents of the diary we found earlier,

182
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,109
we know that someone had kidnapped a young boy

183
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,809
and confined him here.

184
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,309
And because it seemed the child knew who his captor was,

185
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:24,009
there was no choice but to kill him, right?

186
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,509
Yes. Moreover, on the last page of the diary,

187
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:30,209
there something red on it,

188
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,909
and the thing that was written is

189
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,809
"I'm sorry, sonny, please forgive me".

190
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,409
Then, maybe in that coffin...

191
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,409
The corpse of that boy is inside.

192
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,709
Yeah. Could be.

193
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,009
No...

194
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,909
Hey, Ai, pull them away!

195
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,709
It's not something children should see.

196
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,009
I guess not.

197
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,309
I mean, you're a child too, aren't you?

198
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,309
Never mind, just stand back!

199
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,509
It's empty. Nothing's inside.

200
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,109
Thank goodness!

201
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,209
Which means, that boy may still be alive.

202
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,409
If he were killed,

203
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,709
the culprit would've put him inside that coffin.

204
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,509
He couldn't be playing the piano, like he was.

205
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,209
At any rate, we've got to call the police.

206
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,209
Does somebody have a cell phone?

207
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,209
I left mine in my knapsack a while ago.

208
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,609
Me too.

209
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:56,809
Same here.

210
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,209
Me too.

211
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,909
Hey, don't tell me that the place you left it,

212
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:04,409
is in the first room that we went to when we came to this villa.

213
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,909
Not... not again.

214
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:07,409
It's the same song that was played a while ago.

215
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,809
Air on the G String.

216
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:20,409
Why'd all of you leave it in the room where the piano is?

217
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,709
Because you left it back there, Conan.

218
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,609
We put it there together.

219
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,809
It can't be helped already, right?

220
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,509
Rather than that.

221
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,409
Let's all go back to the room with the piano

222
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,609
and get our cell phones back.

223
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:33,709
True.

224
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,009
Don't be silly. We don't even know

225
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,409
what kind of weapon the culprit may have,

226
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:42,009
so who knows what will happen to us if we get close carelessly.

227
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,609
But, we've got to do something quick or the boy may...

228
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:50,909
Doc'll be here about an hour later.

229
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:53,709
We could leave this villa and wait outside till then,

230
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,409
but it's raining cats and dogs outside.

231
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:01,209
Just waiting's not going to get us anywhere,

232
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,009
so why don't we all search for that boy.

233
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,109
Okay!

234
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:07,509
Isn't it too dangerous?

235
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,709
The kidnapper is still here, you know?

236
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,209
No need to worry.

237
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:18,009
So long as that piano is playing, the culprit is in that room.

238
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,909
But there could be more than one culprit.

239
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,309
There's probably just one culprit

240
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:26,709
because the diary was written in the first person.

241
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,509
Besides, there's nothing written that points to an accomplice,

242
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,209
and there was only one wine glass too.

243
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,209
But, stay close to me, understand?

244
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,309
Aye!

245
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:42,009
But, why doesn't the culprit come to get us?

246
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,709
Maybe because he doesn't want us to see his face?

247
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,809
If he goofs and we get away

248
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:51,809
and report to the police what he looks like, it'll put him in a fix.

249
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,009
Maybe that's why he's playing the piano in the dark.

250
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,609
He probably wants us to feel creepy and leave.

251
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,109
He probably hasn't realized yet

252
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:04,109
that we read the diary and found out

253
00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:05,809
that he is a kidnapper.

254
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:09,209
But, either way, if the owner of this villa were to check later on,

255
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,509
he would find out who the culprit is.

256
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:13,709
Maybe he's not the owner of this house.

257
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,109
What?

258
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:20,009
At this point, it's more natural to think that the culprit broke open

259
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,609
one of the doors of this house,

260
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,009
faking to be some rich man

261
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,109
and brought the boy here.

262
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:41,809
Is the piano still playing?

263
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,909
Yes, it's still playing.

264
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,309
It's amazing how he can play in pitch dark.

265
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,309
His fingers remember the position of the keys.

266
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,809
There are blind pianists too, you know.

267
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,209
But, what's with this room?

268
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,009
It looks like a child's room.

269
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,609
It looks like a girl's room.

270
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,609
Chips are scattered here too.

271
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:05,609
Yeah.

272
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,009
It's a portable game device.

273
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,809
And, what're these drawings

274
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,809
in back of the leaflets of the newspaper that are cluttered

275
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,309
and looks like some kind of coded diagram?

276
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,109
That's a treasure map of Monster Getter III.

277
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,109
If you don't draw the map that you get from the game onto something else,

278
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,409
it'll be hard to find the treasure.

279
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,209
It seems like the culprit kept the child confined to this room

280
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,509
and let him keep playing the game.

281
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,509
Yeah.

282
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,409
It's 30 minutes till Doc gets here.

283
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,609
This is the kitchen where we came a while ago, right?

284
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,909
Did we go right around?

285
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:55,609
No. There was a forked corridor.

286
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,709
There still must be places that we haven't searched yet.

287
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,809
Right... Like the place just beyond here.

288
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,009
Something's shining.

289
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:12,609
Water?

290
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,209
Hot water.

291
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,309
Why in a place like this?

292
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,909
A picture?

293
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,409
Strange.

294
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,409
The dishes are all washed

295
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,909
and the trash is divided like it should be.

296
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,309
So, the person is probably a neat person and yet.

297
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,109
I wonder why half-eaten left-overs

298
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:44,509
are messily left on the table then.

299
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,009
Hey! Ayumi's gone!

300
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,209
Don't tell me that the culprit got her?

301
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:57,109
It can't be! The piano's still playing, besides.

302
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,309
No, it's a different sound from that piano.

303
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,509
Don't you think it's strangely out of tune!

304
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:10,209
Maybe the CD in that room

305
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:13,109
was being played endlessly to make us think he was playing.

306
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,409
Maybe he was secretly following us around.

307
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,209
Oh no...

308
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,709
Let's hurry and go look for her.

309
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:21,209
It could be that she's just lost too.

310
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:29,509
Hey, did you find her?

311
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,309
Nowhere at all.

312
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,709
Then, maybe the culprit got her after all.

313
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,509
If worse comes to worst, he could already be killed.

314
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,509
No, you mean he was already killed?

315
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,609
No. I'm just saying there's a possibility.

316
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,409
Oh no.

317
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,409
What?

318
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,809
Ayumi, where were you?

319
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,009
I was here all the while.

320
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:52,409
Answer us if you were there then.

321
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:55,909
I thought that you were looking for the boy.

322
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,809
Because you all rushed out of the kitchen in a hurry.

323
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,909
Oh, that's right! I found a picture!

324
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,009
What?

325
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,509
A family picture.

326
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,909
They seem to be a family of musicians.

327
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:15,909
The picture is dated a year ago.

328
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,009
Could the child in the center

329
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,309
have been the one who was kidnapped?

330
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,809
No. Because the child in the picture is a girl.

331
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,409
He's right. The one in the picture is either

332
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,209
without a doubt the owner of this house or...

333
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,009
a picture of the kidnapper.

334
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,209
The culprit?

335
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:35,409
Oh, no.

336
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:43,209
The key to this case should be hidden in this diary.

337
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,709
I'll solve the case no matter what.

338
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,709
"Next Episode" -There are two pages sticking out

339
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,809
from the edge of the diary.

340
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,609
What?

341
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,109
Our things are gone?

342
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:27,309
And? Is the creepy player of the piano dangerous?

343
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:31,109
Yeah, a very dangerously outstanding genius.

344
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,909
That people would resent his birth.

345
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:38,909
Go for it!

346
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:41,209
Next Conan,

347
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,780
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 2)"

"Piano chair"

350
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,036
Did you figure out the secret of the diary?

351
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,436
-Yeah. -Let's keep it a secret till next week.
