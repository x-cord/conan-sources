1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,140
We encountered a strange boy

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,440
who kept looking at an apartment.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,240
He tells us that a "kind lady" had been killed.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,840
At the apartment, we discovered the body of the lady

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,540
whose death may have been made to look like a suicide.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,840
Just then...

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,740
What's the matter?

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,640
They... they're there.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,940
The ones who were in her room a while ago.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,540
The... the three!

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Love and cases come from the same origin.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,840
The case of the discoverers who didn't report to the police

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,940
because of the money involved, ends in a most unexpected way!

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,940
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:42,503
"The Three First Discoverers (Part 2)"

19
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:45,903
And, what are we going to do?

20
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:49,303
We can't join the interrogation, you know.

21
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,403
Well, that's obvious.

22
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,803
Don't worry!

23
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,603
I stuck the Detective Squad badge

24
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:57,403
in Officer Takagi's pocket a while ago.

25
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,103
Just as I thought.

26
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:05,103
So, you're the one who stole the 500,000 yen from this room?

27
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,103
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,803
And? Where was the money?

29
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,303
Around there!

30
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:16,203
Under the feet of her hanging corpse.

31
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,903
"Ronpei Sakaba (31)" -It was rolling here and...

32
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:19,403
"Ronpei Sakaba (31)" -No, I mean...

33
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,703
Scattered everywhere.

34
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,603
Didn't you actually steal it along with her cell phone

35
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:29,103
after you killed the victim?

36
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:30,303
Cell phone?

37
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:34,403
The charger's here but the phone's not!

38
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:39,303
Inspector. Maybe Ms. Komai used the bills as a footstool.

39
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,503
I don't think 500,000 yen's enough.

40
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:47,803
But, 10 million would be about 10cm high, I suppose.

41
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,103
Indeed.

42
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,803
Next!

43
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:54,303
Go inside big man!

44
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:57,203
The victim weighed 47kg.

45
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,803
If the perp lifted her body and hung her...

46
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:04,103
"Kuramichi Habanaka (40)" -He'd be the prime suspect.

47
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:10,803
There's tape on the sole of his sandal?

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,803
So, I just told you a while ago, didn't I?

49
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:20,603
I just took the manuscript that was left at the entrance with me.

50
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:23,403
Are you sure it was the entrance?

51
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:24,403
The forensic officer said

52
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:27,603
there were three different types of shoe prints.

53
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,203
Oh, well. Actually...

54
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:36,003
The manuscripts were in a bag at her feet

55
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,103
and although I felt bad about doing so,

56
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,403
I went into the room with my shoes on to pick it up.

57
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,503
Under her feet again.

58
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:47,703
But, how unusual in this day and age. Manuscripts?

59
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,603
Yes. And because of this,

60
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:53,103
all the errors and corrections make it hard to read.

61
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:57,003
Therefore, I read the manuscripts after the AD that I give them to,

62
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,103
types them up on the computer.

63
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:02,503
By the way, how many pages was the manuscript?

64
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,603
It was a two-hour special, so maybe about 100 pages.

65
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,803
They weren't folded or rolled up, were they?

66
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:10,903
No.

67
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,603
A hundred pages of standard paper would be about 1cm tall.

68
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:18,903
It's not enough for her to stand on, either.

69
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:23,403
But, why didn't you call the police right away?

70
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:29,003
Please... please keep this off the records.

71
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:33,203
She was actually a ghost writer for a famous scriptwriter.

72
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,903
So, I thought it would cause problems

73
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:38,803
if the scripts were made public because of the case.

74
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,503
I see.

75
00:05:40,503 --> 00:05:44,303
To tell the truth, I wanted her to work independently.

76
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,503
But, the scriptwriter

77
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:51,603
was in love with her realistic and vivid crime schemes she wrote.

78
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:53,803
By the way, what's the title?

79
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:56,103
The Moonless Night Thieves series.

80
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:58,703
Oh. I know it.

81
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,603
They use impressive means

82
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:03,203
to steal gracefully from evil, wealth individuals!

83
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:08,103
Oh, but in the final episode, they killed the couple they robbed,

84
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,303
and the group disbanded.

85
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,103
Yes. That part really affected me too.

86
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:15,303
Affected you?

87
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,203
Oh, well, but...

88
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:23,903
In this script, the thieves were supposed to get back together again!

89
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:28,503
The couple they thought they killed was alive, you see.

90
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:30,603
Is... is that so?

91
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:37,003
But I never thought it would become her posthumous work.

92
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,603
We fought.

93
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:43,203
A couple of days ago at the pub.

94
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,203
You mean, with the victim Ms. Komai?

95
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:50,103
The truth is, I came here because she told me that

96
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:52,903
she wanted to apologize.

97
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:56,103
"Denji Shibakaru (63)" -The owner and customers at the pub

98
00:06:56,103 --> 00:06:58,503
were also watching the fight,

99
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,103
so I didn't think you'd believe me

100
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:03,203
if I told you that I found her hanging and already dead

101
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:06,103
when I got here.

102
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:09,303
So, that's why you left without calling the police?

103
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,403
Yeah.

104
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:12,703
But, I didn't think that the boy

105
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:16,403
was watching us going in and out of this room.

106
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,003
By the way, what caused the fight?

107
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,803
Phooey, it was a stupid argument.

108
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:25,703
We just got a little loud because we were both drinking!

109
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,003
Hey! Hurry up and answer the phone!

110
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:31,203
It's been ringing for some time!

111
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:35,603
Oh, but it's not our ringtone.

112
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:38,303
Oh, it's my cell phone!

113
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:42,403
I forgot that I changed the ringtone the other day.

114
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:46,203
Are you hanging up without answering?

115
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:50,103
It's an invitation from a bar hostess.

116
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,303
Did you come up with anything?

117
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:57,703
Yeah. The one who caused this incident,

118
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:02,203
and that the name of the boy is Mamoru Ganno.

119
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,603
How did you find out?

120
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:05,703
Three years ago,

121
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,203
a band of robbers broke into the house of a certain family.

122
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:11,003
The husband and wife were killed,

123
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,503
and robbed of two million yen in cash.

124
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:17,603
He's the only son of that couple.

125
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,603
I saw pictures of them on the net, face and all.

126
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:24,303
It said he happened to be on excursion and escaped unscathed.

127
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,503
It was also written that ever since that incident,

128
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:29,303
the band of thieves has also been missing.

129
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,103
As to the two million yen,

130
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:35,403
the numbers of the bills were coincidentally jotted down.

131
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,303
It's finally over.

132
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,403
Then, we get to go, don't we?

133
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:42,103
I've got to get back to the TV station too.

134
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,503
Well...

135
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,603
Officer Takagi.

136
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:50,003
I think you should search the room more thoroughly.

137
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,003
What?

138
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,303
The 500,000 yen is definitely in there somewhere.

139
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:55,303
What?

140
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:56,503
And...

141
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,603
Could you lend me 20,000 yen?

142
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:00,703
What?

143
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:14,295
At any rate, according to the testimony of the eye-witness,

144
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,995
after the three of you came in and out of this room,

145
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,195
one after the other,

146
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:21,495
the eye-witness came here and found,

147
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:26,195
scriptwriter Ms. Yasue Komai hung to death.

148
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:30,295
Judging from the fact that there was no footstool at her feet,

149
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,595
it's only thinkable that she was killed,

150
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:35,395
then made to look as if she committed suicide.

151
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:39,095
By one of you three!

152
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,395
Like I've been saying!

153
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:47,195
When I came to this room, she was already hanging there dead.

154
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,695
I did take the money that was on the floor though,

155
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,595
but I didn't kill her!

156
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:58,795
Me too. All I did was take the manuscripts that were at her feet.

157
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:01,895
I didn't do anything I have to feel guilty about.

158
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,595
Same here. When I entered the room,

159
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:07,695
I saw her hanging from the ceiling,

160
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:11,695
but I didn't take anything from the room.

161
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,295
Then can you at least

162
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:16,595
tell me around what time you came to this room?

163
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:21,395
I wonder. I was just told to come around after 2pm

164
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:24,495
so I don't remember the exact time.

165
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:27,095
I think I came around 2pm too.

166
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,595
When I called her from the phone booth,

167
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,395
that's the time she told me to come.

168
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:35,295
I came on my own, so I didn't have an appointment.

169
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,395
Which means all three of you came around after 2pm,

170
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:41,495
but none of you ran into each other?

171
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:43,695
It was just a coincidence.

172
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:46,995
There are such coincidences, right?

173
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:50,795
Maybe they're matching their stories?

174
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,895
Maybe they all agreed to keep the time,

175
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:55,895
Ms. Komai told them to come over a secret!

176
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:59,695
Because those three seem to know each other.

177
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,095
They know each other?

178
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,495
Remember? When that old man lit his lighter,

179
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,795
although there was wind blowing,

180
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:09,395
a large flame was lit without swaying.

181
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:12,795
That's because the big man was near the old man

182
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,095
and blocking the wind, right?

183
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,195
Oh. Well...

184
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:20,395
But, that man was choking and coughing at the cigarette smoke.

185
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:23,095
Maybe he doesn't like cigarettes?

186
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,495
If so, why'd he do such a thing?

187
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:30,595
That goes to show that the old man means a lot to him!

188
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:31,995
I see.

189
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:36,095
That's why he went over to block the wind, correct?

190
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,395
Since he was outside, as long as he didn't get too close,

191
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:41,795
the smoke wouldn't bother him.

192
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:46,595
And when the long-haired man borrowed the lighter,

193
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:50,195
he adjusted the flames to become smaller, right?

194
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,695
So what?

195
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,895
How did you know before you lighted the lighter,

196
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:59,595
that the old man always set the flames at max?

197
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,695
Oh, well, that's...

198
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:06,695
Besides, when the other man was smoking,

199
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:11,395
the big man went up to him and glared, right?

200
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:14,895
As if saying I'm not going to let you smoke!

201
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,695
The long-haired man panicked,

202
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,995
and snuffed out his cigarette that he wasn't finished smoking yet.

203
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:25,195
I'm positive that these three know each other!

204
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:28,195
So what if we know each other?

205
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,595
Like I was just saying.

206
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,895
You all matched your stories

207
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:35,695
and lied about the time that you came to the room.

208
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:38,595
Because, if all of you

209
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:42,595
insist that the lady was dead when you came to the room,

210
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,095
the first one who came

211
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,695
had to be the one that killed and hung her,

212
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,195
but it would mean that you're all lying!

213
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,895
True.

214
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:55,995
That's why you took the lady's cell phone, old man, right?

215
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:59,295
Because you didn't want people to know the order in which you came.

216
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,495
What?

217
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:05,395
I think the lady mailed all of you to come over.

218
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:09,395
Rather than verbally, that way she could mail you by the minute.

219
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,295
And because of this, you didn't run into each other

220
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:15,095
although you came at around the same time!

221
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:18,295
But how do you know he took her phone?

222
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:20,295
Well, the old man didn't know

223
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:24,695
the ringtone of the cell phone he had, right?

224
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,595
He didn't answer the phone either.

225
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:30,495
That was because it was the lady's cell phone!

226
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,695
So, the picture in the cell phone that you showed me

227
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,595
was actually the lady's, right?

228
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,295
But, why do you know about the ringtone?

229
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,695
I... I heard it through the wall.

230
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,695
I have good ears, you see!

231
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:46,695
I've got to retrieve the Detective Squad badge

232
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,595
that I stuck in Officer Takagi later.

233
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:55,495
Then, Mr. Shibakaru, I'd like to check the cell phone that you have.

234
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:58,695
No, this is really mine.

235
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:02,095
But, the order in which the three came,

236
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:06,395
that can be figured out by that cell phone is meaningless!

237
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,595
Meaningless?

238
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,495
Oh, Officer Takagi! Did you buy it?

239
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:15,895
Yeah.

240
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,295
I bought the notebook and the tape,

241
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:20,795
and changed 20,000 yen in thousand yen notes.

242
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,495
Just what're you using them for?

243
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:27,195
I'm going to do an experiment now, but may I use the room?

244
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,195
Yeah.

245
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:32,595
Then, help me out too, you guys!

246
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,595
It's like art craft class!

247
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,695
Okay! It's done, Conan!

248
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:44,595
Oh! Thank you, please leave it there!

249
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:45,595
Okay!

250
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:47,495
Is this really something

251
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:50,695
that has to do with the investigation of the case?

252
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,995
Probably.

253
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,595
Is this good enough?

254
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,395
Yes, very good.

255
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,695
Okay! All done!

256
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,895
Now, we're all set!

257
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,095
What's okay?

258
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,395
All you did was roll 20 thousand yen bills up by tape into cylinders

259
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:09,695
and lined them out!

260
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:14,495
But, I'm sure the long-haired man had seen these cylinders before, no?

261
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:18,595
Because you sort of said that you found money

262
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:22,995
rolling at the feet of the lady that hung herself.

263
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:25,895
It's true if they were scattered on the floor,

264
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,895
you'd say they were rolling, but...

265
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:29,795
Is that how it was?

266
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,195
Yeah. I guess so.

267
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:34,195
And? What about the experiment?

268
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:38,795
Put the notebook on the cylinders that are lined up.

269
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,895
And get on very carefully.

270
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:45,095
See! You can stand on it.

271
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,695
Wow!

272
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,295
But, why?

273
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:52,495
I weigh 18kg!

274
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:56,495
One cylinder can hold up to 1kg.

275
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:58,095
I get it!

276
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:01,095
Ms. Komai used this as a footstool!

277
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:04,595
She weighed about 47kg.

278
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:08,795
If she lined up cylinders amounting to 500,000 yen vertically,

279
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:12,895
and place the envelope with the 100 paged manuscript inside it,

280
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:16,895
a footstool enough to support her weight can be constructed!

281
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,195
I see.

282
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:22,195
After she kicked the footstool and hung herself,

283
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:25,195
Mr. Sakaba stole the cylinders amounting to 500,000 yen

284
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,495
that were scattered on the floor.

285
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:29,995
If Mr. Habanaka picks up

286
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,295
the envelope with the manuscript inside from the floor,

287
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:36,295
the footstool would be gone and it would look like homicide.

288
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,895
And if Mr. Shibakaru is made to take the cell phone away,

289
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:44,095
then nobody would know the three were asked to come by the minute.

290
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:45,995
If an eye-witness is set up

291
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:48,295
to watch the three go in and out of the room,

292
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:52,995
all of you would turn up as suspects of murder.

293
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,095
Oh.

294
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,595
So, she committed suicide after all.

295
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,195
What a scare.

296
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:01,495
But, there's no proof of that yet.

297
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,495
The evidence is on the sole of the sandal

298
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:06,595
that the long-haired man is wearing.

299
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,795
-What? -The tape that the lady used

300
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,695
when she rolled the bills up into cylinders.

301
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:13,495
No, joke?

302
00:17:13,495 --> 00:17:14,895
True.

303
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:18,395
You were taking the tapes of bill worth 500,000 yen off,

304
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:20,295
so that's what took you long

305
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:23,195
to return to the ATM of the bank from here, right?

306
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:25,195
Yeah.

307
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:28,995
I think the lady's fingerprints should be on the tape.

308
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:31,995
And traces of the tape should also be on the 500,000 yen

309
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:35,395
that you deposited in the ATM.

310
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:38,995
Go right away to that bank where the ATM is and confirm!

311
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,195
Yes, sir!

312
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:44,895
But, how amazing Conan!

313
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,995
It's as if you're Shinichi!

314
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:52,095
Oh... I discussed that deduction over with Shinichi by mail

315
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:55,595
and just read off what he wrote back.

316
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:58,895
Oh. I thought so.

317
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:01,495
Which means we're all innocent.

318
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,395
We get to go, right?

319
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:04,995
I've still got work to do.

320
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:10,095
Oh, I still have to ask you why she did what she did.

321
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:13,595
Oh, that's right! I'll return this cell phone.

322
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:16,995
I took it with me because I didn't want to be suspected.

323
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,295
Give me a break, will you?

324
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:22,495
Well, I don't know why she committed suicide

325
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:25,195
while trying to set us up like we murdered her,

326
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:28,695
but in my case I guess it was the argument I had with her at the pub.

327
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:29,795
In my case, it was probably because

328
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:33,395
I asked her to suddenly give me back the money I lent her.

329
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,695
I guess the fact that she couldn't go independent for some time now,

330
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,995
was one reason that stressed her out too.

331
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,095
See you.

332
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:42,195
Oh, hey.

333
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:45,495
Somehow it doesn't feel right.

334
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:49,695
You so easily exposed the trick that she risked her life

335
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,095
to carry out on the suspicious looking three.

336
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,995
No. Her actual purpose was...

337
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,195
What the...

338
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,795
Director Habanaka!

339
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,595
Are the contents of the written confession true?

340
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,295
Written confession?

341
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,095
It's written!

342
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:13,895
In the manuscript of Ms. Yasue Komai that you gave to the AD!

343
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:17,295
That she was one of the members of the notorious band of robbers

344
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,095
that consisted of Kuramichi Habanaka,

345
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,995
Denji Shibakaru and Ronpei Sakaba, in the past!

346
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,295
She says that evidence of this is in her cell phone.

347
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:32,295
And that the money that you stole is in Tohto Bank ATM!

348
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:35,395
No. This must be some kind of mistake...

349
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,795
As to whether this is a mistake or not,

350
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,595
we'll hear you out at the police station.

351
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,495
Come to think of it, it seems to have been found.

352
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:12,895
From inside the cushion in her room.

353
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,095
The 500,000 yen that she newly withdrew from the bank.

354
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:22,295
If she had 500,000 yen on her,

355
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:23,995
why did she go out of her way to...

356
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,895
Because she wanted the police

357
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:28,295
to realize that the 500,000 yen was stolen.

358
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:30,995
Otherwise, that trick couldn't have been exposed.

359
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:34,395
In other words, it was a trick schemed to expose what happened.

360
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:38,695
Yeah, her purpose was to set the three up as suspects for murder

361
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:40,895
and while under the surveillance of the police,

362
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,495
to expose their crime as a band of robbers.

363
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:48,295
She indicated the evidence and wanted them arrested.

364
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,695
But, it's amazing you figured it out.

365
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:54,695
That she still hadn't touched the 500,000 yen that served as evidence.

366
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,995
Two million yen was the amount stolen

367
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:59,295
at the last murder robbery that occurred.

368
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:01,795
Divided by four this would amount to 500,000 yen.

369
00:22:01,795 --> 00:22:03,295
If she regretted the murder and quit her life of crime,

370
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:06,795
I figured she wouldn't use it.

371
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:08,695
By the way, although there were many reasons

372
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:11,495
how I found out that they were a band of robbers,

373
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:12,995
the decisive reason

374
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:16,595
was the phrase that the old man, Shibakaru mumbled.

375
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,995
But I didn't think that the boy

376
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:22,895
was watching us going in and out of this room.

377
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:26,495
The Inspector saw us

378
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,895
and hinted that we were the witnesses.

379
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:32,095
However, that old man already knew that the witness

380
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,495
was the boy Mamoru Ganno.

381
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:37,495
It's proof that he knew Ms. Komai

382
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,695
was on good terms with the bereaved Mamoru.

383
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,595
But, isn't it cruel?

384
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,595
To set Mamoru up as the eye-witness to complete the trick?

385
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,895
It seems that she was being threatened.

386
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:51,095
Saying that if she didn't want Mamoru to find out that

387
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,195
she belonged to a band of robbers,

388
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:53,995
she had to hand over money

389
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,495
or write the continuation to the manuscript,

390
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:58,095
or that they would kill Mamoru

391
00:22:58,095 --> 00:23:00,495
unless she return to the group.

392
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:03,595
That's why she set Mamoru up as the eye-witness.

393
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:07,795
Because she figured the police would protect the eye-witness.

394
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:12,595
And, she probably tried to make up for her crimes by killing herself.

395
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:15,095
But, that was a big mistake.

396
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:18,695
On top of driving Mamoru's parents to death,

397
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:25,095
she made him lose the friend that he finally found too.

398
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:26,595
Lose?

399
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:32,295
Come to think of it, everybody was saying...

400
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,895
That guy is missing one side.

401
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,095
That guy?

402
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,595
Rum.

403
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,095
He hurt is eye in some accident.

404
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:43,895
And lost one of his eyes, which seems to be made of glass.

405
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,495
Hide!

406
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,495
We don't get along.

407
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:02,195
I'm sorry. If everyone loses his job...

408
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:06,895
What's this?

409
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:08,495
Fog.

410
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,295
Is everybody okay?

411
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,095
Ryo!

412
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:14,095
Where are you?

413
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:21,095
Next Conan, "Bodyguard, Kogoro Mouri"

414
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:39,395
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,095
"Fog"

416
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:42,595
A bodyguard?

417
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,695
You mean for an actress?

418
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,795
Just like in the movies.
