1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,770
What?

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,370
A meal coupon?

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,770
You mean you won the lottery again?

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,070
Wow!

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,570
You're really lucky when it comes to lotteries, aren't you?

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,370
So, I thought I'd take you all to the high class restaurant

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,870
on the top floor of the Beika Department Store

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,570
to have a fancy lunch today!

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,370
All right!

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,470
There's still more!

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,270
You've still got more happy news coming, you see!

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,970
-What is it? -Tell us!

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,570
It's still a secret!

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,070
-What? -Come on.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,470
Don't be a Scrooge!

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,770
If Sera is Akai's younger sister,

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,770
what did she come back to Japan from the States for?

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,870
Did she come to confirm whether Mr. Akai

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,170
who was said to have died was really dead?

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,170
Is that why she approached us, who had contact with the FBI?

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,670
If so, she'd be checking me up more closely.

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,370
So then, it has to be something to do with that intermediate school girl

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,270
that Sera is keeping at the hotel.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,470
Her name is probably Mary.

25
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,570
The one called the younger sister from another domain,

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,770
who looks just like Sera.

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,970
No.

28
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,870
Rather than Sera, she...

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,070
What? In deep thought or something?

30
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,970
Yes, sort of.

31
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,770
What's with those bags under your eyes?

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,470
Last night, before going to sleep, I found a cockroach,

33
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,270
and it took me till 4:00 in the morning to get rid of it!

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,170
Really?

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,470
Doc went to sleep right away, though.

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,770
And? What were you thinking about?

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,570
Well...

38
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,270
I was wondering what lunch at a high class restaurant would be like.

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,270
Really?

40
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,870
What a carefree guy.

41
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,970
Sorry.

42
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

43
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

44
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,670
There are many things to think about.

45
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,370
But first, lunch, then an incident occurs!

46
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,370
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:09,727
"The Detective Squad in a Grove (Part 1)"

50
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,227
Fantastic!

51
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,927
It's full of Christmas inside the department store.

52
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:29,327
-Wow! -This sure is exciting!

53
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,627
Santa Claus!

54
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:33,327
He's passing out balloons!

55
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,127
-Let's go get some! -Yes!

56
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,727
Merry Christmas!

57
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,027
-Yeah! -Thank you very much!

58
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,327
Hey, the elevator's that way!

59
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:47,727
I know it's almost Christmas, but talk about crowded...

60
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:52,527
Ai. Look, look!

61
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,627
They're putting on make-up over there!

62
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,527
Yeah. A demonstration sales of cosmetics.

63
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:01,527
My, this mascara is good!

64
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,627
Just the thing for your Christmas date!

65
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:05,927
You can say that again!

66
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,727
-Mascara... -How nice.

67
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:11,627
Hey, Doc's calling you.

68
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:14,627
You guys are too young for stuff like that!

69
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,927
What? You can't do it?

70
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:23,327
Then, what's this? Are you saying that we're not customers?

71
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,827
So if it's your mother...

72
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,927
Hey, Ai.

73
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,927
Go on and do it for them.

74
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,127
I'm sure their mother will come in the meantime.

75
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:34,027
Okay.

76
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,727
Please come this way.

77
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,627
Okay.

78
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:43,227
How is it?

79
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,727
Do I look very different?

80
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,027
Yeah.

81
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,127
-Pre... -Very pretty!

82
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:54,327
I guess you do look different in a way.

83
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:58,527
Where's your mother?

84
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:01,927
She died right after I was born.

85
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,227
What?

86
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:07,327
Okay! Let's go to lunch, Ayumi!

87
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,427
Yep!

88
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,427
Hey! Wait, you guys!

89
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:12,727
Are you planning to go to the restaurant like that?

90
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,127
Hey!

91
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,727
They didn't buy anything, after all.

92
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,427
Boy, did I eat!

93
00:06:30,427 --> 00:06:31,927
I'm full!

94
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,427
The portions were just right, too.

95
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,427
Yep!

96
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:39,427
Well, we did share 3 adult servings among the 6 of us, after all.

97
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:42,927
They took of their make-up, after all.

98
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,827
So, what is it, Doc?

99
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,427
There's something good coming up after this too, right?

100
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,827
What? What is it?

101
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,527
Well, you see...

102
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,427
Together with the meal ticket here,

103
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,027
I also won a gift certificate

104
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:59,527
for this department store at the lottery, too!

105
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:02,127
-No joke? -Wow!

106
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,027
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

107
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,927
So, I was thinking of using the 10,000 yen of this gift certificate

108
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,227
to get you guys Christmas presents...

109
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:13,027
What? Where did they go?

110
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,627
Over there.

111
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:18,427
I always wanted a telescope from before!

112
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,827
I want a baseball bat and glove!

113
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,627
I want a big stuffed doll.

114
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:25,127
Well...

115
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,727
I... I only won 10,000 yen.

116
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:32,227
Then, I guess I'll go take a look at the newest Fusae brand pouch.

117
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,427
Even Ai's acting like them.

118
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,527
Did you ask for me?

119
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,027
Are you the Chef of this restaurant?

120
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,427
Yes, sir. I'm the head chef of this restaurant.

121
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,927
Was there any problem with the food?

122
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:53,227
No, my husband insists that the secret ingredient in this soup is miso.

123
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,627
Yes, I used Haccho Miso.

124
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:58,227
I'm amazed you noticed.

125
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,327
See! I was right, wasn't I?

126
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,227
My, I'm amazed.

127
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:05,327
-Chef. -What?

128
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:07,827
You've got a call from that complainer again.

129
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:10,727
You mean the one with the strange voice?

130
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:13,027
He says he wants to talk to you directly

131
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,027
because he's at this department store today.

132
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:20,527
But I don't want him coming here making a fuss.

133
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,227
Then, tell him to wait at the stairs near the restaurant,

134
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,827
30 minutes from now!

135
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:26,827
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:33,827
I guess I'll go look for the children.

137
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,027
I don't think you need to.

138
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,627
I've been getting mails from them

139
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,627
saying they found what they want you to buy for them so to come over.

140
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:44,027
Moreover, photos are attached to all of them.

141
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,327
Let's see.

142
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:48,927
Genta is on the 7th floor where the sport equipment are.

143
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:52,727
Mitsuhiko is on the 5th floor where the camera shop is.

144
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:56,227
Ayumi is on the 4th floor where the toy department is.

145
00:08:56,227 --> 00:09:00,627
Ai is on the 1st floor where they carry brand name bags and stuff.

146
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:06,027
They all really want me to buy them stuff.

147
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,027
What's wrong, Shinichi?

148
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,327
Nothing.

149
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:12,127
I was just thinking that 30 minutes had passed since then.

150
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:17,027
What was that voice just now?

151
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:19,227
It came from the stairs.

152
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,027
Please... Let me through!

153
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:28,627
If I remember correctly,

154
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:29,927
he's the chef of the restaurant we just went to.

155
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,027
Are you okay? Get a hold of yourself!

156
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:37,827
The perp went down...

157
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,827
Doc, call the ambulance and police right away!

158
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,727
Okay.

159
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,927
Hey, you guys. Can you hear me?

160
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,427
A person's been stabbed right now

161
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:51,027
at the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor.

162
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:53,327
The perp is fleeing using the stairs!

163
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,027
All those near the stairs,

164
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,627
be on the look out for anybody who comes running down the stairs.

165
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,327
Ai, go and tell the receptionist of this department of the circumstances

166
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:05,027
and tell them to stop anybody who is out of running and out of breath!

167
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:06,027
Okay!

168
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:09,027
All the rest of you just find the perp!

169
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,027
Just remember what the perp looks like,

170
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,327
what he's wearing, and his characteristics, that's all.

171
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:15,427
Okay? The perp's somebody who tried to stabbed a person to death!

172
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:18,227
You never know what he'd do if he finds out that he's been identified!

173
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,627
Don't try and do anything, understand?

174
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:21,927
Yes...

175
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:33,893
And? Through Conan's instructions,

176
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:37,193
the people who were stopped at the exit of this department store

177
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:41,593
are these three who were trying to rush out.

178
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:44,593
It seems all three were perspiring profusely.

179
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:47,393
I... I was looking for the restroom!

180
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,793
"Takashi Kamaya (26)" -Every restroom on every floor was occupied,

181
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:53,293
so I decided to use one at a convenience store near here,

182
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,093
but was stopped.

183
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,293
And you?

184
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:59,193
I was looking for my wallet.

185
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,693
"Mitsuko Shikama (38)" -I thought I left it somewhere,

186
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:05,893
so I was running around to places where I shopped today.

187
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:09,093
And? Did you find your wallet?

188
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,893
What? Yes.

189
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:14,093
I looked carefully and found it inside my bag.

190
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,793
Then, how about you?

191
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:19,293
I went to eat at the Thai restaurant here.

192
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:22,793
I'm a chef so I came to check on the taste.

193
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:27,293
"Masaru Miyadai (52)" -The sauteed vegetables that I ate there was so spicy

194
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:28,693
that I couldn't stop perspiring

195
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,193
so I wanted to go home right away to take a shower.

196
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,993
That's why I was in a rush.

197
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,193
All three of them seem to have their reasons.

198
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:40,093
Next, we need to get the testimonies of the children

199
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:42,193
who say they saw the perp.

200
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:43,693
They'll do fine!

201
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,293
They say they didn't see the perp's face

202
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,993
but they remember the characteristics!

203
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:49,493
-Right? -Yeah!

204
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:50,793
I saw, I saw!

205
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,093
No problem!

206
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,693
He was pretty small!

207
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,893
He had the number "2" on his clothes.

208
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,393
His clothes were gray!

209
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:02,893
The color was like what Ai is wearing now!

210
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,993
-Wrong. -What?

211
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:08,793
He was pretty big and was wearing dark gray clothes!

212
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,793
And he ran like a man!

213
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,993
Wrong! He was small!

214
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:17,393
Maybe he looked big to you because you're small built, Mitsuhiko?

215
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,593
No, I'm sure of what I saw!

216
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:21,493
He was a man of big built.

217
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:25,093
I thought it was a woman.

218
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,293
She was wearing light gray clothes that was almost white.

219
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:32,693
She was of normal height, a little taller than Doc!

220
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:36,693
Hey, hey.

221
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:38,593
-I said he was small built! -We've got a problem here.

222
00:12:38,593 --> 00:12:39,993
It's no mistake that he was big built!

223
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,993
-Their testimonies are all different! -Nope! It was a woman!

224
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:46,493
He was small built and wore gray clothes for sure!

225
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:50,793
No, he was big built wearing dark gray clothes!

226
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:51,893
She was a woman wearing bright gray clothes,

227
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:54,693
a little taller than Dr. Agasa!

228
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,693
Organizing what you all said...

229
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,793
The characteristics of the perp

230
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:05,593
who fled down the stairs after stabbing Mr. Hosogoe

231
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:09,393
near the stairs of the restaurant arcade on the 10th floor are...

232
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,893
According to Genta who was on the 7th floor,

233
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:14,993
was small built with the number 2 on his clothes

234
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:18,493
that were gray like the color that Ai is wearing now.

235
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,793
Yeah!

236
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:22,393
According to Mitsuhiko who was on the 5th floor,

237
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:25,393
he was a big built person who ran like a man,

238
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,293
and the clothes he was wearing looked dark gray.

239
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:29,693
That's right!

240
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:32,493
And according to Ayumi who was on the 4th floor,

241
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,693
the person was of normal height, a little taller than Dr. Agasa

242
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:39,593
and looked to be a woman wearing light gray clothes, right?

243
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:40,893
Yep!

244
00:13:40,893 --> 00:13:44,693
But the clothes of all three of the people

245
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,093
who were trying to rush out of here and that we stopped, are all gray.

246
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,993
Yes, although the shade of gray is all different.

247
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:55,493
The one wearing gray similar to the clothes Ai is wearing

248
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,093
is Mr. Kamaya, right?

249
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:59,493
Don't be ridiculous!

250
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:03,493
I was really looking for a restroom that was unoccupied, I told you!

251
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:04,693
What's this?

252
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:07,393
It seems you hurt the finger of your right hand.

253
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,993
Oh, this...

254
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,493
I sprained my finger.

255
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,493
I bumped it against the restroom door because I was in a rush.

256
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:16,793
Besides, the other two brats were saying

257
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:20,593
that the gray was a darker or lighter gray.

258
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,993
Moreover, even that fat brat over there said that

259
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,393
the number 2 was on the clothes,

260
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:27,093
"Beika" -but on mine...

261
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:29,893
See! There're only kanji characters on it!

262
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,393
He's right.

263
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:36,993
Then, the one that Ayumi said was wearing light gray clothes...

264
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,493
Hey, hold it!

265
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:42,693
I told you, didn't I? I was looking for my wallet

266
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,993
and was running around the places I stopped by today.

267
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:50,293
But you found your wallet inside your bag, after all, didn't you?

268
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:53,093
Why were you rushing out of the department store?

269
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,593
I rushed because I suddenly remembered that the TV drama I missed

270
00:14:57,593 --> 00:15:00,393
was going to have a rerun at sundown today!

271
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,593
Do you have a cold?

272
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:05,293
Yes, I was recovering but...

273
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:09,293
Since I perspired running around, I'm cold again

274
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:10,893
and maybe I caught it again.

275
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:15,793
It seems that you don't have the number 2 on your clothes either.

276
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:19,793
Well, the broche on your chest could look to be a number,

277
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,893
but it would be 6, not 2.

278
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:25,693
The only one left is Mr. Miyadai, you,

279
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:29,393
who Mitsuhiko said was wearing dark gray clothes.

280
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:30,593
Hey, hey.

281
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:33,493
I said I ate spicy hot food and perspired

282
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:35,693
so I wanted to go back home and take a shower as soon as possible.

283
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:39,493
That's why I was rushing out of the department store. I'm not lying.

284
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:42,193
The fact is, I heard rumors that

285
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:43,893
the soup of the Thai restaurant here

286
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:47,493
tastes a lot like the soup we serve, so...

287
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,893
You mean you came here to complain?

288
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:52,993
Yeah. Well, I tried it,

289
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,393
but it wasn't all that similar,

290
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:56,293
so I left without saying anything.

291
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:57,493
I see.

292
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:01,493
By the way, something's written on the back of your stadium jacket.

293
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:05,793
Yeah, but it's not a number.

294
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:07,693
Tokyo Spirits?

295
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:14,093
You've been wriggling your feet for a while.

296
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,193
I've got athlete's foot! You know, athlete's foot!

297
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:19,793
That's why I want to go home quickly and put medicine on it.

298
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:25,393
Now, for as to why Ayumi thought the perp was a woman.

299
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,593
Why did you think so?

300
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,493
Well, because...

301
00:16:29,493 --> 00:16:33,693
I just had a feeling that she was a woman!

302
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,693
A...

303
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,893
Feeling?

304
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,193
Inspector Megure!

305
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:41,693
We found that the victim Mr. Hosogoe and those three

306
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,993
have a connection!

307
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,193
What?

308
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:50,593
Mr. Kamaya seems to have been part-timing until 2 years ago,

309
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,993
at a restaurant where the victim was the head chef.

310
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:57,593
But his attitude at work was bad so he was fired.

311
00:16:57,593 --> 00:17:01,693
Ms. Shikama lives in the next room at the same condo as the victim.

312
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:04,093
But they seem to have had frequent arguments

313
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:06,993
about Ms. Shikama's dog being nosy.

314
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,093
And as for Mr. Miyadai, 3 years ago,

315
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,093
he seems to have made a fuss at the victim's restaurant

316
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:14,293
saying that the victim copied his cooking,

317
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,693
and the local police came to the scene.

318
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,293
I see.

319
00:17:19,293 --> 00:17:21,893
It seems as to all three of you,

320
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:25,293
I need to ask you more things in detail.

321
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:37,993
Before that, can you ask the three if they have gloves on them?

322
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:40,193
-Gloves? -Yep!

323
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,593
Because there were no fingerprints on the knife, right?

324
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:48,193
If so, the perp probably was wearing gloves.

325
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,193
And maybe if blood got splattered on it,

326
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,493
I would probably throw it away.

327
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:55,793
Well?

328
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,893
I've got gloves.

329
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:58,293
Just in case.

330
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,593
After all, it's cold.

331
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:09,693
None of them have blood on.

332
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,393
According to the coroner,

333
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:16,093
the victim bled because he tried to pull the knife out himself,

334
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:20,093
so it's most likely that practically no blood splattered on the perp.

335
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,593
I see.

336
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,293
And how is the victim doing?

337
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,393
The surgery seems to have gone well,

338
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:28,593
but he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

339
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,193
At any rate,

340
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,193
I'll have to get the details from all of you in a different room.

341
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,493
We'll go too, then!

342
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,093
No, no!

343
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,393
From here, we the police do the job!

344
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:43,893
What?

345
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,693
Ghads, no joke!

346
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:52,393
Why won't they show us the interrogation?

347
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,193
Well, your eye-witness testimonies were so unreliable,

348
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:56,693
it can't be helped.

349
00:18:56,693 --> 00:18:58,393
It wasn't unreliable!

350
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:01,193
-I really saw what I saw! -I'm not lying!

351
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,093
Cool it, cool it.

352
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:06,093
Okay. So Genta, the perp that you saw was small built

353
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:08,393
and had the number 2 on his clothes,

354
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:12,293
and he was wearing gray clothes just like Ai's. Is that true?

355
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,293
Yeah.

356
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:16,393
Then, why didn't you see the face of the perp?

357
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:20,693
Well, because I was trying to use the stairs

358
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,593
to return from the sport equipment floor

359
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,693
but the members of the basketball team were in the way.

360
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,793
The members of the basketball team?

361
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:32,093
That's the Haido High School basketball club!

362
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,493
Their uniforms were ready today,

363
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:37,093
so the entire team came to pick them up.

364
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,593
I see.

365
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,993
They were all tall and they looked like adults

366
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:43,693
but when they got their uniforms,

367
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,593
they looked so happy and wore it on top of the clothes.

368
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:49,593
They were wearing saying, "I'm going to wear this home today!"

369
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,793
They were excited like children.

370
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:54,893
Do you know what kind of uniform it was?

371
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:59,393
Yeah, I do! I took a picture of it, you see.

372
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:00,693
There!

373
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,993
The uniform is gray like the clothes Ai is wearing.

374
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:08,293
Yeah.

375
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:12,493
That's right. The perp was wearing the same kind of gray.

376
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:13,593
And he went down the stairs

377
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,493
passing in front of the members of the basketball team

378
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,593
who were headed for the stairs!

379
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,993
Then, maybe the members of the basketball team saw the perp, too.

380
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:24,193
-I don't think so. -What?

381
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:27,693
Because I shouted, "Get out of the way" back then...

382
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,993
so I think they were all looking at me.

383
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:35,093
But basketball uniforms have numbers on them, don't they?

384
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:38,993
If so, then maybe you mistook the number 2

385
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:42,493
that was on the uniform of one of the members, for the perp's?

386
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,293
I didn't make a mistake!

387
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,393
Besides, only he was running!

388
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:49,893
Then, if it was full of numbers back then...

389
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:54,193
No. I'm sure that Genta saw the number 2!

390
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:57,993
Because there are no numbers 1, 2, and 3 in basketball.

391
00:20:57,993 --> 00:20:59,293
See?

392
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,193
What? Why not?

393
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,693
The referees of basketball indicate

394
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:06,893
the players who commit violations with their fingers,

395
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:09,093
but since they also indicate the 1 point of free throws,

396
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:13,393
the 2 and 3 points of normal shoots with their fingers.

397
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:17,193
So, to avoid confusion, the International Basketball League decided

398
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,393
that the numbers from 1 to 3 won't be used on the uniforms.

399
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,993
Really?

400
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:26,493
But those three had no number 2 on them, right?

401
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,293
Right.

402
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:32,193
Only if you guys took pictures of the perp.

403
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,793
Then, you should've told us to do so to begin with!

404
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,893
What?

405
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,093
The picture that Genta took,

406
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:39,893
both your hands are full with the bat and glove,

407
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:42,293
but who took this picture?

408
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:45,093
A member of the basketball team that I told you about a while ago!

409
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,693
I see.

410
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:50,293
Mitsuhiko and Ai seem to have taken selfies.

411
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,893
You didn't take this picture yourself, did you, Ayumi?

412
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:53,993
Nope!

413
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,793
The kind salesclerk at the toy department took it!

414
00:21:57,793 --> 00:21:58,893
When you called to say that

415
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:03,393
the person who stabbed somebody ran down the stairs,

416
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:05,993
she took me over to the stairs!

417
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,493
Then, maybe that salesclerk...

418
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,893
Also could've...

419
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:13,593
Witnessed the perp!

420
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,393
Okay, let's go to the toy department!

421
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:17,893
Aye...

422
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:20,893
Hey, the elevator's on the other side!

423
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:23,593
It's crowded so taking the stairs is faster!

424
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:58,093
"Next Episode" -So, who's the perp after all?

425
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,493
The perp went running down

426
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:04,493
slipping through the mannequins and the sign!

427
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:07,093
Will this do?

428
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,093
Ai, the button of your clothes...

429
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,893
But what I saw was "2", you know?

430
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:16,393
What's the matter? Is there something on my face?

431
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,693
Next Conan,

432
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,293
"The Detective Squad is in a Grove (Part 2)"

433
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:27,336
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:29,336
"Mannequin"

435
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,336
The next episode will be aired on Christmas Eve.

436
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,636
Merry Christmas!

437
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,936
I need to think up a lot of gifts for Christmas again.
