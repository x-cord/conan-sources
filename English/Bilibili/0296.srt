1
00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.324
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:06.024
Fishing, fireworks, and a house boat.

4
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:07.024
An accident or a case

5
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.024
depending on the skill of deduction.

6
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.524
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:13.624
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:53.503
"Sayori Unabara (22), in charge of cooking and customer relation"

10
00:01:57.103 --> 00:02:00.603
"Fukuo Unabara (50), Captain of 'Unabara Maru'"

11
00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:09.103
"Kazuyuki Kawai (65), President of a building company"

12
00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:15.503
Oh! There it is!

13
00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:18.103
Unabara Maru. That's the one! That's it!

14
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.903
Welcome! The entrance is this way.

15
00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:30.903
Well, Mr. Kawai, thank you for inviting us over tonight.

16
00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:32.303
Same here.

17
00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:35.503
You've been so much help to me in so many ways that it's no big deal.

18
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:38.903
Getting to watch the fireworks on a houseboat is so fantastic!

19
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:42.803
It sure is rare that they're having fireworks at this time of season.

20
00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:44.003
Hey, come on, Conan!

21
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.803
Hi there, sorry to keep you all waiting!

22
00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:49.703
I had a big transaction to take care of.

23
00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.003
Mr. Yamazaki,

24
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.203
I'm sorry that I suddenly asked you to come

25
00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:55.503
despite your busy schedule.

26
00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:58.103
I've got your fishing equipment ready too.

27
00:02:58.103 --> 00:02:59.203
"Tsuneo Yamazaki (60), President of a finance company"

28
00:02:59.203 --> 00:03:01.203
All you can eat, all you can drink,

29
00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:02.803
and watching fireworks too.

30
00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.803
To top things off I also get to go fishing.

31
00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:06.803
I couldn't possibly refuse.

32
00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:10.403
Captain, please sail the ship out because we're all here.

33
00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:11.603
Yes, sir!

34
00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:25.803
"Houseboat Fishing Shock"

35
00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:30.503
This ship is so spacious,

36
00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.303
and yet we're the only ones on board?

37
00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:36.603
The fact is, I reserved this boat for our company's pleasure trip,

38
00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:39.403
but urgent work came in...

39
00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:42.203
I couldn't cancel the trip at this point, so...

40
00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:46.803
I asked Mr. Yamazaki and Mr. Mouri, whom I'm always being helped by

41
00:03:46.803 --> 00:03:49.103
to come along.

42
00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:53.803
Thank you for waiting!

43
00:03:53.803 --> 00:03:55.503
Oh! Here's the food!

44
00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:57.103
Finally, at last!

45
00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:02.003
Go ahead everybody, help yourself to your heart's content!

46
00:04:15.203 --> 00:04:17.803
Here, Mr. Kawai, have some too.

47
00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:31.303
How do you like this fishing pole?

48
00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:34.403
Oh, so that's the carbon type new model fishing pole

49
00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:37.103
that is your pride and joy?

50
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.303
It's light as well as steady

51
00:04:39.303 --> 00:04:43.003
so even a big catch is no big deal.

52
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:46.703
Please use this tonight.

53
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.803
And? What about you, Mr. Kawai?

54
00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:50.403
No need for worry.

55
00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:53.803
I brought one of the same type with me.

56
00:04:53.803 --> 00:04:55.603
Oh...

57
00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:59.103
Would you like to come along with us too, Mr. Mouri?

58
00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:03.103
Fishing, would you like to go fishing?

59
00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:07.403
But, I don't have a pole for Mr. Mouri.

60
00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:10.103
You may use the one we have here, if it's okay with you.

61
00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:13.303
We have several fishing poles here just in case, for our customers.

62
00:05:13.303 --> 00:05:16.103
You're really service minded, how thoughtful.

63
00:05:16.103 --> 00:05:20.103
Mr. Mouri, are you interested in fishing?

64
00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:22.303
Fishing...

65
00:05:22.303 --> 00:05:24.103
No thanks.

66
00:05:24.103 --> 00:05:27.303
I guess beer is better for me!

67
00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:36.303
Hello, we're almost there!

68
00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:37.803
The scenic point for watching fireworks

69
00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:40.203
is also a great spot for fishing!

70
00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:47.703
Just the other day, a super large sea bream was caught here.

71
00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:50.803
The tides are good today

72
00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:54.403
so I'm sure you'll get a good catch.

73
00:05:54.403 --> 00:05:56.403
It makes me so excited!

74
00:06:01.503 --> 00:06:04.703
I wish you both the best of luck.

75
00:06:04.703 --> 00:06:08.703
Yeah, I'll get a big one for sure!

76
00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:11.403
The same here.

77
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.003
Wow!

78
00:06:20.003 --> 00:06:21.603
It's so pretty.

79
00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:23.803
Tamaya!

80
00:06:23.803 --> 00:06:25.403
Are you enjoying yourselves?

81
00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:30.103
Yes, watching fireworks in autumn is quite fascinating too.

82
00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:31.303
Here, have some more.

83
00:06:31.303 --> 00:06:33.303
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:38.203
Sayori, will you please bring us more beer?

85
00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:39.303
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:39.303 --> 00:06:40.903
Bring some for Mr. Kawai and his guest too.

87
00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:42.203
Yes, sir.

88
00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:22.003
What was that?

89
00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:23.403
What seems to be the matter?

90
00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:25.603
That...

91
00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:40.803
Mr. Kawai, please get a hold of yourself! Mr. Kawai!

92
00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:43.603
Where's Mr. Yamazaki?

93
00:07:44.503 --> 00:07:46.103
Are you okay, mister?

94
00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:47.803
Don't touch!

95
00:07:47.803 --> 00:07:49.203
Stay out of the way!

96
00:07:53.503 --> 00:07:56.203
No good, he's already dead.

97
00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:59.403
He's got burns on the palm of his hand.

98
00:08:01.103 --> 00:08:02.103
This is...

99
00:08:04.203 --> 00:08:07.603
The lights on the ship went out a while ago.

100
00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:08.603
Yeah.

101
00:08:11.503 --> 00:08:15.703
He said this fishing pole is made of carbon.

102
00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:20.703
Just as I thought!

103
00:08:20.703 --> 00:08:23.903
This part of the electrical lighting is exposed!

104
00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.303
Which means...

105
00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:26.403
Right.

106
00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:29.103
Mr. Yamazaki was holding a carbon type fishing pole

107
00:08:29.103 --> 00:08:32.403
that conducts electricity.

108
00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:38.303
His feet is soaked with the seawater that was in the bucket.

109
00:08:38.303 --> 00:08:43.403
Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole probably accidentally touched

110
00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:45.603
the part of the electrical wiring that was exposed

111
00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:47.103
while he was fishing.

112
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:49.703
Therefore, he was electrocuted.

113
00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:52.903
That accounts for the burn on the palm of his hand.

114
00:08:52.903 --> 00:08:58.403
Mr. Kawai probably collapsed when he tried to help Mr. Yamazaki.

115
00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:02.003
Please call the ambulance and the police, Sayori.

116
00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:03.303
Yes, sir!

117
00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:06.203
Captain, please take the boat back to the harbour.

118
00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:07.503
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:21.703
And, what is the cause of his death?

120
00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:25.503
We can't really say until the coroner finishes the autopsy, but...

121
00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:27.803
According to the paramedics,

122
00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:33.603
the victim's heart seems to have stopped instantaneously

123
00:09:33.603 --> 00:09:38.603
due to intense electrical shock.

124
00:09:38.603 --> 00:09:40.503
Just as I thought.

125
00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:47.203
But why did Mr. Yamazaki's fishing pole touch the electrical wiring?

126
00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:51.103
There were practically no waves today and it was quiet,

127
00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:53.603
so the boat didn't sway as much either, did it?

128
00:09:53.603 --> 00:09:56.103
That's true.

129
00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:58.803
Mr. Kawai, can you tell us what happened?

130
00:09:58.803 --> 00:09:59.903
Yes.

131
00:09:59.903 --> 00:10:04.803
Well, the thing is... I happened to get a big bite on my pole.

132
00:10:06.703 --> 00:10:11.003
It was so big that I couldn't handle it alone, so...

133
00:10:11.003 --> 00:10:13.703
I asked Mr. Yamazaki to help me.

134
00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:19.203
We were pulling the pole together when suddenly...

135
00:10:21.503 --> 00:10:22.903
The line cut

136
00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:26.803
and we fell backwards holding the fishing pole.

137
00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:30.703
Then, everything went black...

138
00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:35.603
It's as if I had murdered Mr. Yamazaki.

139
00:10:35.603 --> 00:10:39.103
If only I didn't ask Mr. Yamazaki to help me,

140
00:10:39.103 --> 00:10:41.403
this wouldn't have happened!

141
00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:43.903
Please calm down.

142
00:10:43.903 --> 00:10:46.403
It was an accident.

143
00:10:46.403 --> 00:10:48.703
It's not your fault, Mr. Kawai.

144
00:10:48.703 --> 00:10:54.103
About Mr. Kawai's testimony just now, when this case took place...

145
00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:57.003
-Accident! -Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:10:57.003 --> 00:11:03.303
The captain of a boat that was sailing nearby also witnessed the scene.

147
00:11:03.903 --> 00:11:05.503
Yes, I saw it.

148
00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:10.203
It looked as if they were both trying to pull up a fish.

149
00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:13.103
I think it was just when they were about to pull the fish up.

150
00:11:13.103 --> 00:11:15.103
It seems the fishing line was so close to the rim of the boat

151
00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:18.003
that it was virtually rubbing against it.

152
00:11:18.003 --> 00:11:22.603
Then, the fishing line suddenly broke off and they both fell.

153
00:11:24.503 --> 00:11:26.803
We sailed pass them right after that,

154
00:11:26.803 --> 00:11:30.103
so I don't know what happened later.

155
00:11:30.903 --> 00:11:33.003
This was what he saw.

156
00:11:33.003 --> 00:11:35.803
See! So, it was an accident after all.

157
00:11:35.803 --> 00:11:38.303
You even got a witness.

158
00:11:40.503 --> 00:11:43.403
But both of them got electrocuted,

159
00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:46.503
and why was only Mr. Kawai okay?

160
00:11:46.503 --> 00:11:49.603
Mr. Yamazaki had a weak heart to begin with

161
00:11:49.603 --> 00:11:52.703
so he was going to the hospital on a regular basis.

162
00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:55.403
Come to think of it, he was also taking medication.

163
00:11:55.403 --> 00:11:59.403
I was just lucky.

164
00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:03.303
By the way, Mr. Unabara,

165
00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:06.503
was that electric wiring always exposed like that?

166
00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:10.203
I always check the entire boat before sailing off,

167
00:12:10.203 --> 00:12:12.803
but I didn't notice any abnormalities at that time.

168
00:12:12.803 --> 00:12:16.503
I also checked, so there's no mistake about it.

169
00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.603
A part of the vinyl covering of the electrical wiring

170
00:12:19.603 --> 00:12:22.303
was probably deteriorated

171
00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:24.403
and when the fishing pole touched it,

172
00:12:24.403 --> 00:12:27.203
it completely peeled off.

173
00:12:28.803 --> 00:12:31.303
So it was an accident after all.

174
00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:33.403
But, if so,

175
00:12:33.403 --> 00:12:35.803
the responsibility of this accident will fall upon

176
00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:39.003
Captain Unabara, who left the electrical wiring

177
00:12:39.003 --> 00:12:41.703
in such a dangerous condition.

178
00:12:41.703 --> 00:12:43.003
Oh, no!

179
00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:46.003
Oh, I'm sorry.

180
00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:49.503
I was just mentioning a possibility.

181
00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:57.703
I'm sorry. Will you all please explain things in a little more detail?

182
00:12:57.703 --> 00:12:59.103
Of course.

183
00:12:59.103 --> 00:13:01.103
-Sure. -Thank you.

184
00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:03.003
Shall we start then?

185
00:13:21.303 --> 00:13:22.403
This is...

186
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:50.203
What's this?

187
00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:52.703
The vinyl is melted as if it's been burnt.

188
00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:58.003
Strange...

189
00:13:58.603 --> 00:14:01.603
Drops of the melted vinyl should be somewhere.

190
00:14:01.603 --> 00:14:04.803
Yet, there's none...

191
00:14:04.803 --> 00:14:06.103
I get it.

192
00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:08.003
That's why he...

193
00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:09.603
I've figured it out.

194
00:14:09.603 --> 00:14:12.603
This is not an accident...

195
00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:14.603
but homicide!

196
00:14:25.454 --> 00:14:28.154
All right then, Mr. Unabara, Mr. Kawai.

197
00:14:28.154 --> 00:14:31.754
I'd like to submit a formal report of the accident,

198
00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:32.954
so although I know it's inconvenient for you,

199
00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:34.954
please come with me to the station.

200
00:14:34.954 --> 00:14:36.354
Yes, sir.

201
00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:41.154
As to the rest of you here, you may go for tonight.

202
00:14:41.154 --> 00:14:44.054
Conan's not here.

203
00:14:44.054 --> 00:14:47.054
I tell you, going here, there and everywhere all the time.

204
00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:49.654
I'm here.

205
00:14:49.654 --> 00:14:51.754
Just what were you doing?

206
00:14:51.754 --> 00:14:52.854
We're going home.

207
00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:56.254
Wait, I got to go to the restroom.

208
00:14:59.854 --> 00:15:01.554
Oh boy...

209
00:15:08.454 --> 00:15:10.954
Please wait, everyone!

210
00:15:12.654 --> 00:15:16.354
This is no accident that happened coincidentally.

211
00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:21.254
But, Mr. Mouri, you just mentioned a while ago that it was an accident.

212
00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:25.354
Yes, but there is something that's bothering me.

213
00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:28.654
Mr. Unabara, can you show everyone

214
00:15:28.654 --> 00:15:31.254
the tip of the fish line that is cut, that Mr. Kawai was using?

215
00:15:31.254 --> 00:15:32.254
Yes.

216
00:15:33.054 --> 00:15:37.754
Mr. Unabara, what do you think, seeing that cut line?

217
00:15:37.754 --> 00:15:40.054
What do I think?

218
00:15:40.054 --> 00:15:44.354
Huh? Strange, this doesn't look to have been pulled apart.

219
00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:47.254
It looks as if it's been cut by a knife or something.

220
00:15:47.254 --> 00:15:48.954
Really?

221
00:15:48.954 --> 00:15:51.354
-Officer. -Yes?

222
00:15:51.354 --> 00:15:54.754
Please check the brim of the left shipboard.

223
00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:58.254
The blade of a cutter knife is embedded.

224
00:15:58.254 --> 00:16:03.054
And, a fish hook is hooked on the body of the ship underneath it.

225
00:16:03.054 --> 00:16:05.254
Okay.

226
00:16:05.254 --> 00:16:06.854
I'll go along too.

227
00:16:13.054 --> 00:16:15.854
There it is! It's the blade of a cutter!

228
00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:18.754
Officer!

229
00:16:18.754 --> 00:16:20.354
See, over there!

230
00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.654
A fish line.

231
00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:27.054
Mr. Mouri! It's exactly as you said.

232
00:16:27.054 --> 00:16:29.754
The blade of the cutter and fish hook are still here.

233
00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:34.454
When I cleaned the ship before departing, they weren't there.

234
00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:36.854
Sure they weren't,

235
00:16:36.854 --> 00:16:40.054
because Mr. Kawai set it up after sailing out to the sea,

236
00:16:40.054 --> 00:16:43.454
in order to kill Mr. Yamazaki.

237
00:16:44.354 --> 00:16:46.854
What a thing to say, Mr. Mouri?

238
00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:51.154
When just Mr. Yamazaki and you were the only ones on deck,

239
00:16:51.954 --> 00:16:54.154
you embedded the blade of the cutter into the brim of the ship,

240
00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:56.454
when Mr. Yamazaki's eyes weren't on you.

241
00:16:56.454 --> 00:17:00.354
As well as, hook your fish hook onto the body of the ship.

242
00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:02.754
Then, you pretended to have caught a big one,

243
00:17:02.754 --> 00:17:05.754
and urged Mr. Yamazaki to help you.

244
00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:08.654
When Mr. Yamazaki grabs your fishing pole,

245
00:17:08.654 --> 00:17:11.454
the blade inserted in the brim of the ship cuts the line.

246
00:17:13.354 --> 00:17:15.954
Finally, you pushed Mr. Yamazaki down

247
00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:18.654
so that the fishing pole would touch the electrical wiring.

248
00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:21.354
Don't be ridiculous!

249
00:17:21.354 --> 00:17:23.854
I was electrocuted too, you know!

250
00:17:23.854 --> 00:17:27.754
I was almost killed myself too!

251
00:17:27.754 --> 00:17:29.554
Yes,

252
00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:35.054
if you were bare-handed and bare-footed like Mr. Yamazaki.

253
00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.554
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

254
00:17:37.554 --> 00:17:42.554
Mr. Kawai, will you show me what's in your pocket?

255
00:17:42.554 --> 00:17:44.654
I really don't have anything inside.

256
00:17:44.654 --> 00:17:47.154
Mr. Kawai, will you please show us what's inside?

257
00:17:47.154 --> 00:17:48.554
What is it?

258
00:17:48.554 --> 00:17:49.854
I...

259
00:17:49.854 --> 00:17:51.754
Please!

260
00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:55.754
Mr. Kawai...

261
00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:01.054
A flesh coloured rubber glove?

262
00:18:01.054 --> 00:18:02.754
Mr. Kawai.

263
00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:07.054
That's a pretty odd glove to be using for fishing, isn't it?

264
00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:10.454
It's up to me what kind of a glove I want to use, isn't it?

265
00:18:10.454 --> 00:18:14.654
Besides, this just so happened to be in my pocket.

266
00:18:14.654 --> 00:18:18.154
I was bare-handed when that accident occurred.

267
00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:23.654
Or is it that somebody saw me wearing gloves?

268
00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:25.854
The same goes for the blade of the cutter.

269
00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.954
I'll bet you don't have proof that I did it!!

270
00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:32.454
It was just a mere coincidental accident that Yamazaki died!

271
00:18:32.454 --> 00:18:36.154
No, it wasn't an accident.

272
00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:39.354
I'm sure you had an intention to kill him!

273
00:18:39.354 --> 00:18:40.954
What?

274
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.454
Think about it.

275
00:18:43.454 --> 00:18:47.654
When you pull a fish line that almost rubs against the brim of the ship,

276
00:18:47.654 --> 00:18:52.054
you'd have to pull it vertically against the brim.

277
00:18:52.054 --> 00:18:54.454
If the fish line was suddenly cut,

278
00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:58.154
they would've fallen perpendicular to the brim of the ship.

279
00:18:58.154 --> 00:19:01.654
But in order for the fishing pole to touch the electrical wiring,

280
00:19:01.654 --> 00:19:05.254
they would have to fall horizontally to the brim of the ship.

281
00:19:05.254 --> 00:19:08.454
In other words, the moment the fish line was cut,

282
00:19:08.454 --> 00:19:13.254
you pushed Mr. Yamazaki horizontally against the brim of the ship.

283
00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:16.054
You did so to make the fishing pole

284
00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:19.354
touch the exposed electrical wiring

285
00:19:19.354 --> 00:19:21.154
with the intention to kill him.

286
00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:22.854
Don't be ridiculous!

287
00:19:22.854 --> 00:19:25.854
You're only letting your imagination run wild!

288
00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:30.454
How can you be so sure that I pushed Mr. Yamazaki down?

289
00:19:30.454 --> 00:19:32.454
How rude can you get?

290
00:19:32.454 --> 00:19:36.454
Please present more undeniable evidence!

291
00:19:36.454 --> 00:19:38.754
I have evidence.

292
00:19:39.654 --> 00:19:43.954
Will somebody light Mr. Kawai's lighter?

293
00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:50.554
No good. It doesn't work.

294
00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:51.754
Mr. Kawai,

295
00:19:51.754 --> 00:19:55.954
you lit your cigarette with that lighter before we departed, didn't you?

296
00:20:01.354 --> 00:20:05.154
Why won't it light now?

297
00:20:05.154 --> 00:20:07.754
There seems to be

298
00:20:07.754 --> 00:20:10.954
what looks to be the burnt remains on the wick of the lighter.

299
00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:16.954
That adhered when he burnt the coating of the electrical wiring.

300
00:20:16.954 --> 00:20:21.154
Mr. Kawai used the lighter to melt the coating of the electrical wiring

301
00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:24.554
in order to expose the electrical wiring on the inside.

302
00:20:24.554 --> 00:20:26.854
He then, probably wore the robber boots

303
00:20:26.854 --> 00:20:28.654
that were lying around on the floor of the deck,

304
00:20:28.654 --> 00:20:30.854
and after wearing the flesh coloured rubber gloves on his hands

305
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.654
and insulating himself...

306
00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:37.854
He electrocuted Mr. Yamazki and killed him.

307
00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:41.954
He then removed the boots,

308
00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:44.754
lying down,

309
00:20:44.754 --> 00:20:46.954
and hid the rubber gloves in his pocket,

310
00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:50.154
and pretended to be passed out.

311
00:20:50.154 --> 00:20:54.854
How about it, Mr. Kawai, am I wrong somewhere?

312
00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:03.854
Yamazaki...

313
00:21:03.854 --> 00:21:06.054
Yamazaki tried to take over my company

314
00:21:06.054 --> 00:21:09.854
by lending money at an unreasonably high amount of interest.

315
00:21:09.854 --> 00:21:14.054
Not only that. As collateral for the money he lent me,

316
00:21:14.054 --> 00:21:16.954
he insisted that I get myself an expensive life insurance policy

317
00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:20.354
with him as the beneficiary.

318
00:21:21.654 --> 00:21:27.554
If I didn't kill him, he would've killed me one day anyway.

319
00:21:27.554 --> 00:21:29.154
Someday...

320
00:23:01.354 --> 00:23:02.554
Mr. Mouri.

321
00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:06.054
Thank you so much the other day.

322
00:23:06.054 --> 00:23:09.154
If that incident was closed as an accidental case,

323
00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.254
I would've had to take responsibility for negligence of duty

324
00:23:11.254 --> 00:23:13.954
and close down my business.

325
00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:16.854
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

326
00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:18.854
If the investigation was carried out only on the surface,

327
00:23:18.854 --> 00:23:20.954
the case couldn't have been genuinely solved at all.

328
00:23:20.954 --> 00:23:24.454
Just as expected of the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

329
00:23:24.454 --> 00:23:29.854
Absolutely! There is no case that I cannot solve!

330
00:23:32.054 --> 00:23:35.654
Come on, Dad. You were probably just in good shape.

331
00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:37.454
Yeah, as for being in good shape,

332
00:23:37.454 --> 00:23:39.854
you're sure doing just as good as those fireworks up there.

333
00:23:44.654 --> 00:23:48.254
Tamaya!

334
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:53.854
Eri is to blame for taking on a case like this.

335
00:23:53.854 --> 00:23:56.754
The defendant has a motive for killing the victim,

336
00:23:56.754 --> 00:23:59.554
and moreover, his fingerprints were detected super clearly

337
00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:00.954
on the dial of the safe.

338
00:24:00.954 --> 00:24:04.454
How the heck does she expect to defend somebody like that?

339
00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:06.654
Just as I thought!

340
00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:12.054
I can't see Pops from here at all because the partition is in the way!

341
00:24:12.054 --> 00:24:13.354
What?

342
00:24:13.754 --> 00:24:15.154
Next Conan,

343
00:24:15.154 --> 00:24:19.454
"Court Battle 2: Kisaki vs Kujo (Part 1)"

344
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:22.281
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:24.381
"Decorative clock"

346
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:27.281
-In the next episode... -Here comes the gorgeous Prosecutor Kujo!

347
00:24:27.281 --> 00:24:29.218
She's mom's opponent, right?
