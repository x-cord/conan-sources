1
00:00:01.624 --> 00:00:03.324
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03.324 --> 00:00:05.324
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:07.024
The confrontation of this couple.

4
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:09.124
What's going to happen in the court?

5
00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:10.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:12.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:14.524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:01.337
"The Tokyo District Court"

9
00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:03.737
Thank you so much for everything.

10
00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:06.137
It's all thanks to you.

11
00:02:06.137 --> 00:02:08.337
No, it's nothing. No problem.

12
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.237
Mr. Okada.

13
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:12.237
I'm sure that many things may come up from now too,

14
00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:13.437
but hang in there, okay?

15
00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:14.537
I will.

16
00:02:14.537 --> 00:02:16.237
Terumitsu, it's time we go now.

17
00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.937
I guess so. Goodbye then.

18
00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:21.037
Goodbye. Take care.

19
00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:25.537
Mother.

20
00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:27.237
Did you win the case again, mother?

21
00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:30.837
I'm not the one who won, he did.

22
00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:33.137
All I did was help him out.

23
00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:34.437
I'm sorry, Ran.

24
00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:35.937
You waited quite a while, didn't you?

25
00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:37.237
Quite a bit.

26
00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:39.037
So, Conan suggested that

27
00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:40.637
we'll have you take us to a great meal.

28
00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:41.837
Hey!

29
00:02:41.837 --> 00:02:42.937
The thing is

30
00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:45.037
I've got some sudden business to attend to from now.

31
00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:46.937
-What? -I'm sorry.

32
00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.237
I promise I'll make it up to you.

33
00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:52.437
Ms. Kisaki, the car's ready for you outside.

34
00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.737
Thank you. Oh, right! Ms. Kuriyama.

35
00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.137
Would you please take Ran and Conan

36
00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.537
to eat something good after this?

37
00:02:57.537 --> 00:03:00.537
Oh, Ms. Kisaki.

38
00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:02.337
Ms. Kujo.

39
00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:03.837
I heard that

40
00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:06.637
you decided to serve as attorney for Shinji Usami

41
00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:11.037
Yes. I was planning on going to see you in the near future.

42
00:03:11.037 --> 00:03:14.637
Ms. Kuriyama, who is she?

43
00:03:14.637 --> 00:03:20.637
She is Reiko Kujo, ace Madonna of the Tokyo prosecutors squad.

44
00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:22.137
She is in charge of the case

45
00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:23.537
that Ms. Kisaki is handling now.

46
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.137
I see.

47
00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:28.737
So, she's the famous Madonna of the prosecutor's squad.

48
00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:30.937
I'm really looking forward

49
00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:33.737
to meeting you in court, Ms. Kisaki.

50
00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:35.937
Take it easy on me, okay?

51
00:03:35.937 --> 00:03:39.337
You took the words right out of my mouth. Same to you.

52
00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:41.237
Let's both give it our best shot.

53
00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:43.337
Goodbye, then.

54
00:03:46.737 --> 00:03:50.337
It seems that she's won a succession of cases again.

55
00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:51.537
I see.

56
00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:55.337
That's all about to end now.

57
00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:58.637
I'm going to teach her how failure tastes.

58
00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:06.537
"Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 1)"

59
00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:11.937
I tell you that mother of mine,

60
00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:14.537
all she ever has in mind is work.

61
00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:16.037
Ms. Kuriyama.

62
00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:19.537
What kind of case did Ran's mother take on?

63
00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:20.937
Huh?

64
00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:22.537
Do you remember the case about a month ago,

65
00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:24.737
where a corpse of a man was found

66
00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:28.337
at a construction site in Haido-cho?

67
00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:33.937
The victim was an office worker called Tsuyoshi Hirasawa.

68
00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:36.937
It was found that he was hit on the head with a steel pipe

69
00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:39.837
that was found at the site and died.

70
00:04:39.837 --> 00:04:43.337
And a suspect emerged from a car key

71
00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:45.637
that was found at the site.

72
00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:52.237
And he's the one that Ms. Kisaki will be defending this time.

73
00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:56.537
And, what does the prosecutor think his motive is?

74
00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:58.437
Well, the thing is,

75
00:04:58.437 --> 00:05:02.237
three years ago, the victim, Mr. Hirasawa, who was drunk

76
00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:06.237
accidentally pushed Mr. Usami child off the stairs.

77
00:05:07.237 --> 00:05:10.537
The boy, Masaki, hit his head hard

78
00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:12.637
and died because of the incident.

79
00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:15.537
How terrible.

80
00:05:16.637 --> 00:05:19.137
Hirasawa was most naturally charge

81
00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:20.637
for involuntary manslaughter

82
00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:24.137
but at the time of the incident, being that he was drunk,

83
00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:26.837
a suspended sentence was passed.

84
00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:29.537
That's absurd!

85
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:33.537
He killed a person and he doesn't have to go to jail?

86
00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:35.037
Give me back Masaki!

87
00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:37.637
Give me back my Masaki!

88
00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:43.737
The prosecutors think that Usami killed Mr. Hirasawa

89
00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:46.537
in order to avenge the death of his son.

90
00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:50.237
I kind of feel sorry for him.

91
00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:53.337
And, what is Mr. Usami saying to this?

92
00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:57.737
Well, he says he doesn't remember because he was drunk.

93
00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:04.637
"Tokyo Prison"

94
00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.637
You look well.

95
00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:14.537
Please sit down.

96
00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:20.537
Well, have your remembered anything since then?

97
00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:21.937
"Shinji Usami"

98
00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:24.537
No, nothing.

99
00:06:24.537 --> 00:06:28.837
Okay, then let me start from the beginning and ask you again.

100
00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:33.437
On the day of the incident at around 20:30,

101
00:06:33.437 --> 00:06:34.637
you got into an argument with the victim

102
00:06:34.637 --> 00:06:35.937
at a Japanese pub called "Yamazen".

103
00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.737
I coincidentally ran into him that day

104
00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:41.837
and got into an argument about the past.

105
00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:43.937
The problem is after that.

106
00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.737
The estimated time of murder of the victim

107
00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:49.337
at the construction site is between 21:30 to 22:00.

108
00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:54.437
The point is where and what you were doing during that time.

109
00:06:56.937 --> 00:06:59.237
I don't care how trivial,

110
00:06:59.237 --> 00:07:01.637
if you remember anything, I'd like you to tell me about it.

111
00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:09.837
By the way, about your wife,

112
00:07:09.837 --> 00:07:10.837
I can't get a hold of her

113
00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:12.737
no matter how many times I try calling her.

114
00:07:12.737 --> 00:07:14.637
She has nothing to do with this!

115
00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:15.937
Why not?

116
00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:19.837
Even if you're divorced, she's your ex-wife.

117
00:07:19.837 --> 00:07:22.737
I'm sure she's worried about you.

118
00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:25.437
She hates me.

119
00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:28.137
She doesn't give a darn what happens to me.

120
00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:33.437
"Business Association Haido Yokocho"

121
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.037
Ms. Kisaki.

122
00:07:44.037 --> 00:07:45.937
Ms. Kuriyama.

123
00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:47.837
Well? Find anything?

124
00:07:47.837 --> 00:07:49.837
According to the police,

125
00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:52.337
it should be somewhere around here.

126
00:07:53.537 --> 00:07:55.437
Mother, over here!

127
00:07:55.437 --> 00:07:57.537
Ran? What brings you here?

128
00:07:57.537 --> 00:07:58.937
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:02.337
She insisted on coming along and search together with Conan.

130
00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:03.837
What?

131
00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:07.937
You shouldn't be in a place like this,

132
00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:10.137
at this hour of the day.

133
00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:13.437
Isn't this the shop you're looking for?

134
00:08:14.837 --> 00:08:18.437
Is this the shop of the victim's wife?

135
00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:21.537
Mimasu, written "beautiful seat",

136
00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:23.437
this is the place!

137
00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:26.137
What an unusual name.

138
00:08:26.137 --> 00:08:30.937
"Masako Kameda"

139
00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:42.037
I've already forgotten all about him.

140
00:08:42.037 --> 00:08:46.937
I've heard of why you got a divorce.

141
00:08:46.937 --> 00:08:48.337
But, Ms. Kameda...

142
00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:50.737
"It's your fault that Masaki died."

143
00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:53.637
"Why didn't you die instead of him?"

144
00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:57.237
Every time he got drunk, he would repeat saying so.

145
00:08:58.737 --> 00:09:01.237
I understand how you feel.

146
00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:05.237
However, your husband is in a very tough situation now.

147
00:09:05.237 --> 00:09:09.037
Please cooperate with us to help him and talk to us.

148
00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:13.637
I don't want to recall a thing about him.

149
00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:18.137
The construction site where the incident took place

150
00:09:18.137 --> 00:09:21.337
is near here, isn't it?

151
00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:23.137
If there is something that you knew

152
00:09:23.137 --> 00:09:25.137
about the night the incident happened...

153
00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:27.537
I know nothing.

154
00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:30.537
If that's all you want to talk about, please leave.

155
00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:35.637
Welcome!

156
00:09:36.737 --> 00:09:38.437
Huh?

157
00:09:39.737 --> 00:09:41.337
Dad!

158
00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:43.937
What are you guys doing in a place like this?

159
00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:45.937
Talk for yourself.

160
00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:49.937
I just came to take a light shot like always.

161
00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:54.237
Do you know them?

162
00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:57.337
Well, you see...

163
00:09:57.337 --> 00:09:58.637
I'll come again some other time!

164
00:10:00.937 --> 00:10:02.937
Does he come here often?

165
00:10:02.937 --> 00:10:06.937
Yes. Mr. Mouri comes here frequently.

166
00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:09.937
Come to think of it, he was here that night, too.

167
00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:11.137
Huh?

168
00:10:13.137 --> 00:10:16.537
That night? Are you referring to the night of the incident?

169
00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:22.337
Do you know something about that incident?

170
00:10:25.037 --> 00:10:27.937
That night, my husband...

171
00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:30.237
Usami came here.

172
00:10:30.237 --> 00:10:32.737
Mr. Usami came to this shop?

173
00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:33.937
Yes.

174
00:10:35.837 --> 00:10:38.837
You're sure that it was the night the incident happened?

175
00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:44.437
That night was the only night that Usami ever came here.

176
00:10:44.437 --> 00:10:45.837
Ms. Kisaki.

177
00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:51.837
Do you remember what time Mr. Usami came here?

178
00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.437
No, I don't.

179
00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:58.037
But Mr. Mouri may remember.

180
00:10:58.037 --> 00:11:00.237
Huh? You mean, him?

181
00:11:00.237 --> 00:11:02.937
Thank you so much for remembering.

182
00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:08.337
It's not that I tried to remember for Usami's sake.

183
00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:12.837
I'm finally starting to see some light here.

184
00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:25.245
"Mouri Detective Agency"

185
00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:30.845
-I'm home! -Dad!

186
00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:34.245
What is it, Ran?

187
00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:35.545
You're still up?

188
00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:38.445
Where were you drinking at this late at night?

189
00:11:38.445 --> 00:11:39.945
It's none of your business.

190
00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:42.245
Gosh, you're really starting to act like Eri now days.

191
00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:43.345
If you've got gripes,

192
00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:45.045
why don't you tell her directly yourself?

193
00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:51.445
You haven't changed at all.

194
00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:53.445
It's none of your business!

195
00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:56.545
You smell like alcohol!

196
00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:00.845
Here goes poison gas light beam attack!

197
00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:04.545
-Cut it out! -What a kid.

198
00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:08.245
Never mind, I've got something I want to ask you.

199
00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:12.745
My bust, waist and hip sizes are a secret.

200
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.545
Do you remember that murder case

201
00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:18.545
that occurred at the construction site at Haido-cho?

202
00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:20.445
Come to think of it, yeah.

203
00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:24.745
You were at the pub called Mimasu that night, weren't you?

204
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.845
I don't remember every little detail like that.

205
00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:31.745
Here, drink some coffee and clear your head.

206
00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:35.845
I'm sober now that I've seen her face!

207
00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:37.545
That's just great.

208
00:12:39.445 --> 00:12:41.645
Do you remember him?

209
00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:48.745
I've seen this guy. I'm sure at Mimasu.

210
00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:51.745
Will you tell me the details?

211
00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:54.545
Well...

212
00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:57.945
I fell asleep after getting drunk at Mimasu.

213
00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.745
Mr. Mouri, you have a phone call.

214
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:04.045
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:08.345
Hello? Mouri here.

216
00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:11.845
Hello?

217
00:13:11.845 --> 00:13:14.945
I can't hear too well in the shop.

218
00:13:19.945 --> 00:13:23.145
No doubt about it. He's the guy I saw back then.

219
00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:24.345
Are you sure?

220
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:27.045
What's this? You don't believe me?

221
00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:29.145
That's not what I'm saying.

222
00:13:29.145 --> 00:13:31.845
Pops, you just took a glimpse of him

223
00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.845
and you remember him that clearly?

224
00:13:34.845 --> 00:13:38.645
A renown detective does not forget a face he once sees!

225
00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:41.945
What I'd like to say,

226
00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:43.545
but when I finished taking the phone call

227
00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:46.845
and returned to the shop, he was sitting at the counter.

228
00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:50.445
Gosh.

229
00:13:57.845 --> 00:13:59.945
Are you done with your call?

230
00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:03.445
Well, it seems to have been a wrong number call.

231
00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:06.545
He doesn't look familiar.

232
00:14:07.845 --> 00:14:09.745
He's an old acquaintance.

233
00:14:17.945 --> 00:14:20.345
Well, I guess I better be going.

234
00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:25.145
Come on, why don't you take it easy a while longer, Mr. Mouri?

235
00:14:26.045 --> 00:14:28.545
Here, this drink is on the house.

236
00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:29.845
On the house?

237
00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:31.745
Okay.

238
00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:34.345
I guess I'll take another shot, then!

239
00:14:36.445 --> 00:14:39.945
He went home after about 30 minutes

240
00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:42.145
when I left the shop after him,

241
00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:43.245
there were a lot of police cars

242
00:14:43.245 --> 00:14:44.645
and the vicinity was boisterous.

243
00:14:44.645 --> 00:14:48.445
Something about a murder at a nearby construction site.

244
00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:50.345
Do you remember about

245
00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:53.645
what time that person came to the shop?

246
00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:55.345
21:25.

247
00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:59.445
Huh? How can you be so sure?

248
00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:02.745
I just told you. I'm a renown detective.

249
00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.745
You looked at the time on your cell phone, right?

250
00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:07.345
Shut up!

251
00:15:08.645 --> 00:15:12.145
What time was Mr. Hirasawa killed?

252
00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:13.845
His estimated time of death

253
00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:16.745
is assumed to be between 21:30 and 22:00.

254
00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:20.645
So, if Mr. Usami came to the shop at 21:25,

255
00:15:20.645 --> 00:15:22.545
he has an alibi.

256
00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:23.945
Right.

257
00:15:23.945 --> 00:15:27.245
That's only if we can count on what Kogoro is telling us.

258
00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:30.145
What's this? Are you doubting what I'm saying?

259
00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:31.545
Of course!

260
00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:34.045
You were drinking at that time, weren't you?

261
00:15:34.045 --> 00:15:35.445
How dare you!

262
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.945
I'm back.

263
00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.845
Welcome back, mom.

264
00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:50.745
You've both come here, I see.

265
00:15:50.745 --> 00:15:54.245
-Hello, Ms. Kisaki. -Hello, Conan.

266
00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.845
I was going to bring dad here too,

267
00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.145
but he ran away.

268
00:15:58.145 --> 00:15:59.545
Is that so?

269
00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:05.345
Ms. Kisaki. Did the defendant remember

270
00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.545
that he went to his wife's shop?

271
00:16:07.545 --> 00:16:09.545
All he keeps on saying is

272
00:16:09.545 --> 00:16:12.045
that he doesn't remember anything after having left the shop.

273
00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:14.145
Which means that there is no way

274
00:16:14.145 --> 00:16:16.245
to make up for the time he lost.

275
00:16:16.245 --> 00:16:18.045
The time he lost?

276
00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:19.945
After looking at the time schedule of this case,

277
00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:23.045
Conan is making weird remarks.

278
00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:27.245
Mr. Usami left the pub together with Mr. Hirasawa

279
00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:28.845
at around 20:30, right?

280
00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:34.445
And Pops saw Mr. Usami at Mimasu at 21:25.

281
00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:36.745
It takes roughly 15 minutes

282
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:38.445
to go from the pub to Mimasu.

283
00:16:38.445 --> 00:16:42.245
Therefore, he'll get to Mimasu at around 20:45.

284
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:44.445
I see.

285
00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:47.845
So, 40 minutes is unaccounted for...

286
00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:48.945
I was just wondering what he would want to do

287
00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:50.545
for 40 minutes with a person

288
00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:53.645
that he hates to the point of wanting to murder him.

289
00:16:55.945 --> 00:16:59.645
And it's about Mr. Mouri...

290
00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:03.945
No need to worry about him.

291
00:17:05.845 --> 00:17:07.445
He won't do something as stupid

292
00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:10.345
as to deny the testimony just to stand against me.

293
00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:22.245
The victim was at his ex-wife's shop?

294
00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:23.445
Yes.

295
00:17:23.445 --> 00:17:25.645
It seems that he had an alibi for the day of the incident

296
00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:28.945
and his attorney is looking for witnesses to prove this.

297
00:17:30.245 --> 00:17:33.145
Even if his attorney were to insist on his alibi,

298
00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:36.745
if the witness is his ex-wife, it'll lack credibility.

299
00:17:36.745 --> 00:17:41.045
But Kogoro Mouri is also on their list of witnesses.

300
00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:46.245
Something about he having run into the defendant,

301
00:17:46.245 --> 00:17:47.845
who appeared at his ex-wife's shop.

302
00:17:47.845 --> 00:17:50.545
Oh, I see.

303
00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:57.445
If I'm not mistaken,

304
00:17:57.445 --> 00:17:59.745
Kogoro Mouri is Attorney Kisaki's husband, isn't he?

305
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.445
Yes, although they're not living with each other now.

306
00:18:03.945 --> 00:18:06.645
This is getting to be quite interesting.

307
00:18:09.345 --> 00:18:11.145
Dad.

308
00:18:11.145 --> 00:18:15.045
Make sure you testify for mom's sake, okay?

309
00:18:15.045 --> 00:18:16.945
Like I've been telling you,

310
00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:18.945
if she comes and begs me to do it for her,

311
00:18:18.945 --> 00:18:21.045
I'll do what need be.

312
00:18:21.045 --> 00:18:22.845
-Dad! -Oh, boy.

313
00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:24.345
Here, have some oden.

314
00:18:24.345 --> 00:18:26.245
Thank you.

315
00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:28.845
Huh? There's octopus in here.

316
00:18:28.845 --> 00:18:31.645
That's called iidako and it seems that

317
00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:32.945
the people in the Kanto area don't usually put it in,

318
00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.145
but it's really delicious.

319
00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:35.945
Really?

320
00:18:41.045 --> 00:18:42.645
Yeah! It's really delicious!

321
00:18:42.645 --> 00:18:45.745
Kid, after you finish eating, go on home, understand?

322
00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:49.945
That's the sound off your cell phone, isn't it, dad?

323
00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:52.345
-Could you get that, Mama? -Yes, yes.

324
00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:57.645
-Here you are. -Thank you.

325
00:18:59.245 --> 00:19:02.645
Hello, who is it?

326
00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.445
Huh? You're...

327
00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:15.745
Does pops always hang his coat there?

328
00:19:15.745 --> 00:19:17.845
Right, so that it doesn't get dirty.

329
00:19:17.845 --> 00:19:20.045
So, he did so that night too.

330
00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:23.845
Wait a sec! If so...

331
00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:33.045
Hey, you guys.

332
00:19:37.545 --> 00:19:39.045
Hurry and go on home.

333
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.045
But we're not done talking yet!

334
00:19:41.045 --> 00:19:44.445
Who cares! Kids time is over,

335
00:19:44.445 --> 00:19:46.945
it's adult time!

336
00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:51.045
Hurry on and go on home!

337
00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:52.745
Dad!

338
00:19:54.045 --> 00:19:56.345
How rude.

339
00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:57.545
Huh?

340
00:19:57.545 --> 00:19:59.045
What's the matter, Conan?

341
00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:01.745
I wonder if the call he just got was from her?

342
00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:05.745
She was, if I remember correctly... the prosecutor.

343
00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:09.245
Welcome!

344
00:20:09.245 --> 00:20:11.745
I've been waiting for you!

345
00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:14.345
I wonder what she wants with dad?

346
00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:15.745
Beats me.

347
00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:27.445
We will now begin the first trial

348
00:20:27.445 --> 00:20:30.645
of defendant Shinji Usami.

349
00:20:30.645 --> 00:20:34.645
First of all, will the prosecutor please read the indictment?

350
00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:39.745
The defendant Shinji Usami,

351
00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:42.845
permanent address at Daigaku Tsubonouchi

352
00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:45.245
Shimo Kasuya-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture.

353
00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:49.245
The defendant, Shinji Usami in Heisei...

354
00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:52.345
Is this all the witness the prosecutor submitted?

355
00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:55.245
Yes. It's more or less what we expected.

356
00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:58.945
Therefore, according to Criminal code provision 199,

357
00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:01.545
we intend to file charges for homicide.

358
00:21:07.745 --> 00:21:11.045
A real trial really can get you nervous, can't it?

359
00:21:11.045 --> 00:21:13.145
Yeah.

360
00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:16.045
We will begin questioning the witness now.

361
00:21:16.045 --> 00:21:18.345
Your honor.

362
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:20.145
What is it, prosecutor?

363
00:21:21.645 --> 00:21:22.945
Before starting,

364
00:21:22.945 --> 00:21:26.145
we would like to summon a new witness from our side.

365
00:21:30.745 --> 00:21:33.245
He manages a detective agency

366
00:21:33.245 --> 00:21:36.445
and is known as the Sleeping Kogoro,

367
00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:38.545
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

368
00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:46.445
What's going on, Ms. Kisaki?

369
00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:49.245
I wonder. I don't have the slightest idea.

370
00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:52.645
How come dad's serving as witness for the prosecutor?

371
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:55.645
Just as I thought.

372
00:21:55.645 --> 00:21:58.945
Does the defense have anything to say?

373
00:21:58.945 --> 00:22:01.145
As you think proper is fine.

374
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:05.645
We shall summon Mr. Kogoro Mouri as witness then.

375
00:22:06.645 --> 00:22:08.545
What is she up to anyway

376
00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:10.545
dragging him out to a place like this?

377
00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:16.545
I will give you a gift of your first taste of failure soon.

378
00:22:20.245 --> 00:22:25.045
Madonna is aware of that, after all.

379
00:22:25.045 --> 00:22:27.845
If so, then she may just win this trial.

380
00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:30.145
Looks really bad, Ms. Kisaki.

381
00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:07.745
"Next Episode" -What does this all mean?

382
00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:08.845
Why would the prosecution

383
00:24:08.845 --> 00:24:11.145
want to prove he alibi of the defendant?

384
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:14.045
I don't know.

385
00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:16.845
I'm sure she's up to something though.

386
00:24:16.845 --> 00:24:18.645
I was surprised because he took

387
00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:20.045
the witness stand for the prosecutor,

388
00:24:20.045 --> 00:24:22.745
but dad is on mom's side after all.

389
00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:24.945
Yeah, I guess so.

390
00:24:24.945 --> 00:24:26.745
For now, that is.

391
00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:31.245
Next Conan,

392
00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:35.266
"Battle in Court, Kisaki vs. Kogoro (Part 2)"

393
00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:38.263
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:38.263 --> 00:24:40.263
"Matches"

395
00:24:40.263 --> 00:24:41.363
Next time, everything will be resolved!

396
00:24:41.363 --> 00:24:43.263
You mean between mom and dad?

397
00:24:43.263 --> 00:24:45.063
Well, this...
