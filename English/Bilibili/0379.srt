1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,240
Today's stage is an inn.

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,940
Is it a ghost or just the work of some human?

3
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,740
The outdoor bath is the key to this question.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,825
"The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 1)"

8
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:49,625
My stiff shoulders are killing me these days.

9
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,225
Our hot spring is really good for stiff shoulders.

10
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,725
Excuse me, mister. Is this tonight's desert?

11
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,525
I'm sorry. This is actually for the other guest.

12
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:08,025
She loves cake. I heard she is a famous writer or something.

13
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:09,325
I see.

14
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,325
You were going to eat it, weren't you?

15
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,825
What? No.

16
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,325
Welcome to Kotoya Hotel. We've been expecting you.

17
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:26,325
You must be cold. Now, please come in.

18
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,625
It's a beautiful kimono.

19
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,725
It's a big garden, too.

20
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,425
Hey! Isn't that Eri Akechi, the love romance writer?

21
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,325
-Dad. -That hurts!

22
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,825
Excuse me, sir. Are you the famous detective,

23
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,625
Kogoro Mouri?

24
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,825
Mouri?

25
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,025
You are Mr. Mouri, right?

26
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,825
Yes. That's me.

27
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,325
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:07,125
I never expected to see a famous person like you in a place like this.

29
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:13,025
My name is Kyoichi Bando. I'm a producer at Nichiuri TV.

30
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,325
All right.

31
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:17,025
Well, why don't we sit and talk?

32
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:23,625
Now tell me, what kind of meeting is this?

33
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,425
Actually, we are planning to make a TV series drama

34
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:30,025
together with Daigakukan Publishing and us Nichiuri TV.

35
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:35,325
So I have asked Ms. Eri Akechi over there to write the story.

36
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:41,225
The story is about three young women trying to make their dream come true.

37
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:46,125
So we've been interviewing women in different careers.

38
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,725
And this time,

39
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:51,725
I asked Yoriko to get some people from her university.

40
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,025
Now, here they are.

41
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,625
She's a famous model in Paris and the New York fashion scene.

42
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,425
Asuka Shibasaki.

43
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,425
Hello.

44
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,925
Beautiful!

45
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:08,025
And, she's an oil painter and the winner of the new face award, Ema Anzai.

46
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,325
Nice to meet you.

47
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,525
Charming!

48
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,725
And, this girl is now causing a bit of stir in the music industry.

49
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,125
The singer songwriter,

50
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,125
Ms. Harumi Fukatsu, right?

51
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,225
I'm a great fan of yours!

52
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,625
Thank you.

53
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,625
Somebody's getting pretty famous although she has only one hit song.

54
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,725
It's not going to last long.

55
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:32,425
You know, there are many one hit wonders out there.

56
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,025
Very interesting!

57
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:40,025
You've all got unique characteristics and are also beautiful!

58
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,225
This way, please.

59
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,325
There's a kimono here, too.

60
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,525
Can I ask you something?

61
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:53,425
I saw it everywhere in this hotel.

62
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,025
How come kimonos are hanging on the wall?

63
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,025
People worship the Spirit of Kimono as a guardian deity.

64
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,525
You can see those not only in this hotel,

65
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,525
but also in ordinary houses and homes.

66
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,025
It's custom.

67
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:06,425
I see. Spirit of Kimono.

68
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:11,225
I'm so excited about your new stuff, Ms. Akechi.

69
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:14,025
Oh, no. Call me Eri, please.

70
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:17,325
Actually, my mom has the same name.

71
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,425
So it feels kind of weird calling you Eri.

72
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,625
The kanji is different though.

73
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:27,925
Well, but if you call me "Ms. Akechi", it sounds like I'm a detective.

74
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,625
It feels weird.

75
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:35,425
So I heard people here worship the Spirit of Kimono, am I right?

76
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:38,225
Yes. This Spirit of Kimono is a guardian deity

77
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:41,725
but also have a dark side of face. People call it Kimono Demon.

78
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,625
Kimono Demon?

79
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,225
It's an old folklore told in this village.

80
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:49,825
Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Ohana in this village.

81
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:52,825
She was a kind, hardworking woman.

82
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:57,325
One day, Ohana found a samurai, who broke his leg. She helped him.

83
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:59,225
As a token of gratitude for her help,

84
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,125
the samurai gave Ohana tons of beautiful kimonos and sashes.

85
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,025
Being envious of Ohana's fortune,

86
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,225
the village mayor's daughters made a false charge against her.

87
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:10,725
Ohana was arrested and the daughters took her kimonos.

88
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,725
That night, Ohana was executed.

89
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:19,125
The daughters enjoyed the beauty of the kimonos.

90
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,225
All of a sudden,

91
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:21,825
the lights went out and...

92
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:27,925
Hearing the scream, the householders came,

93
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,425
but what they found were the dead bodies

94
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,325
of the younger daughter lying on the kimonos

95
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:37,825
and the body of the older one tangled with many sashes in a pond.

96
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,725
Realizing the graveness of Ohana's grudge,

97
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,825
the villagers built a small shrine

98
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,925
and worshipped her as a guardian deity of the village.

99
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:46,125
Ever since then, people in this area

100
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,025
have worshipped Ohana as the Spirit of Kimono.

101
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:53,025
And that is the Great Shrine of the Kimono Spirit.

102
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:55,125
You must've studied this place a lot.

103
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:59,525
No, I just stay in this hotel a lot when I write. That's all.

104
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,425
Isn't that Harumi?

105
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,825
You're right. Harumi!

106
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,525
This tree is called Kimono Sakura. It's about 500 years old.

107
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:17,925
When spring comes, those branches will be covered with flowers.

108
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:21,625
It looks just like a beautiful kimono.

109
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,325
Harumi, do you know about this place a lot, too?

110
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:25,725
No.

111
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:29,325
My friend in university loved this cherry blossom.

112
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,925
She told me about this before.

113
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,625
It crossed my mind, so I came here to see it.

114
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,925
Ran.

115
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:41,625
What is that small shrine?

116
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,625
Hey, kid! Don't run around.

117
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,825
That's actually the shrine for Kimono Visit.

118
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,725
Kimono Visit?

119
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,925
The Spirit of Kimono is also a deity of vengeance.

120
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,025
Vengeance?

121
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:59,025
It's been said that if you wear a kimono

122
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:01,725
and visit this small shrine at midnight,

123
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:05,625
the Spirit of Kimono will take revenge for you.

124
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:09,025
And in dedication of the Kimono visit,

125
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,825
people leave a paper doll in this shrine.

126
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:16,025
Look! There are new ones!

127
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,325
There are a couple of them.

128
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:19,425
What?

129
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:24,425
So somebody came here recently for Kimono visit?

130
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:28,325
That means there're two people that this visitor wants to take revenge on.

131
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:32,925
Forget about it. It's just a prank.

132
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:35,225
Don't worry about it, Ran.

133
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,625
Hey. Isn't that a shrine, too?

134
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,225
Come on.

135
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,425
It's just a guest room.

136
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:47,525
Actually, it's a shrine of the Spirit of Kimono, too.

137
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:51,425
Don't tell me there are paper dolls in it, too.

138
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,125
No way, it can't be.

139
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,925
But something's bugging me.

140
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:01,525
Please, Dad. Go and check it.

141
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:02,725
Me?

142
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:09,425
I don't understand why she's so scared.

143
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:13,425
There're no paper dolls here.

144
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,325
Right, see?

145
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,925
Right.

146
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,625
Here's nothing!

147
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,125
Good! Thanks!

148
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,525
It's amazing!

149
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,125
It just looks like the one on the pamphlet, doesn't it?

150
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,425
This is paradise.

151
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,725
This is paradise.

152
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,325
It's beautiful!

153
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,625
Cheers...

154
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:50,025
Everyone, thank you so much

155
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,525
for your cooperation with our four day interview.

156
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:57,425
Eri, make my model character stand out in your drama, will you?

157
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:01,425
Well, I still don't know what kind of story it's going to be.

158
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,625
So I'm giving you ideas right now!

159
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,425
Mr. Bando,

160
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:10,525
how about if Harumi sings the opening theme of the drama?

161
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,525
What?

162
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:13,925
That's a good idea!

163
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,925
Harumi, could you do that?

164
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,125
Only if she's around until then though.

165
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,325
It's good, isn't it?

166
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:32,425
Oh, my! Is it empty before I even open it?

167
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,225
How could that be possible?

168
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,125
Ran? Another bottle?

169
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:42,925
All right! One last bottle, okay?

170
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:47,325
It'll be the last one, Ran.

171
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,825
No!

172
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:54,525
No! Conan, it's not fair!

173
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,925
Excuse me?

174
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,025
Yes, come in.

175
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:01,025
Hi, Harumi!

176
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:05,525
There's something I would like to discuss with Mr. Mouri.

177
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,825
Dad.

178
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,125
Yes?

179
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,825
Dad!

180
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,025
Discuss?

181
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:27,747
It was five years ago. I was in third year in college.

182
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,147
There was this illegal drug that a lot of students on campus were using.

183
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:35,047
Somehow, people started to suspect a female student as the drug dealer.

184
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,947
Although she denied the fact that she was the drug dealer,

185
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:40,947
the drugs were found in her locker.

186
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:45,547
She killed herself by jumping off the university building,

187
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,847
saying she was innocent.

188
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,947
That person's name is Sakurako Suzuka.

189
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:53,047
I told you about her under the cherry blossom tree.

190
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:56,447
She was a very kind person, who loved cherry blossoms.

191
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,247
There's no way that she was selling the drugs. It just can't be her.

192
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,147
So please, Mr. Mouri!

193
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:07,647
Could you reinvestigate this case again? Please?

194
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,447
This was five years ago though.

195
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:15,147
Actually there was a rumour that the drug dealers

196
00:13:15,147 --> 00:13:17,047
were some other female students.

197
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,147
What?

198
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:23,047
But those students were from a family who had a lot of authority.

199
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:26,647
So no one could go against them.

200
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,947
Students?

201
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:32,347
They are Asuka Shibasaki and Ema Anzai.

202
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:35,847
Asuka is a daughter of a parliamentary deputy.

203
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:40,647
And Ema is a daughter of the major construction firm, Anzai Global.

204
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,347
Those two girls didn't get along with Sakurako

205
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,147
because of her strong sense of justice.

206
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:47,247
Mr. Mouri, please look into this!

207
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:53,347
Alright! I'll see what I can do, okay?

208
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,347
Thank you so much!

209
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:59,847
You must like her a lot.

210
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:03,047
I lost my parents when I was young.

211
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,447
My uncle and aunt raised me.

212
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:09,447
Sakurako also lost her parents by fire,

213
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,847
and so she was very kind to me.

214
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:27,847
You guys are going to the bath now?

215
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,747
You're done already, Ms. Akechi?

216
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:33,147
Yes. I got a little cold.

217
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:36,147
Then, why don't we have some drink together?

218
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:40,047
I'm sorry. I got some work to do.

219
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,847
Okay, later!

220
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:46,747
Huh? It's reserved.

221
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:47,747
You're right.

222
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:53,047
It's locked.

223
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:56,147
Well, what can we do? It's only 30 more minutes.

224
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:58,447
Why don't we go upstairs and play some ping pong?

225
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,047
Alright.

226
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:07,647
Somebody's going pretty wild over there.

227
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:10,347
I wonder what Ran and the others are doing?

228
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:12,247
Here we go!

229
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,247
Yes!

230
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,947
You guys already got out?

231
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:23,647
No. Actually, we haven't even got in yet.

232
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,547
It was reserved.

233
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,447
Huh? You're wearing glasses.

234
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:32,647
I wear contact lenses usually.

235
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,247
I took them off for the outdoor bath just now.

236
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,947
It's past 11.30pm now.

237
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:48,247
The bath should be open by now.

238
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,547
Yes. Let's go.

239
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:55,847
Where are you guys going?

240
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,147
To the female bathroom!

241
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,047
What?

242
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,747
Still reserved.

243
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,647
It is locked.

244
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,347
What is this?

245
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,847
There was nothing when we came here last time.

246
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,447
It's weird. This thing is kind of cold.

247
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,247
What is this?

248
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,847
What's the matter?

249
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,247
Kimono Demon.

250
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,647
Pops, break down the door!

251
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:34,247
Okay! Let me do it!

252
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,047
Dad!

253
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,347
This just got me really sober.

254
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,447
Conan, is anybody there?

255
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:54,247
Yes, but in fact...

256
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,347
Asuka!

257
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,447
Asuka!

258
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,647
Asuka, are you alright?

259
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:13,047
She's stabbed in the chest.

260
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,347
The folklore of the Kimono Demon.

261
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,447
Oh, no.

262
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,947
Hey, Conan! Where are you going?

263
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,747
In the folklore, two sisters are killed.

264
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,747
Hey, what's going on?

265
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,047
Asuka is...

266
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,947
What's the matter?

267
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,347
In the outdoor bath, Asuka was found dead.

268
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,047
Actually, it was a murder.

269
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,547
What is it?

270
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:41,147
Oh, my God.

271
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,147
Where is Ema?

272
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:45,747
I think she went over there about an hour ago.

273
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,447
Are those the footprints of Ema's boots?

274
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,747
Is she in there?

275
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,847
Please don't step on the footprints.

276
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:07,147
I know that! Did you forget that I'm a detective?

277
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,947
So it is the Kimono Demon.

278
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:29,147
She's stabbed in her chest, too.

279
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:33,147
Outside, only Ema's footprints and nothing else was found.

280
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:36,847
In other words, this is a locked room closed off by the snow.

281
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,847
Excuse me, sir!

282
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:43,147
I suppose you're Detective Mouri.

283
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,447
Yes, I am.

284
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:49,147
I am Ogura, the police officer of this village!

285
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:50,147
Did you contact the prefectural police department?

286
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:52,647
Yes, I did.

287
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:55,447
But the road condition is not good because of the snow.

288
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,647
So I suppose they won't be here until tomorrow morning.

289
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,447
Tomorrow morning.

290
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:00,847
No choice then.

291
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:04,347
I guess we have to do the on-site investigation on our own.

292
00:19:04,347 --> 00:19:08,247
Miss? Could you bring me some bath towels, please?

293
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,047
Sure!

294
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,147
Please wait in the hall.

295
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:15,547
Yes...

296
00:19:15,547 --> 00:19:17,947
Do it slowly, Mr. Ogura.

297
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:25,047
Yes, slowly. Cover those footprints.

298
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:29,347
This pass under the eaves leads to the back door.

299
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,047
Yet, there are no footprints whatsoever.

300
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,747
Wait a minute.

301
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,947
Something's wrong.

302
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,647
What is it? Something's wrong.

303
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,447
Hey, don't move it!

304
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,647
I don't want the footprints to be covered with snow!

305
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,547
There you are.

306
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:56,747
Sorry, we decided to sit rather than stand. It's was Eri's idea.

307
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,847
Did you find anything?

308
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:05,647
Yoriko, you said Ema passed this lobby around 10.30pm.

309
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,547
Yes, I did.

310
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,747
Did you see anybody else?

311
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,347
No, I didn't.

312
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:15,347
It's getting more complicated.

313
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,247
What do you mean by that?

314
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:22,147
First of all, around the shrine where Ema was murdered,

315
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:27,647
there were no footprints found other than hers.

316
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:29,847
So, did Ema killed herself?

317
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:31,347
I don't think so.

318
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:34,447
There were no weapons found in there.

319
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,047
No way.

320
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,747
Secondly, in order to go to the outdoor bath where Asuka was murdered,

321
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:44,047
you have to go through the recreation hall.

322
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:50,447
We were there after 10.30pm, but didn't see anybody passing through.

323
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:53,247
What about climbing the cliff and going to the outdoor bath?

324
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:54,447
I already checked it.

325
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,447
There were no suspicious traces found on the cliff.

326
00:20:57,447 --> 00:21:02,147
Then, Asuka was murdered before 10.30pm?

327
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:06,547
We found a dagger and a stun gun in the bathtub.

328
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:10,547
The murderer most likely attacked Asuka with the stun gun first,

329
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,747
then killed her in the outdoor bath.

330
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:16,347
The dagger in fact had a nacre decoration in its hilt.

331
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:18,547
I asked the staffs about it.

332
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:22,047
She said it was the votive dagger dedicated to the shrine in the garden.

333
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,647
The votive dagger?

334
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,047
And one more thing.

335
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:28,647
Ema's bandana was also found in the outdoor bath.

336
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,247
There was blood on that bandana.

337
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,847
What does that mean?

338
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:35,247
That means...

339
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:39,947
Assuming that both victims were murdered with the same dagger,

340
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:44,447
it's plausible to think that Ema was killed before Asuka was.

341
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:48,147
Furthermore, Ema was alive until 10.30pm.

342
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:51,747
So theoretically, Asuka was killed after 10.30pm.

343
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:54,947
How did the murderer get into the outdoor bath, though?

344
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,947
There were no traces in the shrine of the garden, right?

345
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:02,947
Give me a break. You got to be a ghost or something to do that.

346
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,947
It's the curse.

347
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:07,247
It's the curse of the Kimono Demon.

348
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,547
What do you mean?

349
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:11,447
We saw it!

350
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:16,847
I saw a couple of new paper dolls dedicated to the shrine!

351
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:20,847
The Kimono Demon's curse killed Asuka and Ema.

352
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:23,347
No, it can't be.

353
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:26,547
A curse did not kill the girls. It's obvious.

354
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:31,847
But what was the trick that the murderer used?

355
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,647
"Next Episode" -It's the Kimono visit!

356
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:05,147
It was Sakurako who revenged herself on these girls with the Kimono Visit!

357
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,847
I see.

358
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:14,247
It must be. I know Sakurako wanted to...

359
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:19,847
Hey! Why are your socks all wet?

360
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:23,647
Wait. Hey, Ran! Wait.

361
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:29,547
Next Conan, "The Murder in the Hot Spring Inn (Part 2)"

362
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:32,974
Next Conan's Hint:

363
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,774
"Sash"

364
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,574
Hey, Ran! Do you have a sash?

365
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:37,774
A black one for karate though.

366
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,478
That's what I thought.
