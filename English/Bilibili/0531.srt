1
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:04,115
A culprit who goes after long-haired women

2
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,715
attacking them with a hammer.

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,715
He is known as Hammer man.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,315
Through an eye-witness report,

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,315
the condo where Hammer man is thought to reside is pinpointed.

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,115
Officer Takagi and other officers secretly stake out.

7
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,915
They try to keep the culprit from seeing through their surveillance

8
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,715
by putting on a lovey-dovey situation.

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,415
Officer Chiba reports that

10
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:29,715
three people went in and out of the room that they were watching.

11
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:33,715
One of them was a male courier who came to pick up a parcel.

12
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,215
The second person was a woman motorbike courier

13
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,115
who came to deliver a parcel.

14
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,915
The third one was a man from the pizza shop who came to deliver pizza.

15
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:42,915
However,

16
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:46,015
all three people say that they did not see the resident of the condo.

17
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:48,715
They explain that a note telling them to come into the room

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,015
and do what they have to was posted on the front door.

19
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:56,715
Thinking that this may be

20
00:00:56,715 --> 00:01:01,515
a strategy that Hammer man thought up to escape the condo,

21
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,415
we decided to bust into the room that was being watched,

22
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,115
but when we got there,

23
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:10,315
we found a man that had been hit on the head and seriously injured.

24
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:14,815
Is he Hammer man?

25
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:19,115
Did one of the three who entered the room strike him?

26
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,815
There could've been a person connected to

27
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,015
one of the women who were attacked by Hammer man among the three people.

28
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:28,715
Although the police wanted to verify the identities of the three,

29
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:32,415
they had already been allowed to leave.

30
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:35,315
After going in to investigate the room with the officers,

31
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:37,815
we found several suspicious points.

32
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,815
Only the invoice of the pizza delivery was left behind

33
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,715
and the invoices of the courier and motorbike delivery were gone.

34
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,515
The plug of a chargeable electric shaver was not plugged in.

35
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:50,215
The bath tub is spic-and-span and super clean.

36
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,615
Strange.

37
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,715
There must be something behind this incident.

38
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,715
Something that is beyond our imagination.

39
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,315
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

40
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:04,415
Saturday nights are for mystery.

41
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,415
The surprising identity of Hammer man.

42
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,815
Funny Detective Queen Sonoko makes her appearance.

43
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:10,415
He sees through the one and only truth.

44
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:12,315
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

45
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,115
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

46
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:00,285
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 2)".

47
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,785
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

48
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,585
we found these gloves among the laundry.

49
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,685
We'll have the forensic officers check it

50
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:16,185
and if the blood matches with those of the victim last night,

51
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,485
the man that was found lying on the floor here

52
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:21,085
is definitely Hammer man.

53
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,085
All we need to do now is

54
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,585
find the remains of anything that belonged to the one who hit Hammer man.

55
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,185
That could lead to some clue.

56
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,185
None here!

57
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,885
All the clothes that are here

58
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:34,485
were inside the dryer and washer, weren't they?

59
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,485
If so, I wonder why there are

60
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:40,685
no underwear or socks.

61
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:41,985
True.

62
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:45,385
Although there are T-shirts, sweat shirts and towels.

63
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,485
Maybe they were all thrown away after being used.

64
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,685
Well, when I had to stake out for more than a week or so,

65
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,885
I used to throw away my underwear

66
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:55,885
without washing them too, at times like that.

67
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,385
Stake out...

68
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,085
You pretended to be lovers so that people wouldn't notice

69
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,985
that you were staking out, right?

70
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,785
What did you think it was?

71
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,185
Oh, no.

72
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:13,485
Is something the matter?

73
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,485
Chiba.

74
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:17,385
You staked out with Officer Sato in the past, didn't you?

75
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,185
Yes, two or three times.

76
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,685
Did... did anything happen back then?

77
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,385
What do you mean?

78
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:26,685
No, if nothing happened, that's okay.

79
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:27,785
Is it that

80
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,485
you want to know whether I pretended being lovers with Officer Sato?

81
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,885
Officer Sato seems to do it a lot

82
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,585
to keep people from noticing that we're officers.

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,785
But, as for me, something like that during a stake out

84
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,785
will totally distract me from my duty.

85
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:43,385
Don't tell me that you...

86
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:48,485
Yes, I could never forget that soft touch.

87
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:51,285
Soft touch?

88
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,785
Kiss me. Right now.

89
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:56,085
A hot passionate one.

90
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,385
What?

91
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,885
Did you find something?

92
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:01,985
No.

93
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,685
Excuse me.

94
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:07,485
I think it's about time I take Conan home, if it's okay.

95
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:08,885
I guess so.

96
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,285
Thank you, Conan.

97
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:13,485
You can leave finding Hammer man to the police.

98
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,985
But...

99
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,585
Then, the person who was carried away on the stretcher

100
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,785
was also attacked by Hammer man?

101
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:22,185
No, the person that was carried off on the stretcher is Hammer man.

102
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:24,385
A person connected with one of his victims

103
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,885
probably took revenge and attacked him.

104
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,085
No way!

105
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:31,185
I thought that Hammer man was over 180 centimetres tall.

106
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,185
The person who was carried away

107
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,285
didn't look to be that tall at all, did he?

108
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:38,585
That's what the urban legend's about.

109
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:40,885
The victims were all attacked from behind,

110
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:45,185
and only got to see the attacker's rear view from the groundwhere they are,

111
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,985
so, the accurate height of the culprit is unknown.

112
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:51,985
Although last night's eye-witness was on his feet,

113
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:54,385
he seems to have been drunk, so...

114
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,785
Urban legend...

115
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,085
Wait a sec.

116
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,185
A bathroom that's too clean,

117
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,285
an unplugged electric shaver,

118
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,885
and a toothbrush for some reason that weren't there,

119
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,885
including no underwear or socks...

120
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:09,385
And the note that was found in front of the room,

121
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:12,285
the invoices of the courier and motorbike courier that disappeared...

122
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,085
Don't tell me that...

123
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,185
There is a piece of leather flap attached to the tip of the left shoe!

124
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:27,485
Where are the other shoes?

125
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,685
This is the only shoe with a leather flap attached to it!

126
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,685
Hey!

127
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:36,485
Conan.

128
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:39,885
Does something bother you about Hammer man's shoe?

129
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:43,385
No, these aren't the shoes of Hammer man.

130
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,785
He wasn't here to begin with.

131
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:47,785
What?

132
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,785
The man called Hammer man.

133
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,285
What do you mean,

134
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,685
saying that Hammer man wasn't here to begin with?

135
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:57,285
You know, like the woman with snake-like mouth

136
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,885
and dog that has a human-like face,

137
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:00,385
rumour exaggerates

138
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,185
and they become really frightening characters, right?

139
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:04,785
Hammer man is said

140
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,485
to have run 100m in 11 seconds,

141
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:12,385
or be a tall man with a height over 180cm.

142
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,785
What I'm saying is that rumour exaggerates the facts

143
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,085
and ends up going around scaring people.

144
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,385
Woman like a snake-like mouth and a dog that has a human-like face...

145
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:24,185
You sure know a lot about old horror characters, don't you?

146
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:27,085
My teacher at school told us about them.

147
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,885
But Conan,

148
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,385
unlike the woman with the snake-like mouth

149
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,285
and the dog with a human-like face,

150
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:36,985
there are actually four people who were victimized by Hammer man.

151
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:38,985
It's hard to believe that he's an imaginary character.

152
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,985
That just goes to show that there's a bad man

153
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:44,985
that's attacking long-haired woman with a hammer,

154
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,885
and we don't really know if that's the Hammer man or not, do we?

155
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,485
He's going around attacking people with hammers,

156
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:52,385
so he's a Hammer man, isn't he?

157
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,085
Are you saying that it was actually not a hammer?

158
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,185
So what I mean is...

159
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,385
What?

160
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,985
Talk louder so that everybody can hear...

161
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,585
Sonoko?

162
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,685
That... that queer dance...

163
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:09,785
Don't say that...

164
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,585
Yes, dance.

165
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:17,385
Conan's remark inspired me!

166
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:20,685
We were dancing around.

167
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:25,185
In other words, being deceived by an urban legend called Hammer man!

168
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:27,985
She's come! Deduction Queen Sonoko!

169
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:32,685
But she resembles Sleeping Kogoro in every way, doesn't she?

170
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,385
Of course she does.

171
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,285
No, I think the angle her head is facing down

172
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,885
is different from that of Mr. Mouri's.

173
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,485
Is... is that so?

174
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:42,585
There's no difference.

175
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:44,285
But, Sonoko,

176
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:47,085
if Hammer man is simply an urban legend,

177
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:51,085
who was that man that was knocked down and passed out in this room?

178
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,385
The only plausible explanation

179
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,885
is that one of the three who came to this room

180
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,985
hit Hammer man because of a grudge.

181
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:01,085
Think back and try to remember the details.

182
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:05,085
In what order and for what the three came to the room for?

183
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,385
If I remember correctly,

184
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:14,085
it was a tall male courier about 180 centimeters in height,

185
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:18,185
a woman motorbike courier who is barely 160 meters tall,

186
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:23,985
and last, a thin pizza delivery man about 170 centimeters tall.

187
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:26,185
Those three who came to the room

188
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,785
because there was a note by the front door

189
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:29,185
telling them to come in and do what they had to

190
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:33,685
since the resident was in bed with a cold.

191
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:35,885
You can see that the only person who could've put that note there

192
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:40,385
was the courier who came along first, right?

193
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,585
Then, the only one who could've hidden

194
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:45,785
the invoices of the courier and the motorbike woman courier

195
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,585
is either the motorbike delivery woman

196
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:51,985
or the pizza delivery man, right that came after the male courier, right?

197
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,485
Yes, that's what's been troubling us from a while ago.

198
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:59,385
But if you think of it this way, maybe the puzzle will fit?

199
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:02,685
If we were to assume that it was Hammer man who was in this room

200
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,685
that left the memo by the door, as well as hid the invoices!

201
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,785
It's true that he could've placed the memo there,

202
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:13,985
but why would Hammer man have to hide the invoices?

203
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:18,085
To keep the police from identifying who is who right away.

204
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:20,385
Because the culprit is just about to switch over

205
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,385
to being someone else right now!

206
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:23,385
What?

207
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,885
Switch? Don't tell me...

208
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,885
You mean Hammer man switched to one of those three?

209
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:33,185
Yes, Hammer man called the motorbike deliverer

210
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:37,385
and pizza delivery man in order to switch identities with them.

211
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,385
In other words,

212
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,585
the one who was knocked out and fainted in that room

213
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:43,585
was one of the three!

214
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:44,885
I see.

215
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,885
So when the people the culprit called,

216
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:50,985
came to the room and followed the instructions on the memo by the door,

217
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:54,085
he knocked them out, put his clothes on them,

218
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:56,685
and set it up as if the man committed suicide.

219
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:58,285
The culprit left the man in the room,

220
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,285
wore the uniform of the man he knocked out

221
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,685
and left straightforwardly out the front door.

222
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:03,985
If so,

223
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,985
the first male courier that came

224
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,485
is cleared from the list of suspects.

225
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,785
After all, his physique is much too different from that of the man

226
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,685
who was knocked out in the room.

227
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:15,785
Besides, he couldn't have taken away the invoice of the motorbike courier

228
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,985
who came along later.

229
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:22,685
Which means that Hammer man is the pizza delivery man!

230
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:25,885
It's understandable that he hasn't returned to shop yet too, then.

231
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:26,885
Okay.

232
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:28,385
Form a cordon right away

233
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,385
and look for the pizza delivery man.

234
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,385
My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?

235
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,385
What?

236
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,085
After hearing of the situation of the room a while ago from Conan,

237
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,785
I figured it out right away,

238
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,485
that is, the identity of Hammer man.

239
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,785
Situation of the room?

240
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,385
About the bathroom being spic-and-span,

241
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:48,285
the chargeable shaver being unplugged,

242
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,285
no toothbrush.

243
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:55,285
As well as that fact that there were no underwear or socks in the laundry.

244
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:58,185
What... what can you tell with all that information?

245
00:12:58,185 --> 00:12:59,585
Can't you tell?

246
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,085
As for the bathroom being spic-and-span

247
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,985
and the toothbrush being taken away,

248
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,785
it was to get rid of any traces of she living in the room

249
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,685
until just a while ago,

250
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:10,985
and the reason the shaver was unplugged

251
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:13,985
was simply because it hasn't been used recently.

252
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:17,785
There were no underwear and socks among the laundry

253
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:20,285
in order to hide what gender the culprit is.

254
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,985
You get it now, don't you?

255
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,785
Don't tell me that...

256
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,685
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

257
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:38,961
Don't tell me that Hammer man is...

258
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,261
a woman?

259
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:41,861
The motorbike delivery person?

260
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,061
Yes, the underwear as well as the socks,

261
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,861
she hid because they would obviously

262
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,561
be much smaller in size than that of men!

263
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,161
She didn't want anyone to find out

264
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,561
that the resident of this room was a woman.

265
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:55,861
It... it's true that the culprit was called Hammer man,

266
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:59,861
but none of the victims said that they were attacked by a man.

267
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:03,061
It could've been a name that the media gave the culprit

268
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:06,361
because the attack was a brutal one with the weapon used being a hammer.

269
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,561
Giving the culprit a certain name catches on fast, so...

270
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:10,661
Come to think of it,

271
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,061
I was told that the one who rented this room was a man,

272
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,261
but that he had a woman living together with him.

273
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:19,761
In other words, the one who disappeared from this room was the man,

274
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:22,761
and the woman kept living here.

275
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:27,361
Well, if you look at the shoe with the leather flap that Conan found,

276
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,461
everything is quite apparent!

277
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,661
This is a shift pad that is used to protect the tip of the shoe

278
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,561
from the impact of stepping on the shift pedal of the motorbike.

279
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,661
Being that there was only one such shoe in the shoe cabinet

280
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,461
and no other shoe with a damaged tip means that...

281
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,361
The owner of the shoe wasn't the resident of this condo,

282
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,161
but rather the motorbike person.

283
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:48,261
In other words, it was the shoe of the man

284
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,361
who was knocked out after a blow on the head.

285
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:54,061
She probably took the woman's shoes she was wearing, her clothes

286
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,161
and her underwear away with her,

287
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,561
after packing them in her knapsack

288
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:01,561
that she said received from the motorbike delivery person.

289
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:05,061
The high heeled boots that she wore to make the culprit look tall

290
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:07,561
are probably in there too.

291
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,861
I see.

292
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:11,961
The drunk that saw her couldn't have caught up with her

293
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,561
unless she was wearing those boots that were in trend some years ago.

294
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,961
But...

295
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:21,061
if so, why isn't the pizza delivery man still not back?

296
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:22,561
It's very likely that he's been hit by the culprit

297
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:26,261
and being confined somewhere.

298
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:29,461
Because if he doesn't return, the police will probably suspect him.

299
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,761
Okay!

300
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,761
This time for sure form a cordon and...

301
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,061
Maybe that won't be necessary.

302
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,061
What?

303
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,461
But, unless we go after her fast, she may flee on the motorbike.

304
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,461
If she could ride a motorbike,

305
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,561
she wouldn't leave this shoe

306
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:44,561
with a shift pad on it behind like this, would she?

307
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,761
In other words,

308
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,561
I'm sure she'd like to get out of the jumpsuit she's wearing.

309
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,561
Because the way she's dressed now,

310
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:52,261
it would make it difficult for her to even flag a cab.

311
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:53,861
The best place to get out of her jumpsuit

312
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,161
would be in a bathroom somewhere.

313
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,761
But if she would go inside a family restaurant wearing a jumpsuit,

314
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:58,761
it would be too conspicuous.

315
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,761
And besides, there's a chance that someone

316
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:03,561
would remember her face and clothing after she comes out changed.

317
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,361
So, a bathroom where she could avoid all this would be...

318
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:07,961
A bathroom in a park!

319
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,461
The one nearest here

320
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,361
is where the incident occurred last night, in Beika Park!

321
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,061
It's being investigated now.

322
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,661
Phooey, stupid guy.

323
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,961
To take that lie to be true...

324
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:29,261
You know the toilet in the park that I went to a while ago,

325
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,761
one of the compartments wouldn't open,

326
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,861
so will you come check it out with me?

327
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:36,661
It bothers me because it's the park where Hammer man appeared, you see.

328
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,761
Oh, okay.

329
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:41,861
There's no such toilet.

330
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,861
That's strange.

331
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,361
It was closed just a while ago.

332
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:50,561
All I need to do now is get out of this jumpsuit

333
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:52,161
get out of this park

334
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:55,661
and flee to where the stupid police won't find me.

335
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,461
Is anything wrong?

336
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,061
I'm the police.

337
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,861
You know that an incident occurred here last night, don't you?

338
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:08,161
Oh, yes, sir!

339
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,861
Is there something in the toilet?

340
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:13,261
No.

341
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:16,361
I don't know if it has anything to do with the incident,

342
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:19,061
but a person is lying on the ground in the toilet beyond.

343
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:24,961
True.

344
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,361
I'll call my men to come over right away.

345
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,761
So, please let me interrogate you for a while.

346
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,761
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

347
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,461
We've got a report on you.

348
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:43,361
Hammer man, was it?

349
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,861
So, Hammer man...

350
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:52,761
Rather, Hammer woman was arrested.

351
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,661
The curtains went down on the urban legend

352
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:58,761
before it was handed down from word of mouth.

353
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:00,161
The motive for her committing the crime,

354
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:03,661
was a grudge she held against the man that ditched her.

355
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:06,061
The reason she attacked only women with long hair

356
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,361
was because the man that left her left with a woman with long hair.

357
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:13,061
Since she was pursued by the eye-witness

358
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:15,061
and her residence was disclosed,

359
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,961
she tried to frame the man and make it look as if he was the culprit,

360
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:21,961
but the police caught on faster than she expected them to,

361
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:24,861
so she seems to have carried out her stupid crime.

362
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:29,161
Thanks so much, Sonoko.

363
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,361
Your deduction was as fantastic as that of Sleeping Kogoro.

364
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:35,061
Especially when you said, "My, my. Haven't you danced enough yet?"

365
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,461
It really sounded like what a Deduction Queen would say!

366
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:40,161
You don't remember?

367
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,061
No, I mean the details.

368
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,961
Actually, I don't remember a thing.

369
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:47,461
Thank you too, Conan.

370
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,161
And, how far did you go?

371
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,861
How far? What?

372
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,661
What else,

373
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,761
but with Officer Sato of course.

374
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,461
It's been quite a while since you've been going with her, right?

375
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,661
I don't want to tell you.

376
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,961
Are you by chance angry about the fact that

377
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:07,061
I acted like lovers with Officer Sato when staking out?

378
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,261
I'm not mad or anything.

379
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:10,661
No big deal,

380
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:13,161
because all I did was hold hands with her.

381
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,761
Huh?

382
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,861
But you mentioned something about a soft touch and all...

383
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:22,061
The touch of her hand when she grabbed mine.

384
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,361
Well, but right after that,

385
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,061
when I saw the way she glared at the suspect during the stake out,

386
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,461
I was scared at the look she was wearing

387
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,961
and kind of backed off.

388
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,861
Is that it?

389
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,161
Yeah.

390
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:36,261
It was the same with you, wasn't it, Officer Takagi,

391
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,061
when you were staking out?

392
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,461
No, in my case...

393
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:43,761
Kiss me.

394
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,261
Right now.

395
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:46,661
A hot passionate one.

396
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:51,661
I see. She said so, because it was me.

397
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:54,261
Officer Sato said so, because it was me.

398
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,861
We've finally found the residence

399
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:07,661
of the younger brother of the suspect of the murder case.

400
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,161
"First Investigation Division" -It's on the 2nd floor of a pachinko parlor

401
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:12,261
in Okuhocho 3-chome.

402
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,461
According to the information we have,

403
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,861
it's very likely that the suspect

404
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,361
will secretly be meeting his brother soon.

405
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:20,661
I want you to stake the place out like always.

406
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:24,661
I want Officer Sato who was pursuing this case to stake out with...

407
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,061
Me!

408
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,961
Please let me do it!

409
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,961
How unusual of you to say from your side that you'd like to stake out.

410
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:34,761
Didn't you know

411
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:37,361
that I actually love stake out?

412
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,861
Be on your guard.

413
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:40,561
He's the younger brother of the suspect,

414
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,661
but is said to be pretty violent.

415
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:43,861
Yes, sir!

416
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,061
-Be careful. -I will!

417
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:49,061
What? Be careful?

418
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,261
There's no movement at all?

419
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,761
Inspector Sato.

420
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:04,461
The name "Sato" is really common, isn't it?

421
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,761
It's sure a nice name.

422
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,661
This is Matsumoto.

423
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:33,661
I'm pursuing a man

424
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:36,661
who looks to be the serial killer suspect at Enha Pier!

425
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,261
What? Are you serious?

426
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:39,461
Yes, sir.

427
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:40,961
The model of the car as well as the color

428
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:43,061
matches the description of the stolen car that was reported.

429
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,661
It's parked right now and there's only one person in the car.

430
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,361
Please confirm the license plate number.

431
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:50,061
Shinjuku 5...

432
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,961
What's up, Matsumoto? Go on.

433
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,161
Whistling?

434
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:11,061
No doubt about it, it's him.

435
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,261
He's whistling.

436
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,861
That familiar song.

437
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,161
Did he see me?

438
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,861
Hey, answer me, Matsumoto!

439
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,461
Matsumoto! Matsumoto!

440
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:28,061
Superintendent Matsumoto!

441
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:31,761
Are you all right?

442
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:34,361
You seem to have been having a bad dream.

443
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:39,161
I'm sorry, I must've dozed off a bit.

444
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:43,361
I think you should go home and get some rest at times.

445
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,661
You've been sleeping over here for the past few days

446
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,261
and haven't been getting much sleep, have you?

447
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,661
I can't afford to rest just yet.

448
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,461
There's only a week left

449
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,161
before the time for the serial killing case expires.

450
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:56,161
Even as we sit here like this,

451
00:23:56,161 --> 00:24:00,161
the hands of the clock are ticking away.

452
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,961
"Next Episode" -They say that the scar may still be there

453
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,561
even after a person grows up.

454
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,361
And, the two who gave their names, where are they now?

455
00:24:12,361 --> 00:24:14,161
Do you see something outside?

456
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,861
Don't you sense it?

457
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,361
Like someone's watching you.

458
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:20,061
I can't help feeling that way.

459
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:21,861
The culprit of that incident

460
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,861
that's responsible for the scar on my face...

461
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,061
The serial killer of the incident 15 years ago

462
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,361
is in this house?

463
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,861
Next Conan,

464
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,761
"The Scar of First Love".

465
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:53,061
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,761
"Nickname".

467
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,361
Just as expected of Detective Queen Sonoko.

468
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,861
And the Dance Queen as well, you know.
