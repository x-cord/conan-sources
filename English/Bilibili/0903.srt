"Danny's Restaurant"

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,940
Don't be ridiculous!

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,040
"Akira Hashizume (38)" -Why do I have to apologize?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,640
"Hiroshi Kagazume (38)" -Don't play dumb! You know exactly why!

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,240
I was just doing my job! Don't act so self-righteous!

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,340
You arrogant jerk!

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,740
-What was that? -What?

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,140
Excuse me, but could you keep your voices down,

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,840
Mr. Hashizume and Mr. Kagazume?

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,040
-I'm Kagazume! -I'm Hashizume!

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,040
-I'm terribly sorry! -They're at it again.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,740
"Kimiko Kuwana (36)" -I wish they'd stop. I'm sick of it.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,440
"Shingo Hosoda (28)" -It started a year ago.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,140
They're making it hard for me to do my job.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,840
What a nuisance.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,940
It was their fault it nearly turned into a murder.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,040
When the countdown reaches zero,

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,540
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,840
They're so alike, but they get along terribly!

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Their case is full of complex mysteries!

"Birds of a Feather at Loggerheads"

25
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,481
Those guys sure are weird.

26
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,681
Huh?

27
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,981
They seem to hate each other,

28
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:16,781
-but they're identical in every way. -You sure?

29
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,981
Shut up already!

30
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,181
You're right. Even their names...

31
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:22,981
Hashizume and Kagazume.

32
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:24,481
Tsume and Tsume.

33
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,481
Maybe they don't like that.

34
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:31,581
Well, birds of a feather either love or hate each other.

35
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,881
This is the last time! You'd better not regret it!

36
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,881
Enough already, you hypocrite!

37
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,481
Huh?

38
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,581
Hey.

39
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,881
This is his, right?

40
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,781
-Thank you. -Didn't he take the wrong one?

41
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,181
Yeah...

42
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:59,781
I'll switch with him later.

43
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,281
"Mouri Detective Agency"

44
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,381
I see.

45
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,781
"Nichiuri Sports - News Archive" -So this is the case

46
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,581
"Major company executive is dead!" -they were referring to.

47
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:18,781
Yeah. After the president of a major company died,

48
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,881
his will disappeared.

49
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,181
I remember now.

50
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:25,781
Weekly magazines were full of stories about the family

51
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,281
accusing each other of stealing it.

52
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:30,581
That was these two.

53
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,181
"Hiroshi Kagazume" -Two Nichiuri Sports reporters

54
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,481
"Akira Hashizume" -famous for their articles on scandals.

55
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,681
They even made comments on TV.

56
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:38,581
And exacerbated the situation.

57
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:42,381
They even wrote scandalous articles about the arguing family members.

58
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,781
Ultimately, the family members clashed,

59
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,981
resulting in an attempted murder.

60
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:51,581
I heard they garnered a lot of criticism and magazine sales fell.

61
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,581
And they're still suffering the consequences.

62
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,281
And that...

63
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:03,081
turned out the worst way possible.

64
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,381
We've identified the victim.

65
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:12,581
"Nichiuri Sports Newspaper Company" -Hiroshi Kagazume, 38 years old.

66
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,481
He was a reporter for Nichiuri Sports magazine.

67
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,981
The time of death is between 7 pm and 9 pm.

68
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,181
How did he die?

69
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,581
We're still waiting for the autopsy,

70
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,781
but judging by the body's condition,

71
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,581
we believe it was cyanide poisoning.

72
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:32,881
It's likely it was dissolved into the coffee in his travel tumbler.

73
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,381
Was it suicide?

74
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,981
That's what we thought at first, but...

75
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,881
Footprints?

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,881
Yes. They're not the victim's and they're fairly fresh.

77
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,881
In other words,

78
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:49,581
it's possible someone else was here around the time of death.

79
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,081
Akira Hashizume.

80
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,681
Like the late Hiroshi Kagazume,

81
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,881
you're a reporter at Nichiuri Sports, correct?

82
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:08,581
Yeah. Anyway, why am I being arrested?

83
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,481
You're not under arrest.

84
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:15,581
We just want to speak with you as a material witness for now.

85
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:20,581
Kagazume and I got along like cats and dogs.

86
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,881
We always fought. It was a huge nuisance.

87
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:28,581
I'm sure my coworkers have already told you that.

88
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:32,781
So I definitely had a motive to kill him.

89
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,681
But you didn't?

90
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,581
Of course not!

91
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,181
Then why were your fingerprints found

92
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:43,181
"Travel Tumbler Fingerprint Results" -on the travel tumbler.

93
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:45,981
"Name: Akira Hashizume" -at the crime scene?

94
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:51,881
Our travel tumblers were identical.

95
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:54,581
I've accidentally touched it before.

96
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,881
It must've happened then.

97
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,081
Accidentally, you say?

98
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:02,181
We'll be confirming that.

99
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,581
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Hey, kid.

100
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:11,181
You're sure Mr. Hashizume took the wrong travel tumbler, right?

101
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,381
Yeah, but...

102
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,381
What is it, Conan?

103
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,181
It may have been my imagination,

104
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:20,481
but it seemed like Mr. Hashizume

105
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:25,281
deliberately took Mr. Kagazume's travel tumbler.

106
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,281
-What? -What?

107
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:28,181
Is that true?

108
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:34,281
Then if he deliberately left his own poisoned tumbler

109
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,581
and Mr. Kagazume drank from it without knowing...

110
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,281
Yeah, it's murder.

111
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,181
But later...

112
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:46,081
Mr. Kagazume listened to what I said.

113
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:49,181
He knew it wasn't his.

114
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:50,581
But...

115
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,581
You're right. That is weird.

116
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,181
We can ask Mr. Hashizume about it.

117
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,181
Well, actually...

118
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,281
What? You have an alibi?

119
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,881
Yeah. It was yesterday night from 7 pm to 9 pm, right?

120
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,781
I was...

121
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:15,281
He was staking out a celebrity's affair.

122
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,881
Is there proof?

123
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,281
Yes.

124
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:23,481
"Cheetah Delivery" -He remembered the company name

125
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:28,281
and appearance of the deliveryman who arrived during that time.

126
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:32,981
We confirmed his story with the delivery company.

127
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:36,781
It would've been impossible for Mr. Hashizume to be at the crime scene.

128
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:39,981
Mouri, delivery.

129
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,081
Coming.

130
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,881
"Cheetah Delivery" -Hello. I have a package for you.

131
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,781
I'm here at the time you specified.

132
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,481
Okay.

133
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,981
Could it be...

134
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:54,181
This is it. Mr. Hashizume claims he was here,

135
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:59,181
watching that apartment building from 6 pm to 7 am.

136
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:03,081
Conan, did Mr. Mouri really ask you to investigate this place?

137
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:05,481
Hey, look.

138
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,381
What's this?

139
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,681
This is probably from a camera tripod.

140
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,381
Hello?

141
00:09:15,381 --> 00:09:18,681
Yes, thank you for taking my call earlier.

142
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,281
What?

143
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:25,281
So the old man was right.

144
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:30,781
Yeah. The delivery Mr. Hashizume saw had a specified delivery time.

145
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,581
Not only that, but the address was unknown,

146
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:36,081
and the sender's name on the voucher was made up.

147
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:38,781
Did Mr. Hashizume send it?

148
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:46,481
Yeah. He filmed the delivery using an unmanned camera on a tripod.

149
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,981
During that time, he went to the crime scene.

150
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:52,781
Later he checked the video so he'd have an alibi.

151
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,981
Which means it was premeditated murder.

152
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:03,181
We found the evidence to support it in a surprising location.

153
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:09,881
On the flash drive plugged into the victim's laptop.

154
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:15,881
On it we found a plan to murder...

155
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,181
"Murder Plan"

156
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,481
"By Hiroshi Kagazume"

157
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,581
you, Mr. Hashizume.

158
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,981
The method and alibi trick in it

159
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,681
is exactly as we just described.

160
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,881
"Alibi fabrication" -According to the plan,

161
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,781
he meant to "switch out travel tumblers

162
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:36,481
and return poisoned tumbler to Hashizume".

163
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,581
"Exchange tumbler for my own".

164
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,381
"Reconcile with a toast".

165
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:43,181
"Send him to underworld".

166
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:50,281
Later, "claim Hashizume was stressed about lack of progress at work,

167
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:51,981
suggesting suicide,

168
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:56,981
and write obituary about the loss of a rival and friend."

169
00:10:56,981 --> 00:11:01,281
He was quite the particular criminal.

170
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:03,181
Or maybe it was conceit.

171
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,981
Indeed.

172
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,881
What is it? Something's not right.

173
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,881
You either accidentally took or stole the victim's flash drive,

174
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,381
and read its contents.

175
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:20,481
You learned of his plan to kill you and became enraged,

176
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,181
and decided to murder him using the same method.

177
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,481
No.

178
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:30,481
You pretended to accidentally take the victim's travel tumbler home

179
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,781
and poisoned it.

180
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,881
No!

181
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:37,681
You invited the victim out so you could return it

182
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:39,581
and exchanged tumblers with him.

183
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,081
You made him think you reconciled and made him drink it.

184
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,781
No...

185
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:51,381
What?

186
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:52,481
Huh?

187
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:06,148
"Murder Plan By Akira Hashizume"

188
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,648
What is this?

189
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,848
Inspector!

190
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:13,148
It's the murder plan we found

191
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:18,748
on the flash drive we seized from Mr. Hashizume.

192
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:22,548
His target is the victim, Mr. Kagazume.

193
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:23,548
What?

194
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:27,948
Both plans were written at nearly the same time.

195
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,748
There are also no signs the documents were unlocked and read.

196
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:34,548
Which means...

197
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:39,648
Yeah. Unbelievably enough, they coincidentally created the same plan

198
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:43,048
"Murder Plan By Akira Hashizume" -to murder the other.

199
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:48,348
Because they're so alike, huh?

200
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,448
But still...

201
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,248
That's right.

202
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:59,448
I tried to kill Kagazume according to the plan.

203
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:03,348
I fabricated an alibi, poisoned the travel tumbler,

204
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:05,848
invited Kagazume out and went to meet him.

205
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,648
I'm sure of it.

206
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:09,248
But...

207
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,848
But when I went...

208
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,948
Kagazume was already dead.

209
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:15,948
-What? -What?

210
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:18,148
He was dead when you got there?

211
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,648
That's absurd.

212
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,948
It's too convenient!

213
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:23,548
You're right.

214
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:27,248
But it's true.

215
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:29,648
I ran,

216
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,548
washed the tumbler,

217
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:33,448
and threw it away.

218
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,748
Quit playing dumb.

219
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,148
Who else could have killed him?

220
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:42,948
Those two...

221
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,348
Mr. Mouri thinks they're suspicious?

222
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:47,648
No.

223
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,648
He just wants to know if they have alibis.

224
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:55,548
We looked into it but it's unclear.

225
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:58,748
Mr. Hosoda was out gathering information alone.

226
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:01,548
Ms. Kuwana was working late in the office by herself.

227
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:04,148
Neither had anyone to confirm their stories.

228
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:06,748
Oh, really?

229
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,348
Pops asked me to do one other thing.

230
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,448
Huh?

231
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,848
Re-examine the crime scene?

232
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,848
Is there something bothering Mr. Mouri?

233
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,848
Can you show me the crime scene photos?

234
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:24,848
Huh?

235
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:26,648
Yeah, here.

236
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:30,548
What's this?

237
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:32,648
It's coffee.

238
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:37,748
We think some coffee spilled from his tumbler when he collapsed.

239
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:42,748
We found the same cyanide in it, so we're fairly certain.

240
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,748
Then shouldn't it be on his pants, too?

241
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,648
Based on the length of his pants,

242
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:49,848
isn't it strange to only be on his socks?

243
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,148
Now that you mention it,

244
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,248
it certainly is odd.

245
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:58,148
How did the victim, Mr. Kagazume, get here?

246
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,148
By car.

247
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:03,048
He parked on the embankment and walked here.

248
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:05,048
Did you search the inside of the car?

249
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:10,448
Yeah, but we didn't find anything suspicious.

250
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,648
Search it again.

251
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:14,948
Officer Chiba? This is Mouri.

252
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,448
There's something I want you to look into.

253
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:24,248
Is it true, Mouri?

254
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:27,448
That you've uncovered the truth behind the case.

255
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:32,248
What? I came here because you said you found new evidence to...

256
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:43,848
Pops! Are you okay?

257
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:47,048
Stand back, Conan.

258
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,648
Okay!

259
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,548
Excuse me.

260
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,848
Allow me to explain the truth behind the case.

261
00:15:54,848 --> 00:16:00,248
First, Officer Takagi, what did you find in Mr. Kagazume's car?

262
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,748
Right. On the floor of the driver's seat,

263
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:07,148
we found traces of cyanide.

264
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:09,048
What?

265
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,648
That can only mean one thing.

266
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:16,548
Mr. Kagazume put cyanide in his own tumbler inside his car.

267
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:21,248
And while doing that, he spilled a bit of coffee.

268
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,848
Sitting in the driver's seat

269
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,648
caused the hem of his pants to ride up,

270
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,648
exposing his socks.

271
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:29,348
It's possible it splashed onto it then.

272
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:35,048
Doesn't that mean they tried to kill each other at the same time?

273
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:39,148
They both had plans to murder the other.

274
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:42,948
Mr. Kagazume meant to murder Mr. Hashizume

275
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:45,248
by returning a poisoned travel tumbler,

276
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:49,348
but he drank the coffee in the poisoned tumbler he took first.

277
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:55,248
No. Mr. Kagazume drank from Mr. Hashizume's tumbler he had initially.

278
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:59,848
As Mr. Hashizume claimed, they never exchanged tumblers here.

279
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,148
How do you know that?

280
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,448
The fingerprints.

281
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:09,348
Fingerprints? But it was originally Mr. Hashizume's tumbler.

282
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:13,848
It's not strange for Mr. Kagazume's or his own fingerprints to be on it.

283
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:18,848
Yes, but I'm not talking about their fingerprints.

284
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,748
It's Conan's fingerprints.

285
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,048
What?

286
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,948
Well...

287
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:27,648
I actually touched the tumbler.

288
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,148
I barely touched it,

289
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,448
so I'm not sure I left a print,

290
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:35,748
but it could serve as evidence.

291
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:39,748
So? What does this mean?

292
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,848
In other words,

293
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:47,848
Mr. Kagazume drank from the tumbler he poisoned himself.

294
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,148
What? Could it be...

295
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,348
No way.

296
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:53,648
But why?

297
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:54,948
This is...

298
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,948
"Will and Testament" -the reason.

299
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,648
At Mr. Mouri's instructions,

300
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,548
we found this on another one of Mr. Kagazume's flash drives.

301
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:09,248
It was never revealed publicly in last year's case.

302
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:13,748
It describes the death of a major company's president.

303
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:16,448
The disappearance of a will that exacerbated

304
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:19,048
"The Surviving Family's Darkness!" -an inheritance dispute.

305
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:24,148
How Mr. Hashizume and Mr. Kagazume worked together

306
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:26,748
then to break into the law office and steal it.

307
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:29,548
"Will and Testament" -And this is his written confession.

308
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,048
What?

309
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:35,448
They wrote articles

310
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,348
mocking the people they enraged.

311
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:42,748
But after the attempted murder,

312
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,648
they destroyed the will and never spoke of it again.

313
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:50,548
However, wracked with guilt,

314
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,948
Mr. Kagazume suggested to Mr. Hashizume that they reveal the truth.

315
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,148
But...

316
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:57,748
Mr. Hashizume rejected the idea.

317
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:02,648
What we saw in the restaurant was part of that discussion.

318
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:08,748
Rejecting the idea and fearing the truth would come to light,

319
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:12,248
Mr. Hashizume plotted to kill Mr. Kagazume,

320
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:18,048
without realizing Mr. Kagazume had made his own plans

321
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:20,348
to kill Mr. Hashizume.

322
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,648
Mr. Hashizume and Mr. Kagazume.

323
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:24,848
The murderous intent you felt

324
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,948
due to your similarities grew over years of working together,

325
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,948
eventually becoming murder plots.

326
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:32,848
But you were different in one way.

327
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:35,148
At the very end,

328
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,748
Mr. Kagazume changed his.

329
00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:40,148
This is the last time! You'd better not regret it!

330
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,248
Enough already, you hypocrite!

331
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:04,948
Mr. Kagazume realized you deliberately took his tumbler,

332
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:09,848
and realized you'd come up with the same plan.

333
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:13,048
We found signs that some of Mr. Kagazume's data had been erased,

334
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:15,248
so we restored it.

335
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:20,548
After Mr. Hashizume's death was ruled a suicide,

336
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:24,148
he wrote that he would also kill himself.

337
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:26,748
What?

338
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:30,848
He changed his plan

339
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:34,948
to make the remorseless Mr. Hashizume suffer.

340
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,848
And there's one more thing.

341
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:38,348
Yes.

342
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,048
According to his physician,

343
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:43,448
Mr. Kagazume was sick and had not much time left to live.

344
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:47,748
After judging himself guilty,

345
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:51,048
he plotted to frame Mr. Hashizume for his own murder.

346
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:54,648
He may have been going for a double suicide,

347
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:57,848
since you're so similar.

348
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:00,248
He should've minded his own business.

349
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:04,148
It was a huge scoop!

350
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:06,148
We did whatever it took

351
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,548
to expose the unsightly darkness within people!

352
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:12,748
We brought lots of things to light!

353
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,948
He should've thanked me!

354
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,648
Don't be absurd!

355
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:20,848
You call yourself a reporter?

356
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,848
What did you gain from writing this article?

357
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,948
Money? Fame? Think about it.

358
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:31,248
Did your article make a single person happy?

359
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:43,148
I wish Mr. Kagazume had been judged by the law

360
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:47,148
and atoned for his crime instead.

361
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:54,148
That same day, Mr. Hashizume was arrested

362
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,448
for the attempted murder of Mr. Kagazume

363
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,948
and stealing the will one year earlier.

364
00:23:21,648 --> 00:23:24,748
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad? You must be tired.

365
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,848
What do you want for dinner?

366
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:28,948
Western or Japanese?

367
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,548
Depends on what I drink.

368
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:35,448
After beer, will I have wine, cold sake or shochu?

369
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,448
Or will I have whiskey?

370
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:40,648
They're all liquor. They're all the same.

371
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:46,448
Listen, kid, wine and sake have their own uniqueness and flavor.

372
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:50,548
And shochu has its own unique...

373
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,948
I'm too young to know what you're talking about.

374
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:58,348
"Next Episode"

375
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:02,748
Yeah. They're both probably dead.

376
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:05,148
It's my fault.

377
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:08,948
The sweater he was wearing was from a pretty high-end brand.

378
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:13,248
If he was strapped for cash, he couldn't have bought that.

379
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:18,548
I thought I'd give you an accurate version of the events.

380
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:24,348
Next Conan, "Result of the Draw"

381
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,991
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,291
"Potted plant"

383
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,591
Their names and faces are so similar.

384
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,391
So names and natures often agree.

385
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:34,191
But your detective skills are weak.
