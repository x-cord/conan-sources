1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,970
After finishing her shift, Sergeant
Miike Naeko sang away her troubles

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,880
over Detective Chiba at a karaoke
box with two senior female officers.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,050
On the way home...

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:14,710
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,170
Momosaki Toko (28)
Transportation Department
(Sergeant)
Yagi Shiori (28)
Transportation Department
(Lieutenant)
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,350
Are you okay? Can you handle her?

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,800
I'll be fine.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,680
Chiba-kun... You big dummy...

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,570
Excuse me.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,700
I've been hearing the sound of a small girl
crying in the park bathroom for a while.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,190
Could you go check it out?

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,430
Is someone there?

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,090
I knew it. I'd sensed an
odd presence recently.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,260
I'm a cop.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,420
Looks like you chose the
wrong target for your trap.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,410
I didn't choose wrong.

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,770
I didn't choose the wrong target!

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,020
The body of Sergeant Momosaki
was discovered in the park.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,900
Next to it was a bent 100 yen coin.

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,990
There was also a mark that led us to believe
the body had been pointing at something.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,770
And in the direction she was pointing was...

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,780
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,660
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,190
Risking her life to send a message!

25
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,080
Stop the chain of assault cases!

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,830
Always determining the one truth

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,650
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

28
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,970
his name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:37,547
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Two)

30
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:40,917
"Target: MPD Transportation
Department, Part Two!"
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Two)

31
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,947
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Two)

32
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,757
Please stand back.

33
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:54,617
Yes.

34
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,787
Not yet.

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:06,437
Were the victim Sergeant Momosaki
and Lieutenant Yagi close?

36
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,517
Yeah, apparently they were
high school classmates.

37
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,657
Weren't you, too, Yumi-san?

38
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:14,437
You called them a bunch of times
while we were at the karaoke box.

39
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,447
You again, Yumi?

40
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:19,177
If you have time to call, come sing with us.

41
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,197
It'll be just like high school.

42
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:25,197
Yeah, that's right. You
should join us, Yumi-san.

43
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:27,707
Oh, that.

44
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,637
That's someone different.

45
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:33,107
That was their classmate Yumiko.

46
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,737
Yumiko-san?

47
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:38,337
I think she works as a
hostess in Ginza these days.

48
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,967
And they called that friend Yumi?

49
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:46,977
I told them to call her something
else since it's confusing.

50
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:56,987
So, you really have no idea if
anyone resented Sergeant Momosaki?

51
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:02,377
I can think of way too many people who
might have resented her, justified or not.

52
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:09,107
Oh, but three of the traffic violators

53
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:12,247
they fined made a bunch of complaints.

54
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,027
When was that? Where did the incidents occur?

55
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,887
It was a week ago.

56
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:21,167
I think all three were at an intersection
on Fifth Street in Beika City.

57
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:25,257
Fifth Street is right next to
the Mori Detective Agency.

58
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,507
Do you remember those three?

59
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,567
Yeah.

60
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,837
Miike and I helped question them.

61
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,517
I wrote their names down.

62
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:38,687
The first was Aono Kengo-san, who was
not only using his phone while driving,

63
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,917
Aono Kengo
The first was Aono Kengo-san, who was
not only using his phone while driving,

64
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,527
but didn't have a driver's license.
Aono Kengo

65
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:44,867
The second, who was driving a motorcycle against traffic without a helmet on,

66
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:45,837
Akamine Manji
The second, who was driving a motorcycle against traffic without a helmet on,

67
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,537
was Akamine Manji-san.
Akamine Manji

68
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:50,647
The third was Shiroyama Yuzo-san,

69
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,207
who was driving a vehicle with an expired
inspection without a seat belt on.

70
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,647
Shiroyama Yuzo
who was driving a vehicle with an expired
inspection without a seat belt on.

71
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:55,037
Shiroyama Yuzo

72
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,877
All three seemed to be in a big hurry.

73
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,887
Since they tried to flee before
they were issued tickets,

74
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:04,157
they were forced to arrest them
for interference of public duties.

75
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:06,497
Those three sound suspicious.

76
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:07,987
According to what we heard earlier,

77
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:13,057
Sergeant Momosaki felt someone had been
following her since about a week ago, too.

78
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,607
Damn.

79
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,377
I thought the old man
might have seen something,

80
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,067
but a week ago he was off on a trip
with the neighborhood association.

81
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,587
But wait.

82
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:25,317
Maybe Poirot's Amuro-san saw something.

83
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:27,197
Hey, Conan!

84
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,327
We're going to school!

85
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,957
O-Okay!

86
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:34,757
How did it go?

87
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:38,147
The victim was a female police officer
with the transportation department.

88
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,867
What? A policewoman was killed?

89
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,807
This is a serious case.

90
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,467
That's so scary.

91
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,657
Right, Ai-chan?

92
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,347
Yeah...

93
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,247
I find a kid who barges into a
crime scene far scarier, Kudo-kun.

94
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:55,547
Is something wrong?

95
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,187
Not really.

96
00:06:58,037 --> 00:07:02,847
Sounds like we'll have to share what
we have on those three traffic violators.

97
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,167
I'll pass the word on.

98
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,807
I'll also see if I can find anything else.

99
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:07,737
Please do.

100
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,427
Well, we're heading back to our post.

101
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:12,407
Let us know if there are any developments.

102
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:13,407
Okay.

103
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:14,867
Miike!

104
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:41,897
Incorrect passcode has been entered ten times
Reformatting device

105
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:43,357
Damn!

106
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,997
I'm impressed you found this place.

107
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,017
I asked one of your colleagues from work.

108
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:03,247
They said you'd be here
if you weren't at home.

109
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,097
Japan's police truly are exceptional.

110
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,757
I knew it!

111
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,757
You're the one who killed Toko!

112
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:15,097
Well? What do the exceptional
police want with me?

113
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:17,517
Have you come to get revenge on me?

114
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,897
Turn yourself in.

115
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:22,627
It's not too late.

116
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,477
Turn yourself in immediately.

117
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:28,347
You'll follow the established rules
and accept the judgment of the law.

118
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,917
Exceptional and rigidly follows the rules.

119
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,767
You truly are an insect.

120
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,037
Hold on!

121
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:30,647
Just one more.

122
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:33,937
MPD to all stations.

123
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:36,017
A woman bleeding from the head

124
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:39,347
has been discovered in an alleyway
off Third Street in Haido City.

125
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:44,687
All officers and patrols in the
neighborhood, please head to the location.

126
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,467
That's nearby, Chiba-kun.

127
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,607
Let's check it out.

128
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,617
C-Commissioner Kuroda.

129
00:09:58,037 --> 00:09:59,537
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:03,717
I happened to be in the area,
so I came to the scene.

131
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:07,237
But now it's clear.

132
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:09,127
What? What is it?

133
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:13,127
One of the officers who arrived knew her.

134
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:19,767
The victim is Lieutenant Yagi Shiori
of the MPD Transportation Department.

135
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:25,007
And next to her body is a 100
yen coin stuck inside her phone.

136
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,357
Just like the one found next
to the body of the officer

137
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:32,127
discovered in the park this
morning, it was deliberately bent.

138
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:36,217
100 yen coins are engraved
with a cherry blossom.

139
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,407
It goes without saying that the cherry
blossom is the emblem of the Japanese police.

140
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,417
Th-Then this is...

141
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:47,317
Yes, without a doubt.

142
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:54,427
This case is a serial murder
of female police officers.

143
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,894
What? Seriously?

144
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,704
Someone died at the bottom
of an apartment building.

145
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:09,654
No way.

146
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:11,384
Where? Nearby?

147
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:12,334
Apartment Incident
There's a ton of police here...

148
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,754
Crap, someone's dead
I happened to be there

149
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:14,904
All these cops
Something serious is going on
Apartment Incident

150
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:14,914
Apartment Incident

151
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:29,134
The victim was MPD Transportation
Department Lieutenant Yagi Shiori,

152
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,424
twenty-eight years old.

153
00:11:31,134 --> 00:11:34,874
Judging by the body's condition,
she died from the fall.

154
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:39,434
She was probably pushed from this
apartment building's external stairs.

155
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:44,684
Not only that, but like the body of Sergeant
Momosaki that was discovered this morning,

156
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,694
a bent 100 yen coin was left at the scene.

157
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:51,574
Because 100 yen coins are
engraved with a cherry blossom,

158
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,874
the emblem of the police,

159
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:58,704
it's extremely likely that these crimes were
committed by an individual who resents the police.

160
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:07,114
Naturally, all female
officers like the victims,

161
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,714
as well as all other officers,
should be on their guard.

162
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:14,794
Don't overlook any illegal activity
when you arrest the suspect.

163
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:15,964
Yes, sir!

164
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,444
Let's canvas the area first.

165
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:21,484
Yeah. We'll start with
this apartment building.

166
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,224
Let's split up and ask around.

167
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:29,394
Commissioner Kuroda, we'll see you
later at the investigation meeting.

168
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,234
Yeah.

169
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:34,074
What is it, Sato?

170
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:35,654
Something on your mind?

171
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:39,824
Nothing. It's just Lieutenant Yagi's face...

172
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:44,314
We believe the wound on
her right temporal region

173
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:47,644
was inflicted when she fell to the ground.

174
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:51,084
In that case, it would be more natural
for the wound to be facing the ground,

175
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:54,084
but it's currently facing upwards,
in the opposite direction, instead.

176
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,344
Then there's this. The victim's
hand is reaching towards her phone.

177
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:03,594
It's not standard for a person to use
a touchscreen without looking at it.

178
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:07,774
If the victim was trying to place a call,

179
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:11,014
her head would be facing
left, towards her phone.

180
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,604
But she's facing right, preventing
her from seeing the screen.

181
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:16,364
Like her head wound, it feels unnatural.

182
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,294
Is it possible that it's accidental?

183
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:22,724
Sometimes the shock from a fall can cause
a person to face a different direction.

184
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:25,874
It's also still unclear what she was
attempting to do with her phone.

185
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,624
True, but look closely at this.

186
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:32,974
There aren't any large visible
wounds on the victim's face.

187
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:37,134
But there appears to be some kind of
scratch on just the tip of her nose.

188
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:43,174
Similarly, the lipstick around her mouth is
smudged as though it was wiped in one direction.

189
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:47,394
It's as if she forced herself to face right
while scraping her face against the ground.

190
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:48,854
You're right.

191
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:52,644
Maybe she followed the direction
the suspect fled with her eyes.

192
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:56,654
We'll have forensics examine
her phone immediately.

193
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:59,164
If she called someone,

194
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:02,904
they may have heard something.

195
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:06,354
They didn't hear anything.

196
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:08,664
I broke it before they answered.

197
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,644
But there's one more.

198
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,414
Where's the last one?

199
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:17,104
Aiko... The one who took Aiko's life...

200
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,674
That's right.

201
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,634
They tried to run, so we arrested them.

202
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,604
We have to question them now.

203
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:25,504
We'll be pretty late by
the time we head there.

204
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,054
That woman...

205
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,604
We'll definitely be there.

206
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:30,814
Tell her to sing by herself.

207
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,254
Okay.

208
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,394
Where is that woman?

209
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,234
You heard her.

210
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,464
See you later, Yumi.

211
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:45,904
Do the traffic violators from a week
ago have something to do with this?

212
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:49,884
I'm not surprised no one's talking
about some traffic violations.

213
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:58,424
I guess I'll go to Poirot to gather information.

214
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:03,594
A week ago?

215
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,804
Poirot Coffee
A week ago?

216
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:08,314
There was a commotion at that
intersection over there.

217
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,184
Could you tell me more
about what happened then?

218
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,024
What is it?

219
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:18,544
Conan-kun wants to know more about the
commotion that happened at the intersection a week ago.

220
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,524
I see.

221
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:24,934
Two female officers got into a
shouting match with some drivers.

222
00:15:25,464 --> 00:15:28,784
Apparently there were three
traffic violators in a row.

223
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,504
They said, "We'll question you all at
once, so come down to the station."

224
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:36,294
"We've got your license plate numbers,
so there will be hell to pay if you run."

225
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,044
Was anyone really angry when they said that?

226
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:44,024
All three of them were angry.

227
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:47,554
They had someplace they had to be right away.

228
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:54,074
The man who was using his phone while driving

229
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,694
and forgot his license cried
that his neurotic girlfriend

230
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:59,234
was waiting for him and asked
to be allowed to leave.

231
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:06,214
The man driving against traffic without
a helmet shouted that his ex-wife

232
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,014
was being abused by her new boyfriend
and demanded they let him go rescue her.

233
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:13,764
The man driving with an expired inspection
without a seat belt was panicked

234
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,534
because his sister was being stalked

235
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:20,294
and she'd be in danger if he wasn't with her.

236
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,544
What about it?

237
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:27,924
Both of the female officers they
were arguing with were murdered.

238
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,244
No way.

239
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:34,814
Did any of those three men
participate in sports like baseball

240
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:40,064
or golf or work in the music industry?

241
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:42,064
What? Why?

242
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:48,074
The first female officer murdered in
the park was pointing at a swing set.

243
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:51,074
I thought the "swing" might be significant.

244
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,974
Oh, right. We say we swing
baseball bats and golf clubs.

245
00:16:55,974 --> 00:17:00,084
And getting into a jazz rhythm
is also called swinging.

246
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:02,214
I see.

247
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:06,964
But I couldn't tell what those three men did.

248
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,354
I see.

249
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,594
Call me if you remember anything.

250
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:14,734
Okay.

251
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,914
Conan-kun is just like a detective.

252
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,104
It's true.

253
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:24,864
Not only that, but he's a
pretty shrewd private eye.

254
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:37,084
You let your guard down, Akai Shuichi.

255
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:42,084
I could say the same thing to you.

256
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:43,934
Don't be ridiculous.

257
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:48,464
You lost the moment I saw through
your disguise as Okiya Subaru.

258
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:54,474
What if I knew you'd try
to sneak in here today?

259
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,414
A private eye?

260
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:01,604
Wouldn't that be interesting if it were true?

261
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,124
Is that true, Miwako?

262
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:26,334
Yeah. We just finished the
investigation meeting.

263
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,714
No. Yagi-san, too...

264
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:33,844
It's likely the suspect is going
after female police officers.

265
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:37,444
You two are both in the
Transportation Department, too.

266
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:38,724
Be careful.

267
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,234
Yagi-san...

268
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:42,754
Miike.

269
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,354
Yes, ma'am. I'm fine. I won't cry anymore.

270
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,544
Do they know who the suspect is?

271
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:56,364
They're calling the three traffic
violators they arrested a week ago,

272
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,534
but none of them are answering.

273
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,134
Is the only clue we have that swing set?

274
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:03,294
Yeah. About that...

275
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:06,964
Did Lieutenant Yagi have any habits?

276
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:11,044
Like expressing something by
turning her head like this?

277
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:14,874
Who knows? I've never
heard anything like that.

278
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:16,094
Her head?

279
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:19,934
I'll send the photo of her to your phone.

280
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:24,444
Contact me immediately if you notice
anything after seeing the photo.

281
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,694
I'm going out canvassing after
this, so I'm counting on you.

282
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:28,944
S-Sure...

283
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,064
Yagi-san...

284
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:39,204
It's true. It looks like she
forced her head to turn.

285
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:47,074
This is the alleyway off Third
Street in Haido City, right?

286
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,754
Yes.

287
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:50,514
What? Wait a minute.

288
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:53,404
This alleyway and the park...

289
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,954
A number I don't recognize is calling me.

290
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,774
Y-Yes? Hello?

291
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,394
Why are you blocking my calls?!

292
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,654
Ch-Chukichi?

293
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,244
Sorry, sorry.

294
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:16,394
You kept calling every ten
minutes, so I blocked you.

295
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,494
Because I'm worried!

296
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:22,414
The news just said another
female officer had been killed!

297
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:25,384
Yeah, thanks.

298
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:28,164
By the way, whose phone are you calling from?

299
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,794
A senior shogi player's phone.

300
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,784
He was here today at the
shogi hall for an interview.

301
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:36,134
Aren't you bothering him?

302
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,174
Yeah, but...

303
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:43,194
In any case, you should hurry home and only
think thoughts about your upcoming title match.

304
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:45,054
O-Okay...

305
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:47,184
Yumi-tan, you should head
home early today, too.

306
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:51,254
You were up all night playing mahjong at my
place last night, so you haven't gotten much sleep.

307
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,294
All night mahjong?

308
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,514
Oh, and don't forget to eat a proper meal.

309
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,654
And if you don't hydrate enough,
it's not good for your skin.

310
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:57,604
Yeah, yeah. Got it.
And if you don't hydrate enough,
it's not good for your skin.

311
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,354
I'm just so worried about—
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

312
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:01,704
Jeez, he worries too much.

313
00:21:01,704 --> 00:21:02,864
Yumi-san!

314
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,594
You were up all night playing mahjong again?

315
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:07,554
I told you not to do that!

316
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:08,794
Huh? What?

317
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,304
Man, you're all on my case.

318
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,124
Wait, this is no time for that.

319
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:17,004
Wait, Yumi-san! Where are you going?

320
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:21,394
I've got someplace to stop
by. You can leave without me.

321
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,264
Be careful on your way home.

322
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:25,034
Got it?

323
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,274
Well? Any witnesses?

324
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:35,994
No. At the time of the crime, most
of the residents weren't home.

325
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,904
The only person who was home was
an old man confined to his room.

326
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:42,284
Naturally, he didn't witness the incident.

327
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:45,894
Then we'll canvas the
neighboring residents, too.

328
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,774
Yes, while their memories are still fresh.

329
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,794
Right.

330
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:01,244
I know I took the mini patrol car,

331
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:04,214
but since I'm helping the
investigation, go easy on me.

332
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,184
Wh-Who's there?!

333
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:13,444
Oh, just my imagination.

334
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:18,504
Jeez. I'm jumping at shadows.

335
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:25,954
Let's see. This area is...

336
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:55,734

We may have figured it out,

337
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,584
but calling the number 7155
didn't connect us to anyone.
