1
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.540
We went to Kanazawa.

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.940
Look, Conan!

3
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.340
"Tsuzumi Gate"

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.340
That's the Tsuzumi Gate, right!

5
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.640
It's really shaped just like a drum!

6
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.040
Yes! It's much larger than I thought.

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.340
Mr. Mouri?

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.940
Pops was asked to cooperate in a town revitalization event

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.340
called the "Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour."

10
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.740
How do you do?

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.340
I am Yuzo Tanimoto from the Tourist Bureau.

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.040
-"Yuzo Tanimoto (57)" -We hope you enjoy yourselves today.

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.140
-"Moeko Miyazawa (27)" -I'm Moeko Miyazawa from the Tourist Bureau too.

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.940
-"Yuya Tadokoro (48)" -I'm the CEO of an event planning company,

15
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.640
Yuya Tadokoro.

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.540
-"Osamu Kuranishi (33)" -I'm a staff member, Osamu Kuranishi.

17
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.040
-"Harumi Akiyama (29)" -I'm also a staff member, Harumi Akiyama.

18
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.940
I am the great detective, Kogoro Mouri!

19
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.940
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

20
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.840
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

21
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.540
A deduction event is staged in Kanazawa.

22
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540
The mystery is big-Hyakumangoku!

23
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.540
His name is Detective Conan.

26
00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.669
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kanazawa Part)"

27
00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.569
The event will be staged in Kanazawa and Kaga.

28
00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.869
The participants will travel to several checkpoints

29
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.569
by deciphering codes and gather hints

30
00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.569
to get to the truth behind a certain case and deduce

31
00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.169
who the culprit is.

32
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.469
Checkpoints?

33
00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.369
Yes. We've chosen several tourist spots

34
00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.969
in Kanazawa and Kaga as checkpoints.

35
00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.169
I see.

36
00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.669
So we can go sightseeing while solving the mystery!

37
00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:55.769
Yes.

38
00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.369
You can solve the mystery

39
00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:02.169
by cracking the code you receive at each checkpoint.

40
00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.569
That's sounds like fun.

41
00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.569
It does, doesn't it?

42
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.769
Akiyama has already thought up the codes.

43
00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.569
So, Mr. Mouri, we'd like you to come up with a story

44
00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.369
that would serve as a backdrop for the codes, of this difficult case.

45
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:23.369
We're calling it, "A Challenge from The Great Detective Kogoro Mouri"!

46
00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:24.569
I see.

47
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.469
I understand.

48
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.169
You can count on me!

49
00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.769
Since I, Kogoro Mouri,

50
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.869
have solved countless difficult cases up to now!

51
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:38.569
I'll prepare an exceptionally difficult case for you!

52
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.269
I've got one suggestion to make, though.

53
00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:45.969
Today, in order to get a feel of the event,

54
00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.069
we'll have you actually solve the codes,

55
00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.469
we're thinking of going to each checkpoint.

56
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.769
What do you think?

57
00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:59.669
So, you want to challenge the Great Detective Kogoro Mouri?

58
00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:00.869
Fine.

59
00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:02.769
I'll accept the challenge.

60
00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.569
All the checkpoints for the famous tourist sites

61
00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.069
are in the guidebook.

62
00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.869
Thank you very much.

63
00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.569
So, this is the code for the first checkpoint.

64
00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.969
We start right away?

65
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.369
Let me see.

66
00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:27.369
Experiencing picking fleas in front of a mirror spring?

67
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.769
What's this about?

68
00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:32.769
Look. Only the word "nomitori" are written differently.

69
00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:41.169
"Nomitori"...

70
00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.869
I get it!

71
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:44.069
Since it says "nomitori",

72
00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.369
it means that

73
00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:47.569
I have to delete the characters "no" and "mi" from the sentence!

74
00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.169
When the two characters are deleted, it reads

75
00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.769
"Experience in front of Kaga hot spring".

76
00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:55.269
Experience in front of Kaga hot spring.

77
00:05:55.269 --> 00:06:00.369
"Kaga yu" means Kaga hot spring!

78
00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:06.269
We're going to experience something in front of that hot spring, right?

79
00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:07.669
But wait, Dad.

80
00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.469
Kaga hot springs include the four hot springs of Kaga.

81
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.169
-"Yamanaka Hot Spring" -Yamanaka Hot Spring.

82
00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.369
-"Katayamazu Hot Spring" -Katayamazu Hot Spring.

83
00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:17.169
-"Awazu Hot Spring" -Awazu Hot Spring.

84
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.169
-"Yamashiro Hot Spring" -and Yamashiro Hot Spring.

85
00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.969
All of them located far apart from each other.

86
00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.769
Besides, only the character "mae" is written in Chinese character, right?

87
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:28.969
Maybe that could be a catch?

88
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.869
We'd be inclined to read it "mae" meaning front, from preconception.

89
00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:35.469
But can also be read "zen", right?

90
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:36.469
"Zen"?

91
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.769
Which means experiencing Kaga Yuzen

92
00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.769
Experiencing Kaga Yuzen (Kaga prints and dye).

93
00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:48.269
If I remember correctly. It's...

94
00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:49.269
Here it is!

95
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.969
The "Kaga Yuzen" Traditional Industry Centre!

96
00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.569
It says we can experience Kaga Yuzen here.

97
00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.069
Correct.

98
00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:00.969
Just as would be expected of a great detective.

99
00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.869
Your assistants are very efficient too!

100
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:06.269
Well, I guess so!

101
00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.969
Pops, you've got to tie up loose ends.

102
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.169
"Kaga Yuzen Traditional Industry Centre"

103
00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:32.769
Clothes make the person.

104
00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:36.969
You look nice!

105
00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:39.269
It suits you very well.

106
00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:41.169
Really?

107
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.669
Your wristwatch is nice too, Ms. Akiyama!

108
00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.269
How fashionable to be wearing a large men's watch.

109
00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:49.469
This...

110
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.969
This is not fashion, but rather,

111
00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:53.069
a hand-me-down of my older brother.

112
00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.169
I actually want something more feminine,

113
00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:58.769
but I can't afford it.

114
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.969
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.769
This is the code for the next checkpoint.

116
00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.169
And, at this point,

117
00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:10.269
the first clue to the case would be given to you.

118
00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:11.569
I see.

119
00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:12.869
I understand.

120
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:16.069
Let's see. The next code is...

121
00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:20.469
So and so experience?

122
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:23.669
All I have to do is put four letters in the circles?

123
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.969
Free experience.

124
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:28.069
Jump experience.

125
00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:30.269
PSYE experience?

126
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:32.669
Come on, Dad!

127
00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.869
I got it!

128
00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:37.469
Four circles, stands for "wagashi"

129
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.969
is a homonym for which means Japanese sweets.

130
00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:41.469
I see!

131
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:44.869
In other words, experiencing Japanese sweets?

132
00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:48.569
Found it. The Ishikawa Prefecture Tourist Centre!

133
00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:49.969
Correct.

134
00:08:49.969 --> 00:08:52.169
Well done, sonny!

135
00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:55.769
No room for the great detective, eh!

136
00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:58.469
You can say that again.

137
00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:04.669
You guys, show a bit of consideration, will you?

138
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.669
You're making me lose face!

139
00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:08.569
But...

140
00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:13.569
Thief!

141
00:09:21.969 --> 00:09:25.269
Darn it. You'll pay for this!

142
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.969
Idiot.

143
00:09:34.669 --> 00:09:37.569
Are you all right, Miss?

144
00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:40.169
Yes. Thank you very much.

145
00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:41.769
You're a lifesaver!

146
00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:45.369
Thank you so much.

147
00:09:45.369 --> 00:09:47.669
Are you all right, Mr. Mouri?

148
00:09:47.669 --> 00:09:49.369
Yes. Of course.

149
00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:52.169
What an insolent fellow, though.

150
00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:55.169
The next time we find him, let's nab him.

151
00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:59.169
Kanazawa is supposed to be a safe place, and yet...

152
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:03.369
Look this way.

153
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:06.569
I'll take your picture next!

154
00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.669
It's just my imagination?

155
00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:11.669
I feel somebody looking at me.

156
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:17.069
"Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Traditional Products"

157
00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:22.469
"Handmade Japanese Sweets Experience"

158
00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:41.369
"Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Traditional Arts and Crafts"

159
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:09.369
"Ishikawa Prefectural Art Museum"

160
00:11:15.469 --> 00:11:17.369
Okay, smile.

161
00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:18.969
Yes!

162
00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:21.569
What? That couple again?

163
00:11:21.569 --> 00:11:23.569
We sure run into each other.

164
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:25.969
Don't tell me.

165
00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:37.269
Let's go have lunch at Omicho Market Place.

166
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:41.669
"Omicho Market Place"

167
00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:52.169
I am now at Komatsu Hikiyama Exchange Hall Miyossa

168
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:56.769
-"Komatsu Hikiyama Exchange Hall Miyossa" -in Komatsu City!

169
00:11:56.769 --> 00:12:01.669
What? Mr. Kuranishi and Ms. Akiyama, you're engaged?

170
00:12:01.669 --> 00:12:02.669
Yes.

171
00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:06.269
We're planning to get married some time next spring.

172
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:09.569
The same time the Hokuriku Bullet train will start running.

173
00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:12.369
Well that sure is good news.

174
00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:16.769
Sneaking behind my back, you lucky guy.

175
00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.769
Well... Our company doesn't forbid

176
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:21.169
love relationships among employees, does it?

177
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:26.669
Ms. Miyazawa.

178
00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:27.769
What is it?

179
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:31.469
Why are you carrying that heavy looking bag around all the time?

180
00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:33.769
You should've left back on the bus.

181
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:36.169
Well... This is...

182
00:12:36.169 --> 00:12:38.969
Is there something very important in it?

183
00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:42.569
Hey, Conan!

184
00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:45.369
It's rude to ask what's inside of woman's bag, you know?

185
00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:46.969
Oh, I guess so.

186
00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:48.969
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:50.269
It's okay.

188
00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:54.869
Now for the next news.

189
00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:56.469
On May 6, 2010,

190
00:12:56.469 --> 00:12:59.969
the man suspected to attacked an elderly man who lived alone

191
00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:02.769
and robbed of five million yen in Kanazawa

192
00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:07.569
was arrested yesterday after four years

193
00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:10.669
According to the Ishikawa Police,

194
00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:14.769
it seems that this man is denying all charges.

195
00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:15.769
Based on the police investigation...

196
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:16.969
It's true that

197
00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:20.769
he doesn't look to be a bad person just by looking at his mug shot.

198
00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:21.769
No...

199
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:23.369
Well, people who look that way,

200
00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.669
turn out to be criminals most of the time.

201
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:28.569
But, if it turns out to be a false charge,

202
00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.369
it's no laughing matter, right?

203
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:33.769
That person's life would be ruined.

204
00:13:35.969 --> 00:13:39.369
What's wrong, Ms. Akiyama?

205
00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.669
What?

206
00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:43.669
Are you all right?

207
00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:46.369
Yes. It's nothing.

208
00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:10.428
This is good!

209
00:14:10.428 --> 00:14:14.028
It goes great with liquor!

210
00:14:16.928 --> 00:14:18.928
What's wrong, Conan?

211
00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:20.428
What?

212
00:14:20.428 --> 00:14:24.228
I was just thinking they're so many delicious things around.

213
00:14:24.228 --> 00:14:26.928
True.

214
00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:29.528
That couple doesn't seem to be around.

215
00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:33.128
Did you search carefully?

216
00:14:33.128 --> 00:14:36.128
Yes. But, I couldn't find it.

217
00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:39.828
I must've dropped it somewhere.

218
00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:42.128
Is something wrong?

219
00:14:42.128 --> 00:14:43.428
Yes.

220
00:14:43.428 --> 00:14:47.028
Ms. Akiyama seems to have lost the code card.

221
00:14:47.028 --> 00:14:48.128
Come to think of it,

222
00:14:48.128 --> 00:14:52.428
we still weren't given the code card for the next checkpoint.

223
00:14:52.428 --> 00:14:54.928
But, I remember the code!

224
00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:57.728
I'll make a new one right away so no worry.

225
00:14:57.728 --> 00:14:58.828
Gosh.

226
00:14:58.828 --> 00:15:03.428
I'm sorry...

227
00:15:03.428 --> 00:15:07.128
Mr. Mouri, I'm sorry it's handwritten.

228
00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:11.428
This is the code for the next checkpoint.

229
00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:12.528
Let's see...

230
00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:16.728
I won't show it to you guys anymore.

231
00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:20.528
One zero.

232
00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:23.528
One thousand. Fifty. Ten.

233
00:15:23.528 --> 00:15:26.728
Ten (To), five (go), six (ro).

234
00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:29.728
Hey, Ran, give me the guidebook.

235
00:15:33.828 --> 00:15:35.028
Here it is!

236
00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:37.728
The number 1056 stands for Togoro!

237
00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:40.128
G stands for gold!

238
00:15:40.128 --> 00:15:42.328
And the sword stands for ken in Kenroku-en.

239
00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:46.228
In other words, it refers to the Kinjo Reitaku in Keroku-en.

240
00:15:46.228 --> 00:15:47.828
Correct.

241
00:15:47.828 --> 00:15:50.128
Fantastic, Dad.

242
00:15:50.128 --> 00:15:51.828
Bull's eye.

243
00:15:51.828 --> 00:15:55.728
Pop's getting the hang of it.

244
00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:59.028
Well... That's how I do it.

245
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:04.028
But, who is Togoro?

246
00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:05.428
-"Kanazawa Shrine" -Long ago,

247
00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:08.028
a man called Yam Digger, Togoro,

248
00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:10.228
found alluvial gold while washing yams

249
00:16:10.228 --> 00:16:13.628
-"Kinjo Reitaku Well" -at this mountain stream.

250
00:16:13.628 --> 00:16:16.328
Because of this, it became known as Mountain stream where gold is washed.

251
00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:19.728
Thus, the name, Kanazawa.

252
00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:23.928
That's why the code was Togoro and gold.

253
00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:26.028
It's amazing you knew, Dad.

254
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:30.328
It's common sense for any adult to know.

255
00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:33.228
Then, let's head off to Kenroku-en.

256
00:16:33.228 --> 00:16:36.928
Akiyama and I have some arrangements to make so.

257
00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:38.228
We'll join you later.

258
00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:40.028
Same here.

259
00:16:40.028 --> 00:16:43.828
Kuranishi, you mean you want to stay around her that much?

260
00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:45.128
It's not that!

261
00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:48.128
I don't mix work up with love!

262
00:16:51.628 --> 00:16:54.228
"Kenroku-en"

263
00:17:21.028 --> 00:17:24.228
This is the next code.

264
00:17:24.228 --> 00:17:26.528
What's this?

265
00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:29.028
Next, it's deciphering by pictures?

266
00:17:31.628 --> 00:17:35.128
I guess Pops is done for it, this time.

267
00:17:35.128 --> 00:17:39.328
A rhombus and that seems to be an arrowhead.

268
00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:44.128
A rhombus, an arrowhead, and a saddle.

269
00:17:44.128 --> 00:17:47.028
Hishiyagura Turret can be found at the Kanazawa Castle!

270
00:17:47.028 --> 00:17:48.128
True!

271
00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.528
There's a place called Hishiyagura at the Kanazawa Castle!

272
00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:53.128
Correct.

273
00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:55.528
Really?

274
00:17:55.528 --> 00:17:58.928
The Kanazawa Castle's just within a stone's throw.

275
00:17:58.928 --> 00:18:02.428
"Kanazawa Castle"

276
00:18:20.728 --> 00:18:23.228
Here's the next code card.

277
00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:26.428
This will be the last one.

278
00:18:26.428 --> 00:18:28.228
No, Ms. Akiyama!

279
00:18:28.228 --> 00:18:29.828
It not the last one yet.

280
00:18:29.828 --> 00:18:32.828
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

281
00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:36.328
No problem. It's okay.

282
00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:39.028
Don't you notice something?

283
00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:43.828
This one's quite simple.

284
00:18:43.828 --> 00:18:46.928
24 minus 3 is 21, right?

285
00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:48.628
Twenty one.

286
00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:52.128
The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa!

287
00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:54.028
Correct.

288
00:18:54.028 --> 00:18:56.028
There wasn't anything to notice.

289
00:18:56.028 --> 00:18:58.728
It's just simple subtraction.

290
00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:02.128
He's right. It's a bit too easy, don't you think?

291
00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:05.928
I'm sorry, I couldn't think of anything else.

292
00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:08.028
We're a bit pressed for time

293
00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:11.028
so let's head to The 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa.

294
00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:14.328
You'll pay for what you did!

295
00:19:15.828 --> 00:19:18.228
How dare you get in my way?

296
00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:26.028
You're the thief I saw a while ago!

297
00:19:27.928 --> 00:19:31.028
-Hold it! -Are you okay, Mr. Mouri?

298
00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:32.328
Please move.

299
00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:36.028
Hold it!

300
00:19:43.028 --> 00:19:44.428
Wait!

301
00:19:47.128 --> 00:19:48.128
Wait!

302
00:19:48.128 --> 00:19:51.128
Hey. Wait.

303
00:19:51.128 --> 00:19:52.928
Hold it!

304
00:19:57.828 --> 00:20:00.028
Please wait!

305
00:20:04.428 --> 00:20:07.128
What's wrong, Conan?

306
00:20:07.128 --> 00:20:08.328
It hurts.

307
00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:11.728
You didn't tell me that he was that strong, Ms. Miyazawa.

308
00:20:14.228 --> 00:20:15.928
Hey! I said hold it!

309
00:20:15.928 --> 00:20:17.128
What?

310
00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:21.628
What the heck?

311
00:20:21.628 --> 00:20:24.328
There's another one hiding there too.

312
00:20:27.428 --> 00:20:30.428
You're the one who had your handbag snatched a while ago, right?

313
00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:34.828
But, what does Ms. Miyazawa have to do the victim and the thief?

314
00:20:34.828 --> 00:20:38.128
In other words, this was all an act, right?

315
00:20:38.128 --> 00:20:41.328
So, the couple over there was filming us from outside,

316
00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:47.128
while Ms. Miyazawa was filming us from inside her bag.

317
00:20:49.028 --> 00:20:51.528
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:51.528 --> 00:20:55.528
This was actually candid camera for advertising the event.

319
00:20:55.528 --> 00:20:57.528
Candid camera?

320
00:20:57.528 --> 00:20:58.728
Yes.

321
00:20:58.728 --> 00:21:02.528
The couple here is the cameraman and his assistant.

322
00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:04.728
The thief and woman over there

323
00:21:04.728 --> 00:21:09.428
are actors who were hired to act out coincidental occurrences.

324
00:21:09.428 --> 00:21:14.328
And, Ms. Akiyama and I were secretly filming all of you.

325
00:21:14.328 --> 00:21:16.028
Ms. Akiyama too?

326
00:21:16.028 --> 00:21:18.628
Mr. Mouri, we've been looking for.

327
00:21:18.628 --> 00:21:21.628
I'm sorry. They found out.

328
00:21:22.728 --> 00:21:26.128
What's going on?

329
00:21:26.128 --> 00:21:27.628
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:27.628 --> 00:21:29.528
I'll explain the details,

331
00:21:29.528 --> 00:21:32.128
so let's head back.

332
00:21:41.028 --> 00:21:43.028
Akiyama.

333
00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:44.228
Harumi?

334
00:21:45.828 --> 00:21:47.128
Harumi.

335
00:21:47.128 --> 00:21:49.828
Hurry! Please call an ambulance!

336
00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:50.928
Okay!

337
00:21:50.928 --> 00:21:52.828
Hey, don't film this!

338
00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:55.228
This is not an act. It's for real.

339
00:21:55.228 --> 00:21:56.428
What?

340
00:21:56.428 --> 00:21:58.528
It's not candid camera.

341
00:21:58.528 --> 00:22:01.028
Then, why was Ms. Akiyama?

342
00:22:06.228 --> 00:22:10.328
It doesn't look to be a robbery.

343
00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:13.028
If this was the doing of a spree killer killing at random,

344
00:22:13.028 --> 00:22:16.028
it's strange that there aren't any other victims.

345
00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:21.328
Then, the killer specifically went after Ms. Akiyama.

346
00:22:24.228 --> 00:22:28.228
Just what is the meaning of this?

347
00:23:51.928 --> 00:23:55.228
Ran, you go.

348
00:23:55.228 --> 00:23:56.928
But...

349
00:23:56.928 --> 00:24:00.228
If you get too flustered, you'll look even more suspicious.

350
00:24:00.228 --> 00:24:01.928
Hey, hey.

351
00:24:01.928 --> 00:24:05.028
These card that fell out of Ms. Akiyama's bag.

352
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:09.728
I see. So, that's the story.

353
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:15.828
That's why to keep anyone from fleeing, Ran was sent over instead.

354
00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:17.028
Next Conan,

355
00:24:17.028 --> 00:24:21.428
"Kaga Hyakumangoku Mystery Tour (Kaga Hot Spring Part)"

356
00:24:36.628 --> 00:24:39.028
Next Conan's Hint:

357
00:24:39.028 --> 00:24:41.628
"Code card".

358
00:24:41.628 --> 00:24:42.928
Finally, off to the hot springs!

359
00:24:42.928 --> 00:24:44.128
You've got work to do before that, right?

360
00:24:44.128 --> 00:24:46.328
Maybe the hot springs are on candid camera too.
