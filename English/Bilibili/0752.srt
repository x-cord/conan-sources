1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,140
After all the fuss over finding the owner of the calico cat, Tai

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,340
we decide to visit Mr. Masuko

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,340
who turned out to be Tai's real owner.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,640
What's with this cat?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,340
Sir! Is anything wrong?

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,840
Well, although this cat doesn't seem to be hurt,

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,640
it's got blood on its paws.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,740
Which means...

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,440
Don't tell me that Mr. Masuko's...

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,840
Don't tell me...

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,140
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,940
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,640
The Detective Squad and locked room trick.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,540
What is the cute calico cat's secret?

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,240
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:37,369
"Lucky Calico Cat Case (Part 2)"

19
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,469
Mr. Masuko?

20
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,369
Please answer me if you're okay!

21
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,669
Mr. Masuko!

22
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,969
Sonny, maybe he could just be sleeping?

23
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,569
After all, the door lock seems to be in use too.

24
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,969
But, you heard a strange sound, didn't you, sir?

25
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,469
Yes.

26
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:57,369
A loud sound like something hitting something.

27
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,169
Moreover, there's blood on the paws of Mr. Masuko's cat.

28
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,269
I'm sure something happened inside!

29
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,769
Ai, get an ambulance!

30
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,869
Okay!

31
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:11,969
Do you guys have a string or something?

32
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,269
Any tape or wire too?

33
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,269
I've got yarn!

34
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,669
I've got some Band-Aid.

35
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,669
I have a clip.

36
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,069
But, what do you intend to do with these things?

37
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,669
I'm going to open the door lock!

38
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,069
First I tie the string onto the U-shaped bar of the door lock,

39
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,569
then I fix the knot on to the tip of the bar with the Band-Aid.

40
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,469
I pull the string through the clip

41
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,169
and fix the clip onto the inside of the door,

42
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:43,869
all's set.

43
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:45,769
All I need to do next is close the door

44
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,769
then pull hard on the string.

45
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:50,269
It opened!

46
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,169
Where's your room, sir?

47
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,969
Over there.

48
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:55,969
Then...

49
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,569
the room closest to this room is...

50
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,069
the room to the left.

51
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,669
Hey, Conan?

52
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:01,969
The room beyond?

53
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,369
It's an accident.

54
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,869
He tried to change the florescent light

55
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,169
by standing the chair up on the bed,

56
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,469
then he lost his balance and hit his head on the side table.

57
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,569
I do that sometimes too.

58
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:23,469
But, on top of the bed is unstable and dangerous.

59
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,269
Please don't do something like that!

60
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,969
Because the mattress on your bed is expensive and fluffy!

61
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:34,769
How come you know, about Officer Sato's bed?

62
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,769
Have you ever slept there?

63
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:38,969
Well, no...

64
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:42,469
I want to sleep over at Officer Sato's place too!

65
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,469
Never mind that,

66
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,069
but how is he, the owner of this room?

67
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,669
The surgery's over, but it seems he's unconscious

68
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,869
and in critical condition.

69
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,569
Well, if he regains consciousness,

70
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,269
he'll be grateful to you!

71
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,369
Because thanks to Conan who opened the door lock right away

72
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:01,669
his life was saved!

73
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,569
No, more than that...

74
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,869
if he comes to, I think he'll tell you...

75
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:10,169
who attacked him.

76
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,569
Attacked?

77
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,169
Isn't this an accident?

78
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,869
But, the chair's on top of the covers!

79
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,869
If he were going to stand the chair on the bed,

80
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,769
don't you think he'd have at least flipped the covers over?

81
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,269
Besides, see...

82
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:27,869
Mr. Masuko's still wearing a slipper on one leg!

83
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,869
If he were going to climb on the bed or a chair,

84
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:32,069
I think he'd take off his slippers, no?

85
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,969
I guess so...

86
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:37,069
Besides, I think the florescent light that he removed

87
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,269
was an old one that he was planning replace...

88
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,769
But the edges aren't black at all, right?

89
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,269
They look almost brand new.

90
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,469
Which means that someone knocked Mr. Masuko

91
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,769
over in this bedroom, hurt him badly,

92
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,169
and set things up to make it look like an accident.

93
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,769
From the time the next door neighbor heard a strange sound

94
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,269
to the time the manager came to this room,

95
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,669
it seems to have taken an hour.

96
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,269
Which means, there would've been enough time

97
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,269
to set up the trick.

98
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,869
But...

99
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,669
there seems to be only one spare key to the front door,

100
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,169
and both were found on the shelf of the living room.

101
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,469
Moreover, the door lock of the front door, how on earth...

102
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,869
That's all done with!

103
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,769
Right, Conan?

104
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:26,269
Since the door lock could be unlocked from outside,

105
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,969
to lock it would be even.

106
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:30,469
Oh, no. I haven't figured it out till there yet.

107
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,669
Hey, look!

108
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,269
An image here.

109
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,269
True!

110
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,769
Hey, you guys? What're you doing?

111
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,969
The door phone!

112
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:50,069
It seems to record the images of anybody who pushes it.

113
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,569
There is it!

114
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,869
Three people are shown on it an hour before we got here.

115
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,869
Even the sound is recorded,

116
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,269
and since they all gave their names

117
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,069
if you compare it with the address,

118
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,469
you may be able to find out who and where they're from, no?

119
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,569
There's no time for you two to be lovey-dovey!

120
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,269
Gee, it's because you said something you didn't have to, Officer Takagi!

121
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,369
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,669
On the table here are wrapping paper and an old cat carry.

123
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:18,869
He was really planning to give that calico cat away

124
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:21,269
to someone as a gift.

125
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,169
There are folding marks and ripped places here

126
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,169
and there on the wrapping paper, which means...

127
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,369
Did someone open what was already wrapped once?

128
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,069
The tape and scissors are here...

129
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,469
but the wastebasket nearby is empty.

130
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:41,969
Why that think isn't it here?

131
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,469
We found them quite quickly, didn't we?

132
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,869
The three who were shown on the door phone.

133
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,869
Yes. But the only one who was invited in

134
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,969
was the one who came first.

135
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,869
The second one was only answered at the door

136
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:02,069
and the third one says he rang the doorbell at the front entrance

137
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,569
but got no answer so left.

138
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,369
All three are suspicious.

139
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,769
True.

140
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:13,869
If the second one came while the first one was in the room,

141
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,169
if after the second guest went home,

142
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:18,869
the first one would've been able to commit the crime too.

143
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:19,969
Come to think of it,

144
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,069
when you guys rang the door phone at the entrance,

145
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,269
how was Mr. Masuko?

146
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,669
We didn't ring it!

147
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,569
We thought of ringing it

148
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:30,869
but a resident who was on his way out came,

149
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,569
so we went inside as he opened the door.

150
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:36,269
We wanted to surprise him by showing up without telling him!

151
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:38,769
We did have an appointment with him anyway too.

152
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,069
We also knew his room number besides.

153
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:43,069
I see.

154
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:49,169
"Furuyo Tsuyuguchi (41)" -Yes. It's true that I met Masuko today

155
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:52,669
"Bar Owner" -and had black tea in his living room.

156
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,169
I stayed until one song completed playing,

157
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,269
so I think I stayed about 10 minutes.

158
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,569
Record?

159
00:08:58,569 --> 00:08:59,569
Yes.

160
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:03,969
I'm collecting vintage jazz records

161
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,869
and since Mr. Masuko told me

162
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:09,169
that he found the record that I was looking for,

163
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,869
I came and while I was at it,

164
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:13,269
he let me listen to one song!

165
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,969
Did the door bell ring while you were here?

166
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:20,769
I wonder because I was using headphones.

167
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,869
I'm sorry,

168
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,069
but may I be excused to go to the restroom?

169
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,169
Yes, go ahead.

170
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,269
Thank you.

171
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,069
Hey, sonny?

172
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,669
Why don't you turn off the light after using the restroom?

173
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,669
I'm sorry!

174
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:52,469
I can't stand wasting money, so I...

175
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,969
"Masuko" -Like I said before...

176
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,669
I only talked to him at the front door,

177
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,969
"Mari Aso (28), Former employee" -so I didn't go into the room.

178
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,569
I didn't have an appointment to see him either.

179
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,769
It seemed that he had a guest.

180
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,169
What did you want with Mr. Masuko?

181
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:13,169
The fact is I was fired from President Masuko's company.

182
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:15,969
So, I came to tell him goodbye.

183
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:18,469
Are you saying that you came to complain?

184
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,569
No, to the contrary!

185
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:24,169
I was fired because I really goofed things up.

186
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:28,969
Besides, the president found me new employment,

187
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:32,669
so I wanted to thank him for that too.

188
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,669
How cute.

189
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,169
May I carry him?

190
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,169
Yes!

191
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:39,969
Cute.

192
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,669
Tai is happily wagging his tail!

193
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,569
My, true.

194
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,469
Do you own a cat or something?

195
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:50,469
No, my parents don't like animals,

196
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,869
I like them, though.

197
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,369
Don't make me repeat myself.

198
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:58,769
"Rinpei Urushiya (53)" -It's true that I went to the front door.

199
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,669
"Novelist" -But no matter how many times I pushed the door bell,

200
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:05,269
he didn't answer so I gave up and left!

201
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,869
Then, how did you get into the condo?

202
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,669
When I pushed the door phone on the 1st floor,

203
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,469
he opened it for me!

204
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,669
I'm not sure if it was him or not

205
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,669
because it's not that he said anything.

206
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,869
What's your relationship with Mr. Masuko?

207
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,869
I used to know him since my university days.

208
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,969
We're novelists that debuted in the same year.

209
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,869
Well, his novels didn't sell at all,

210
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:31,869
so it seems he gave up at an early stage, though.

211
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:35,469
As for myself, my novels only sold during the first stages too.

212
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,769
Thinking back now, I guess he who chose

213
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,269
another way of life did the right thing.

214
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,069
And, what brought you here?

215
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,969
I came so that we could think up some idea for a novel.

216
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,369
He used to keep me company

217
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,369
every time I got stuck from before.

218
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,269
Get that cat away from me.

219
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,469
How annoying.

220
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:57,769
You don't like cats, sir?

221
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,869
Yes.

222
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,969
I was scratched by a stray in the neighborhood this morning too.

223
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,369
I've got Band-Aid.

224
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,269
No need to worry!

225
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,869
I've finished treating it already.

226
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,569
Thank you.

227
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:15,669
Well, if this cat were like the cats in those famous novels,

228
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,169
a great detective cat it would be a different story, though.

229
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,569
The order in which they pushed the door phone

230
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,769
was Mrs. Tsuyuguchi, Miss Aso and Mr. Urushiya, that's okay.

231
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,569
But, since the neighbor's not sure

232
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,669
what time he heard the strange sound,

233
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,169
it's tough to narrow down the suspects.

234
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,669
I guess we've no other choice but to wait

235
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,769
for Mr. Masuko to regain consciousness.

236
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:44,069
No, I don't think we need to.

237
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:46,369
See.

238
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,169
It's that mischievous look.

239
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:04,786
And?

240
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:08,086
Those three are the people who came

241
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:11,886
around the time the neighbor heard the suspicious noise?

242
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:12,886
Yes.

243
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,386
But...

244
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:18,686
The door was locked and bolted, wasn't it?

245
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:21,386
Do we really have a case here?

246
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,486
Yes, sir.

247
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,986
The crime scene indicates that it's not an accident

248
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:26,686
according to Conan.

249
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:29,886
And, is Conan in the room?

250
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:32,886
No. He left saying he had some shopping to do.

251
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:33,986
I'm back!

252
00:13:35,086 --> 00:13:36,886
Conan!

253
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,386
What did you buy?

254
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:41,686
The thing that was missing from Mr. Masuko's room!

255
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,386
The thing that was missing?

256
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,186
This!

257
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,886
A ribbon for wrapping!

258
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,386
After wrapping the present,

259
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:52,086
you usually cut off the edges of the ribbon with scissors.

260
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:55,786
Since there were no cut pieces of ribbon in the trash box,

261
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,586
though there was a scissors,

262
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,986
I think that the length of the ribbon happened to be just right.

263
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,786
The content was an old cat carry

264
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,286
and besides tape was also there.

265
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:09,286
So, I'm sure Mr. Masuko wrapped himself and not at a store.

266
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:13,486
But... What does that tell us?

267
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,886
Are you half-asleep?

268
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,886
The fact that it's gone

269
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:20,186
means that the perp used it for something.

270
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:21,886
Half-asleep?

271
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,986
For example, to lock the room

272
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,886
and make it look like an accident.

273
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,886
At any rate, let's try it out and see

274
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,786
whether it can really be done or not.

275
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:38,886
First, how the safety lock was latched!

276
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:40,986
Pass the ribbon between the space of the door

277
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:43,486
and the bolt so it hooks on

278
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,986
then go outside holding onto both ends of the ribbon

279
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,086
and close the door.

280
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,486
All you have to do next is pull on both ends of the ribbon.

281
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,886
Okay, Mitsuhiko!

282
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,186
Roger.

283
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,586
-Start pulling! -Okay.

284
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:02,986
It... it worked!

285
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,386
Next, locking the door.

286
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,986
Open the door

287
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,886
and after checking if it's bolted.

288
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,486
Pull the ribbon off

289
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:14,586
and make a knot in the middle of it.

290
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:16,786
I've made a knot.

291
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:18,986
Then looped the ribbon around the knob,

292
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:22,386
to lock the door, so that the knot hooks on

293
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,986
pull the end of the ribbon outside and close the door.

294
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:29,286
Then, pull it diagonally upwards from outside.

295
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:32,886
Amazing.

296
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:34,786
The ribbon really locked the door.

297
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,986
But unlike the safety lock,

298
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,986
you can pull the ribbon out this time, can you?

299
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,886
Hey! Pull with all your might!

300
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,286
Okay.

301
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:46,386
But the door is closed

302
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,386
and the knot is blocking it from pulling off.

303
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:52,686
Strange, it was supposed to work.

304
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,586
I guess he's just a kid after all.

305
00:15:55,586 --> 00:16:00,286
When you got here, the ribbon wasn't here, was it?

306
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,886
-No. -There was nothing here.

307
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:06,886
Then it's impossible to lock this door using this ribbon.

308
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:09,686
Yes. The ribbon would be left behind

309
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:13,286
unless someone pulls it off from inside the room

310
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,886
and takes it somewhere, then it would work.

311
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:19,586
Someone? But only the victim was in the room.

312
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,886
And he's still unconscious, you know?

313
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,686
I've got no choice...

314
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,486
See, over there.

315
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:30,186
Good luck!

316
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,386
Keep moving the ribbon!

317
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:33,386
Okay.

318
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,986
The cat pulled it along in its mouth and took it away!

319
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,186
After it!

320
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,286
Yes, sir!

321
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:52,886
Inside the bookshelf?

322
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:57,386
So this is where the cat hides his treasures.

323
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,886
I found it!

324
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,686
A different ribbon from the one just now!

325
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,486
It's knotted too,

326
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,286
so there's no mistake about it.

327
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,586
The question is...

328
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,686
who set up the trick with that ribbon?

329
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:17,686
I think it's the doing of someone who's good with cats.

330
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,886
Yes. Someone who knows that cat well enough

331
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,286
to the point of knowing it not only takes the ribbon away

332
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:25,786
but also knows that it hides it somewhere.

333
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,586
Then, it could be the lady wearing glasses?

334
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:31,986
Because Tai was wagging his tail

335
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,386
when she carried him.

336
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,186
No, unlike dogs,

337
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,186
cats wag their tails when they don't like something.

338
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,986
Since Ms. Aso didn't know this,

339
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,986
I don't think she knew much about cats, no?

340
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:45,986
But, maybe the cat didn't like her

341
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,386
because she hurt his owner?

342
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:50,786
If so, she wouldn't ask if she could hold him from her side!

343
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:53,586
There's a possibility that he might scratch her too.

344
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,586
But, the other two were...

345
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:59,186
Mrs. Tsuyuguchi, who was hung up on saving electricity

346
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,686
and Mr. Urushiya, who picked up the stuff

347
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:04,786
that Genta dropped out of his pocket.

348
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,486
Both were habitual, unconscious acts, no?

349
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,686
Right.

350
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:13,186
But, back then Genta dropped a Band-Aid,

351
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:16,486
a handkerchief and the cap of a PET bottle,

352
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,986
but the thing that Mr. Urushiya picked

353
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:20,986
was the PET bottle cap, right?

354
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:22,686
Now that you mentioned it, right...

355
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,386
But why?

356
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:27,386
Shall we try it out then? Take a look.

357
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:37,286
I see! Cats love PET bottle caps too!

358
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:38,486
I see.

359
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:39,886
If the cat takes it

360
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:43,186
and brings it to the place he hides his treasures

361
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:45,986
there's a danger that the ribbon that was used for the trick

362
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,586
would be found.

363
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,786
Well, it seems to have been an unpremeditated crime

364
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:52,686
because the perp used things that were at the site.

365
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,786
If the perp wasn't wearing gloves,

366
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:57,386
prints could probably be taken from the ribbon.

367
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,986
Okay, let's interrogate Mr. Urushiya once more!

368
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:06,386
When did you start suspecting that the novelist?

369
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:10,886
Was it because Tai stood his tail up to him?

370
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,786
Because it's what cats do when they are happy,

371
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:16,486
want love or to people who they know well.

372
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:18,486
Well, true, but I've suspect him being the perp

373
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:24,386
from the time he said someone opened the door for him

374
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:27,486
when he rang the door phone on the ground floor.

375
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:30,286
If it were the perp who opened the door,

376
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,586
he would've still been inside the room.

377
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:37,786
It's unthinkable that the perp would let someone up to the front door

378
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:42,686
if he were planning to set up the locked room scheme then.

379
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,086
Indeed.

380
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:50,586
I'm the one who knocked him over and seriously hurt him.

381
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:52,286
But, it's amazing how you thought up something like that

382
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:53,686
on the spur of a moment.

383
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:57,386
I used to write that sort of mysteries novels in the past.

384
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:01,386
The fact is, I came to ask him for money today.

385
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:04,486
I was actually supposed to meet him tomorrow, though.

386
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,086
But, he called me this morning to tell me

387
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:08,886
that he had something good to give me.

388
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:13,386
I got impatient and came to see him today.

389
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:18,786
But, all he gave me was a messily wrapped used cat carry!

390
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:21,986
Furthermore, inside it was that calico cat!

391
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:25,286
Moreover, he said that he couldn't give it to me yet today.

392
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:28,586
He grinned and kept me in suspense.

393
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:35,886
To begin with, that cat was a stray that I brought home with me too.

394
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:38,686
Which means that you were the original owner?

395
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:42,786
Yes, when it was a kitten for only about 6 months.

396
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:45,686
I gave it to him because his wife was depressed

397
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,186
going through pet loss.

398
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:49,886
Well, I was glad I gave it to them, though.

399
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:52,886
Because after that my novels stopped selling completely,

400
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,986
and I couldn't afford to be taking care of a cat.

401
00:20:55,986 --> 00:21:00,386
It seems that in turn, his company started doing really well.

402
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:05,586
Yet, how dare he try to push that stray cat back to me.

403
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,886
Right. Carrying the cat that went

404
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:11,486
into the bedroom with the ribbon,

405
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,586
here's what he said...

406
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:16,186
This cat will help you work everything out!

407
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,786
Moreover, he's was yours to begin with.

408
00:21:18,786 --> 00:21:21,786
You're more fit to be his owner.

409
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,986
But, Tai is an incredible cat, you know.

410
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,886
Male calico cats are rare in number

411
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:30,586
and super valuable.

412
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,686
They're really expensive!

413
00:21:32,686 --> 00:21:34,386
What?

414
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:40,586
But, Mr. Masuko didn't return the cat to you for the money.

415
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,886
I think he did so because that cat

416
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,886
was a cat that brought on good fortune, a lucky cat.

417
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:12,186
I'm glad because Tai's owner was discharged from the hospital, right?

418
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:14,786
Yes, he has no after effects from the injury either.

419
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:17,386
And what happened to the cat?

420
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:21,186
It turned out that Azusa of Poirot would keep him after all.

421
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,686
Tai?

422
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:28,086
No joke? You turned into a stray again?

423
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:30,286
But, it looks smaller?

424
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,686
The pattern looks exactly the same, though.

425
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:35,086
Come on! We're going home, Mugi!

426
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:39,186
Come on, grandma.

427
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:41,786
You've got to keep the lid of the cat closed!

428
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:44,986
I'm sorry, but she looked uncomfortable.

429
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:47,886
I think that granny was...

430
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,686
All's well ends well.

431
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,686
Is it okay?

432
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,486
I'm a Peeping Tom, you know.

433
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:58,586
Were you still here, Mr. Suzuki?

434
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:02,486
The landlord told you to leave as soon as possible, right?

435
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:04,786
Hey! We've got company.

436
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:07,186
Please cut it out already, Katsuko.

437
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:12,486
Inside... Katsuko's...

438
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,186
Next Conan,

439
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:20,986
"Share House Blind Spot".

440
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:39,286
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:41,386
"Refrigerator".

442
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:42,886
Leave the refrigerator to me!

443
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:43,986
I don't understand.

444
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:46,386
After all, it's autumn. Genta's all for food, that's why.
