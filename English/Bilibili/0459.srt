1
00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.499
Commotion!

2
00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:04.999
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.099
A man who is strict about rules versus a woman who is not.

4
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:08.799
A tragedy occurs between the two.

5
00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.299
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.799
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.199
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.435
Are you really going to go look at it?

9
00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.835
Yes, for your sake, Genta!

10
00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.835
Geez. What a curiosity seeker.

11
00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:14.735
We only found out about that person a day ago.

12
00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:19.535
"Yesterday" -Oh, that doesn't go there, Kojima.

13
00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.635
Oh, rats...

14
00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:25.535
Unburnable trash...

15
00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.835
Genta, make sure you sort the trash correctly!

16
00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:30.835
Stupid, I just made a careless mistake.

17
00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:33.935
You're too careless, Genta.

18
00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.135
Oh...

19
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.435
If Mr. Iwata were here,

20
00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:39.035
you'd be getting lectured for at least 30 minutes.

21
00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:40.835
Who's Mr. Iwata?

22
00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:43.335
A man who lives in our apartment.

23
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.735
Oh, that's right, your family runs an apartment.

24
00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:52.435
Yes, Mr. Iwao Iwata who moved in about three months ago,

25
00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:55.235
is super strict when it comes to throwing away trash.

26
00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:56.635
If you throw the trash out at a strange time,

27
00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.535
or dispose of trash without sorting it out,

28
00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.335
he finds out who did it

29
00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:04.035
and brings the trash bag back to that person.

30
00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:07.035
Oh, isn't that taking things a bit too far?

31
00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:09.635
He's really serious and extremely neat.

32
00:03:09.635 --> 00:03:12.935
Yes, he's a very fine man.

33
00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:15.835
Rather, he's quite a weirdo.

34
00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:17.035
That's right!

35
00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:21.135
Let's go see that man called Mr. Iwao Iwata tomorrow.

36
00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:22.735
Go visit him?

37
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.735
Let's go see the person who's serious and neat

38
00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:26.835
so that you can follow him as an example, Genta.

39
00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:28.335
What?

40
00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.635
Hey...

41
00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.535
So, we end up coming...

42
00:03:35.535 --> 00:03:37.935
-Good morning. -Good morning!

43
00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:40.935
He's Mr. Iwao Iwata.

44
00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:43.535
You're the one who put out this trash bag, aren't you?

45
00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:45.935
A direct mail addressed to you is inside.

46
00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.035
Don't look into other people's trash bag!

47
00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:49.435
"Iwao Iwata (30)" -It's wet with rain

48
00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:51.135
so you threw it out last night.

49
00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.835
Trash is supposed to be thrown out in the morning.

50
00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.135
Why don't you follow the rules?

51
00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.535
This man is exactly as Chiharu said.

52
00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:07.035
"The Abominable Man of Rules"

53
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:11.935
On top of that, kitchen garbage, cans and Styrofoam are mixed in this bag.

54
00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:14.235
Sort your trash like you should!

55
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:16.635
He sure looks worked up.

56
00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:18.535
He doesn't have to get so furious.

57
00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:21.235
That just goes to show how serious he is.

58
00:04:21.235 --> 00:04:22.435
What?

59
00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:28.135
Okay. I will sort it!

60
00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:29.635
You better watch yourself!

61
00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:30.835
If you keep pushing your weight around,

62
00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:33.435
you're really going to get it one of these days!

63
00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:39.835
They're my classmates.

64
00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:41.235
Good morning!

65
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.035
-Good morning! -Good morning!

66
00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:44.635
Morning.

67
00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:47.835
Your attitude of cautioning people to stick to the rules of society

68
00:04:47.835 --> 00:04:49.835
was a great learning experience for us too.

69
00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:53.635
Well, it's just that somebody's got to do it.

70
00:04:53.635 --> 00:04:54.735
Bye.

71
00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.735
But why can't he caution the person personally

72
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.635
instead of in front of all those people,

73
00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:04.835
and so exaggeratedly too.

74
00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:07.835
There's a reason

75
00:05:07.835 --> 00:05:11.035
why Mr. Iwata became so strict about throwing trash out.

76
00:05:11.035 --> 00:05:12.435
What reason?

77
00:05:12.435 --> 00:05:14.835
Soon after Mr. Iwata moved in,

78
00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:16.535
the apartment was struck by an arsonist.

79
00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:17.635
Arson?

80
00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:18.835
The arsonist burned the trash

81
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:20.735
that someone had thrown out in the middle of the night

82
00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:22.235
without following the rules.

83
00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:31.135
Mr. Iwata happened to notice it and extinguished the fire

84
00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:32.635
so we were lucky, but...

85
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:39.535
And that's why he became really strict about throwing out trash.

86
00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.835
But like the man that he just razzed,

87
00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:45.035
if he's too hung up on rules and repeated about it,

88
00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:46.735
people around him are going to start hating him.

89
00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:49.235
That's what you call repaying kindness with resentment.

90
00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:51.035
Right, Conan?

91
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:52.535
Conan?

92
00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.035
Yeah.

93
00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:57.135
Then, three days later, an incident occurs.

94
00:05:57.135 --> 00:05:59.935
"Three days later" -Homicide?

95
00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:01.435
Mr. Iwata...

96
00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:04.135
Didn't I tell you that he was going to be hated?

97
00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:05.735
But, it can't be...

98
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:06.935
No way!

99
00:06:06.935 --> 00:06:10.435
Poor thing, he was just trying to do the right thing...

100
00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:13.035
No, it's the other way around!

101
00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:15.135
Mr. Iwata is the assaulter...

102
00:06:15.135 --> 00:06:16.135
-What? -What?

103
00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:17.635
He is?

104
00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:26.635
-Officer Takagi! -Officer Takagi!

105
00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.635
Oh, you guys.

106
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:29.935
What is it?

107
00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:32.935
Is it true that Mr. Iwao Iwata really kill somebody?

108
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.435
Is it really true?

109
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:37.735
Do you guys know him?

110
00:06:37.735 --> 00:06:40.035
Yes. So tell us the details!

111
00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:42.835
It's true that he assaulted somebody.

112
00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:45.835
A woman, over how to throw trash out.

113
00:06:45.835 --> 00:06:47.635
-What? -Over how to throw trash out?

114
00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:49.835
"Interrogation room" -Over how to throw trash out?

115
00:06:50.935 --> 00:06:51.935
Last night...

116
00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:55.835
Rather, at about 3 am in the wee hours of the morning today.

117
00:06:55.835 --> 00:07:00.035
I got thirsty so I was drinking water in the kitchen.

118
00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:02.335
When I happened to look out the window

119
00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:04.435
and notice someone taking trash out.

120
00:07:04.435 --> 00:07:05.935
I couldn't stand not doing anything so I...

121
00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:07.335
So, it's you again.

122
00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:09.735
I thought I told you that you shouldn't bring your trash out at night,

123
00:07:09.735 --> 00:07:10.735
just the other day too!

124
00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:13.035
I cautioned her then she said...

125
00:07:13.035 --> 00:07:15.635
Get off my back.

126
00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:20.435
Stop playing Mr. Goody-goody all by yourself!

127
00:07:20.435 --> 00:07:23.535
She came at me with an iron pipe that was at her feet.

128
00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:25.735
I never liked you from before.

129
00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:27.435
I thought that I'd be killed

130
00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:31.435
unless I took the iron pipe away from her so I...

131
00:07:35.435 --> 00:07:36.935
Are you all right?

132
00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:40.035
Hey...

133
00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:42.135
Oh, no...

134
00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:46.135
But he turned himself in to the police right after that.

135
00:07:46.135 --> 00:07:49.235
So, rather than a case of homicide...

136
00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.235
Right.

137
00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:53.635
I admit to have killed her.

138
00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:57.535
But, officer, I did so in self-defense.

139
00:07:57.535 --> 00:08:00.335
Yes! I'm sure he did it in self-defense!

140
00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:02.435
If it's as Mr. Iwata says.

141
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:04.635
Self-defense?

142
00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:08.035
What happens if he did it in self-defense?

143
00:08:08.035 --> 00:08:10.935
He won't be charged for homicide, right?

144
00:08:10.935 --> 00:08:12.735
He won't be charged?

145
00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:15.035
But, it happened after midnight so...

146
00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:19.135
We're looking for eye-witnesses too but so far nothing.

147
00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:21.035
In other words, it's difficult to prove

148
00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.935
that the victim actually suddenly attacked him

149
00:08:23.935 --> 00:08:25.835
with the iron pipe.

150
00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:27.435
You mean you suspect him?

151
00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:31.135
We can't just take his side of the story for fact.

152
00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.635
We've got to find something to back it up...

153
00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:35.835
He's a really serious person

154
00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:38.235
and not someone who would lie.

155
00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:39.435
Yes!

156
00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:40.535
I think so too.

157
00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:43.935
But if he really felt that his life was in danger,

158
00:08:43.935 --> 00:08:45.835
why didn't he flee?

159
00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:47.935
That's the part that bothers me too...

160
00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:50.735
It's strange that a person who is carrying out justice

161
00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:52.435
runs from a person who is doing something wrong!

162
00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.835
Logically I guess you could say so, but...

163
00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.135
It seems that the victim was always not too concerned

164
00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.735
about the rules of how trash should be thrown away.

165
00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:00.635
You mean the woman who passed away?

166
00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:04.135
Yes. Her name was Ms. Misa Katayama

167
00:09:04.135 --> 00:09:06.835
and she lived alone in that condominium.

168
00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:09.835
She worked as a hostess at a snack bar,

169
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:12.635
so she always came home after midnight.

170
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.835
She seems to have thrown her trash out at night

171
00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:16.735
because she used to be asleep in the morning.

172
00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:20.135
The community committee leader also seems to have cautioned her before.

173
00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:24.735
Ms. Katayama, please adhere to the rules.

174
00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:27.635
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

175
00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.835
I mean all the fuss about throwing away rubbish at night.

176
00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.535
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

177
00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:33.235
and get them to arrest me.

178
00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:37.335
It seems that the community committee leader

179
00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:39.335
couldn't do anything about it either.

180
00:09:39.335 --> 00:09:42.635
That's when Mr. Iwata moved in

181
00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:45.235
and cautioned her repeatedly about trash

182
00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:49.935
that Ms. Misa Katayama seemed to dislike him.

183
00:09:49.935 --> 00:09:54.235
So, it's exactly as Iwata had testified...

184
00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:55.235
Isn't this the result of a tragedy that occurred impulsively

185
00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:57.035
because a woman who doesn't give a hoot about rules

186
00:09:57.035 --> 00:10:00.535
and a man who is hung up on rules,

187
00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:03.235
just happened to live in the same neighborhood?

188
00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.635
I wonder if that's what it was?

189
00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:09.335
For now, the only foothold we have is his testimony.

190
00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:11.735
I'll go check on his character

191
00:10:11.735 --> 00:10:14.235
to see if he is one we can trust or not.

192
00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:16.035
It seems it's only been three months

193
00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:18.235
since he moved to this apartment but...

194
00:10:18.235 --> 00:10:20.135
I'll check further back in the past.

195
00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:22.235
I'll go look for eye-witnesses.

196
00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:27.935
If we can make apparent what a decent citizen Mr. Iwata really is,

197
00:10:27.935 --> 00:10:30.635
I'm sure his killing in self-defense will be proven!

198
00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:34.535
If he really did it in self-defense.

199
00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:38.335
I guess they're going to come with me even if I tell them not to.

200
00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:42.235
Mr. Iwata's personality?

201
00:10:42.235 --> 00:10:45.035
For example, is he the type that lies?

202
00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:47.735
No way... Not Mr. Iwata.

203
00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:49.335
He would never lie.

204
00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:52.235
He's a decent citizen that isn't two-faced.

205
00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.035
See, it's just a waste of time, Officer Takagi.

206
00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:56.735
Yeah...

207
00:10:56.735 --> 00:11:00.535
Did he used to get into trouble with people for not following rules

208
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.435
when he was living here too?

209
00:11:02.435 --> 00:11:04.435
He would never get into trouble with anyone

210
00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:07.535
because he's a mild mannered person.

211
00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.235
Something's not right...

212
00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.135
Because when we saw him the other day,

213
00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:14.135
he was really worked up and shouting off the top of his lungs.

214
00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:15.135
Yes...

215
00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:16.835
I wonder if his personality changed

216
00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:19.535
after he moved to that apartment?

217
00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:22.335
Oh, I was really surprised when he moved out,

218
00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:24.035
because it was so sudden...

219
00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:25.535
Sudden?

220
00:11:25.535 --> 00:11:29.435
Well, the rental agreement is renewed every two years

221
00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:34.135
and he moved out almost right after he completed renewal procedures.

222
00:11:34.135 --> 00:11:35.135
What?

223
00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:39.335
In other words, Mr. Iwata was planning to go on living here

224
00:11:39.335 --> 00:11:41.035
but suddenly changed his mind

225
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:44.635
and moved in to the apartment in Beika-cho?

226
00:11:44.635 --> 00:11:48.735
Did Mr. Iwata move into an apartment in Beika-cho?

227
00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:51.235
Yes, why do you ask?

228
00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:55.535
It's nothing. But to move from a condominium to an apartment...

229
00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:58.335
He didn't look like he was having money problems.

230
00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:01.335
And, it's more convenient to go to the research lab

231
00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:03.935
that he works at from here too.

232
00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:07.535
Maybe something urgent came up three months ago

233
00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:10.035
that he had to move into that apartment.

234
00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:13.035
Yeah. There seems to be no other way to think of it.

235
00:12:13.035 --> 00:12:16.135
And because he moved there, the incident occurred.

236
00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.035
Hey! Just what does that mean?

237
00:12:18.035 --> 00:12:20.035
Hey! What does it mean?

238
00:12:20.035 --> 00:12:21.335
-Hey! -Hey!

239
00:12:21.335 --> 00:12:23.235
How should I know?

240
00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:24.735
This case most likely is not something

241
00:12:24.735 --> 00:12:28.335
that occurred on the spur of the moment after all.

242
00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:37.443
"Sanko Precision Technology Research Institute"

243
00:12:37.443 --> 00:12:39.943
Three months ago?

244
00:12:39.943 --> 00:12:44.343
Yes, do you know if something out of the ordinary came over Mr. Iwata?

245
00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:46.143
Three months ago...

246
00:12:47.443 --> 00:12:50.443
Oh, he's usually a very cheerful person,

247
00:12:50.443 --> 00:12:54.943
but he looked to be very troubled about something back then.

248
00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:56.143
I think it was after he went to pay homage

249
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.543
to the grave of his acquaintance.

250
00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:58.843
Pay homage to the grave?

251
00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:02.243
Yes... It was the second anniversary of his benefactor's death

252
00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:03.943
who took care of him when he was in school.

253
00:13:03.943 --> 00:13:05.443
Did he go to the grave

254
00:13:05.443 --> 00:13:07.443
before he moved in to the apartment he's living in now?

255
00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:11.043
Yes, I think he moved out soon after that.

256
00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:15.343
That visit to the grave may have triggered him off in some way.

257
00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:17.343
A school days benefactor who he owes his life to...

258
00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:20.943
"Inoue Law Office" -Oh, you must mean Mr. Yasaka.

259
00:13:20.943 --> 00:13:24.443
Iwata and I were both students who didn't have money

260
00:13:24.443 --> 00:13:26.943
so we worked part-time and barely fed ourselves.

261
00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:32.143
Iwata used to work part time at Mr. Yasaka's factory.

262
00:13:32.143 --> 00:13:33.743
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka took care of Iwata,

263
00:13:33.743 --> 00:13:36.443
who had lost his parents at a young age,

264
00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:39.743
as if he were their own son.

265
00:13:39.743 --> 00:13:42.243
When he was hit by a motorbike near the factory

266
00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.743
and was badly hurt...

267
00:13:44.743 --> 00:13:47.643
If a blood transfusion is needed, please use my blood!

268
00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:49.243
Mine too!

269
00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:52.243
The couple both seem to have given him blood.

270
00:13:52.243 --> 00:13:55.243
In other words, that couple saved his life.

271
00:13:55.243 --> 00:13:57.443
Iwata used to say so too.

272
00:13:57.443 --> 00:13:59.543
However, about two years ago,

273
00:13:59.543 --> 00:14:03.843
they were deceived by some bad loan shark

274
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.843
who took away their house as well as their factory

275
00:14:05.843 --> 00:14:09.143
and the couple committed suicide.

276
00:14:09.143 --> 00:14:10.543
If he said that he was going to visit the grave of someone

277
00:14:10.543 --> 00:14:12.343
who saved his life in his school days,

278
00:14:12.343 --> 00:14:15.743
it must be the grave of that couple.

279
00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:17.143
I'm sure the temple where their grave was is

280
00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:20.243
in Henryu Temple located in Beika-cho.

281
00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:21.443
-What? -What?

282
00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.243
Henryu Temple...

283
00:14:23.243 --> 00:14:25.643
That's near your apartment, right, Chiharu?

284
00:14:25.643 --> 00:14:26.943
Yes...

285
00:14:26.943 --> 00:14:28.943
There's Beika Station...

286
00:14:28.943 --> 00:14:30.743
The apartment...

287
00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:32.443
And it's beyond a little way farther.

288
00:14:33.743 --> 00:14:36.643
Where's the loan shark that deceived Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka

289
00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:39.143
and drove them to suicide now?

290
00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:41.343
I'm sure he's in jail

291
00:14:41.343 --> 00:14:43.143
because he seems to have threatened people for money

292
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:45.043
and been involved in other crimes.

293
00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:47.143
What about the woman?

294
00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:48.643
The woman?

295
00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.443
There seems to have been a woman involved too.

296
00:14:51.443 --> 00:14:52.543
"Two Years Ago" -After investigating I found out

297
00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:55.743
that there was a woman who introduced the loan shark Fujikura

298
00:14:55.743 --> 00:14:58.043
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's!

299
00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.943
I'm sure that the woman, conspired with Fujikura

300
00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:03.243
to begin with and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

301
00:15:03.243 --> 00:15:07.243
Hey, can't you somehow get that woman to pay for what she did too?

302
00:15:07.243 --> 00:15:09.243
If she says that she introduced them out of goodwill,

303
00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:10.343
that's it...

304
00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.343
It's too bad, but there's no way she can be tried by law.

305
00:15:13.343 --> 00:15:16.843
So, you can't punish that woman by law!

306
00:15:16.843 --> 00:15:19.243
Iwata seemed really vexed.

307
00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:21.043
What's that woman's name?

308
00:15:21.043 --> 00:15:22.243
He didn't tell me.

309
00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:25.643
I think she was working for a bar or a snack shop or something.

310
00:15:25.643 --> 00:15:27.743
-Which means... -Don't tell me that...

311
00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:29.943
What about that woman?

312
00:15:31.243 --> 00:15:32.743
So, that's the story.

313
00:15:33.543 --> 00:15:35.343
I have something I would like you

314
00:15:35.343 --> 00:15:38.143
to verify with a man called Fujikura

315
00:15:38.143 --> 00:15:41.743
who had been serving time since two years ago.

316
00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:43.743
You can't?

317
00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:46.143
He died last month of an illness?

318
00:15:48.143 --> 00:15:49.843
Fujikura?

319
00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:51.543
Eiji Fujikura.

320
00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:55.543
Have you ever heard this man's name from Ms. Misa Katayama?

321
00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:57.243
No, I haven't.

322
00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.343
I don't have the slightest idea what kind of guy

323
00:15:58.343 --> 00:16:00.943
that nasty woman was going with...

324
00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:04.543
But you were working with her, weren't you...

325
00:16:04.543 --> 00:16:06.143
I'm telling you, I don't know!

326
00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:18.143
Yes, this is Takagi.

327
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.643
Thank you just a while ago.

328
00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:22.243
You got verification?

329
00:16:22.243 --> 00:16:24.243
Thank you.

330
00:16:24.243 --> 00:16:26.343
It's the prison officer I called a while ago.

331
00:16:26.343 --> 00:16:30.343
He asked a person who was serving sentence together with Fujikura.

332
00:16:30.343 --> 00:16:32.243
It seems that Fujikura was saying that once he got out,

333
00:16:32.243 --> 00:16:34.643
he was going to team up with a hostess called Misa

334
00:16:34.643 --> 00:16:36.943
and make loads of cash again.

335
00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:39.843
The assaulter and the victim connected, didn't they?

336
00:16:39.843 --> 00:16:41.043
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

337
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:45.243
You have no conclusive proof at all yet!

338
00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:46.743
Proof...

339
00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:51.843
Conan!

340
00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:54.643
What's with this kid?

341
00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:55.943
-Conan! -Conan!

342
00:16:57.843 --> 00:17:01.143
Is she the person called Ms. Misa Katayama?

343
00:17:01.143 --> 00:17:04.343
Yes, but if so, what?

344
00:17:04.343 --> 00:17:06.543
Is this a recent picture?

345
00:17:06.543 --> 00:17:08.943
It's about a half a year ago...

346
00:17:08.943 --> 00:17:11.243
Half a year has already passed...

347
00:17:11.243 --> 00:17:13.843
What about this picture?

348
00:17:13.843 --> 00:17:15.543
She's hurt.

349
00:17:17.643 --> 00:17:19.043
Yes, right.

350
00:17:19.043 --> 00:17:21.243
She slammed her finger between the car door and it almost came off.

351
00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:22.643
There sure was a great fuss over it.

352
00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:24.843
Everything turned out okay, for the time being though.

353
00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.343
For the time being?

354
00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:31.843
There's one thing I'd like to verify...

355
00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:35.643
Yes. That murder weapon that was confiscated as evidence.

356
00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:38.043
Yes... About that iron pipe...

357
00:17:38.043 --> 00:17:41.443
Although we were trying to save Mr. Iwata,

358
00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:44.543
we seemed to have tracked down something incredible.

359
00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:45.943
-Mitsuhiko. -Mitsuhiko.

360
00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:49.343
No matter what the consequences, there is only one truth.

361
00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:52.743
You understand why we asked you to come here,

362
00:17:52.743 --> 00:17:55.243
don't you, Mr. Iwata?

363
00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.243
"Yasaka Family's Grave" -Three months ago from now,

364
00:17:59.243 --> 00:18:02.043
you came to visit this grave...

365
00:18:02.043 --> 00:18:03.843
The day you came here was

366
00:18:03.843 --> 00:18:05.243
the memorial day of the death of Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka,

367
00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:07.643
who killed themselves after being deceived by Eiji Fujikura,

368
00:18:07.643 --> 00:18:10.143
an evil loan shark two years ago.

369
00:18:13.243 --> 00:18:15.143
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka...

370
00:18:15.143 --> 00:18:18.443
On your way back to the station after visiting the grave,

371
00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:21.943
you coincidentally caught a glimpse of something.

372
00:18:21.943 --> 00:18:24.243
It was the woman who had conspired with Eiji Fujikura

373
00:18:24.243 --> 00:18:27.143
and deceived the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's.

374
00:18:27.143 --> 00:18:29.643
Stop pestering me with your rules and regulations.

375
00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:31.843
If it bothers you so much, why don't you call the police

376
00:18:31.843 --> 00:18:35.643
and get them to arrest me?

377
00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:40.843
Despite having driven a good couple to their death,

378
00:18:40.843 --> 00:18:44.443
this woman didn't show a tinge of regret.

379
00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:47.643
Isn't that when you thought that having seen her

380
00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:50.543
on their memorial day was a work of fate?

381
00:18:50.543 --> 00:18:53.543
And that you would avenge the death of the couple who saved you.

382
00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:57.243
You rented the apartment located opposite the condominium

383
00:18:57.243 --> 00:19:00.343
that the woman lived and moved in.

384
00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:05.243
You wanted to avenge their death but didn't want to get caught doing so.

385
00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:08.043
Since she was not legally punished by law,

386
00:19:08.043 --> 00:19:10.243
you thought up a scheme in which you wouldn't get caught either.

387
00:19:10.243 --> 00:19:14.443
So, you thought up the strategy of killing in self-defense.

388
00:19:14.443 --> 00:19:18.143
You carried out your plan right away.

389
00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:20.343
You stared the arson fear.

390
00:19:20.343 --> 00:19:21.943
Using this as a start,

391
00:19:21.943 --> 00:19:24.643
you made everybody believe that you had very strict standards

392
00:19:24.643 --> 00:19:26.643
when it came to throwing out trash.

393
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:29.143
Next, all you had to do was to wait for the chance to come around.

394
00:19:29.143 --> 00:19:31.943
You continued to wait until that woman,

395
00:19:31.943 --> 00:19:34.543
Ms. Misa Katayama, to come out to throw her trash away.

396
00:19:34.543 --> 00:19:38.743
You waited for the perfect chance when there were no witnesses at all.

397
00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:39.843
Oh...

398
00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:43.043
Darn!

399
00:19:43.043 --> 00:19:46.543
Then last night the time finally arrived.

400
00:19:58.143 --> 00:20:00.643
You put her fingerprints on the iron pipe

401
00:20:00.643 --> 00:20:02.943
that you brought along with you

402
00:20:02.943 --> 00:20:06.043
and turned yourself into the police.

403
00:20:06.043 --> 00:20:08.243
Am I wrong, Mr. Iwata?

404
00:20:08.243 --> 00:20:12.543
You tried to make a planned murder looks as if it happened by chance.

405
00:20:12.543 --> 00:20:16.543
Since it looks on the outside to be trouble between the neighbors,

406
00:20:16.543 --> 00:20:20.243
you probably thought that police wouldn't check far back

407
00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:23.143
into the past karmic relationship of the victim and assaulter.

408
00:20:24.743 --> 00:20:28.143
That woman picked the iron pipe up from the ground

409
00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.443
and suddenly attacked me.

410
00:20:30.443 --> 00:20:33.143
That's why I had no choice but to...

411
00:20:33.143 --> 00:20:35.443
I did it in self-defense!

412
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.643
Enough already.

413
00:20:36.643 --> 00:20:37.743
Yeah.

414
00:20:37.743 --> 00:20:39.443
Please stop it already.

415
00:20:39.443 --> 00:20:41.143
We have proof.

416
00:20:41.143 --> 00:20:43.343
It's Ms. Misa Katayama's fingerprints.

417
00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:44.943
Fingerprints?

418
00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:46.943
Are you saying that the woman's fingerprints weren't

419
00:20:46.943 --> 00:20:48.743
on the iron pipe or what?

420
00:20:48.743 --> 00:20:50.243
Just the opposite.

421
00:20:50.243 --> 00:20:54.343
The fingerprint of all 10 of Ms. Katayama's fingers were on it.

422
00:20:55.443 --> 00:20:57.543
That person called, Ms. Misa Katayama,

423
00:20:57.543 --> 00:20:59.443
seems to have hurt the finger of her right hand very badly

424
00:20:59.443 --> 00:21:01.043
half a year ago

425
00:21:01.043 --> 00:21:04.443
and to this day cannot bend that finger.

426
00:21:04.443 --> 00:21:05.643
What?

427
00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:07.643
Unless somebody forced her to grab the pole

428
00:21:07.643 --> 00:21:09.243
and held it down,

429
00:21:09.243 --> 00:21:12.743
the fingerprint of that finger couldn't have got onto the pole.

430
00:21:18.743 --> 00:21:21.543
I just couldn't forgive that woman!

431
00:21:22.843 --> 00:21:24.943
I'm alive here today thanks

432
00:21:24.943 --> 00:21:27.043
to the Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka's giving me blood.

433
00:21:27.043 --> 00:21:30.243
Hey, keep your eyes on what you're doing or you'll get hurt.

434
00:21:30.243 --> 00:21:31.343
Okay!

435
00:21:31.343 --> 00:21:35.443
I think I'll work here even after graduating from university...

436
00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:37.043
Don't be silly!

437
00:21:37.043 --> 00:21:38.843
That's right, Iwata.

438
00:21:38.843 --> 00:21:40.543
You're going to become a technician great enough

439
00:21:40.543 --> 00:21:42.543
to carry Japan on your shoulders.

440
00:21:42.543 --> 00:21:45.743
You idiot, not only Japan but the world!

441
00:21:45.743 --> 00:21:46.843
Right!

442
00:21:48.543 --> 00:21:51.643
How could she dare to deceive such a good couple...

443
00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:56.143
And to go as far as to drive them to commit suicide...

444
00:21:56.143 --> 00:21:59.243
Regardless, what you have committed is a crime.

445
00:21:59.243 --> 00:22:01.543
No matter how much you cannot forgive a person,

446
00:22:01.543 --> 00:22:04.543
it does not give you the right to take that person's life.

447
00:22:06.443 --> 00:22:07.743
Mr. and Mrs. Yasaka!

448
00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:48.443
Oh, there you are!

449
00:23:48.443 --> 00:23:50.543
What's up, Genta?

450
00:23:51.643 --> 00:23:55.543
A super weirdo moved in right opposite our house,

451
00:23:55.543 --> 00:23:57.743
and that person is...

452
00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:00.743
What's the matter?

453
00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:02.543
He never learns...

454
00:24:03.843 --> 00:24:07.243
"Next Episode" -Bummers, rain...

455
00:24:07.243 --> 00:24:11.043
We were supposed to play dodge ball during fifth period.

456
00:24:11.043 --> 00:24:14.143
And I was looking forward to playing!

457
00:24:14.143 --> 00:24:15.443
"I will be taking care of Ms. Kobayashi."

458
00:24:15.443 --> 00:24:16.843
"Can you figure out where she is? From the fiend with 200 faces."

459
00:24:16.843 --> 00:24:22.043
It seems that the hint is not limited to just the five numbers.

460
00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.343
I guess so.

461
00:24:28.343 --> 00:24:33.843
Next Conan, "1st Grade Class B Grand Project!"

462
00:24:49.543 --> 00:24:51.243
Next Conan's Hint:

463
00:24:51.243 --> 00:24:53.743
"The face of dice"

464
00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:55.243
Do dice have a face?

465
00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.743
-Yes, six of them too! -No joke?

466
00:24:56.743 --> 00:24:58.743
Are you all right?
