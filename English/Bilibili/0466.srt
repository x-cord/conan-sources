1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,799
Snow White.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,799
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,299
A group of four consisting of men and women.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,599
The snowman of the Youth Detective Squad

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,199
watches the trails of the case.

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,599
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,099
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,099
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
You're pretty good, Shinichi.

10
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, yes. You're so good.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,400
"Unbreakable Snowman (Part 1)"

12
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,800
Huh? Where are they?

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Look. They're over there.

14
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,500
Gosh, before we got here

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,400
they were dying for me to teach them how to snowboard.

16
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
And now they are absorbed in making a snowman.

17
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,200
By the way, are you sure it's okay?

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,100
The boy who said he witnessed Rena Mizunashi's motorbike accident.

19
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,600
If the foreign lady that approached him was...

20
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,700
Yeah, she's probably one of the members of the Black Organization.

21
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,000
Vermouth.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,500
What did you say?

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
Doesn't that mean...

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Do you really understand?

25
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,600
If those guys find out that she was badly wounded in the accident...

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah. I'm sure they already know

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
that Rena Mizunashi was transported to the hospital in critical condition.

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,300
Hey, Shinichi.

29
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,800
But that's as far as they know.

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,600
They don't seem to know which hospital it is yet.

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,900
Besides, this case has already been reported to Ms. Jodie from the FBI.

32
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm sure the FBI won't let them find the place that easily either.

33
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,000
But will that boy be okay?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,500
It seems that he's under the custody of the FBI for now.

35
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,700
I think the organization is not interested in him anymore.

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,900
Because if they wanted to shut him up,

37
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,500
they would've done so when they got in contact with him.

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,600
But isn't it strange?

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,900
That the boy coincidentally happened to be at the house

40
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,600
where the murder was committed,

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,500
and you find out a mysterious woman approached him and asked questions.

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,900
-It was no coincidence. -Huh?

43
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,700
That's what bothered me

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,100
and made me search Rena Mizunashi on the internet.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,400
I found a deeply buried info about her.

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,700
There's a big fan homepage dedicated to the announcer Rena Mizunashi.

47
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,400
Then it hit me.

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
There was a guy who was hired for that part-time job

49
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,500
and was the one causing the motorbike accident.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,800
He seems to have been wearing custom-made jacket with her picture on it.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
This is what was written in his diary,

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
"On my way back home from my part-time job,

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
a boy named Toji looked at my jacket

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
and said that the lady flew off her motorbike."

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,500
That's why that guy probably saw the diary, too.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
That guy?

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah.

58
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,500
He mentioned that the homicide that happened at the boy's house

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
and the weird part-time job was connected.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,800
He deliberately got Pops and me involved in the case by making us go there

61
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,600
and succeeded in making us encounter the boy.

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,500
That guy's name is Eisuke Hondo.

63
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,200
Eisuke Hondo?

64
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,600
The one who suddenly came to Ran's school as a new student.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Moreover, his eyes are identical to Rena Mizunashi.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
Hey...

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Don't tell me that the new student is...

68
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
He's probably a member of the guys who are checking on us

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
to figure out where Rena Mizunashi is.

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,500
That's what I'd like to say,

71
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,400
but somehow it's so unlike him.

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,500
Huh?

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
He seems naturally dense and awkward.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
You idiot!

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,500
What if that's their plan to make you lower your guard?

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,100
But...

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,200
I saw him crying.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,100
I've told you before about the case

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,900
involving the saw, nail and hammer, right?

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,100
Back then, I saw him crying.

81
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
I don't know if he was crying because he was having a hard time

82
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,300
solving the case and was angry at himself

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,900
or for not being able to get to the point of the matter.

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Or that he was annoyed at himself for not being able

85
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,100
to relay what he wanted to, despite seeing through the case.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
But I did see him crying back then.

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,300
It just looks like its crying!

88
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,000
Gosh, both of you!

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,600
But I guess this is okay the way it is. Right, Mitsuhiko?

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes. I'm glad we bought fruits on the way here.

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah.

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, you brats! Don't you dare touch that!

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,600
"Sakuko Kokura (22)" -That's our graduation project, you know.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,800
"Tanji Kiyama (22)" -Well, it's only a trial piece though.

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a graduation project?

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,500
This snowman that looks like a monster?

97
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,800
That's right!

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
We're students of the sculpture department of an art university.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
"Asaka Onoue (22)" -Since all four of us love snow,

100
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,900
we pleaded with our teacher and got special permission to do this.

101
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,600
But he's the only one who was making it.

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,500
"Kazuya Itabashi (22)" -That's because I make the overall framework.

103
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,900
After that, we will discuss it over and add what we want to on it.

104
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,300
After coming up with something that we are satisfied with,

105
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,700
we'll take a picture of it

106
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,500
and use it to help us make the real snow statue that we want to make.

107
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,400
If we make it all together from the start,

108
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
we'll most likely come up with something that's not really organized.

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
The title of this project is "The Grief of the Abominable Snowman".

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,700
The head's basically finished,

111
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,200
but I haven't come up with anything yet to his body.

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Well, let's go easy on it.

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,900
Go easy?

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,700
We've got to leave the day after tomorrow.

115
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,200
So we need you to hurry and get it into shape somehow.

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,300
That's not nice, Sakuko.

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,400
Itabashi's been out here all this time for us.

118
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
I'd just like you to know,

119
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,700
it was you guys' idea for the four of us to make this project together.

120
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't really care to.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, now.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,100
It's our university project on our last winter vacation.

123
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,400
Right, let's end everything peacefully, okay?

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,500
I mean, we may not even see each other again after graduating.

125
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,600
Right, Asaka?

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Right.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,100
I guess so.

128
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,200
Shall all four of us go to ski at night on the last day then?

129
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
I guess not.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not all of us can go.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Hey, Sakuko! Wait!

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,400
Asaka.

133
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,100
Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,900
I've worked things out inside of me.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,600
Okay then, Itabashi.

136
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm going back to the lodge.

137
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,100
Call me when you're done.

138
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,200
Yeah.

139
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,200
That brunette's leg...

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,900
She dragging her leg.

141
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,600
What a snobbish lady, the one with the slant eyes.

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Shall we surprise them with our snowman?

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,100
Huh? How?

144
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,800
First of all, we...

145
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes, this is Sakuko.

146
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,200
Huh? Talk with me?

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,300
Right now?

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,100
There's nothing better than curry

149
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,800
-after sweating in the snowy mountains. -That's right!

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,200
I mean, all you guys did was make a snowman.

151
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Did you find her?

152
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Maybe she went out skiing alone

154
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,800
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

155
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Hey, hey, Asaka.

156
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Is something the matter?

157
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

158
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,200
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

159
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
We have already search the stores and all.

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,900
Don't tell me she really went outside?

162
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
Let's all split up and look for her.

163
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,400
We'll search behind the lodge.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
You guys should search the front.

165
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
Hey! Sakuko!

166
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,900
Are you there?

167
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,400
Slant eyed lady, where are you?

168
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,300
Hey!

169
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Guys, where are you?

170
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
Guys!

171
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Silly, stop crying.

172
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,700
Hang on tight to my outfit and don't let go.

173
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,900
Hey, guys! Is everybody else nearby?

174
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Yes! I'm hanging on tightly to Haibara's hand.

175
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,900
What's this?

176
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,300
It's my hand.

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,600
Are you talking about me?

178
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,300
In this white-out condition,

179
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,800
don't you think it's too dangerous to keep searching?

180
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,300
I guess so. We'd better wait till the blizzard subsides.

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,000
The head of our snowman is on the ground!

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,300
No!

183
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,800
It probably slipped off because of this strong wind.

184
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
The gloves.

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Darn it!

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,900
Wait, Genta!

187
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,100
-That glove! -I'm sure there's a cliff over that side!

188
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,500
That was close...

189
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,600
I told you.

190
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,100
The blizzard is subsiding a bit.

191
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Yes.

192
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Huh?

193
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Is something the matter, Conan?

194
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,400
Below the cliff in that lake,

195
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,700
there's something floating.

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Don't tell me that it's...

197
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Use the zoom function of your right lens.

198
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,900
Okay.

199
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
There!

200
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
It's a person.

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,200
A person is floating in the lake.

202
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
That's...

203
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Sakuko?

204
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:33,109
The victim is Ms. Sakuko Kokura, age 22,

205
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:35,909
a senior at an art university.

206
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:38,909
It seems she drowned to death,

207
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:42,809
but shall we bring her in for autopsy just in case, Officer Yamamura?

208
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,709
Yeah. Please do that, will you?

209
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,709
Well?

210
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,309
Was this woman travelling alone?

211
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:52,709
No, well...

212
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,909
She came here with her classmates who went to the same art university.

213
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,209
From the right, it's Tanji Kiyama,

214
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,109
Asaka Onoue,

215
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:03,609
and Kazuya Itabashi.

216
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,209
So, did these three find the body?

217
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,209
No, the one who found her is...

218
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:11,209
We, the Youth Detective Squad!

219
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,409
We were looking for that lady when it became a blizzard.

220
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,909
Then we found her from that cliff over there.

221
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,409
We saw her floating in this lake.

222
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,109
You're that boy that's always with Mr. Mouri.

223
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:27,009
Which means that Detective Mouri is also here?

224
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,509
No, he's not.

225
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,609
I'm sorry, but we're the only one here.

226
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,609
Oh, I see.

227
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:36,109
Which means that the Sleeping Kogoro

228
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:40,109
won't be disclosing the truth of this cursed case.

229
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,609
Cursed?

230
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:42,709
Yes.

231
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:48,909
She's wearing snowboard boots.

232
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,809
On the lake, the snowboard was floating.

233
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,009
Moreover, to come down here below the cliff,

234
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,609
you have to cross that bridge.

235
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:06,109
And yet, that bridge was closed off till we arrived here.

236
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:08,309
It means that she fell from the cliff when she was snowboarding.

237
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,309
Yes.

238
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:12,809
She accidentally fell over the cliff in the blizzard.

239
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,409
It's natural to think she fell over the cliff and drowned in the lake.

240
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,609
But it's a complete mystery.

241
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:25,509
I mean, this lake!

242
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:26,909
Lake?

243
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,109
Don't you think it's weird?

244
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:31,909
There's so much snow accumulated and yet why isn't the lake frozen?

245
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,909
I'm sure that an evil creature that lives in the lake

246
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,109
lured her to jump into the lake and sucked her in.

247
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,509
It's a hot spring.

248
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,209
Huh?

249
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,809
Hot water flows into this lake and the water temperature is high.

250
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:50,809
Well, it's not the kind of temperature that anyone would like to go into.

251
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:55,109
I've heard that this lake has never frozen.

252
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:56,109
Is that so?

253
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:59,909
Yeah, it's written here in this guide book, too.

254
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:02,809
Shouldn't a local police officer know about this?

255
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:06,609
Then, it's an accident.

256
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:10,809
But still, I wonder if this person was really snowboarding?

257
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,009
Huh?

258
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,509
Because she isn't even wearing a cap or goggles.

259
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,009
That's right.

260
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:18,409
It was a blizzard,

261
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:21,809
so it's strange that she went without wearing anything on her head.

262
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,509
It probably came off when she fell into the lake.

263
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,309
That could be so for the cap and goggles,

264
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,709
but her gloves wouldn't come off, would they?

265
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,609
True.

266
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:34,909
Which means that Ms. Kokura...

267
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,009
was a person who perspired a lot.

268
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,509
Hey.

269
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,609
You know, it's like the people who hate to wear gloves

270
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,509
because their hands get all sweaty.

271
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,909
But I think even people like that would wear gloves when snowboarding.

272
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,309
Maybe she wasn't dressed to go snowboarding in the first place

273
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,209
and the boots were put on her?

274
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:01,709
Sakuko was murdered, but made it look like an accident while snowboarding.

275
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,209
Maybe somebody planned this out.

276
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,409
No way.

277
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:09,709
Then, you mean it was someone among the three?

278
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,509
I was just stating a possible assumption.

279
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,009
Would you give me the details as to what happened

280
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,509
up to the time Sakuko's body was found?

281
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,109
Yeah.

282
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:26,409
I think it was just before 12 pm, right?

283
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,909
Yeah. She went straight up to her room right after coming to the lodge.

284
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:37,009
After that, we promised to eat lunch together a little after 1 pm,

285
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,109
but only she didn't show up.

286
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:43,109
I went to her room and knocked on the door, but got no answer.

287
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:46,109
So I had the lodge manager open the door for me,

288
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,609
but she wasn't there.

289
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:52,609
We split up and looked for her inside the lodge, but couldn't find her.

290
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,709
And just when we were at a loss what to do...

291
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,409
I ran into them in the dining room.

292
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,009
Maybe she went out skiing alone

293
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,209
and because of this blizzard, she can't find her way back.

294
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:05,209
Hey, hey, Asaka.

295
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,109
Is something the matter?

296
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,209
You're the old man that was with the children a while ago.

297
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,709
Sakuko, who was with us, didn't come to lunch.

298
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,209
So I went to her room to call her, but she wasn't there.

299
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,109
We have already search the stores and all.

300
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,309
Don't tell me she really went outside?

301
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,109
Let's all split up and look for her.

302
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,809
We'll search behind the lodge.

303
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,109
You guys should search the front.

304
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:34,309
So we split in two groups and started searching.

305
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,309
Then, Conan found her dead body from on top of the cliff.

306
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,209
And?

307
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,209
Where were you guys from the time you parted with her

308
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,209
till the time she was found?

309
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:51,309
I was in my room at the lodge.

310
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,609
I was also in my room.

311
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,109
I was in the back of the lodge making the snowman.

312
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,509
Snowman?

313
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,709
Yes.

314
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:03,109
I was making the trial framework for our graduation project.

315
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:08,009
By the way, it seems like Sakuko has rented a snowboard and boots,

316
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,709
but did you rent something, too?

317
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,309
Yes. I rented a snowboard, too.

318
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,509
I rented a pair of skis too, but...

319
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,509
But?

320
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,209
Kiyama hasn't skied,

321
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,809
out of consideration for me, who hurt my leg last year

322
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,709
and can't ski anymore.

323
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:28,309
But even if you can't ski, you can still push a person from behind,

324
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,309
can't you?

325
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,509
Huh?

326
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,609
Look. You three could've called Sakuko after parting with her

327
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,409
to secretly have her come to that cliff there.

328
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:44,309
I just thought that all you'd have to do is give her a little push

329
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,809
and she'd go falling down into the lake below.

330
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,609
No way.

331
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:54,609
It's understandable if she fell over on a speeding snowboard.

332
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,209
But even if you were to push her from the cliff over there,

333
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,409
she would have landed right about there.

334
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:02,409
There's still more than five meters before she reaches the lake.

335
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,209
I see. So pushing her off is out.

336
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,409
But if it's you who can ski...

337
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,209
I think that's impossible, too.

338
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:18,309
Even if he were to somehow make it down,

339
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,209
it would be impossible for him

340
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,309
to make it back up in that blizzard in such a short time.

341
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:26,009
Even with a rope.

342
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:27,809
If you still suspect me,

343
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,209
why don't you go to the locker in the lodge

344
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,909
and check the ski board and ski shoes that I rented.

345
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,209
If I used them, they should be wet, right?

346
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,809
Are you three using the same locker?

347
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,609
Yes.

348
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,609
Which means, anyone of you

349
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,809
could've taken out her snowboard and boots at any time you wanted?

350
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,309
Just what are you getting at?

351
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,409
-Huh? -Huh?

352
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,709
In other words, if you tie her on to the snowboard

353
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:56,309
and make her slide from the cliff...

354
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,609
she would automatically fall into the lake.

355
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:04,809
Are you all right, officer?

356
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,509
This slope is super bumpy.

357
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,009
If you do something like that, she's bound to flip over.

358
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,609
As to that, if it's Mr. Itabashi who can snowboard,

359
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:18,609
he could easily choose a slope that isn't bumpy.

360
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:22,409
Then, where's the rope that she was tied onto with?

361
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,309
That's right!

362
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,909
And even if she didn't fell down,

363
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,409
I think her body would've been tied onto the board.

364
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,909
Besides, Sakuko probably didn't have her gloves on

365
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:37,909
because she got lost in the blizzard

366
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:41,809
and was trying to call us on her cell phone for help.

367
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,309
But would she take off the gloves from both hands to make the call?

368
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,809
Maybe she wasn't trying to call, but trying to send a text message?

369
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,009
She would be using both hands to type.

370
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,509
Text message?

371
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,309
Yes.

372
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,009
Sakuko used to always confirm by text message

373
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:04,609
whether we would be able to answer her call, saying, "May I call you now?"

374
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:09,209
Her gloves probably got blown away by the wind when she was typing.

375
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:17,009
She probably went after her gloves using the snowboard.

376
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,309
And fell over the cliff.

377
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,609
Was the blizzard that bad?

378
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:31,709
Yeah, it was unreal.

379
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:35,309
It was white all over and you couldn't see anything around.

380
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,709
Guys, where are you?

381
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,109
So it's an accident after all.

382
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,409
I guess so.

383
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,209
Please cut out all your strange guesses, officer.

384
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:54,809
Well then, let's go to the cliff where she is thought to have fallen from.

385
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,909
There may be traces of an accident left, too.

386
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,409
Accident?

387
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,109
It can't be.

388
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,609
I wonder if a person who promised to have meals with others in an hour

389
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,509
would go out into the blizzard, carry the snowboard

390
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:09,209
and go all the way up the ski trail?

391
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:14,409
If this is homicide, the culprit must be one of these three.

392
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,609
I can't figure out...

393
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,409
how Sakuko who was in the lodge...

394
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,309
was thrown into the lake.

395
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,609
"Next Episode" -Snowman?

396
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,409
Yes. What about it?

397
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:09,409
Genta!

398
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:14,309
The percentage of this being a homicide is zero!

399
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:16,709
It is 120% an accident.

400
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:20,609
Sakuko did not die of an accident, but was killed.

401
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,009
Moreover, the culprit is...

402
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,709
It could be the ski trails that the culprit left behind.

403
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:33,009
Next Conan, "Unbreakable Snowman (Part 2)"

404
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,509
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:53,309
"The taste of snow"

406
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,509
What does snow taste like?

407
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:55,809
It's pretty salty.

408
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,509
Yes, yes.
