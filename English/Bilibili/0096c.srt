1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,480
The deceased is
Yabuuchi Machiko-san, age 39.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,550
You're sure she's the
second wife of Yoshichika-san,

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,380
the head of this house
who died last month?

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,490
Yes.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,630
Detective Yamamura.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,720
We haven't found
the murder weapon yet,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,080
but it appears she died of
blood loss from the stab to the chest.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,840
O-Oh, is that so?

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,570
Can we say the body was found just after 10:00 pm?
Detective Yamamura

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,550
Can we say the body was found just after 10:00 pm?

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,840
Yes.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,390
It seemed odd that the well bucket
was up, so when we pulled it up...

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,430
...we found her body in the well.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,730
Umm, is something the matter?

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,220
No, no! I just got
chills when I imagined it...

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,950
Umm, this would mean that
the killer was one of you eight

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,050
who were here when it happened...

18
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,500
H-Hold on, now!

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,550
She was at a friend's after-wedding
party at the hotel by the station,

20
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,510
and she called from
there at around 9:00!

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,010
Even if she left by
car right after calling,

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,510
she wouldn't be
back until after 10:00.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,840
We were all in the same room

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,260
between 10:00 and the
time the body was found,

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,730
so we couldn't have killed her!

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,690
Yep! I was the only one not with them,
because I was in the bath!

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,720
Eh?! T-Then you're the killer?!

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,470
No! I only met the
late Machiko-san today!

29
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,100
Right, Conan-chan?

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,080
Yeah!

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,720
It's the truth!
Yukiko's been living abroad.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,260
I just happened
to ask her here today.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,260
"Yukiko"? Oh, wait a minute!
Don't tell me you're...

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,220
Fujimine Yukiko-san, the actress?!

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,480
Y-Yes.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,600
Wow, cool!

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,110
I used to watch you every week on
"Dangerous Policewoman Story!"

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,800
You actually inspired me
to join the police!

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,630
Oh!

40
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,440
That makes you even more suspicious.

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,150
Huh?

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,970
After all, you're skilled
at using guns and knives.

43
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,330
That was just a TV show!

44
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,040
Are we gonna be alright with this cop?

45
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,470
Say. Was it really
Machiko-san who called?

46
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,470
Yes. It was her.

47
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,510
She responded to the conversation,
and I could hear the party, too.

48
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,010
See?! Only you could've done it!

49
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,430
I'm telling you...

50
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,680
There's someone
else who's suspicious!

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,010
He was lurking around here.

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,610
A strange person covering his face
with sunglasses, a hat, and a scarf.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,990
A s-strange person?

54
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,030
I bet it's the brother of our mom,
who died fifteen years ago.

55
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,880
She tried to pick a flower there
and accidentally fell into the well.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,040
But he's convinced one
of us pushed her down there.

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,050
But just like me, Machiko-san wasn't
part of the family fifteen years ago!

58
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,970
So why would he kill her?

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,630
Good question.

60
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,520
It was dark back here.
Maybe he mistook her for someone else?

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,230
Umm, it's still not certain if
he was the man with sunglasses...

62
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,100
It could be.

63
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,740
See? Here's this camellia flower.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,280
A flower from that tree?

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
This was in this
lady's breast pocket.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,470
What're you freakin' out for?

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,790
You're with the homicide
department, aren't you?

68
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,550
A-Actually, this is my
first real investigation...

69
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,010
There's a cold going
around the department,

70
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,510
so I was the only
one they could send...

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,260
So, I'm not good
around dead bodies...

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,270
Oh. I see.
Oh. I see.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,880
A-Anyways, to find out the
precise time the victim returned home,

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,150
I'll need to check with
the taxi she took from the hotel.

75
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,660
Taxi?

76
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,200
Mother took the family car.

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,660
C-Car?

78
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,200
The car's in the yard, isn't it?

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,090
No. I didn't see one anywhere.

80
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,050
The car isn't here.

81
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,210
How strange. It's always parked here.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,380
Where could Mother have put the car?

83
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,220
She had been drinking at the party,

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,720
so perhaps she left the
car there and took a taxi home?

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,590
Yes...

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,300
Detective Yamamura!

87
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,050
Yes?

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
We found a car in the
woods right behind the house.

89
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,270
I-In the woods?

90
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,770
What's a car doing there?

91
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,280
T-This is our car!
But why is it in the woods?

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,250
Maybe the killer planned to
use it, but changed his mind?

93
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,690
Your mother probably just ran
out of gas or had engine trouble!

94
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,550
So she walked to the house,
where that man was waiting to stab her!

95
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,360
That's strange. The engine works
just fine, and the key was still in.

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,020
Plus, it still has gas, and
doesn't seem to have any flat tires...

97
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,020
And this empty cassette
case seems curious.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,780
I don't see its contents anywhere.

99
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,030
There's only a cell phone
in the glove compartment.

100
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,460
Hey!

101
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,790
In any case, you'll all sleep
tonight while we keep watch.

102
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,260
Plus, that man
could still be out there.

103
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,510
Geez. We all gotta sleep in
the same room as some cops?

104
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,820
This sucks.

105
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,470
Hey, Shin-chan.

106
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,370
How much have you figured out?

107
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Dunno.

108
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,820
C'mon, tell me!

109
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,320
I'll get accused of being the killer
if we leave it to that lamebrain cop!

110
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,990
There are still too many mysteries!

111
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,580
There's that man in the sunglasses,
the car left in the woods,

112
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,790
and the empty cassette case.

113
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,710
What's most curious of all is the
body that was tied to the well rope.

114
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,900
Even though it was hidden in the well,
it almost asked to be found.

115
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,470
Yeah. There are too many
mysteries scattered about.

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
Huh?

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,610
Was that storeroom open before?.

118
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't know.

119
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,110
W-Wait!

120
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,120
Wait! Shin-chan!

121
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,620
Come on. Let's get back
to our room and sleep.

122
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,530
Hurry up, Shin-chan!

123
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,390
Detective Yamamura!

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,430
Y-Yeah?

125
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,890
We found the murder weapon in the well!

126
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,980
Eh?!

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,980
A kitchen knife, huh?

128
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,480
Please see if it matches
with the victim's stab wound.

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Right!

130
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,490
What's that plastic thing?

131
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,650
Oh, it's a woman's raincoat.

132
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,240
The knife was wrapped
in it for some reason.

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,570
A raincoat?

134
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,110
No, forget it!
Authorized personnel only!

135
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,650
What's going on?

136
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,250
This person just barged in...

137
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,980
I told you, I'm the attorney!

138
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,050
Attorney?

139
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,550
I came to read the will of the late Yoshichika-san!
The Yabuuchi Family Attorney

140
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,720
O-Oh, I see...

141
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,730
It's finally time...

142
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,730
Eh?! Delay the reading of the will?!

143
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,320
Yes. The killer still
hasn't been caught,

144
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,400
and we haven't
finished checking the house.

145
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,570
The reading should
be moved to a later date...

146
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,070
Screw that!

147
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,740
Do you have the right to decide that?!

148
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,500
The greedier you are,
the more noise you make.

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,710
What was that?!

150
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,580
Geezer! Don't be rude with me!

151
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,460
You got that?!
You're just an impostor, anyway!

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,470
Is pain the only way
to get through to you?

153
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,390
H-Hold on, you two!

154
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,400
How about this? We police
will also attend the reading. Okay?

155
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,400
Now, let's all be friends!

156
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,400
T-That was...

157
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,860
Brazilian jujutsu.

158
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,410
He's quite skilled, at that.

159
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,410
Does that mean Carlos
is even more skilled than him?

160
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,130
But, if he's so good at self-defense,
why would he hire a bodyguard?

161
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,190
Good question. Maybe
he's just being extra cautious.

162
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,770
The reading of Yabuuchi Yoshichika's
last will will now take place.

163
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,360
I ask that you listen quietly.

164
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,530
What's wrong?

165
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,450
What is it? What is that sound?!

166
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,650
What's with the tape recorder?

167
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:12,420
Yoshichika-san recorded a
tape that accompanies his written will.

168
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,530
Huh? I don't hear anything.

169
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,640
Wait, isn't that the record button?

170
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,970
We have to stop it!

171
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,020
Duck!

172
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,900
Look out!

173
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,110
What was that?!

174
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,540
T-The cabinet! An arrow
came out of that cabinet!

175
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,750
What?!

176
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,750
W-What the...

177
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,920
A b-bow gun!

178
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,340
And this clock...

179
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,140
A-A timing device...

180
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,480
So, it was set to
fire at a specified time...

181
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,030
W-Who would do this?!

182
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,730
Who set this up?!

183
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,822
Who set this up?!

184
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,492
It must've been that person
who ran from the gate last night!

185
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:26,952
Assuming he really is the brother
of our mom who died fifteen years ago...

186
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:35,462
...and that he held a grudge
against our Yabuuchi family...

187
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,522
I get it.

188
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:41,432
He used the fact we would gather
in here for the reading of the will

189
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:44,932
and set up the
bow gun and arrow there.

190
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:48,192
Does that mean
anyone would've done, then?

191
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:51,102
No, it doesn't look that way.

192
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:52,732
Conan-kun!

193
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:56,112
See? Look at the room on the
other side of the wall it went through.

194
00:11:56,522 --> 00:12:00,522
See all the arrow
holes in the floor mat?

195
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:05,122
It's proof that the killer had
done some test shots beforehand.

196
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:09,402
In order to hit the
person sitting in that spot.

197
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,522
It was decided from the start

198
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:16,752
that the will would be
read in that room, right?

199
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,762
Y-Yes.

200
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,792
That's even more evidence, then.

201
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:26,072
But, kid, there'd be no
way to tell who'd sit where.

202
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,452
Yes, there would.

203
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:33,772
The arrow flew at the "head seat,"

204
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:35,732
Seats of Honor
the one furthest from the exit,

205
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:38,682
Humble Seats
where the most senior person sits, of course.
Seats of Honor

206
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:39,322
Seats of Honor
Humble Seats

207
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:43,862
In other words, that means the
person who set up the arrow...

208
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:48,412
...had tried to target you,
Uncle Yoshifusa.

209
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:55,632
So, there's still another cretin out
to take my life. Heaven help me.

210
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:58,442
But, isn't this a possibility?

211
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:02,342
What if Uncle was the
one who set up the arrow?

212
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:09,312
I don't think so. He barely dodged
it after reacting to Conan's voice.

213
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,062
Duck!

214
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:18,272
Then, is all of this the doing of
that strange man with the sunglasses?

215
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:21,302
Yes. It's a very good possibility.

216
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:26,282
Umm... I'm sorry to interrupt...

217
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:29,992
But shouldn't we
stop that tape recorder?

218
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:34,002
Oh no! I left it on record!

219
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:39,042
Hey! Did all of our
dad's will get erased?!

220
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,322
Why, you...

221
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,552
Oh, whoops!

222
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:45,012
I accidentally put it on
Side B instead of Side A.

223
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:48,642
Which means Side B was recorded to!

224
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:52,822
The will is safe and sound on Side A!

225
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,392
Geez...

226
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,982
C'mon! Just let us hear the will already!

227
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:00,402
Please calm down. I'm rewinding it now.

228
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:04,232
In any case, I don't think
we'll be able to solve this case

229
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:06,232
until we learn
who that strange person is...

230
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:10,412
Yeah. But I have a good
idea who set up the arrow.

231
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:12,912
It's that person.

232
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:16,822
D-Don't tell me they're in this room?!

233
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,922
Yeah.

234
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:21,272
C'mon! Who is it?! Tell me!

235
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:26,732
No! There are still too many mysteries!
I can't say anything rashly!

236
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,172
Just a hint, then?

237
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,432
No!

238
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,182
Oh, I see.

239
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:36,392
Fine, then! I'll figure it out
on my own! Who needs you?!

240
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:39,442
Hey, now! Don't pout, Mom!

241
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,862
Detective Yamamura!

242
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:47,362
We found a suspicious
cassette tape by the bath stove!

243
00:14:47,362 --> 00:14:48,862
A-A tape?!

244
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:54,622
Listen, everyone! Please stay
in this room until I return!

245
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,542
H-Huh? Where's
Yukiko-san and that boy?

246
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:00,702
They just went outside.

247
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:01,292
Eh?!

248
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:06,982
Hold on, hold on! Please
don't wander around on your own!

249
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:09,722
So, where was this tape?

250
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,552
Y-Yes. It was between the firewood.

251
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,772
That's weird.

252
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:18,102
Hiromi got the bath ready, but she
didn't say anything about a tape.

253
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:22,982
Oh, and we just received word
from the examiners. It's strange...

254
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,402
Strange?

255
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:31,482
Only the victim's fingerprints and
blood were on the murder weapon,

256
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:38,652
but oddly enough, it appears
she had held it as you would a sword.

257
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:40,232
A s-sword?

258
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,372
Yes.

259
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,292
That is strange.

260
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,942
If she had grabbed the
handle after being stabbed,

261
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,722
it would've been upside-down.

262
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:53,692
If it was placed in her hands
to make it look like a suicide,

263
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,432
it would've made sense
to have it upside down, too!

264
00:15:55,862 --> 00:16:02,692
Oh, and I contacted the hotel
the victim had supposedly been at.

265
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,152
What did they say?

266
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:09,772
It seems she had indeed been there,
but they're not sure when she left.

267
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:13,732
Come to think of it, Hiromi
did say something strange.

268
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:19,022
The late Machiko-san said
she'd be home after 11:00,

269
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,172
so why was she back just after 10:00?

270
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:24,992
Wait a minute!

271
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:32,012
This door will take you straight
from the bath to the stove.

272
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:36,902
And this stove is right next to the well,
where the body was hidden!

273
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:41,022
Which means that tape...

274
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,302
Could it be?!

275
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:46,072
Let's hear what's on the tape for now.

276
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,322
What're you doing, Mom?

277
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:56,022
Hey.

278
00:16:56,022 --> 00:17:01,752
You said that sunglasses person
was watching from this gate, right?

279
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:06,402
Yeah. Hiromi-san
saw him run from there, too.

280
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:14,932
What is it? Did you find something?

281
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,072
It's nothing!

282
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:20,932
Hurry! Please return to the room!

283
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:25,322
Okay! Let's go listen to
that tapey-wapey, Conan-chan!

284
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:27,442
Quit talking like that!

285
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:30,612
Machiko-chan! Let's drink!

286
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:34,402
This is from the party Mother was at!

287
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:37,192
This tape was really
right next to the stove?

288
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,322
Y-Yes.

289
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:44,332
Just as I thought! This makes all
of Machiko-san's strange actions fit!

290
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:50,382
And her killer was the one
who blurted out something odd!

291
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,692
Hey, Mom. I'm gonna need your help.

292
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,342
I figured out who's responsible.

293
00:17:57,522 --> 00:18:01,722
I'm going to explain using
your voice, so go along with it...

294
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,682
Forget it.

295
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:04,732
Eh?

296
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:08,522
Don't give me that. You wouldn't
tell me anything earlier.

297
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,792
If you wanna do it, do it on your own.

298
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:16,322
Because I know something
you don't, Shin-chan!

299
00:18:16,322 --> 00:18:18,242
L-Like what?!

300
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,192
Don't ask me.

301
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:23,742
Whatever. Just don't get in my way.

302
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:29,522
Well, let's hear the tape with
the will for now. What do you say?

303
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:30,502
Yes.

304
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,902
D-Detective?

305
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:42,932
Or so I'd like to say, but the will
can wait until after my explanation.

306
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:48,942
After I've revealed who was
responsible for the two incidents here.

307
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:50,062
W-What?!

308
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,522
Let's start with the second incident,

309
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:55,772
with the hidden bow gun
that was aimed at Mr. Yoshifusa.

310
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:00,742
Hey, now. Wasn't the guy
with the sunglasses behind that?

311
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:03,322
I thought so, too.

312
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:06,202
Until I heard a certain
someone say a certain something.

313
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,192
Certain something?

314
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:11,962
Why don't we give it a listen?
We do have it...

315
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:15,522
...on Side B of the will tape.

316
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,972
Mr. Attorney. Please play it.

317
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:19,722
Y-You can't be serious...

318
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:25,722
L-Let's play it and see.

319
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,442
Duck!

320
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,072
Look out!

321
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:30,362
What was that?!

322
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:34,022
T-The cabinet! An arrow
came out of that cabinet!

323
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:34,732
What?!

324
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,112
A b-bow gun!

325
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,822
So, what about this?

326
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,742
Doesn't it seem strange?

327
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:45,912
As you all know, the
arrow fired from the cabinet

328
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,872
flew across the room in an instant,

329
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:53,132
shot through the wall,
and left our field of vision.

330
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,632
Yet, a certain person accurately
identified it as an arrow,

331
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:02,192
before we even opened the cabinet
and found a bow gun inside.

332
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,142
Why would that be?

333
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:08,182
Keiko! Don't tell me you--

334
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,522
Yes. The answer is simple.

335
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:17,152
It was because you set
up that bow gun, Keiko-san!

336
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:18,942
Say what?!

337
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,862
B-But that's not enough
to prove Keiko did it...

338
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:29,022
It's true! I set it up! The day
Uncle Yoshifusa came back!

339
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,752
K-Keiko...

340
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:34,792
I got us in debt.
I kept it a secret from you.

341
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,502
It was a huge amount,
with even bigger interest.

342
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,692
I thought if I could get
my portion of the inheritance,

343
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:45,512
I could pay it all off
without you ever knowing.

344
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:51,892
But, when I heard your uncle
came back from Brazil, I just snapped.

345
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:55,192
I didn't intend to kill him.

346
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:59,442
I just wanted to scare
him enough to return to Brazil.

347
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:01,902
I set it up so it'd miss him;

348
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:06,202
I didn't expect it to fly so close to him!

349
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:11,202
It doesn't matter,
since you killed Mother anyway.

350
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:12,162
Eh?!

351
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,582
That was your doing too, right?

352
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,752
N-No! That wasn't me!

353
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:20,212
B-But...

354
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,462
It's the truth! Believe me!

355
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,052
She's right.

356
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:29,312
The person who murdered
Machiko-san and hid her in the well...

357
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,062
...was someone else!

358
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,602
W-What?!

359
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:34,652
Who?!

360
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,352
Who was it?!

361
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:40,362
Okay! Solve this right, Shinichi!

362
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:42,862
The person responsible...

363
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:45,072
We'll be watching!
