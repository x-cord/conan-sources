1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,540
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,440
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
The stage for today's episode is a TV station.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,340
The passion for creating a program

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,540
gets bent out of shape along the way and leads to murder!

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:02,225
And you want me, Kogoro Mouri...

10
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:06,125
to speak before the scriptwriters?

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:10,525
Yes. I'd really like you to tell them your story, Detective Mouri.

12
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:13,325
Have you ever seen the show "Detective Fluke"?

13
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:17,225
Well, since it's a detective story, I've watched it several times.

14
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,325
I watch it every week!

15
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,025
Thank you.

16
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:26,225
Three people are taking turns writing the scripts of "Detective Fluke".

17
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:29,625
However, since we've been doing this for five years now,

18
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,625
we're running out of things and tricks to write about.

19
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:38,625
So you want to use my experiences as a reference to make your scripts.

20
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,625
It doesn't happen all the time,

21
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,625
but once in several times, there are fantastic ones.

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,825
For example,

23
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:51,325
"52nd Closed Door Murder" had a surprising trick.

24
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,125
If so, Fluke, that locked room was...

25
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,725
It was set up afterwards, Inspector.

26
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,025
The entire house was lifted up with a crane.

27
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:09,525
No one would ever think that such a large scale method would be used.

28
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:14,525
But you can't fool the eyes of Detective Rintaro Fluke here.

29
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,525
It's amazing how they can think up a trick like that.

30
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,325
It makes me so happy.

31
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:31,025
I think that the "52nd Closed Door Murder" is a great mystery story, too.

32
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,625
But it was broadcast more than 2 years ago.

33
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,025
How old are you now anyway, Conan?

34
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:38,525
Well...

35
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,825
I saw it on a video the other day.

36
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,325
Oh, my. Of course.

37
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,625
That was close.

38
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,025
I understand.

39
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:53,025
I'll tell the scriptwriters all the various experiences I've been through.

40
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,125
May I go, too?

41
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,725
I'd like to meet the people who are writing "Detective Fluke"!

42
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:08,425
"The Mystery of the Complete Half Crime"

43
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,625
Maybe we came here too early.

44
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,925
There's an hour more before the appointed time.

45
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:24,225
I'm sure there was a coffee shop on the top floor.

46
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:26,025
I'm scriptwriter, Yagami.

47
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:29,025
I'm going to the producer of "Detective Fluke", Inoue's place.

48
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,125
Yes, sir. One moment, please.

49
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:37,025
That guy. He's one of the three scriptwriters, isn't he?

50
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:40,725
He seems somewhat unfriendly and arrogant.

51
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,625
Mr. Yagami, long time no see.

52
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,325
Well, the cab I was riding got caught in traffic.

53
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,525
I think it's been six months already

54
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,225
that we've all gotten together like this.

55
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:02,125
While we're waiting for Mr. Mouri to arrive a while later,

56
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,225
I would like to conduct a meeting

57
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,525
as to the development of this series from now on.

58
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,825
I'd like something to drink.

59
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:09,925
What about all of you?

60
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,625
No, thank you.

61
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,225
I'll go get it. I'll take your order.

62
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,125
Coffee! Hot.

63
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,525
-Same here. -Same here.

64
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,925
Okay, I'll be right back.

65
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:30,825
I'm sorry. Let me do it.

66
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,325
It's okay, I'm always doing this.

67
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,425
Is he a waiter or what?

68
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,825
I think the meeting is more important.

69
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,825
Is he really a scriptwriter, or what?

70
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,425
He writes great stuff.

71
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,125
I'm not talking about what he writes.

72
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,525
I'm talking about the way he usually behaves, Sakuma.

73
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,725
He's still a newcomer, so...

74
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:55,325
I'm sure he's trying to be as considerate as possible!

75
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,425
I think you should take him off the list after all, Ms. Inoue.

76
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:02,725
Sakuma and I can probably handle "Detective Fluke" ourselves.

77
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:04,625
-Mr. Yagami... -Mr. Yagami...

78
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,525
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

79
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,425
Thank you.

80
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,925
If I remember correctly, you use milk, don't you?

81
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,725
I forgot the milk. I'll be right back.

82
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,925
I tell you, he lacks composure.

83
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:31,125
He still very young.

84
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,025
-Mr. Yagami! -Mr. Yagami!

85
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:59,625
Yes, Ms. Inoue.

86
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,125
What did you just say?

87
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,925
Yes!

88
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:11,725
That's right. The address here is...

89
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,525
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:26,025
The smell of almond, it's poisoning by cyanic acid.

91
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,725
Four people and four drinks.

92
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:53,525
There was poison in the coffee cup that was on the floor.

93
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:57,325
No poison whatsoever was detected in the other three cups.

94
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:01,325
In other words, the culprit put poison only in Mr. Yagami's cup.

95
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,625
That's right.

96
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:06,225
Mr. Koda, you're the one who got the drinks?

97
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,425
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,125
I took everyone's order.

99
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,625
Everyone usually drinks hot coffee while I drink Japanese tea.

100
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:18,325
But doesn't a staff of the TV station usually the who serves tea?

101
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:20,925
Yes, but...

102
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,525
I'm still a fledgling scriptwriter,

103
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,725
so I try to help out whenever I can.

104
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,225
Is something strange about what I did?

105
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:32,125
No, not really.

106
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,425
I see!

107
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:37,025
One of the cups in the hot water room was smeared with poison

108
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,225
and that cup just happened to go to Mr. Yagami.

109
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:44,425
So, you're saying that someone wanted to commit at random murder?

110
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:46,725
I can't think of anything else.

111
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,725
So you said that you'd serve the coffee,

112
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,525
but Mr. Koda insisted on doing it himself.

113
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,825
Yes, he said he'd do it himself.

114
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,525
May I have a moment with you, Inspector?

115
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,325
Ms. Inoue, will you please come with me?

116
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,325
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:14,025
Judging from the circumstances,

118
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,925
the only one who would've been able to mix the poison in the drink

119
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,825
is Mr. Koda.

120
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:22,625
His remark of it being a random killing is shaky justification

121
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,125
and we feel that he's our man.

122
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,525
But what's his motive?

123
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,025
You brat! I told you to stay in your room.

124
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,125
He's writing for the same program, isn't he?

125
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,325
Why would he want to poison his colleague?

126
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,625
He may be a colleague, but...

127
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,225
Is something bothering you?

128
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:42,625
Please tell us about it.

129
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,725
This is a homicide case, you know.

130
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,625
The scripts of "Detective Fluke"

131
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:55,025
were originally being written by both Mr. Yagaimi and Mr. Sakuma by turns.

132
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,925
Then, this man who introduced himself as a fervent fan of the program

133
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,025
brings a plot that he had written to me.

134
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,025
He was Mr. Koda.

135
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,625
I read it, and found it to be very interesting.

136
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,425
So I decided to have him work for us as our third scriptwriter.

137
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:11,425
Although Mr. Sakuma evaluated him highly,

138
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:14,025
Mr. Yagami for some reason didn't like him.

139
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:20,825
Therefore, Mr. Yagami had repeatedly told me to take him off the program.

140
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:23,525
Did Mr. Koda know about this?

141
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,125
I think he could sense it from the atmosphere.

142
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,325
I'm sure it was a very trying situation for Mr. Koda.

143
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,825
Which means...

144
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:32,225
Ms. Inoue.

145
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:35,625
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

146
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,225
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

147
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:46,425
Mr. Koda was staking his future on "Detective Fluke".

148
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:51,125
But Mr. Yagami wanted to get Mr. Koda off the project no matter what.

149
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,925
Inspector, there's no doubt that he...

150
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,125
He does have a motive.

151
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,525
But if he did do it...

152
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:22,425
Hey, Mr. Mouri. Wait!

153
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,725
We already know who the killer is!

154
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,625
But we don't have any material evidence whatsoever yet.

155
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,225
Besides, there are things that are not solved yet.

156
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,625
Shut up! I'll make him spit it out.

157
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,825
I'm the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri!

158
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,225
Are you sure?

159
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,925
I killed Mr. Yagami?

160
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:43,025
You're suspecting that I did it?

161
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,425
No way.

162
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:49,025
Well, it's true that I slightly hated him, but...

163
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:53,525
Mr. Mouri, even if I were to have put poison into the coffee cup,

164
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:56,125
I wouldn't make Mr. Yagami drink it.

165
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,425
Because out of the three cups, only one would be poisoned.

166
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:03,325
Moreover, I left to go get milk, so I wasn't there.

167
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,325
In other words, I didn't urge him to drink it,

168
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,625
but Mr. Yagami drank it of his own initiative.

169
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,425
There was no way I could've known

170
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:14,025
that Mr. Yagami would choose the coffee cup he chose.

171
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,225
Am I wrong?

172
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,325
Well...

173
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:19,025
That's it.

174
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:21,225
If he's the killer,

175
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:24,925
how did he make Mr. Yagami choose the cup he drank out of?

176
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,625
I see!

177
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:31,825
Mr. Mouri?

178
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:34,625
You brought the drinks

179
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,525
and gave the cup without the poison inside to Ms. Inoue,

180
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,725
which leaves two cups remaining.

181
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,625
Two cups would be the same as I mentioned earlier.

182
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,925
I'd have no idea which one Mr. Yagami would choose.

183
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,925
That's easy. All you have to do is line it up this way.

184
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:54,025
Mr. Yagami was sitting just about here in the room back then.

185
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,525
He would most naturally take the cup that is nearest to him.

186
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,525
Moreover, Mr. Sakuma would never pick up his coffee cup

187
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,725
before Mr. Yagami, his superior.

188
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,425
I see.

189
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:05,625
I wonder about that.

190
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,025
No, although he is my superior and I came in after him,

191
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,425
we know each other quite well.

192
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,325
So even back then I took the coffee cup before Mr. Yagami

193
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,025
and gave him the remaining cup.

194
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:20,025
If that's the case, doesn't that make me suspicious?

195
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,625
Mr. Mouri, if you want to implicate me so much,

196
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,525
just what kind of trick did I use

197
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:31,325
to make sure Mr. Yagami drank the poison?

198
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:34,225
Figure that out first.

199
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:36,825
Those challenging eyes...

200
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:39,425
He's gotta be the suspect.

201
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:43,025
And he's confident about the trick he used.

202
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:46,825
Two people and two drinks.

203
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,725
The percentage of each choice is 50%.

204
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:54,625
Just what kind of trick he use to get a probability of 100%?

205
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,489
Mr. Mouri. To be honest, I have my doubts about suspecting Mr. Koda.

206
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:10,189
If by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

207
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,289
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

208
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:16,289
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

209
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,089
But he left the room saying that he forgot the milk.

210
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,489
If he were the killer, would he leave the scene?

211
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:24,889
That's true.

212
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,389
Didn't it cross his mind that an accident could occur?

213
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,889
Hey.

214
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,689
Are you listening to me, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,989
I wonder what's going to happen to "Detective Fluke" from now on.

216
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,289
Is it going to end?

217
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:50,189
I don't know. But with something like this happening...

218
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,289
After all the effort that was put into writing the scripts.

219
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,589
Is that the list for "Detective Fluke"?

220
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,189
May I have a look at it?

221
00:14:58,789 --> 00:14:59,989
Go ahead.

222
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:00,989
Thank you.

223
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,589
What is it?

224
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,989
That was Mr. Koda's script, wasn't it?

225
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,389
The one entitled "52nd Closed Room Murder".

226
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,589
The one you said that you thought was interesting, too.

227
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:22,989
Actually, that was the first plot that Mr. Koda brought here.

228
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,689
I was also surprised that a new scriptwriter with such talent existed.

229
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,189
Mr. Koda also wrote the "Supporting Performers Club"?

230
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:34,289
Yes. Why?

231
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,389
Don't tell me that...

232
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,389
Most of the scripts are written by both Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma.

233
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,789
They're after all the main scriptwriters, so...

234
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:45,889
In other words, no matter how talented he is,

235
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,089
he doesn't have the chance to display it.

236
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,889
And if that's the motive,

237
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,989
every mystery is solved.

238
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,589
What's the matter, Conan?

239
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,489
Ms. Inoue!

240
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,589
I've finally arrived at the goal.

241
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,789
It seems that he's figured out the trick!

242
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:05,889
No way.

243
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:10,189
There are two people and two drinks.

244
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:15,489
The way to make the target drink the poison for sure is...

245
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:19,089
No matter how much I think, there's only one way.

246
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,089
That is...

247
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,389
to believe in luck.

248
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,789
Mr. Mouri, is that the conclusion you've reached?

249
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,689
Inspector, this is no joke.

250
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,689
The rate of success is 50%.

251
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:39,789
You took a sink or swim chance.

252
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:42,889
Mr. Koda, your desperate feeling

253
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:47,289
of not wanting to be removed from the script writing of "Detective Fluke"

254
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,089
made you take the dreadful risk of sink or swim.

255
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,489
That's enough, Mr. Mouri.

256
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:56,889
No, Inspector! I'm saying this with conviction.

257
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,889
Mr. Mouri?

258
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,989
Could this be the rumoured...

259
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,389
Sleeping Kogoro?

260
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:11,889
I took a sink or swim chance?

261
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,189
Are you serious about what you're saying?

262
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,989
At one point I really thought so, but...

263
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,989
Mr. Mouri...

264
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,589
Please hear me out, Inspector.

265
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,789
Mr. Koda, you said to solve the mystery of the trick you used

266
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,589
to make Mr. Yagami choose the poisoned coffee

267
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,589
if we're going to suspect you.

268
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,989
But that's impossible.

269
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:38,989
Because you used no trick to begin with.

270
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,589
There's no trick?

271
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,489
No, nothing at all.

272
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:46,889
If so, how did he make Mr. Yagami drink the poisoned coffee?

273
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,089
Before I tell you that,

274
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:54,389
please let me explain how I came to such a conclusion.

275
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,289
Conan, bring me the stuff.

276
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,489
Okay.

277
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:02,289
This is the list of the scripts of "Detective Fluke"

278
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,589
that Conan just borrowed.

279
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,089
I was surprised at seeing this.

280
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:14,189
One among several scripts is an extremely well written mystery story.

281
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:17,289
Ingenious tricks, logical mystery solving,

282
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,289
and most of all, a story development that sticks to unbiased standards.

283
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,989
For example, "52nd Closed Door Murder" is one of them.

284
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,889
So is "Supporting Performers Club",

285
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,789
"Evil Well Murder",

286
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:31,189
and "When the Door of Fate Opens."

287
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,989
Those scripts are all...

288
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:38,189
Yes, all those scripts that I thought to be amazing

289
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:42,689
were those that you have written, Mr. Koda.

290
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,489
When I found out,

291
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:51,089
that's when I changed my mind.

292
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,189
A person such as you who writes such a perfect mystery story

293
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:58,889
would never take a sink or swim chance when the success rate is 50%.

294
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,889
And I began to question your motive.

295
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:07,489
That is, why did you leave the place back then?

296
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:12,289
You had it in mind beforehand that you would say that you forgot the milk.

297
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,889
You may have wanted to instil the impression on everyone

298
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,289
that you had nothing to do with which cup of coffee

299
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,389
Mr. Yagami and Mr. Sakuma were going to choose.

300
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:24,389
But that action of yours is suspiciously strange after all.

301
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,089
Because as Inspector Megure had mentioned earlier,

302
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:30,089
if by chance Mr. Sakuma had chosen the poisoned coffee

303
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,989
instead of Mr. Yagami who it was intended for,

304
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:36,089
he would've had to stop him from drinking it no matter what.

305
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,189
That's right. No matter how good your plan is,

306
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,589
it can always go wrong.

307
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:47,089
You, who writes flawless mysteries would not overlook that fact.

308
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,889
Nevertheless, you left the meeting room.

309
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,889
There is only one possible answer.

310
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:58,889
You did not only target Mr. Yagami.

311
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,289
Mr. Mouri.

312
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,289
Just what are you trying to get at, Mr. Mouri?

313
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,589
It didn't matter whether Mr. Yagami or Mr. Sakuma drank it.

314
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,989
That's why no trick needed to be used.

315
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:19,089
In other words, you're saying that he didn't care which of us he killed?

316
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,189
You mean it was such a flimsy murder plan?

317
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:25,289
This is no flimsy plan, Inspector.

318
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,989
No matter who dies, the result he wants is achieved.

319
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,989
So long as one of the two main scriptwriters disappears,

320
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:34,489
the chance of the third scriptwriter,

321
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:37,589
Mr. Koda getting to introduce his writings would increase tremendously.

322
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:41,089
He wanted to write as many scripts of "Detective Fluke" as he could.

323
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:44,589
This is probably the real motive for the murder that was committed.

324
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:45,989
Is it not, Mr. Koda?

325
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:50,889
Ms. Inoue.

326
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:55,389
I want to write as many scripts of this popular program as I can,

327
00:20:55,389 --> 00:21:00,489
sell my name and make a name for myself as a successful scriptwriter!

328
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,889
Mr. Koda...

329
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:10,389
At first glance, it looked to be a plan with only 50% chance of succeeding.

330
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,089
But if it didn't matter which of the two drank the poisoned coffee,

331
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,989
the rate of success would be 100%.

332
00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:18,289
I see.

333
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:27,189
I'm already 29, you see.

334
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,989
By age 30, I'll be a writer in great demand.

335
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,189
That's my goal as a scriptwriter.

336
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,589
What's this thing about being a writer in demand?

337
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,289
Even if you write only one in ten scripts,

338
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,689
those who read your scripts can all tell how talented you are.

339
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:55,589
Even Ms. Inoue evaluated your scripts highly.

340
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:58,589
I remember all your scripts, too.

341
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,489
They were all very good.

342
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,989
You're so stupid.

343
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:38,489
So "Detective Fluke" is going to end after all?

344
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:44,189
"Detective Fluke" ends, and a new series of "Detective Fluke" will begin!

345
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,989
It says that the name of the main character's going to be changed

346
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:49,989
from "Rintaro Fluke" to "Kogoro Fluke".

347
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:51,589
Kogoro Fluke.

348
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:55,189
It sounds like Kogoro's a fluke!

349
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,289
Isn't that is what you actually are?

350
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,589
"Next Episode"

351
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,289
Based on the look on your faces,

352
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:08,089
it looks like your deduction is messed up.

353
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,889
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya has made the mistake of a life time!

354
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:12,689
We should've told Conan about this to begin with!

355
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,189
What if we don't make it in time?

356
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,189
-Genta! -Genta!

357
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:23,689
Let's go around to the yard!

358
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:29,589

Next Conan's Hint:

360
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:34,616
"Soy sauce"

361
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,616
-Next week comes the bluebird. -What? A boo-bird?

362
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:39,316
-No, Inspector McGraw. -My name's Megure.
