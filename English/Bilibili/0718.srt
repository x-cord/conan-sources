1
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:06,724
Pops is invited over to the villa in Shizuoka prefecture,

2
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:09,024
where Mrs. Chika Kaido does her writing work

3
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,524
as a writer of mystery novels,

4
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:12,424
because she wanted him to tell her about

5
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,324
his experience as a famed detective. However...

6
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:22,424
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Mouri.

7
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:25,024
Those two are hooked up with each other.

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,224
Yes?

9
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:29,424
Those two?

10
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:32,924
My husband Yuichi and my disciple Kohko.

11
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:37,124
In other words, I'm an eyesore to them both.

12
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:41,524
But, I'm not letting them have their way.

13
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:46,224
I'm sly and strong like an ogre, you see.

14
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:53,724
Mrs. Chika may look strong

15
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:56,824
but she's actually a very weak person.

16
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,524
She's always depressed and in a slump

17
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:04,024
and can't sleep a wink unless she relies on sleeping pills.

18
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:10,224
Chika puts on a tough front

19
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:13,424
but she's actually a sensitive woman.

20
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:16,124
I was surprised when I saw her looking absentmindedly

21
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:19,024
at the knife in the kitchen.

22
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,424
She probably had a tough time going on living

23
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:24,424
so could've been contemplating suicide.

24
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:31,724
Okay then, Mr. Mouri. I hope you get a good night's rest.

25
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,924
-Oh. -Goodnight.

26
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:37,824
What's with those people?

27
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,324
They invite me to come over

28
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:41,024
but don't listen to what I have to say at all.

29
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:44,224
They suddenly start talking about family affairs too.

30
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:48,324
Oh, what a beautiful moon.

31
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:50,924
True.

32
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:54,224
Tonight should be a good night for working on my manuscript.

33
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:57,724
But, there's a proverb that goes, happiness is short-lived.

34
00:01:57,724 --> 00:02:01,624
This could be the last time.

35
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:05,724
I had no idea what were on the minds of the three

36
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,824
till the incident occurred.

37
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,224
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

38
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:26,324
are slashed by the light of deduction.

39
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:27,624
The whereabouts of the murder triangle

40
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,624
is not known till the following day.

41
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,124
He sees through the one and only truth.

42
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:33,324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

43
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:36,124
His name is Detective Conan!

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,840
"The Devil's Circuit"

45
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,340
Oh, Mrs. Kaido was laughing late at night?

46
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,140
Yeah. I think it was about 02:00.

47
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,240
When I got up to go to the restroom.

48
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,740
I wonder what was so funny.

49
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Something really good must've happened.

50
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,840
I guess so.

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,140
I wonder if all three of them are still asleep.

52
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,240
But, it's already after 08:00.

53
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,340
It's time at least one of them is awake already.

54
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,840
Let's go check them out.

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,440
Uh, the curtains are still closed.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,340
I wonder if nobody's really up yet.

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,240
Uncle! Look!

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,440
Mr. Kaido! Mrs. Chika!

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
Darn! I'm busting the door down!

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,840
Judging from rigor mortis, she died late last night.

61
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,040
Since there are no signs of external wounds,

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,140
she could've died of an illness.

63
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,740
Or, maybe she drank poison.

64
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,140
Either way, we'd better go let Mr. Kaido know!

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,440
Mouri here, I'm coming in!

66
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,240
No good. He's dead.

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,940
There are no signs of external injuries either.

68
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,240
Sleeping pills, eh.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,940
Don't tell me that?

70
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,340
Her too?

71
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,640
At any rate, Ran, call the police!

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,740
Okay!

73
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,440
Uh, Pops. This pitcher...

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,340
seems to have been a set with the glass cup

75
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,540
that was found beside Ms. Shimura, right?

76
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,740
Looks to be so.

77
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,540
Huh? It's wet.

78
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,640
Uh, the floor here is wet.

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,940
The water of the pitcher probably spilled or something I guess?

80
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,040
In the trash box, there's an empty can of beer

81
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,540
and two chocolate bars.

82
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,340
And, some tissue.

83
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,740
Uh. I wonder why this chocolate bar was thrown away?

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,340
It's not even opened.

85
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,940
Beats me.

86
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,840
It seems she was still working when she died.

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,140
Maybe a dying message or something is written.

88
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,740
Can't be.

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Oh! Something's come up.

90
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,540
An Ironic Circuit.

91
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,040
Bombed the wrong target.

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,140
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud."

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,340
It doesn't look like a dying message.

94
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,040
Maybe it's an idea memo for a novel.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,740
Dad! The police say they'll be here right away!

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,940
Okay.

97
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,340
Long time no see! Mr. Mouri!

98
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,540
Long time no see, Yokomizo.

99
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,240
Yes!

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,640
Oogawara, this is the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm Tomonori Oogawara.

102
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,440
I hear that you've done a lot for Inspector Yokomizo.

103
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,740
Well, not really.

104
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,340
But! We the police are working towards

105
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,940
and trying to mature into an organization

106
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,540
that doesn't have to rely on people like you

107
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,140
by improving day by day.

108
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,040
At any rate, Mr. Mouri, please take us to the victims.

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,340
Yeah. This way.

110
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,440
Inspector Yokomizo!

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,940
Why do we need a guy like him taking charge of the site?

112
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Well, don't let it bother you.

113
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,440
There's a box with 20 chocolate bars inside it on the desk.

114
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,940
Inside the box there were 17 bars left,

115
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,040
and near the box there was one empty wrapper left,

116
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,640
presumably of a chocolate bar that had been eaten.

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,440
Furthermore, from the closet of her husband,

118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Mr. Kaido's room, a syringe was found.

119
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,540
As a result of the coroner's inquest,

120
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,640
it was found that they died of poisoning.

121
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,840
The body was turned over to undergo a judicial autopsy.

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,240
Uh, Dad. Is this suicide or homicide?

123
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,540
You don't know.

124
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,040
I heard that Mrs. Kaido liked that chocolate bar

125
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,940
and used to always eat it while working.

126
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,940
And yet, I wonder why she threw those two away?

127
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,240
Moreover, it seems that Mrs. Kaido

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,340
used to take five tablets of sleeping pills every night.

129
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,940
But, it seems that her husband Yuichi

130
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,940
was against her taking sleeping pills.

131
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,440
Huh? But wasn't there an empty bottle of sleeping pills

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,540
near the corpse of her husband?

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,340
In other words, that was Chika's.

134
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,940
Hey, where'd you get that?

135
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,040
Oh.

136
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,140
I found it in the living room.

137
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,440
Let's see...

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,640
I love to take long baths,

139
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,640
and gulp down cold beer after coming out.

140
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,540
But my doctor told me I shouldn't.

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,340
There was an empty can of beer in the trash box, right?

142
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,440
It seems she bought that pitcher

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,040
because the doctor told her to stop drinking beer.

144
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,840
So that she could drink it after taking a bath.

145
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,540
The assistant that went to buy it with her

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,740
seems to have taken a liking to it.

147
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,540
Assistant, you mean Ms. Shimura?

148
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,940
This is it?

149
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,840
What? 1.2 million yen?

150
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,040
A pitcher like that?

151
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,440
So, it's the price for you, eh.

152
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
What? Mrs. Kaido passed away?

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,740
When?

154
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,840
Before that, who may I ask are you?

155
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I'm Toda of a monthly magazine called Mystery Paradise

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,940
in charge of Mrs. Kaido.

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,440
She sounded so well

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,740
when I talked to her on the phone last night and yet...

159
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,340
Sorry for questioning you here.

160
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,440
No, don't be.

161
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,640
And you seem to have called her last night?

162
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Yes, on her mobile.

163
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,640
She didn't answer the first time,

164
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,440
but on my second try at around midnight...

165
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,640
And how are you getting along so far?

166
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,440
It's going to be a fantastic masterpiece, Mr. Toda.

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,040
I'll turn over the history of Japan's mystery novels.

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,940
Either way, she was full of zeal.

169
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
If so, this is most likely not suicide.

170
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,640
I see, okay. Good work!

171
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,640
We got the result of the autopsy

172
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,740
along with the report from the forensics.

173
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,040
First of all, around 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido passed away.

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,740
The sleeping pill that he drank was laced with poison.

175
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,340
Next, at around 01:00, Ms. Kohko Shimura passes away.

176
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,940
Poison was laced on the inside of the glass

177
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,640
in which she drank tea with.

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,040
And Mrs. Chika Kaido dies at around 02:00.

179
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Poison was inserted in the chocolate bar that she ate.

180
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
By the way, about that chocolate bar,

181
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,340
there was another one laced with poison inside the box.

182
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,940
But including the two that were found in the trash box

183
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,340
and the other ones no poison was detected.

184
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,540
Which means the three were most likely killed.

185
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,840
Yes.

186
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,340
What? Why is it homicide?

187
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,440
If they wanted to commit suicide,

188
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,340
all they had to do was drink the poison directly.

189
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,940
They would never go out of their way to lace the glass cup with poison

190
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,540
or, do something as bothersome

191
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,040
as to insert poison into the chocolate.

192
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,640
In other words, that chances are high that

193
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,840
they were poisoned to death.

194
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,140
Also, all three were killed by different poisons.

195
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,040
What?

196
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Then, don't tell me that...

197
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes. It's possible that there are three murderers.

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,640
It's true that although a person was out to kill three people,

199
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,040
there would be no need to prepare three types of poison.

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,440
But, it's strange that three different culprits

201
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,540
would kill three different people on the same day.

202
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,740
Inspector. All the things that were laced with poison

203
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,440
belonged to Mrs. Chika Kaido, weren't they?

204
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,840
Yeah.

205
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,340
If so, can't we look at it this way?

206
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,440
Although there may have been three culprits,

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,940
their target was just one person.

208
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,740
Mrs. Chika Kaido.

209
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,540
What? Then, it means that her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura...

210
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,740
Poor thing, I guess that just happened to end up as victims.

211
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,040
-Uh, Pops. -Huh?

212
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
Didn't Mrs. Chika say something strange yesterday?

213
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Something about her being an eyesore to the two.

214
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,040
Just what does that mean, Mr. Mouri?

215
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Her husband and Ms. Kohko Shimura

216
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,540
were having an extramarital affair.

217
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,140
That's right, isn't it?

218
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,040
Is that right?

219
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,640
It seems that her husband wanted a divorce.

220
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,540
However, since Mrs. Chika was a very proud person,

221
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,040
she had no intention of granting him one.

222
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,540
In other words, in order for them to get together

223
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,040
they had no choice but to get Mrs. Chika Kaido out of their way.

224
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,640
Of the three culprits, two of them

225
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,240
were Yuichi Kaido and Kohko Shimura!

226
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,840
I see. That explains what they said yesterday, right?

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,040
Although Mrs. Chika seems to be strong,

228
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
she's actually a very weak person.

229
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,440
She was probably contemplating suicide.

230
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,540
It was probably what they had schemed before killing her

231
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,640
to make her death look like suicide.

232
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,140
They tried to set you up as an eyewitness, didn't they, Dad?

233
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,340
It's true that from the syringe that was found

234
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,640
in Yuichi's room,

235
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,240
poison laced on the chocolate bar was detected.

236
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,740
This does it.

237
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,540
Moreover, his prints were detected on all the chocolate bars

238
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,940
that were found in Mrs. Chika Kaido's study.

239
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,940
All the chocolate bars?

240
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,540
Including the third culprit, "X"

241
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,240
each of them schemed to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

242
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,840
But, ironically, not only Chika,

243
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,840
but also Yuichi Kaido and Kohoko Shimura ended up

244
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,440
killing each other with the poison that they used.

245
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,740
But who then is the third culprit "X"?

246
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
I hear that the editor

247
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,940
always goes through a tough time trying to deal with

248
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,640
the selfishness of the novelists that they're in charge of.

249
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,040
Isn't that right, Mr. Toda?

250
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
Mr. Mouri? I wonder about that deduction of yours.

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,140
You were full of hate for Mrs. Chika, weren't you?

252
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,940
Oh, no.

253
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,140
I think it's most appropriate to figure out

254
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,340
who would benefit most from her death

255
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
if we want to arrive at a motive.

256
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,440
If a novelist suddenly dies,

257
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
this would be very attention gathering.

258
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,140
If this happens, wouldn't the books and magazines

259
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,340
connected with the novelist sell very well?

260
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,940
I see!

261
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,540
What do you mean, I see!

262
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,640
I didn't kill her! I really didn't!

263
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,040
I wonder why Yuichi's prints were on all of the chocolate bars?

264
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,940
Not only that, but the empty can of beer

265
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,840
that the doctor had told her not to drink

266
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
that was found in the trash box.

267
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,540
And, Chika who was laughing out loud late at night

268
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,540
that Pops said he saw.

269
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,040
Darn. There are too many unexplainable things.

270
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,174
The thing that bothers me though is...

271
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:41,074
I'm sly like an ogre and strong.

272
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,374
What did she go out of her way to say something like that?

273
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:48,474
I wonder if everyone really suspects him.

274
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,874
I can't believe that he's the culprit, though.

275
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:04,374
Don't worry,

276
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:07,874
I'm sure that Pops will come up with the right solution.

277
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,874
So that's the story.

278
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:15,574
What's the matter, Conan?

279
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,674
Here, this! I'll get going before you.

280
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:19,974
Hey, Conan.

281
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:26,274
Inspector Yokomizo, were Yuichi's prints also detected

282
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:28,674
on the syringe that found?

283
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:30,274
No, they seem to have been wiped off

284
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,474
so nobody's prints were found.

285
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,074
But, isn't it strange?

286
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,074
That the prints on the chocolate bars are left behind

287
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,574
and yet the ones on the syringe are wiped off?

288
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:41,074
Well, I guess so, but...

289
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:45,574
Mr. Toda. You called Mrs. Chika twice last night, didn't you?

290
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,874
Yeah. At first I called her around 23:30.

291
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,074
But, Mrs. Chika didn't answer that call, right?

292
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:55,574
I found out from Mrs. Chika the second time I called her

293
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:59,174
that she was taking a bath from about 23:00.

294
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,874
What about it?

295
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,374
Pops is a great detective after all!

296
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:08,074
He figured out the entire mystery, he says.

297
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,274
Right, Pops!

298
00:17:09,274 --> 00:17:12,274
Huh?

299
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,474
Huh? Oh, well...

300
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:19,574
So, as I was saying the third culprit is Mr. Toda...

301
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,474
-you'd think, but not so. -What?

302
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,874
Are you turning back on what you said at this point?

303
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:29,574
Mr. Toda, I hear that

304
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,674
Mrs. Chika Kaido was depress over a slump.

305
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:36,074
Oh, yes. From some time ago.

306
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,474
It doesn't matter whether she was going through

307
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,474
a slump or not, is there!

308
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,074
If she was really killed, that is...

309
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,274
The third culprit "X"

310
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,874
is she herself.

311
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:50,974
The one who laced the chocolate bars with poison

312
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,674
was Mrs. Chika Kaido, herself.

313
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,974
That was of course to commit suicide.

314
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,974
Then, Mrs. Chika Kaido committed suicide?

315
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,974
No, she didn't commit suicide.

316
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:05,174
Huh? But, you just said so yourself, didn't you?

317
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:11,974
As Mrs. Chika Kaido would say, an ironic circuit has spun.

318
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,574
She is a very proud novelist

319
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:16,774
and she felt like annihilating herself from this world

320
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:18,574
after her continued slump.

321
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:20,974
But, she could bear thinking that

322
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,174
her husband and his lover would become happy after her death.

323
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,174
So, as her death gift to him,

324
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:28,774
she decided to frame her husband as criminal

325
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,574
who had killed his wife.

326
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:34,474
First of all, she inserted poison

327
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:37,674
into her chocolate bar to commit suicide.

328
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:43,574
Then she hid the syringe that she used inside Yuichi's room.

329
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,674
In the meantime, aside from all that was being schemed,

330
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:49,474
her husband and Ms. Kohoko Shimura

331
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:53,674
were also each scheming to kill Mrs. Chika Kaido.

332
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,874
Mrs. Chika Kaido had been taking a bath from around 23:00.

333
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,974
During this time, Ms. Kohko Shimura

334
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,974
switched Chika's sleeping pills with ones

335
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,174
that were laced with poison.

336
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:08,874
And at about 23:30, Mr. Yuichi Kaido

337
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,774
laced poison onto the glass cup set to the pitcher

338
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,674
from which Chika drinks water out of after taking a bath.

339
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,574
And then, at that time,

340
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,974
as if to calm himself down,

341
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:23,474
he takes Chika's sleeping pills with him,

342
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:27,674
drinks it, and the first one, Mr. Yuichi Kaido dies.

343
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:31,374
Then at around midnight, when getting out of her bath,

344
00:19:31,374 --> 00:19:35,174
Mrs. Chika got a call from Mr. Toda.

345
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,474
She then, probably inadvertently

346
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,774
dropped the pitcher to the floor.

347
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:43,874
I'll turn the history of Japanese mystery upside down.

348
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,374
But, I guess she couldn't bring herself to drink the water

349
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,874
that spilled out of the pitcher she dropped.

350
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:54,874
She went to the kitchen and changed her mind.

351
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:57,874
She figured that she was going to die soon anyway

352
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,874
so she brought the beer that the doctor told her not to drink

353
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,174
back to her study and drank it.

354
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:05,774
Then, just before 01:00,

355
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,974
Ms. Kohoko Shimura who probably couldn't get to sleep

356
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:12,574
comes over to the kitchen uses the glass to drink tea.

357
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:18,074
The second person, Ms. Kohoko Shimura dies.

358
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,974
And then, at 02:00.

359
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,274
Chika who returns to the kitchen again

360
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:23,974
discovers the body of Kohoko

361
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:27,674
and the glass cup on the floor.

362
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:31,674
She concluded that her husband had thought of poisoning her.

363
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:38,674
She then figured everything out.

364
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:42,174
That the two had mistakenly killed each other

365
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,474
in an attempt to kill her.

366
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:48,474
She had lost all though of committing suicide anymore,

367
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:49,974
so she threw the chocolate bar that she had laced poison with

368
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,674
into the trash box.

369
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,174
I've got to live!

370
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:56,474
I'll live and write a novel...

371
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,874
about the pathetic twosome!

372
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,374
"An Ironic Circuit"

373
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:03,574
"Bombed the wrong target"

374
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,274
"The lone winner who survives gets to laugh out loud"

375
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:18,274
And, the third person, Mrs. Chika Kaido dies.

376
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:23,474
Hey, wait a second, Mr. Mouri.

377
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:25,774
To think that she would mistakenly eat the chocolate bar

378
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:28,374
that she had planned to commit suicide with,

379
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:30,974
is a little outrageous, don't you think?

380
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:34,574
Another ironical circuit had spun.

381
00:21:34,574 --> 00:21:35,874
Huh?

382
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:40,274
The first call that you made to her at 23:30, Mr. Toda.

383
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:41,674
It's most likely

384
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:45,974
Yuichi was lacing poison just around that time.

385
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,974
Surprised at hearing the phone ring,

386
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,674
he dropped the chocolate bar.

387
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:52,374
It was then that the position

388
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:55,374
of the poison laced chocolate bar changed places.

389
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:59,174
There's no other explainable situation,

390
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:03,274
for all the chocolate bars having his prints on them, is there?

391
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,674
How about it, Oogawara?

392
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,074
Now you know,

393
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,374
why I want Mr. Mouri to help me out, don't you?

394
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:35,474
Yes, sir!

395
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:39,574
I've seen with my very eyes the greatness of a renown detective.

396
00:23:39,574 --> 00:23:40,574
So he says.

397
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:44,074
As long as you understand, it's okay with me.

398
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:49,174
Hey, Dad, come off with that remark.

399
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,474
I goofed a bit.

400
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:53,574
I can't laugh about Pops.

401
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:02,174
Inspector, the laundry is left in the washing machine

402
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,674
after being spun dried.

403
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:06,274
How come you remember so accurately

404
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,474
the time the washing machine running?

405
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:11,174
It was making a loud rattling noise,

406
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:14,174
but stopped once after about five minutes,

407
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,974
so I guess the person heard the noise or something.

408
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,574
It stopped once?

409
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:24,474
Next Conan, "Platinum Ticket Commotion"

410
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:42,374
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,774
"Washing Machine"

412
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,274
We're giving away gifts by phone starting today.

413
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:48,274
It's a mini drama of Conan and "that" person.

414
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,474
Dad!
