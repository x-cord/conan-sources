1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.040
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.040
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.440
Is it a prank played by the god of matchmaking?

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.040
Conan challenges the mystery of a murder.

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.840
That is analogous to the story of the "Eight-Forked Serpent".

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.140
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:48.545
So...

10
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.145
I'm going to check out the famous sightseeing spots

11
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.945
and drink up the "all-you-can-drink"!

12
00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.245
He's 180 degrees unlike what he was in the plane.

13
00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.245
The place we came to visit this time

14
00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.645
is the home of mythology, Izumo.

15
00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:14.745
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 1)"

16
00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:19.045
Izumo Shrine is where the God for matchmaking is enshrined.

17
00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:22.045
I can understand Ran praying with passion, but...

18
00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:25.445
Please, please do find me a good match.

19
00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.145
Gosh. I wonder what kind of match he is expecting.

20
00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:30.945
I'll tie mine here.

21
00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:36.345
For a good match, a good match!

22
00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:37.945
Gosh.

23
00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.845
So this is Japan's greatest "Ooshimenawa".

24
00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:43.245
It sure is huge!

25
00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.545
Well, this is fantastic.

26
00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.445
It weighs five tons.

27
00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:51.045
Five tons?

28
00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.745
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

29
00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:54.845
The famed detective.

30
00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:56.745
Yes.

31
00:02:56.745 --> 00:03:00.745
You look way better in person than on television.

32
00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:05.745
Do you work here?

33
00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:08.045
"Eiko Esumi (25)" -I'm Eiko Esumi.

34
00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:10.945
I run a Japanese inn in front of the path to this shrine.

35
00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.745
A Japanese inn?

36
00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:16.345
I'm his daughter, Ran. And he's Conan.

37
00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:17.845
Hello.

38
00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:21.845
Excuse me, what's that money there?

39
00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:22.945
Really!

40
00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:25.045
There's so much money stuck to it.

41
00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:27.245
I guess you can call it a tradition?

42
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.545
If the coin gets stuck on it, they say your wish is granted.

43
00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:33.145
Which means, I'll meet the person of my dreams?

44
00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:37.045
There! Go for it!

45
00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:42.145
Darn it.

46
00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:43.345
There!

47
00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:44.845
Darn you!

48
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.245
Darn it!

49
00:03:50.245 --> 00:03:53.045
Your wish will probably never be granted.

50
00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:57.745
How lucky to have a hometown in a place where the God of matchmaking is.

51
00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:02.145
I have a tentative offer for marriage, too.

52
00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:03.545
Tentative?

53
00:04:03.545 --> 00:04:04.545
What?

54
00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.545
Is it with someone you don't really care for?

55
00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:11.945
I get it! That man is poor.

56
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.045
I think he has money.

57
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.345
Because he's involved in large-scale business.

58
00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.345
Maybe he has a bad personality.

59
00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:23.345
A rich man with bad personality is the worst match in any category.

60
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:25.945
You should call off the marriage.

61
00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:28.445
Dad!

62
00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:31.345
But I have a reason for not being able to refuse.

63
00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:32.745
When you get married,

64
00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:35.445
it should be with someone that you really love, right?

65
00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:38.245
What is the name of that man?

66
00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.445
Mr. Koji Wanibuchi.

67
00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:43.545
No matter what reasons you may have,

68
00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:46.345
reluctantly getting married with Mr. Wanibuchi

69
00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:48.345
is like giving yourself up as human sacrifice.

70
00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:49.945
Dad!

71
00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:51.745
I'm sorry for what he said.

72
00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:56.445
Don't be. Because Mr. Mouri is saying this for me.

73
00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:58.845
Right, Conan?

74
00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:01.545
Shall we go see an interesting miniature model?

75
00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:03.645
An interesting miniature model?

76
00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:06.845
Did Izumo Shrine look like this before?

77
00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:08.645
This is indeed...

78
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.545
The world of mythology!

79
00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:13.745
This seems to be the biggest shrine in all of Japan.

80
00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:15.945
I'm not sure of the details.

81
00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:17.445
It is a shrine that was built towards the end of the Heian Period

82
00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:19.445
to the first part of the Kamakura Period.

83
00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.645
Ryo!

84
00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:23.745
Sorry, can you wait a while?

85
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:25.745
Yep.

86
00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:28.645
He's Ryosuke Fukama, a childhood friend of mine.

87
00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:31.345
He used to like ancient history since he was a child.

88
00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:34.845
"Ryosuke Fukama (25)" -He's lucky because he's working doing what he likes.

89
00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:39.745
Eiko actually likes Mr. Fukuma.

90
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:42.345
Yep. I'm sure he likes her, too.

91
00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:47.945
How exasperating.

92
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:49.045
All three pillars were created

93
00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:51.345
by bunching three huge trees together as one...

94
00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.945
Eiko is going to be taken away by a rich guy with bad personality

95
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:59.245
because you don't keep a firm grip on her!

96
00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:00.445
Yes?

97
00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:01.645
Mr. Mouri.

98
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:03.245
Dad!

99
00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:05.645
I'm really sorry.

100
00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:07.945
No, it's okay.

101
00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:10.645
Mr. Mouri. Thank you for today.

102
00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:13.745
Not at all. Get a grip of yourself, okay?

103
00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:15.745
You seem to be saying good stuff,

104
00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:18.145
but who knows what's actually on your mind.

105
00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:21.145
The following day, murder is committed.

106
00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:36.745
A current price of 10,000,000 yen?

107
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:38.645
That does it.

108
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:42.245
Stabbed right in the back.

109
00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:45.545
Don't let outsiders in here!

110
00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:47.445
Don't tell me that you're...

111
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:51.445
I'm Mouri, a private detective from Tokyo.

112
00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:52.745
Just as I thought!

113
00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.445
I've heard of your activities.

114
00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:56.245
I'm Officer Yamane of the Izumo Police Department.

115
00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:57.745
Likewise, I'm Officer Komura.

116
00:06:57.745 --> 00:07:00.145
It's amazing how you got here.

117
00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:02.645
I just happened to be nearby.

118
00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.445
However, there seems to be no need for the assistance

119
00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:08.445
of a famed detective for this case.

120
00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:10.345
How's that?

121
00:07:10.345 --> 00:07:15.045
The victim is Mr. Koji Wanibuchi, the owner of Wanibuchi Sogyo,

122
00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:19.445
that is doing extensive business centering around the Izumo area, age 35.

123
00:07:19.445 --> 00:07:22.245
Koji Wanibuchi?

124
00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:25.145
The fiance that Eiko was talking about yesterday?

125
00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:27.545
He was killed.

126
00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:29.345
So you know him.

127
00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.645
He is a famous businessman that is well-known locally,

128
00:07:31.645 --> 00:07:33.245
as being a wheeler-dealer.

129
00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:35.745
The person who found him is that couple over there.

130
00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:38.145
They're locals.

131
00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:42.045
Well, this is not a place that tourists would come.

132
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:45.045
The estimated time of death is around 13:00.

133
00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:48.745
Mr. Wanibuchi's watch is thought to have broken when he fell.

134
00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:51.145
It is stopped at 13:05.

135
00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:54.745
It's probably okay to determine that it was time the murder was committed.

136
00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:57.445
The motive of the killing was probably due to grudge.

137
00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:59.245
Being a wheeler-dealer businessman,

138
00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.145
he must've had a lot of enemies, too.

139
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:04.345
He seems to have had a bad personality, too.

140
00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:07.545
It's true that he didn't have a good reputation,

141
00:08:07.545 --> 00:08:09.045
but the purpose of the killer

142
00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:12.445
was to steal his sword that is worth 10,000,000 yen.

143
00:08:12.445 --> 00:08:15.045
A sword priced at 10,000,000 yen?

144
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.245
This is Mr. Wanibuchi's notebook.

145
00:08:19.445 --> 00:08:22.645
He was scheduled to go to a local antique shop today

146
00:08:22.645 --> 00:08:26.545
and get the sword as collateral for lending money this afternoon.

147
00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:29.645
I confirmed with the shop and found that at around 12:00 noon,

148
00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:31.545
they gave the sword to Mr. Wanibuchi as promised.

149
00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:37.145
After receiving the sword, Mr. Wanibuchi came here to Inome.

150
00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:40.445
And we're not sure for what, but at around before 13:00,

151
00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:44.045
he was witnessed standing holding the sword.

152
00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:46.345
However, when his body was found,

153
00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:48.545
the sword was nowhere in sight.

154
00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:52.645
The killer who saw him receive the sword at the antique shop

155
00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:54.645
may have tailed Mr. Wanibuchi and...

156
00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:07.345
So you see, this is a simple case of robbing treasure.

157
00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:10.345
So there is no need for a detective.

158
00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:12.245
Yes, now I clearly understand.

159
00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:18.445
I wonder if this case is really all that simple?

160
00:09:18.445 --> 00:09:20.745
Why come out all the way to a place like this?

161
00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:23.845
Moreover, bringing a sword worth 10,000,000 yen along?

162
00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:26.745
What are you thinking about?

163
00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:28.545
I'm not thinking anything!

164
00:09:29.645 --> 00:09:32.945
I hate to say this about the late Mr. Wanibuchi,

165
00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:36.945
but Eiko won't have to get married reluctantly anymore.

166
00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:41.045
-Ran! -I know that I shouldn't be saying this.

167
00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:43.645
But you were saying so yourself yesterday, too.

168
00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:46.045
That it's like human sacrifice.

169
00:09:46.045 --> 00:09:48.245
Well, you see, that was...

170
00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:50.745
Wait. This case sounds similar

171
00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:53.045
to the story of getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent, doesn't it?

172
00:09:53.045 --> 00:09:55.345
Getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent?

173
00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:58.045
The mythology of Susano-o-no-mikoto.

174
00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:00.745
There was an unfortunate princess

175
00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:03.145
that was about to be taken away against her will,

176
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.845
when Susano-o appears to save her.

177
00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:08.145
Thanks to Susano-o for getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent,

178
00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:10.545
the princess is rescued.

179
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:12.345
And Susano-o gets a hold of the Eight-forked serpent's sword.

180
00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:15.045
It sure is similar.

181
00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:17.345
Right?

182
00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:20.145
Susano-o-no-mikoto may be a hero,

183
00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:22.345
but the killer is nothing close to it!

184
00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:26.545
It just so happened to help Eiko out,

185
00:10:26.545 --> 00:10:29.145
but the guy is a robber!

186
00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:31.645
I know that.

187
00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:33.245
All I'm saying is that it seems similar to the mythology

188
00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:35.745
about getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent.

189
00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:37.145
Right, Conan?

190
00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:39.645
Yeah.

191
00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:43.645
This case was not just a simple robbery after all.

192
00:10:49.845 --> 00:10:55.545
Once a year, when the Gods from all over Japan gather at Izumo,

193
00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:58.745
it is said that they land here on Inasanohama.

194
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:01.345
What? They're not listening.

195
00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:03.845
I'm explaining this to you.

196
00:11:03.845 --> 00:11:05.345
I wonder if something happened?

197
00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:15.345
Don't tell me that this is...

198
00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:18.345
I confirmed it with the antique shop owner

199
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.145
and was told that it was indeed the sword in question.

200
00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:22.545
Just as I thought.

201
00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.645
I don't understand.

202
00:11:23.645 --> 00:11:24.745
Why would you hide the treasure

203
00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:27.945
so that it get covered with sand like this?

204
00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:30.045
It was probably thrown away, not hidden,

205
00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:32.545
because whoever it was didn't need it anymore.

206
00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:37.045
Taking the sword away from the site of the murder was a camouflage

207
00:11:37.045 --> 00:11:40.045
to deceive people into thinking it was a robbery.

208
00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:41.745
It's most likely

209
00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:46.245
that the real motive of the culprit was to take Mr. Wanibuchi's life.

210
00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:50.045
The real motive is most probably a grudge.

211
00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:51.845
Get a list on the double of his business rivals

212
00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:56.045
as well as all the people in Mr. Wanibuchi's private life

213
00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:57.845
that he was having problems with.

214
00:11:57.845 --> 00:11:59.945
Yes, sir!

215
00:11:59.945 --> 00:12:00.945
What is it?

216
00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:02.745
Oh, no.

217
00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:07.845
After the list was made,

218
00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.745
the following day, four people were called in by the police.

219
00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:16.645
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma were also among the people who were summoned.

220
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:24.608
I will be questioning everyone by turn.

221
00:12:24.608 --> 00:12:25.608
But before that,

222
00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:29.808
I would like to introduce someone who will be helping us with this case.

223
00:12:29.808 --> 00:12:32.308
Detective Kogoro Mouri.

224
00:12:32.308 --> 00:12:33.608
I'm Mouri.

225
00:12:34.908 --> 00:12:37.008
That famed detective?

226
00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:41.408
"Takehiko Fujie (40)" -Well, I didn't think that a famed detective

227
00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:43.908
would be in Izumo.

228
00:12:45.208 --> 00:12:48.008
First of all, Mr. Kazuya Ishitobi.

229
00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:49.208
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:50.508
According to our investigation,

231
00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:55.108
"Kazuya Ishitobi (35)" -Mr. Wanibuchi approached your shop of long standing

232
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.808
asking if you'd like to joint-manage the shop with him, is that right?

233
00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:00.808
Joint management, my foot!

234
00:13:01.608 --> 00:13:05.908
Wanibuchi Sogyo will take care of all the management finances.

235
00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:07.808
All you have to do is lend me the name Ishitobi,

236
00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.108
and we'll open stores throughout Japan.

237
00:13:10.108 --> 00:13:12.908
Fantastic, don't you think?

238
00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:16.308
You're not thinking of refusing, are you?

239
00:13:17.908 --> 00:13:20.008
He tried to take over "Ishitobi"

240
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:23.108
that had been in business for 2,000 years by threat and money!

241
00:13:23.108 --> 00:13:24.708
I see.

242
00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.308
Next, Mr. Takehiko Fujie.

243
00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:31.008
You run a wedding hall called Ryounkaku and...

244
00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:34.408
The same went for my place as Mr. Ishitobi just mentioned.

245
00:13:34.408 --> 00:13:37.508
We at Wanibuchi Sogyo are thinking of going into

246
00:13:37.508 --> 00:13:39.408
the wedding hall management business.

247
00:13:39.408 --> 00:13:40.408
What?

248
00:13:40.408 --> 00:13:42.508
But I do not want to fight for customers

249
00:13:42.508 --> 00:13:45.208
with Ryounkaku that is a place of long standing.

250
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.008
So I would like to make a proposal.

251
00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:49.508
We would like to invest our capital in your company

252
00:13:49.508 --> 00:13:52.408
and would like to carry out joint-management with you.

253
00:13:52.408 --> 00:13:53.608
What do you think?

254
00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:58.908
Mr. Fujie, my superior?

255
00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:02.008
He wanted to take over.

256
00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.908
Superior?

257
00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:06.708
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

258
00:14:06.708 --> 00:14:09.108
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

259
00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:11.408
I see. At the university.

260
00:14:11.408 --> 00:14:14.808
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

261
00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:17.908
A monster that swallows up anything he targets as prey.

262
00:14:17.908 --> 00:14:20.508
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

263
00:14:22.408 --> 00:14:23.708
I see.

264
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:28.508
Ms. Eiko Esumi, you also had business connections with Mr. Wanibuchi?

265
00:14:28.508 --> 00:14:29.608
Yes, sir.

266
00:14:29.608 --> 00:14:32.608
Our inn, Hinodeya, is also an inn of long standing,

267
00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:35.608
but wear and tear kept getting worse.

268
00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:38.008
But we couldn't afford to renovate it.

269
00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:40.308
At about that time, we were contacted by a company in Tokyo

270
00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:42.508
saying that they'd like to build a modern hotel in its place,

271
00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:45.308
so they would like us to sell them our land.

272
00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:47.508
Just when my parents were thinking,

273
00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:49.408
there was no other choice than to let go of the inn.

274
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.008
It's absurd that an inn with such long standing

275
00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:53.408
as Hinodeya go out of business.

276
00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:56.908
Let us help you with the renovation fees.

277
00:14:56.908 --> 00:14:59.108
For the sake of Izumo.

278
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:00.608
It was unexpected.

279
00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:04.108
Because from what I heard of him, he was a greedy man and nothing else.

280
00:15:04.108 --> 00:15:06.708
My parents accepted his offer thankfully

281
00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:09.908
and renovated the inn, but...

282
00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:12.308
Let my daughter marry you?

283
00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:14.308
What's come over you all of a sudden?

284
00:15:14.308 --> 00:15:16.508
It's not all of a sudden.

285
00:15:16.508 --> 00:15:18.708
I lent you the money for renovation

286
00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:21.008
because this is the birth home of my future wife.

287
00:15:21.008 --> 00:15:23.108
For what other reason would anybody do this?

288
00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:26.308
He was planning on it to begin with.

289
00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:28.808
He said to give the total of the money he lent back right away,

290
00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:30.708
if I refuse to marry him.

291
00:15:30.708 --> 00:15:32.508
Oh, no.

292
00:15:32.508 --> 00:15:35.508
My parents told me that if they have to give me up to a guy like that,

293
00:15:35.508 --> 00:15:38.108
they'd rather let go of the inn.

294
00:15:38.108 --> 00:15:39.908
But I know how much that inn

295
00:15:39.908 --> 00:15:44.808
that has been handed down for generations mean to them.

296
00:15:44.808 --> 00:15:46.208
That's why I...

297
00:15:46.208 --> 00:15:47.708
Mr. Fukuma.

298
00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.008
Not being able to leave Ms. Esumi in her plight,

299
00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:53.308
you went time and again to ask Mr. Wanibuchi

300
00:15:53.308 --> 00:15:55.208
to let her go, didn't you?

301
00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:56.608
I hated him.

302
00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:57.808
I hated that man, too.

303
00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:10.208
Next, at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

304
00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:13.808
please tell me where and what each of you were doing

305
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.508
at around 13:00 yesterday.

306
00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:17.008
First of all...

307
00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:19.508
I was at Matsue Castle!

308
00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:21.408
Matsue Castle?

309
00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:25.108
I was alone so I have no one to prove it.

310
00:16:25.108 --> 00:16:28.808
That's right. I signed my name on the list of the castle tower.

311
00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:32.908
Mr. Fukuma.

312
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:35.908
It was my day off yesterday,

313
00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:37.808
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

314
00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:42.508
I was there from a little before noon to about 3:00.

315
00:16:42.508 --> 00:16:45.108
I go there often, because I can relax there.

316
00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:49.208
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses to prove it.

317
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.208
Then Mr. Ishitobi.

318
00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:55.508
I was at the Izumo Traditional Culture Museum.

319
00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:58.708
I was alone, too.

320
00:16:58.708 --> 00:17:01.308
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

321
00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:03.608
I was at Hinomisaki.

322
00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:07.908
I was alone, too.

323
00:17:07.908 --> 00:17:10.908
It was a little too early for seagulls

324
00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:13.508
that I didn't get to see them.

325
00:17:13.508 --> 00:17:15.408
Komura, split up and check on the alibis.

326
00:17:15.408 --> 00:17:16.408
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:21.808
They're all famous sightseeing spots,

328
00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.108
so many people must've seen them.

329
00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:27.308
That is, if they're telling the truth.

330
00:17:27.308 --> 00:17:29.008
Exactly.

331
00:17:32.608 --> 00:17:33.908
How was it?

332
00:17:33.908 --> 00:17:35.008
Yes, sir.

333
00:17:35.008 --> 00:17:37.608
Mr. Fujie's alibi's been confirmed.

334
00:17:37.608 --> 00:17:39.408
It was written in his handwriting

335
00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:41.308
and judging from the names written by the people there,

336
00:17:41.308 --> 00:17:45.008
it is thought that he was certainly in Matsue at 13:05.

337
00:17:45.008 --> 00:17:46.708
13:05.

338
00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:49.608
He wrote his name on the list at the very time

339
00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:52.608
the victim was killed.

340
00:17:52.608 --> 00:17:55.008
The time it takes to get from Matsue Castle

341
00:17:55.008 --> 00:17:57.208
to Inome, the scene of the crime

342
00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:59.308
is about 40 minutes to an hour by car.

343
00:17:59.308 --> 00:18:00.708
I see.

344
00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:03.308
So I'm not a suspect anymore.

345
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.208
The problem is the remaining three of you.

346
00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:10.508
We cannot get any eyewitnesses at all.

347
00:18:10.508 --> 00:18:11.908
Not even one?

348
00:18:11.908 --> 00:18:14.408
Not even one, for all three of them.

349
00:18:14.408 --> 00:18:19.608
But we can't keep you here just because we can't confirm your alibis.

350
00:18:19.608 --> 00:18:23.108
You may have to come in for questioning again,

351
00:18:23.108 --> 00:18:25.408
but you may go for today.

352
00:18:25.408 --> 00:18:26.908
Thank you for your cooperation.

353
00:18:30.308 --> 00:18:34.108
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

354
00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:35.508
No.

355
00:18:35.508 --> 00:18:38.708
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

356
00:18:38.708 --> 00:18:40.608
Could it be that they're lying?

357
00:18:45.008 --> 00:18:46.608
Yes, this is Yamane.

358
00:18:46.608 --> 00:18:49.308
Yes. Yes.

359
00:18:49.308 --> 00:18:50.908
What?

360
00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:53.308
I see. Okay!

361
00:18:53.308 --> 00:18:54.608
Call him back!

362
00:18:54.608 --> 00:18:56.208
Ryosuke Fukuma!

363
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:58.008
Yes, sir!

364
00:18:58.008 --> 00:19:00.208
Yesterday at around 14:00,

365
00:19:00.208 --> 00:19:02.708
we found a witness that said he saw someone

366
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.108
burying something at Inasanohama.

367
00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:07.808
The man who was witnessed was a tall, lanky man.

368
00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:14.408
Sand from Inasanohama

369
00:19:14.408 --> 00:19:17.208
and soil from Inome Cave were detected from your shoes.

370
00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:18.708
You did it, didn't you?

371
00:19:18.708 --> 00:19:21.108
You killed Mr. Wanibuchi, didn't you?

372
00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:24.008
I stand mute.

373
00:19:25.808 --> 00:19:27.308
He's exercising his right to remain silent?

374
00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:30.008
Yes. But if he's the one who did it,

375
00:19:30.008 --> 00:19:34.008
that explains why there were no witnesses at Old Taisha Station.

376
00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:36.608
Because he had killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome

377
00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:40.308
and got rid of the sword at Inasanohama.

378
00:19:40.308 --> 00:19:43.408
I guess he's the one, Ryosuke Fukuma.

379
00:19:43.408 --> 00:19:44.808
Oh, no!

380
00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:48.008
Since the sand and soil were found on his shoes,

381
00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.108
as well as a witness having seen him,

382
00:19:50.108 --> 00:19:52.108
he probably did take the sword away from the site,

383
00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:55.008
and buried it at the beach.

384
00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:59.808
But it's not enough to conclude that he's the one who killed the victim.

385
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:03.608
I was at Hinomisaki.

386
00:20:03.608 --> 00:20:05.608
That reaction.

387
00:20:05.608 --> 00:20:10.308
Mr. Fukuma knew where Eiko really was at that time.

388
00:20:10.308 --> 00:20:11.908
Which means...

389
00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:15.608
Hey, where do you think you're going?

390
00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:22.008
You brat.

391
00:20:22.008 --> 00:20:24.308
Why did you go into the interrogation room on your own?

392
00:20:24.308 --> 00:20:26.008
No, Conan!

393
00:20:26.008 --> 00:20:28.008
Because I think

394
00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:30.008
that Mr. Fukuma isn't saying anything

395
00:20:30.008 --> 00:20:33.208
because he's protecting the real killer.

396
00:20:35.008 --> 00:20:37.108
Just as I thought.

397
00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:38.708
I'm right.

398
00:20:38.708 --> 00:20:44.208
He probably saw the real killer killed Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome Cave.

399
00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:48.108
But I wonder who that real killer is?

400
00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:51.308
Who else would he have to protect other than that one person?

401
00:20:51.308 --> 00:20:55.308
You witnessed Ms. Eiko Esumi commit the murder.

402
00:20:55.308 --> 00:20:59.108
That's why you took the sword away to make it look like a robbery.

403
00:20:59.108 --> 00:21:00.908
Is that it?

404
00:21:00.908 --> 00:21:04.008
I did it! I'm the one who killed Wanibuchi!

405
00:21:04.008 --> 00:21:07.308
It's too late saying it now.

406
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.608
Me?

407
00:21:08.608 --> 00:21:10.108
It's not me!

408
00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:13.308
Then at the time Mr. Wanibuchi was murdered,

409
00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:16.108
where were you really at?

410
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:20.408
You said you were at Hinomisaki, but nobody saw you there.

411
00:21:20.408 --> 00:21:23.808
The lighthouse worker nor the souvenir shop employee, nobody!

412
00:21:23.808 --> 00:21:25.208
Well...

413
00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:27.808
She's doing the same thing as Mr. Fukuma.

414
00:21:27.808 --> 00:21:30.208
She sounds like she's protecting somebody.

415
00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:33.308
It was my day off yesterday,

416
00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:35.608
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

417
00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:37.008
It could be that...

418
00:21:38.608 --> 00:21:41.508
I'll bet you're protecting Mr. Fukuma

419
00:21:41.508 --> 00:21:43.208
because you know that he's the killer?

420
00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.708
I was right after all.

421
00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:53.308
Hey!

422
00:21:53.308 --> 00:21:55.308
Ran, come with me!

423
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:59.108
Conan, what are you doing?

424
00:21:59.108 --> 00:22:01.308
What is going on, Mr. Mouri?

425
00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:05.308
The lovers are protecting each other.

426
00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:09.108
Which of you is the killer?

427
00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:11.908
Neither of them may be the killer?

428
00:22:11.908 --> 00:22:13.508
We're going to prove that!

429
00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:15.708
And where to?

430
00:22:17.608 --> 00:22:19.608
To Old Taisha Station.

431
00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:49.008
"Next Episode"

432
00:23:49.008 --> 00:23:51.708
All the suspects are innocent now.

433
00:23:51.708 --> 00:23:52.908
So it seems.

434
00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:55.908
What is going on?

435
00:23:55.908 --> 00:23:59.308
Logging in the time suddenly started from yesterday?

436
00:23:59.308 --> 00:24:01.208
I don't think that's right.

437
00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:03.408
Misunderstanding based on subjective impression?

438
00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:06.108
I'm Kogoro Mouri, I'd like to see you.

439
00:24:06.108 --> 00:24:09.408
As to what it's about, I'd like to tell you in person when I see you.

440
00:24:11.008 --> 00:24:16.408
Next Conan, "The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 2)"

441
00:24:17.276 --> 00:24:19.476
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:21.476
"False testimony"

443
00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:23.876
-Did you pray to get together with Shinichi? -No.

444
00:24:23.876 --> 00:24:25.176
Then who did you pray to get together with?

445
00:24:25.176 --> 00:24:26.276
Tell me!
