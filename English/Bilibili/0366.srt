1
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.940
The stage for today's episode is fishing.

2
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.740
A breakwater out at sea in clear view

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.540
but a murder is committed without anyone noticing.

4
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.825
Here. Watch your step, all of you.

8
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:12.025
The wind feels so good!

9
00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:13.525
Listen, all of you!

10
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:16.625
We're going fishing out by the breakwater!

11
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.925
Be careful not to get too carried away

12
00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:20.425
and fall into the ocean, all right?

13
00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:21.725
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

14
00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:27.825
How unusual to go out fishing to the sea.

15
00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:30.025
Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.425
What's the problem?

17
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:32.525
Every time we decide to go somewhere,

18
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.725
it's always camping at the mountains,

19
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:36.625
so I'm sure that Dr. Agasa wanted us to experience something new!

20
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.525
Well... Sort of...

21
00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.025
I'm not complaining or anything.

22
00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.625
I already have a hunch that

23
00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:46.725
since I've been avoiding going out to distant places with you guys,

24
00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:48.425
you figured instead of taking me to the confinement of the mountains,

25
00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.525
it would be better to take me out to see where the view is nice and clear.

26
00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:53.625
Thanks to somebody's great idea, right?

27
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:54.725
Darn you.

28
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:57.725
-She hit the bull's eye. -She hit the bull's eye.

29
00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:00.825
I guess it's not a bad idea for a change of scene

30
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.525
to come and feel the sea breeze of this vast ocean,

31
00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:05.125
the mother of all creation.

32
00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:09.425
But I think he should've just minded his own business.

33
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.725
What a snob!

34
00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:13.325
Well... Regardless of her remarks,

35
00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.625
I can tell that Ai is pretty happy about this.

36
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.125
You think so?

37
00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.225
And, like she says, the ocean is the source of life.

38
00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:24.525
The source of life?

39
00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:27.425
Besides, it's a great place to relax.

40
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:31.425
Come to think of it, today is...

41
00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:34.725
Oh, my... Are you all going to fish at the breakwater too?

42
00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:36.225
Yes! We are.

43
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:38.325
Only until after noon, though!

44
00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:40.025
Then, would you like to have a bet with me

45
00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:42.825
and see how many fish we can catch by then?

46
00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.125
A bet to see...

47
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:45.625
How many fish we can catch?

48
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.725
Let's bet one side dish from our lunch box!

49
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.825
"Kiriko Shirane (38)" -Lunch box? One side dish?

50
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:53.125
I'll bet my crab cream croquette.

51
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:54.925
It is very delicious!

52
00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.625
Right, Kanetani?

53
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:57.725
Yeah.

54
00:03:57.725 --> 00:04:00.025
"Mineto Kanetani (39)" -It's always great.

55
00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:02.125
Just as expected of a fisherman's daughter.

56
00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:05.525
You're tops when it comes to making dishes using seafood.

57
00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:09.925
We're all lucky we get to eat the food that this beauty makes, you know?

58
00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.925
Oh, cut it out, Kanetani.

59
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:14.725
But, we're only beginners.

60
00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:17.325
You should have Ida give you advice then.

61
00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:18.725
Ida?

62
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:22.625
He's the one who's navigating this ship right now.

63
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:24.025
A fisherman actively in business!

64
00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:26.325
He's a super veteran that knows everything about fishing!

65
00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:29.725
No way, no can do.

66
00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:31.125
"Futoshi Ejiri (41)" -No matter how much advice you get,

67
00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:32.425
you won't be able to fish anything.

68
00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:34.825
Because you're "bozu" (no catch) to begin with

69
00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.925
be it your brains or your age, you get it?

70
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:41.325
"Bozu" (No catch)?

71
00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:45.025
I wonder if brains or age has anything to do with fishing?

72
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:49.025
He's just joking and saying that you won't catch any fish.

73
00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:51.025
It's a pun, a play on words.

74
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:55.125
No need to trouble yourself over it, it's just an old man's joke.

75
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.925
That guy... Okay!

76
00:04:57.925 --> 00:04:59.825
Let's ask the fisherman all kinds of questions

77
00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:03.225
and fish up a lot of yellow tails and tunas!

78
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:06.625
You can't fish something that big.

79
00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:14.425
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 1)"

80
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.125
Okay, I'll see you guys then.

81
00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:19.725
I'll be back in three hours. Good luck.

82
00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.725
"Iwao Ida (39)" -If something comes up call me right away, okay?

83
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.725
I'll come for you in 20 minutes!

84
00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:35.725
What's the matter? Why are you doing that?

85
00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:37.125
Because...

86
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.525
-Right? -Yes!

87
00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:42.125
We went to ask him about fishing...

88
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:45.225
But he treated us too much like little kids

89
00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:46.925
that we really got angry!

90
00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:49.225
And, what did he say?

91
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:53.925
He said don't make loud noises with your friends.

92
00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:57.125
That's right.

93
00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.125
It's exactly as the fisherman says.

94
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.025
Why is he right?

95
00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.425
If loud noises are made,

96
00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.725
the sound of footsteps and such

97
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:07.625
will travel along the breakwater into the water,

98
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:10.825
surprising the fish and make them flee.

99
00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:12.825
So, that fisherman was probably trying to tell you

100
00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:14.825
that if you make too much noise your footsteps,

101
00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:17.825
it will keep the fish away.

102
00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:21.125
But he didn't have to say it that tone of voice!

103
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.525
Exactly! That's right!

104
00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:25.525
Did he say anything else?

105
00:06:25.525 --> 00:06:26.725
Well...

106
00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.125
It's dangerous doing something like that.

107
00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:36.425
What if the children copy him?

108
00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.125
It will be bad.

109
00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:40.025
The place over there, where the tetra pods are,

110
00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.025
is Ejiri's usual fishing spot!

111
00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:47.525
That man is not contented unless he gets to fish there.

112
00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:49.025
But it's strange that

113
00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:51.125
the tetra pod looks to be above the surface of the water.

114
00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:52.925
Although it's so out off shore like this,

115
00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:55.425
it's pretty shallow, isn't it?

116
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:57.125
Yes.

117
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:00.125
The rocks here a patterned in complex fashion.

118
00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:02.625
That area over there is very deep, you see.

119
00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:03.725
Well, but thanks to that,

120
00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:05.425
this place is hard to enter for fishing,

121
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.425
that not too many people know of this place.

122
00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:12.325
So, this is an extremely fantastic hidden fishing spot,

123
00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:15.025
thanks to Ida's navigating skill.

124
00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:18.925
I see, that's why there aren't other fishers around.

125
00:07:19.925 --> 00:07:21.425
Let's give it our best shot.

126
00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:23.525
After all, our lunch is at stake too.

127
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:30.425
But are you sure we can catch fish in a place like this?

128
00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:33.125
Yeah. For fish, the breakwater is like

129
00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:37.325
an artificially made hotel with a restaurant.

130
00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.425
There'll be loads of fish!

131
00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.625
Really?

132
00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.225
There're lots of them?

133
00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:44.625
But the fishing season is already...

134
00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.625
Oh, no!

135
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:49.225
-a bit over... -This cooler box is so small!

136
00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:50.425
What should we do?

137
00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:52.525
We didn't figure things out too well.

138
00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:54.525
What if we can't fit all the fish in?

139
00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:56.225
Don't worry.

140
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:59.125
I'll eat them all up.

141
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:02.825
-What a thing to say, Genta, come off it! -Excuse me...

142
00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:05.625
I'll aim for the record of youngest big catcher then.

143
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:07.725
Oh, just great.

144
00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:10.425
I'll open up a fish shop then!

145
00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:13.025
Yep... That's good idea.

146
00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:15.525
You're not listening at all, you guys.

147
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:34.125
No fish at all.

148
00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.425
I wonder if the fish are asleep?

149
00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:38.925
Yeah, it's not even budging.

150
00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:40.725
And it's such a clear day.

151
00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:42.925
The fish don't bite because it's a clear day.

152
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:44.725
What do you mean?

153
00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.525
It's not good if it's a fine day?

154
00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.925
No, because the water is only this deep.

155
00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.125
On a fine day when the water is transparent,

156
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.525
fish get suspicious and are on guard.

157
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:56.525
So it's actually better

158
00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:59.925
if it were cloudy or drizzling a little.

159
00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:03.025
Nevertheless, this is a good place.

160
00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:05.025
So the fish will eventually start biting.

161
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.325
Well... I'd advise you not to get your hopes up too high.

162
00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:09.725
What it all boils down to is

163
00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:12.025
only people with patience are suited for fishing.

164
00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:13.525
That's not true!

165
00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:16.925
There are impatient people among fishing experts.

166
00:09:16.925 --> 00:09:19.725
Exactly, impatient people are said to be suited for fishing

167
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.625
because they're concerned whether the bait's not too good,

168
00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.825
whether where they are fishing is not good,

169
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:27.525
whether their tools aren't good enough.

170
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.325
So, they read up on fishing books,

171
00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:31.125
take notice of fishing news,

172
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.625
check out the tides of the day and so forth.

173
00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.725
They do a lot of research as well as try each and every kind of thing,

174
00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:38.625
so impatient people are said to become good anglers faster.

175
00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:42.225
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

176
00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:44.225
The more effort you put in,

177
00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:45.325
the more reward you get to receive from the sea.

178
00:09:45.325 --> 00:09:48.425
That is you get to catch better fish too.

179
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:49.625
Well as for me,

180
00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:53.725
I haven't received such a great gift from the ocean yet though.

181
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:56.725
Hey, Conan.

182
00:09:56.725 --> 00:10:00.025
You said there are many different kinds of fish here, right?

183
00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:01.125
Yeah.

184
00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:03.125
Then can we catch sea bream here too?

185
00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:04.225
That's impossible.

186
00:10:04.225 --> 00:10:07.425
Why not? Why is it impossible?

187
00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:08.525
There are no sea breams

188
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:12.125
unless you go to a place that's more out to the sea

189
00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.025
with a depth of 30 to 70 meters.

190
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.825
But since the sea is connected,

191
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:20.025
a sea bream may go astray and come along, right?

192
00:10:20.025 --> 00:10:22.925
Remember! There was a sea lion that did that too, right?

193
00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:28.525
Yeah, all we have to do is catch fish that come swimming astray.

194
00:10:28.525 --> 00:10:31.325
Even whales come swimming astray at times too.

195
00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:32.325
Come on...

196
00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.625
I guess we can't fish for whales though...

197
00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.825
Well, we've got lots of time,

198
00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:39.525
so I guess we'll just have to stick it out, right, Conan?

199
00:10:39.525 --> 00:10:41.925
Oh, yeah, let's do our best.

200
00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:45.125
Did you catch something?

201
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:46.525
Oh, no...

202
00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:49.225
My bobber drifted away.

203
00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:52.625
Gosh. It's because you didn't push it in nicely into the bobber rubber.

204
00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.425
But...

205
00:10:54.425 --> 00:10:55.925
What is it now?

206
00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:58.825
Look, Ai's bobber is moving!

207
00:11:01.025 --> 00:11:02.325
Caught a fish!

208
00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:03.925
Keep your cool, Haibara!

209
00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:05.325
Pull! Pull!

210
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:07.425
-Just a little more! -Hang in there!

211
00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:08.525
Don't rush!

212
00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:10.525
That's right, you're doing good!

213
00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:18.125
-She did it! -She did it!

214
00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:27.725
It sure is tiny, though.

215
00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:30.025
A tiny girella?

216
00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:32.425
Well, I guess it's better than nothing.

217
00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:36.025
What do you think you're doing?

218
00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:39.125
It's fishing manners to return trash fish into the sea, isn't it?

219
00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:40.425
I guess you're right.

220
00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:42.225
What a waste.

221
00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:44.425
But the next time you put the fish back into the sea,

222
00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:46.125
it's better to cool your hands with the water in the bucket

223
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.725
before throwing in the fish.

224
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.725
Because the body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish

225
00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:54.625
and it would get burned!

226
00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:58.625
You sure like to pick on people, don't you?

227
00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:02.925
I just said that it would be better to do so!

228
00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:06.825
But now we know that we can fish here too!

229
00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:10.125
I'm going to change places and go fish over on that side.

230
00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:11.125
Hey!

231
00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:12.625
I want to fish for sea bream!

232
00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:13.825
Don't run!

233
00:12:13.825 --> 00:12:16.225
Oh, right. Sea bream...

234
00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:18.425
I've told you, it's impossible.

235
00:12:34.947 --> 00:12:36.847
Talk about not being able to fish anything

236
00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:38.947
You can say that again.

237
00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:40.047
Who was it that was saying

238
00:12:40.047 --> 00:12:42.847
let's fish for yellowtail and tuna?

239
00:12:44.247 --> 00:12:47.447
Talk about not even budging.

240
00:12:47.447 --> 00:12:51.247
Well, to become a good angler, experience is what counts!

241
00:12:52.347 --> 00:12:55.847
Okay! Experience is what it takes, experience.

242
00:12:57.347 --> 00:13:00.347
I'm going to go over to everyone else and see how they're doing.

243
00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.647
Please don't run.

244
00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.447
I know...

245
00:13:05.247 --> 00:13:08.147
Their fishing manners have improved.

246
00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:09.847
Fantastic...

247
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.147
Thank you.

248
00:13:21.147 --> 00:13:22.647
Good luck!

249
00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:26.947
I wonder if she'll become a professional angler when she grows up.

250
00:13:28.947 --> 00:13:31.947
Ayumi, did you learn anything?

251
00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:36.547
He taught me how to hook the bait on and a lot of other things.

252
00:13:36.547 --> 00:13:38.147
Really?

253
00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:40.547
Maybe I'll have him teach me too.

254
00:13:40.547 --> 00:13:43.147
There seems to be a lot of fish below

255
00:13:43.147 --> 00:13:45.147
and I wonder why I still can't seem to catch anything?

256
00:13:45.147 --> 00:13:49.347
He told me that the flow of the current is not good right now.

257
00:13:49.347 --> 00:13:53.047
I see. The flow of the current?

258
00:13:53.047 --> 00:13:56.147
I'm going to catch a fish today, no matter what it takes.

259
00:13:56.147 --> 00:13:58.847
If I can't fish anything today, when else can I?

260
00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:05.647
No fish.

261
00:14:05.647 --> 00:14:07.147
You can say that again.

262
00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:10.447
Well, but the veterans over there haven't caught any either.

263
00:14:10.447 --> 00:14:12.447
So I guess it can't be helped.

264
00:14:12.447 --> 00:14:15.447
I'd like to at least catch one fish.

265
00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:17.447
True, if we don't catch any,

266
00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:20.047
the man will really make fun of us.

267
00:14:21.547 --> 00:14:23.447
I'm getting sleepy again

268
00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:25.847
It's come!

269
00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:28.047
-Really? -No doubt about it.

270
00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:29.347
I've caught one!

271
00:14:29.347 --> 00:14:31.547
Hang in there, Mitsuhiko!

272
00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:40.047
I did it! I finally caught one!

273
00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:43.147
You did it! Mitsuhiko! You did it!

274
00:14:43.147 --> 00:14:45.647
You did it, Mitsuhiko!

275
00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:47.547
It's a nicely shaped mackerel!

276
00:14:47.547 --> 00:14:49.947
Genta! I caught one!

277
00:14:49.947 --> 00:14:51.647
See!

278
00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:54.447
You caught one? Really?

279
00:14:54.447 --> 00:14:57.547
Look... It's this big.

280
00:14:57.547 --> 00:14:59.347
Mitsuhiko caught it!

281
00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:00.647
Yeap!

282
00:15:00.647 --> 00:15:03.647
I'm happy for you!

283
00:15:03.647 --> 00:15:05.947
I mean, it's so small...

284
00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:08.847
As for me, I'm going for the big one. A sea bream!

285
00:15:08.847 --> 00:15:10.847
You did it, didn't you, Mitsuhiko!

286
00:15:10.847 --> 00:15:12.747
You really know how to "make it roll" (mackerel)?

287
00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:16.747
You did it, I've lost the bet.

288
00:15:16.747 --> 00:15:18.647
Is this your bobber?

289
00:15:20.247 --> 00:15:21.847
My bobber?

290
00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:23.247
Thank you.

291
00:15:23.247 --> 00:15:25.147
It drifted away.

292
00:15:25.147 --> 00:15:27.647
Why do you have it?

293
00:15:27.647 --> 00:15:30.247
Make sure you keep in on tight next time.

294
00:15:30.247 --> 00:15:32.047
Okay!

295
00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:36.547
The crab cream croquette she gave us sure is good, isn't it?

296
00:15:36.547 --> 00:15:40.747
Eating in a place like this makes lunch taste even better, doesn't it?

297
00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:43.447
Yes! It's delicious!

298
00:15:43.447 --> 00:15:45.647
Nothing yet.

299
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:50.647
I guess Conan was right about no sea breams being here.

300
00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:54.147
This is the worst time of day for fishing.

301
00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:56.647
Morning or sundown is way better.

302
00:15:56.647 --> 00:15:58.847
It seems everyone's having a hard time too.

303
00:16:00.347 --> 00:16:02.147
No bite what so ever.

304
00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:04.447
Maybe I'll try changing the bait.

305
00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:07.247
How about you? Anything?

306
00:16:07.247 --> 00:16:10.147
No, nothing at all!

307
00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:12.847
I wonder if the bait is on all right?

308
00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:16.847
What's this? I feel something pulling.

309
00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:18.247
It's big!

310
00:16:18.247 --> 00:16:21.847
Conan, a whale! I can't lift it up!

311
00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:25.847
It looks like your fishing line is tangled up somewhere.

312
00:16:25.847 --> 00:16:29.647
Tangled? Is there a fish called tangled?

313
00:16:29.647 --> 00:16:30.847
It's not a fish.

314
00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:33.047
Your line got caught and stuck to seaweed or a rock or something.

315
00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:35.147
It's not a fish?

316
00:16:35.147 --> 00:16:37.247
Then what do I do?

317
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.247
Don't pull too hard,

318
00:16:39.247 --> 00:16:41.747
but rather, loosen and pull.

319
00:16:41.747 --> 00:16:42.947
Like this?

320
00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:44.847
Right, good. Repeat the process.

321
00:16:46.347 --> 00:16:48.147
It's free.

322
00:16:49.947 --> 00:16:51.847
What's this?

323
00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:54.247
You sure fished a big one.

324
00:16:57.047 --> 00:16:59.447
Shoots, bait gone again.

325
00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:04.747
Even the expert angler Ejiri is having a bad day today.

326
00:17:04.747 --> 00:17:06.947
It looks like things aren't going well over there either.

327
00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:08.947
Is it because of the tide?

328
00:17:12.747 --> 00:17:15.847
Genta, aren't you going to eat lunch?

329
00:17:15.847 --> 00:17:19.047
Yeah, I'll eat in a little while!

330
00:17:19.047 --> 00:17:23.947
I can't believe that Genta is still not eating.

331
00:17:23.947 --> 00:17:27.747
Yep... I wonder if he wants to fish sea bream that badly?

332
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:31.247
Sea bream is Genta's dream, please let him fish a sea bream.

333
00:17:32.347 --> 00:17:34.247
-Dr. Agasa! -Sorry.

334
00:17:36.547 --> 00:17:38.447
Even so,

335
00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:42.047
I'm so hungry right now.

336
00:17:42.047 --> 00:17:44.347
Should eat my lunch or fish for the sea bream?

337
00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:47.347
Will it be lunch or the sea bream?

338
00:17:48.447 --> 00:17:50.247
It's lunch first after all!

339
00:17:50.247 --> 00:17:54.847
Eating lunch while bathing in sea wind makes lunch tastier after all.

340
00:17:54.847 --> 00:17:56.347
Don't you think so too, Ai?

341
00:17:56.347 --> 00:17:57.847
Aren't you glad you came?

342
00:18:04.547 --> 00:18:07.647
Take your time and eat.

343
00:18:07.647 --> 00:18:09.447
I've got no time to lose, you see.

344
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:12.747
The lunch tastes great here.

345
00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:15.847
Thank you for the meal.

346
00:18:18.047 --> 00:18:20.747
A record high eating speed.

347
00:18:20.747 --> 00:18:22.447
Okay, I've finish eating my share,

348
00:18:22.447 --> 00:18:24.747
now all I need is for the fish to eat my bait.

349
00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:26.847
Come on, my dear sea bream.

350
00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:28.047
Genta.

351
00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:55.647
Oh, it's the ship!

352
00:18:55.647 --> 00:18:57.547
It's that time of day already?

353
00:18:57.547 --> 00:18:59.247
Shall we get ready to go, then?

354
00:18:59.247 --> 00:19:00.747
Right.

355
00:19:00.747 --> 00:19:03.847
He's already come for us. How fast.

356
00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:06.547
Next, it's curry party time at Dr. Agasa house.

357
00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:07.747
That's right.

358
00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:10.347
Besides, maybe we can have mackerel sashimi.

359
00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:12.647
Rather, I guess it's too small for sashimi.

360
00:19:12.647 --> 00:19:13.847
Mackerel, slash me.

361
00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:14.847
Dr. Agasa!

362
00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:20.547
How'd you do, caught anything?

363
00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:24.647
Of course we caught nothing, as empty as no hair on my head.

364
00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.647
Well, that's too bad.

365
00:19:27.647 --> 00:19:29.247
How about you guys?

366
00:19:29.247 --> 00:19:30.747
Empty here too.

367
00:19:30.747 --> 00:19:33.047
I caught one small mackerel.

368
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:34.947
Big catch, big catch.

369
00:19:34.947 --> 00:19:38.247
I say, we should change fishing spots from this afternoon.

370
00:19:38.247 --> 00:19:41.447
True. But what about Ejiri...

371
00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:45.547
He said that he's going to stick it out here till late in the day today.

372
00:19:45.547 --> 00:19:49.247
Really? I'll go talk it over with Ida then.

373
00:19:56.947 --> 00:20:00.047
Hey, Genta, give up already.

374
00:20:00.047 --> 00:20:01.547
We're going back.

375
00:20:01.547 --> 00:20:02.647
Okay.

376
00:20:03.747 --> 00:20:06.347
He says he'll go around over to where he went before.

377
00:20:06.347 --> 00:20:08.447
Oh, that's good.

378
00:20:08.447 --> 00:20:10.147
You're going to change places?

379
00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:13.247
Yes, this place is no good today.

380
00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:16.547
There's another spot nearby where we fished a lot before.

381
00:20:16.547 --> 00:20:18.247
We're stopping by for a while.

382
00:20:18.247 --> 00:20:20.447
Well, we're in no rush.

383
00:20:20.447 --> 00:20:22.947
So, we're all going back together then?

384
00:20:22.947 --> 00:20:25.847
No, Ejiri's going to stay there.

385
00:20:25.847 --> 00:20:28.447
We're going to leave him behind alone?

386
00:20:29.547 --> 00:20:31.047
No need to worry,

387
00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:34.447
because Ida's boat will come for him again at sundown.

388
00:20:35.747 --> 00:20:38.847
Ejiri really likes that place, doesn't he?

389
00:20:42.547 --> 00:20:43.947
It sure was a lot of fun.

390
00:20:43.947 --> 00:20:45.047
I'd like to come again.

391
00:20:45.047 --> 00:20:46.947
Yes, next time I'd like to come

392
00:20:46.947 --> 00:20:49.647
after doing some research as Dr. Agasa suggested.

393
00:20:52.347 --> 00:20:54.447
Hey! We're going back!

394
00:20:54.447 --> 00:20:57.147
Shoots, I wanted to fish. A sea bream.

395
00:20:57.147 --> 00:20:59.547
All I fished was seaweed!

396
00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:05.147
Another false call?

397
00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:08.347
Okay, we'll be on our way then!

398
00:21:08.347 --> 00:21:10.247
Good luck!

399
00:21:10.247 --> 00:21:12.347
No use calling out to him.

400
00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:14.747
Once he starts fishing,

401
00:21:14.747 --> 00:21:17.847
he's reticent and hardly ever talks!

402
00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:18.847
Right.

403
00:21:18.847 --> 00:21:20.247
He was saying that he's going to stick it out today too,

404
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:22.047
until he gets a big catch.

405
00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.747
But he sure makes a lot of noise when he gets a big catch.

406
00:21:24.747 --> 00:21:28.047
Just the other day, he got so excited that he almost fell off.

407
00:21:29.147 --> 00:21:31.847
He sure is quiet today, though?

408
00:21:31.847 --> 00:21:34.347
He's probably in deep thought or something.

409
00:21:37.347 --> 00:21:38.647
So, shall we get going?

410
00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:46.847
It seems like he gotten a bite.

411
00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.147
Yes, he's got a bite.

412
00:21:48.147 --> 00:21:50.647
There's a bite. Don't you realize it?

413
00:21:50.647 --> 00:21:54.447
Ejiri! You got a bite!

414
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.847
Ejiri?

415
00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:57.947
What's up? What's all the racket about?

416
00:21:57.947 --> 00:22:00.647
That man seems to be asleep...

417
00:22:00.647 --> 00:22:03.247
Asleep? You mean Ejiri?

418
00:22:03.247 --> 00:22:04.347
No way.

419
00:22:09.547 --> 00:22:10.947
What's the matter with him?

420
00:22:10.947 --> 00:22:12.147
Ejiri?

421
00:22:15.747 --> 00:22:18.047
Hey! Ejiri...

422
00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:22.647
Ejiri?

423
00:22:22.647 --> 00:22:23.847
What's up?

424
00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:25.347
What's wrong?

425
00:22:25.347 --> 00:22:26.547
What's going on?

426
00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:27.947
Ejiri!

427
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.247
"Next Episode" -We've got to take this man on the ship right away

428
00:24:02.247 --> 00:24:04.547
and head him off to the hospital!

429
00:24:04.547 --> 00:24:06.147
Hurry!

430
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:07.547
Dear!

431
00:24:07.547 --> 00:24:08.647
Don't move!

432
00:24:10.747 --> 00:24:14.047
Don't touch anything and stay still!

433
00:24:14.047 --> 00:24:16.347
What's up?

434
00:24:16.347 --> 00:24:19.547
Who are you, sonny?

435
00:24:19.547 --> 00:24:21.947
Conan Edogawa.

436
00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:23.047
A detective.

437
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 2)"

438
00:24:31.074 --> 00:24:32.874
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:32.874 --> 00:24:34.474
"Festival"

440
00:24:34.474 --> 00:24:35.474
In the next episode, the case is solved.

441
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.874
The fishing case is finished!

442
00:24:37.874 --> 00:24:39.274
What was that?
