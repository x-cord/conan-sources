1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,040
What?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,740
You're going to be late tonight, so you don't need dinner?

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,540
But you said the same thing the day before yesterday, too!

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,740
I'm sorry. I've got an urgent matter to attend to.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,140
Then, what are you going to do about

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,140
the person who asked you to search for his first love the other day?

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,540
Weren't you supposed to inform that person on the progress of the case?

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,740
Idiot!

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,540
What makes you think that the great Detective Kogoro Mouri

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,340
can be bothered by such a trivial case?

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,740
Call the client and say that I've found nothing yet!

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,340
Make sure you chain lock the door!

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,140
Hey, dad!

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,440
Seriously. I wonder what's gotten into him recently.

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,440
He always comes home in the wee hours of the night.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,940
Maybe he found himself a lover or something.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,340
Well, if he's investigating marital affairs,

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,040
he may work till late at night, doesn't it?

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,140
He's probably at the Beer Garden at Beika Department Store

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,440
that was just opened last week.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,240
The beer garden is known for the fried noodles they serve.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,540
And there's green seaweed on Pop's toothbrush

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,740
each morning after he comes home late.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,340
I'm sure he doesn't want to be scolded by you for coming home drunk,

25
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,740
so he secretly comes home late at night.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,640
Does that mean he was drinking up beer,

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,940
leaving his family up to themselves,

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,240
and having a good time all by himself?

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Well, I guess Pops has got other things to do, too.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
Great detective, my foot!

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,740
Sleeping Kogoro, my foot!

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,740
He's just a good-for-nothing father!

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,440
No.

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,340
Mr. Kogoro Mouri is a very very good person!

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,940
"Takae Kiritani (70)" -There's no reason why he should be insulted

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,640
"Apartment Landlady" -by some unknown girl student.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,840
Unknown girl student? I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,040
Daughter?

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Are you really Mr. Kogoro's daughter?

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,540
Yes, my name's Ran.

41
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,640
So, he's kept it a secret from you.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,940
He comes to visit this old lady every week

43
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,340
and helps me solve cases for free.

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,240
My dad's working for free?

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,540
It can't be.

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,840
Looks like that moustached man is pretty good!

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,140
But what kind of cases does he solve for you?

48
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,540
Just simple ones like looking for lost items.

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,940
Would you like to come over to my house and see for yourself?

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,140
Mr. Kogoro will also come over to my house today.

51
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,540
Yes.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,640
If all cases were men,

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,340
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Kogoro's imposter appears?

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,940
A grave case where Death is summoned!

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,940
His name is Detective Conan!

59
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,980
"Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 1)"

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
So you're the landlady of an apartment.

61
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,180
Yes, the one standing next door is the apartment.

62
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,980
My husband, my son and his wife have passed away.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,080
The only one alive, my granddaughter

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,680
seems to have no intention of taking over this place,

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,580
so I'm thinking of letting go of this apartment soon.

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,180
I see.

67
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,880
Mr. Kogoro loves the okonomiyaki that I make.

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,080
He eats at least two pieces every time he visits.

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm sorry that you have to make some for us, too.

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,380
So the green seaweed came from this granny's okonomiyaki?

71
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,080
But what a surprise.

72
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,780
To think that dad was secretly doing

73
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,280
good deeds like this for the elderly.

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,380
No. There must be something behind all this.

75
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,380
He's here.

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,980
I'll open the door and surprise him then.

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
Yes!

78
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,580
Who are you?

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
You... You are?

80
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,680
Welcome, Mr. Kogoro!

81
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,880
I coincidentally ran into your daughter on the street

82
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,380
and had her come over.

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,780
Kogoro?

84
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,080
Daughter?

85
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,480
You're wrong, granny. This man is...

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,380
What?

87
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,680
The granny's granddaughter asked you to do her a favor?

88
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,780
What's your relationship with her granddaughter?

89
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,680
I... I'm her boyfriend.

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,780
I was her classmate at the university.

91
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,280
"Ryohei Onda (21)" -When I came for the first time three months ago,

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,880
"University Student" -a thief broke into houses in the neighborhood.

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,180
Her granny was so scared that she couldn't sleep.

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,580
I set up two locks for her

95
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,880
and taught her how to protect herself.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,580
Even so, you didn't have to pretend to be my dad, did you?

97
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,080
She persuaded me that it would be more convincing if I did, so...

98
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,680
Besides, it seems that granny had sent a letter to Detective Mouri, too.

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,380
But that thief was caught last month, so I don't think

100
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,280
you need to be around anymore, do you?

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
Right, but...

102
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,380
I started rejecting strange soliciting calls for her after that.

103
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,380
I was also asked to do other things

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
like looking for the neighbors' missing cats.

105
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,380
Don't tell me that you're acting as an imposter of Kogoro Mouri

106
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,480
in an attempt to deceive granny so you can swindle her.

107
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,980
-No way... -I don't think he'd do so.

108
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,280
If so, I'm sure he would have fled

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,580
the minute he ran into you, Ran, who is his daughter.

110
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,380
Pops has many friends in the police force, too.

111
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,680
So please cover for me just this once.

112
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,980
I'm sure granny would be disappointed

113
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
if she finds out that I'm an imposter.

114
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,280
I promise that I won't ever do something like this again.

115
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
Seriously.

116
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,380
Have you finished your father-daughter talk already?

117
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Yes, my daughter really surprised me out of my wits.

118
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,680
Then, please solve the case like you always do.

119
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Yes.

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,880
Ran, watch carefully how your father works!

121
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,680
So that means that the real Pops is...

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Draft beer is fantastic!

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,980
Zapping?

125
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,380
Are you talking about channel surfing

126
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,880
where you use the remote controller to switch channels

127
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,980
one after the other?

128
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,580
Yes. Last night, when I was watching TV,

129
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,180
I wasn't touching the remote controller at all,

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,480
and yet the channels suddenly kept changing.

131
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,580
What do you call that?

132
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,680
I think it's "poster east guide" or something.

133
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,580
"Poster east"?

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,080
You mean a poltergeist?

135
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
Right, right.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,480
I thought a ghost appeared and I was so scared

137
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,480
that I called Mr. Kogoro.

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,680
Can you explain what happened?

139
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,780
Well, it's probably your husband who died last year.

140
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,480
Ghosts don't exist in this world.

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,780
Ghosts only appear in cartoons, dramas and novels.

142
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Right, Pops?

143
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,580
Yeah, of course.

144
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,080
So, this is not the work of a ghost.

145
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
In other words...

146
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Hey, Conan. Why don't you help him?

147
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,780
You've figured something out already, haven't you?

148
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,880
I do, but may I say it?

149
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,680
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

150
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,680
I feel a bit sorry for him.

151
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,380
Seriously. I guess I'll help him out, then.

152
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,080
Granny.

153
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,880
You were watching TV in that room, right?

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
Yes...

155
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,280
Do you always stack that many books on the table like that?

156
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,680
Right. I have this urge to look things up

157
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,180
as soon as I come up with something that bothers me.

158
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,480
Then, maybe the remote controller of the TV

159
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,180
is buried somewhere underneath?

160
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,880
Right, right. It's hard to pull it out from underneath.

161
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,380
Goal!

162
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,980
-Big Osaka's star player! -No way.

163
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,580
It turned on.

164
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,780
Since the TV remote controller was buried underneath the books,

165
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,880
the channel button happened to be pressed down.

166
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,980
Therefore, it caused zapping.

167
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,480
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

168
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,280
Yeah, that... That's right.

169
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,480
Thank you, Mr. Kogoro!

170
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Thanks to you, the mystery's been solved.

171
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Well... I think it'd be better to tidy up the table.

172
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,080
If he's making her happy, maybe we should overlook his misdemeanor.

173
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,180
I... I guess so.

174
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,780
Well...

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,980
It's not a big deal anyway.

176
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,280
Hey, isn't he dead?

177
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Oh, no. Why?

178
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Ambulance! No, call the police!

179
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,680
It... It seems like something happened next door.

180
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Next door? Do you mean my apartment?

181
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,080
Conan?

182
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Hey...

183
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,880
The door is busted!

184
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,280
This is...

185
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,080
A room key?

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,880
Hey. Why is the door busted?

187
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,080
-What is this, kid? -Never mind, just tell me.

188
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,980
"Kumi Bannai (22)" -The bell of Mr. Denkawa's alarm clock

189
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,480
"Apartment Resident" -wouldn't stop ringing.

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
"Ken Ishigame (64)" -So I came up to the door

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,580
"Apartment Resident" -and repeatedly asked him to stop the clock.

192
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,980
"Junji Hyodo (28)" -Since there was no answer,

193
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,880
"Apartment Resident" -we had no choice but to bust the door open.

194
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,280
Something similar happened last night, too.

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,180
Something similar?

196
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,080
He suddenly turned the TV on full blast.

197
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Moreover, it was zapping right through.

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,780
Talk about a nuisance.

199
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,980
Zapping?

200
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,480
When the three of us came and complained about it

201
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
in front of the door last night,

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,580
it finally stopped.

203
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,380
But the room key is near the corpse

204
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,080
and he's holding a knife in his hand.

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,680
I wonder if he cut his own neck and committed suicide.

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,980
No, this is a homicide.

207
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,780
Moreover, the killer is...

208
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,480
among these three people here.

209
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,580
Well, we should leave the rest to the police.

210
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,780
No need to worry! The case will be solved immediately.

211
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,880
The landlady?

212
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,280
We've got the great Detective Kogoro Mouri on our side.

213
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,780
-What? -What?

214
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,180
Hey...

215
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,430
The victim is

216
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,730
"Apartment Resident" -Mr. Gensuke Denkawa, 44 years old.

217
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,630
He had been living in this apartment since 10 years ago,

218
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,730
and he was a construction worker.

219
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,630
Am I correct?

220
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,030
Yes.

221
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,630
It'd be better if you could've talked to my husband.

222
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,230
He would've been able to give you more information.

223
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,430
But I've been in charge of maintaining this apartment

224
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,830
since 10 years ago.

225
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,530
I formally took over as landlady

226
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,830
since last year after my husband passed away.

227
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,230
By the way, is it true

228
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,530
that Mr. Denkawa's alarm clock didn't stop ringing,

229
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,230
so the residents of this apartment,

230
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:43,330
Ms. Bannai, Mr. Ishigame and Mr. Hyodo broke into this room?

231
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,930
Yeah, we pounded on the door repeatedly

232
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,830
and told him to stop it, but...

233
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,130
He wouldn't answer us at all, so we had no choice.

234
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,530
And when we came inside, Mr. Denkawa was already...

235
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,430
Then, this boy suddenly came into the room.

236
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,630
I was at the landlady's house

237
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,630
and heard these people making a lot of noise through the window,

238
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,130
so I decided to come.

239
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,130
You saw them through the window?

240
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,830
The landlady's house is right next door, you see.

241
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,730
But why were you at the landlady's house, Conan?

242
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,230
We're an acquaintance of the landlady,

243
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,530
and he was visiting her with me.

244
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,530
What?

245
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,430
Well, I can understand Ran and Conan being here but...

246
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,530
Who are you?

247
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,830
Well, I...

248
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,630
You! You're a police detective

249
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,230
but you don't know the great Detective Mouri?

250
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,130
Of course, I know him, but...

251
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,030
You go ahead and tell her since you're his daughter!

252
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,230
Well...

253
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,930
Thank you for always taking care of my dad!

254
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,630
Just what do you mean?

255
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,930
I see.

256
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,230
The landlady's granddaughter asked you to take care of her

257
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,830
since she's living alone and feeling lonely.

258
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,630
That young man with the fake mustache

259
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,530
who's the granddaughter's boyfriend is pretending to be Mr. Mouri.

260
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,030
Please!

261
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,930
The landlady completely believes him.

262
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,230
If she finds out that he's an imposter, she might feel depressed.

263
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,630
Well, as long as he doesn't get in the way of the investigation,

264
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,130
I could leave it at that.

265
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,130
Thank you very much.

266
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,530
If Inspector Megure finds out about it, he'll bawl us out.

267
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,030
So, back to the subject.

268
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,930
Wasn't it taking things a bit too far to bust the door open

269
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,730
just because the alarm clock didn't stop ringing?

270
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,230
Don't you think so, Detective Mouri?

271
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,030
Well... Yeah.

272
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,730
I feel the same way!

273
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,030
Denkawa had busted down my door too, you know.

274
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,730
He left a message saying that he pulled out the telephone line

275
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,430
because my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

276
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,030
In my case, he once taped my door with masking tape from the outside

277
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,030
so that I couldn't get out of the room!

278
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,030
After finding out that Mr. Denkawa had done it,

279
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,830
I cornered him to tell me why he did it.

280
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,430
And he had the nerve to say it was because there was a foul odour.

281
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,430
-A foul odour? -I was grilling salted fish,

282
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,530
so it might have been a bit smelly.

283
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,930
He also cracked my window.

284
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,830
It seems that Mr. Denkawa had a grudge against my grandson

285
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,730
who cracked his window

286
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,230
with a baseball when he came to see me.

287
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,830
Did you report all the incidents to the landlady?

288
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,530
Yeah, we reported it to the previous landlord.

289
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,030
Everything was settled out of court

290
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,830
since we thought we were partly to blame.

291
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,930
After that, he started leading a quiet life.

292
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,930
By the way, the volume of the TV last night was unreal.

293
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,430
Suddenly, he started watching TV with the volume at full blast.

294
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,830
Furthermore, he was zapping the whole time.

295
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,330
Since it was a nuisance to the neighbors, we knocked on the door

296
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,830
and asked him to turn the volume down like we did today.

297
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,530
And? Did Mr. Denkawa listen to you?

298
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,530
-Yes. -He did turn off the TV.

299
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,330
He didn't say anything though.

300
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,730
But, why would Mr. Denkawa do something like that all of a sudden?

301
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,230
Beats me.

302
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,730
Maybe he thought that we had gone out already.

303
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,330
The three of us were just about to leave.

304
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,430
All three of you went out together?

305
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,930
Yeah.

306
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,830
The parents of our friend live in Izu

307
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,530
and run a hot spring inn there.

308
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,030
They offered to let us stay for cheap, so...

309
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,230
The three of you get along well, don't you?

310
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,630
Well, we used to exchange a lot of stink talks about Denkawa.

311
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,330
We were trying to figure out ways to chase him out of here.

312
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,230
We went to talk it over at the inn.

313
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,330
And when we came back just a while ago,

314
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,730
the bell of the alarm clock was ringing.

315
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,630
We went to put our things in the room,

316
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,230
but the alarm didn't stop ringing even after a while.

317
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,430
That's why we went to complain to him again!

318
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,830
So, you busted the door down and found the corpse?

319
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,730
What time did you leave for the hot spring last night?

320
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,930
I think it was around 6 pm.

321
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,730
By the way, where are the other residents of this apartment?

322
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,430
We're the only ones living here.

323
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,530
Because everyone else disliked Mr. Denkawa and left.

324
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,030
In other words, after you three left,

325
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,430
there was nobody in the apartment except Mr. Denkawa.

326
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,530
If I remember correctly, the time of death that the coroner estimated

327
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,730
was between 5 pm to 7 pm last night.

328
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,030
Yes. According to the testimony of the three,

329
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,430
it seems like Mr. Denkawa was still alive at 6 pm.

330
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,130
The key to this room was near his body,

331
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,430
and he was holding a blood-smeared knife in his hand.

332
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,230
Judging from the circumstances,

333
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,130
he seems to have slashed his own throat with the knife

334
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,630
between 6 and 7 pm after the three left.

335
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,330
Yes. Although we haven't found a suicide note yet,

336
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,530
this seems to be none other than a suicide.

337
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,930
I don't think it was suicide.

338
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,930
What?

339
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,430
I think this is the work of Death.

340
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,130
Look. Although this key is located on the blood,

341
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,930
there's no blood stain on it, right?

342
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,230
True.

343
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,530
It's possible that when we came into the room,

344
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,630
someone accidentally kicked the key on the floor

345
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,630
onto the pool of blood.

346
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,530
But when I came into the room,

347
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,130
I touched the key a bit. And it was still a bit warm.

348
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,430
What?

349
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,730
I'm sure that Death killed this man and tried to take him away.

350
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,930
But since those three busted the door and came in,

351
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,130
he was surprised

352
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,030
and dropped the key he was holding onto the dry blood.

353
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,130
Huh? But that's strange.

354
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,130
I thought Death's hands were supposed to be cold.

355
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,230
So how come the key was warm?

356
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,630
That's probably because somebody hid the key in his or her hand,

357
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,030
and threw it near the corpse after entering this room

358
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,530
to make it seem like the door was locked.

359
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,730
It's one of the three of you

360
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,030
who busted down the door and came in.

361
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,230
What?

362
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,330
I wonder if the culprit thought that if he locked the door

363
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,830
and left the place after killing Mr. Denkawa,

364
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,530
that it would be a perfect alibi?

365
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,330
Wait a second!

366
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,430
Then, what about the loud sound of the TV

367
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,130
that was playing before we left?

368
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,830
We've already confirmed that the sound came from Mr. Denkawa's room.

369
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,730
Maybe the sound of the TV was recorded beforehand

370
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,330
and set to play with a timer.

371
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,630
But the first thing we heard was the 6 pm news,

372
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,830
The date, the day as well as the news that were aired

373
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,430
were all from yesterday.

374
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,130
The channels were switched after two to three minutes though.

375
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,430
Then, maybe a TV or DVD recorder was used.

376
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,230
Nowadays, you can reserve the program you want to watch

377
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,630
and the TV will turn on by itself.

378
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,530
If several devices are used,

379
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,630
it could sound like it's zapping, too.

380
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,130
I don't think that's possible.

381
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,030
There's only one TV in this room.

382
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,130
There doesn't seem to be anything that looks like a timer here either.

383
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,930
The only things here are the alarm clock beside the bed

384
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,130
and the two electric fans.

385
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,130
One of the fans was knocked over though.

386
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,730
I was the one who knocked it over.

387
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,930
At any rate, I wanted to stop the bell of the alarm clock right away.

388
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,030
I came into the room when it was dim.

389
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,230
As for me, I tripped over the corpse's feet

390
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,130
and scraped my elbow.

391
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,930
I pulled the string of the light and turned the light on,

392
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,230
and found the room in this condition.

393
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,030
Anyway, do you need two fans in a room?

394
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,730
Some people do that.

395
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,830
One is for cooling themselves,

396
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,230
and the other is for ventilating the room.

397
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,430
Kamen Yaiba!

398
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,330
The sound is so loud!

399
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,330
This TV has the function of recording programs,

400
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,130
but I don't think that zapping is possible.

401
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,930
But this is strange.

402
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,230
The room looks quite tidy and yet

403
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,530
the laundry seems to have been taken in and left as is.

404
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,330
Even the clothes pins are scattered on the floor.

405
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,430
The newspaper leaflets left on the mattress

406
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,130
also seem out of place.

407
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,630
Besides that, there's only one TV set,

408
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,630
so why are there two remote controllers?

409
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,930
This one is a universal remote controller.

410
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,630
Did he buy a universal remote controller

411
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,930
because he lost the remote controller and found it later on?

412
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,330
There are splattered blood spots on the side of the remote controller.

413
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,730
Moreover, it's slightly scraped.

414
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,630
Don't tell me this is...

415
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,430
The culprit is one of the three who found the corpse after all.

416
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,830
The culprit may have schemed a perfect crime

417
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,330
and made it look as if Mr. Denkawa committed suicide,

418
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,330
but he can't fool me.

419
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,530
Whoever it is, I'll disclose the culprit for sure!

420
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,330
No way. Her granddaughter is married.

421
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,130
Then, who on earth is he?

422
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,830
I think we should ask

423
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,330
Detective Mouri who is a professional

424
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,730
at solving criminal cases to deduce this case.

425
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,030
I, Kogoro Mouri shall reveal the truth behind this case.

426
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,230
You're taking it too far.

427
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,330
Don't worry.

428
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,530
Because the real Sleeping Kogoro is right here with us.

429
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,330
Next Conan, "Kogoro is a Good Person (Part 2)".

430
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,230
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,930
"Clothes Pin"

432
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,030
Even Mr. Mouri's imposter can solve cases.

433
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,126
True. Wait, do you mean me?
