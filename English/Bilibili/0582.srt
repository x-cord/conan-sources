1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
-Bull's Eye! -Strike!

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,740
Awesome!

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,340
It feels kind of uncomfortable being invited

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,440
to the client's birthday party

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,740
when the case isn't solved yet.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,340
What're you talking about?

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,240
You were the one who was all excited

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,840
saying that Asako from Strawberry invited you to come!

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,740
After all, they're one of the most popular

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,440
comedian couple around now.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,540
"Jiro Imaoka, Asako Fujimori" -Strawberries taste of love.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,340
"Fujimori"

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm Mouri.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,340
Thank you for inviting us over tonight.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,140
What's the matter, Asako?

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,940
A man suddenly broke in from the veranda and I...

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,540
Asako!

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,240
Hey, Conan!

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,340
Zombie?

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,840
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,140
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,140
A popular man and woman comedian.

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,540
The key to this difficult case is strawberry.

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:25,562
"The Night the Zombie Died"

28
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,062
"Mouri Detective Agency"

29
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:29,862
It all started a week ago.

30
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,162
Ms. Asako Fujimori of the popular man and woman

31
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:33,462
comedian couple, Strawberry,

32
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,762
came to the Mouri Detective Agency asking to have a job done.

33
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,862
Keisuke Numata?

34
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,562
He's a man I used to go out with

35
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:44,762
about 15 years ago when I first came to Tokyo.

36
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:47,162
He didn't have a good personality,

37
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:51,062
so I parted with him right away though.

38
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:54,562
The moment that Strawberry won the Spring Comedian Grand Prix

39
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,762
and your popularity started to grow!

40
00:03:56,762 --> 00:04:00,162
I got repeated calls from asking to lend him money.

41
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:03,462
I refused and he started giving me a bad time.

42
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:04,862
Started giving you a bad time?

43
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,462
My mailbox was messed up.

44
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:11,362
When I walk the streets at night, I feel like someone is following me.

45
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:12,362
The other day,

46
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,562
I found marks on the front door attempting to be forced opened.

47
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:21,462
Your pendant is cute.

48
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,462
This is a medicine case.

49
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,162
-Medicine case? -Yes.

50
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,662
I've had a weak heart since I was a child.

51
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:33,862
So I always keep medicine in here and carry it around with me.

52
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,262
Unforgivable.

53
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:39,262
Targeting such a fragile woman.

54
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:42,162
I see.

55
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:46,362
So, she asked you to look for that guy called Numata?

56
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,662
Yes, sir. I checked everywhere,

57
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,762
but I still can't come up with where he is.

58
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,662
To start with, I told her to change the lock

59
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:56,562
that is hard to do picking on.

60
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,062
I think that Numata found out about this,

61
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,562
and decided to force himself in.

62
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:07,462
Asako, your left arm is bruised.

63
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:10,062
That guy grabbed me.

64
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,562
Asako.

65
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,962
"Minoru Hisamatsu (60)" -You really surprised me, really.

66
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,862
-Are you all right? -Mr. Hisamatsu!

67
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,662
Mr. Hisamatsu, Strawberry's manager.

68
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,262
Why on earth...

69
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:28,162
A man suddenly came in with a pistol.

70
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,562
I got desperate and...

71
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,162
Take off his mask.

72
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,562
Yes, sir!

73
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,062
No? It can't be!

74
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,162
Jiro!

75
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:52,862
Why? Why, Jiro?

76
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,462
Jiro!

77
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,562
It's a model gun.

78
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:03,462
Can you give us the details of when Jiro came inside?

79
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,162
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,462
Today's my birthday.

81
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:10,762
I invited him to come at 7:00 pm to have dinner

82
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:12,862
with Mr. Mouri who has been looking after me.

83
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,662
Hamburger, right?

84
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:17,062
What's this?

85
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:18,762
It's fruit punch.

86
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,962
I made it for dessert.

87
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,262
It was when I was cutting strawberries...

88
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:29,062
I heard glass crack.

89
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:41,962
I'm going to kill you!

90
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:43,662
No!

91
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,862
-No! -Stay still!

92
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,562
You're Numata, aren't you?

93
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,762
Shut up!

94
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:51,762
No!

95
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:10,762
That's when Mr. Mouri and the others arrived.

96
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,762
You should cool it.

97
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,262
Thank you.

98
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,662
Inspector! According to the calls received record,

99
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:24,262
the victim before breaking in here at about 6:45 pm,

100
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:25,962
made a call somewhere!

101
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:28,762
K?

102
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:32,062
Check out who it is right away.

103
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:33,362
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:38,062
Didn't you invite Jiro to come today?

105
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:41,562
He told me that he had to meet somebody today.

106
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,562
Why did Jiro do something like this?

107
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:47,562
-Do you have any idea? -No.

108
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,962
Mr. Hisamatsu, how about you?

109
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:53,362
Well...

110
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:58,762
Jiro was trying to quit being a pair with Asako!

111
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:00,862
-What? -What?

112
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:03,362
What? It can't be...

113
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,362
Jiro entered the world of comedy

114
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:07,362
right after graduating from high school.

115
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,562
Although he had good looks,

116
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:09,862
he didn't have guts going on stage.

117
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:12,462
So things didn't work out.

118
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:15,862
Asako insisted that Jiro had talent,

119
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,562
aggressively established being a pair with him

120
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,262
and after 10 years of hard work,

121
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:22,162
everything starting to bloom.

122
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:25,962
Being busy worsened Asako's heart condition.

123
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,762
She began to take off from stage performances and TV,

124
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,762
or her reaction during their act would be delayed.

125
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:34,462
It seems that Jiro couldn't tolerate that.

126
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,162
Come to think of it, I too,

127
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:39,162
during the time I was guarding Asako...

128
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,862
-Jiro! -Hi, Jiro!

129
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:44,362
"Strawbery" -Well, it was really good!

130
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,062
No! No good!

131
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:49,362
You didn't react on time, three times!

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,862
Just what do you think you're doing?

133
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:55,162
I'm sorry, my heart wasn't feeling right.

134
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:56,662
Who cares?

135
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,162
We're professionals, you know?

136
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,462
Come now...

137
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:02,262
Asako has a lot on her mind too and is tired.

138
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,362
I can't go on like this anymore.

139
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:06,162
Hurry on up and quit already!

140
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:13,662
-Did he tell her to quit? -Yes, sir.

141
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,962
Come to think of it,

142
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,162
I've seen a lot about it in the weekly magazines and stuff.

143
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,562
Oh, here.

144
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,562
"Get together party with girl announcers"?

145
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,562
"Dating idols"?

146
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:27,562
It seems he was pretty open about going out with women.

147
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:32,362
Asako and Jiro were not only comedy pairs,

148
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,562
but were they were also lovers.

149
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:37,962
Yet, as soon as they started getting popular, Jiro...

150
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,462
Not being able to tolerate it any longer,

151
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:43,262
I too, warned Jiro about his actions.

152
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,762
That's when he said...

153
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,362
Dissolve being a pair?

154
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:51,762
Yeah, with Asako the way she is, we can't possibly continue, right?

155
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:54,862
I've had enough of being held back by her!

156
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,162
After all Asako did for you,

157
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:59,462
how could you talk like that?

158
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,762
That's a totally different story.

159
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:06,062
After dissolving being a pair, just what do you intend to do?

160
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:09,762
With my looks I could probably stand alone, don't you think?

161
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:13,662
At any rate, it's better if our ages are not so close.

162
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,962
You...

163
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:20,062
Regardless, I don't want to do comedy with Asako anymore!

164
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:22,262
Her time's up already, time to withdraw!

165
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:25,662
Mr. Hisamatsu, tell her that she should think about retiring too!

166
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,662
Won't you?

167
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:32,362
The one that helped him to get where he is now is Asako.

168
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:36,962
Why did Jiro have so many rubber masks?

169
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:40,162
Yeah, it seems he was thinking of doing

170
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:43,162
a one-man comedy using rubber masks.

171
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,862
One-man comedy?

172
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:48,862
Do comedy while changing masks one after the other.

173
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,762
He showed me a bit of it,

174
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,062
but it wasn't anything you could laugh at

175
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,662
even as a flattering remark.

176
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:55,762
Inspector!

177
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:58,862
The person the victim called has been identified!

178
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:00,262
A locksmith!

179
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:02,162
You mean like the one who helps you

180
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,562
get the door open when you lose your key or something?

181
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:08,662
Yes. But according to them,

182
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:11,262
the call was dropped soon after they answered.

183
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:14,162
They thought it was a wrong number.

184
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:18,462
I heard from the resident who lives on the 2nd floor here,

185
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:22,862
just when the weather forecast was aired at around 6:50 pm,

186
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:26,862
the resident witness a man climbing up the veranda to her room.

187
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,162
No mistake about it?

188
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,062
No, because the witness said

189
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:34,362
he had seen the victim and Asako practicing in the park many times.

190
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,062
So, no mistake about it.

191
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,262
You mean he wasn't wearing the zombie mask at that time?

192
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:41,362
What? Yes.

193
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:44,762
Which means he put the mask on after he got to the veranda.

194
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,862
A piece of glass?

195
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,362
What's up?

196
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:02,262
Hey!

197
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,962
Kids stay in the corner and stay put!

198
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:09,262
Hey, there's something on the hem of Jiro's pants!

199
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,562
What?

200
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,662
It's cocklebur, isn't it?

201
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:16,362
That stuff can get stuck anywhere, can't it?

202
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,862
It hurts.

203
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:22,462
Asako, did you go out somewhere today?

204
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:26,362
No, I was in the room all day today.

205
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:27,562
But...

206
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:33,062
Inspector! Regarding the truth of this case,

207
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:34,962
I, the famed Kogoro Mouri,

208
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,962
has figured it out!

209
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,968
"Strawberries taste of love" -As his popularity grew,

210
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:55,168
people started pampering him and Asako was in the way.

211
00:12:55,168 --> 00:13:00,268
But, if he conspicuously parts with her, it may ruin his reputation.

212
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:03,068
Therefore, he came up with an idea.

213
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,368
An idea?

214
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:08,468
Asako was being stalked by a man called Numata.

215
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,368
Jiro took advantage of this.

216
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,968
He would break in pretending to be Numata

217
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,868
and shock Asako out of her wits.

218
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:21,168
It would certainly affect her heart, forcing her to resign!

219
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,268
What?

220
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,668
Jiro would never do something like that!

221
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:29,268
But, if you think of it that way, everything falls into place.

222
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,268
The reason Jiro put on a zombie mask

223
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:36,068
and armed himself with a model gun, cracking the window to break in here!

224
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:39,968
It was all so that he could cut ties with you!

225
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,468
It can't be...

226
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:43,868
However, Asako who resisted,

227
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,768
stabbed him with the knife she was holding.

228
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,568
Inspector.

229
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:51,168
It would be more accurate to say, that the knife poked into him.

230
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,968
Asako had no idea that the attacker was Jiro.

231
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,868
That's why she resisted.

232
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,668
No matter how you look at it, this is a case of self-defense.

233
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,368
I see.

234
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:05,968
Pops's deduction is logical and thinkable.

235
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,268
But...

236
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,668
Just as I thought.

237
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,068
He called the locksmith at 6:45 pm,

238
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:22,268
and was witnessed climbing up the veranda at 6:50 pm.

239
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,168
Judging from the time known,

240
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:27,168
he must've called from around here.

241
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,368
Found it!

242
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,568
This cocklebur is what was on Jiro's pants.

243
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:35,368
This grassy area is so stepped on all over.

244
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:38,668
Was somebody looking for something in the grass?

245
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,568
I get it!

246
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:43,168
So, that's what it was!

247
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:47,168
Asako, I'm sorry about this unfortunate case,

248
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,668
but please come to the station for statement details on the incident.

249
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,368
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:55,168
Conan. Where were you?

251
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,568
Somewhere.

252
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:00,168
There...

253
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:07,968
-Just as I thought. -What is it?

254
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:10,268
Really greedy when it comes to food.

255
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:15,468
Cold enough to make your teeth sting, that's what's so good.

256
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,768
-Shall we go, then? -Yes, sir.

257
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,268
Inspector!

258
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:30,668
Will hear me out a bit longer?

259
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,968
You mean there's something more?

260
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:36,268
The thing I said a while ago was the exterior scenario.

261
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,368
The true scenario is hidden behind.

262
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,568
The scenario behind?

263
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:46,368
Yes. The scenario that goes

264
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:49,268
Asako feigns killing Jiro in self-defense.

265
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,868
That scenario!

266
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:54,868
-What? -What're you talking about?

267
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:58,668
Asako, a man named Keisuke Numata

268
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:01,168
doesn't exist in this world, does he?

269
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,168
He does!

270
00:16:03,168 --> 00:16:05,668
I showed you his picture, didn't I?

271
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:09,668
All you had to do was pull out some old pictures,

272
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,768
that would do the trick anytime.

273
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:16,468
You made up a make-believe character named Numata,

274
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,668
and showed me how terrified you were.

275
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,268
You led me to think that you mistook Jiro,

276
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,768
the masked zombie, for Numata.

277
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:26,768
You made up a scenario of the knife mistakenly as a self-defense

278
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:29,268
and had me deduce it, likewise.

279
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,168
That's enough!

280
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:34,168
To begin with, if Jiro didn't wearing that zombie mask

281
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,968
and break into this room,

282
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:38,468
this wouldn't have happened!

283
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:41,868
You're the one who set it up to be this way, is it not?

284
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,968
Asako, at sundown around 6:00 pm

285
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:48,568
you met Jiro in the park, didn't you?

286
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:52,268
No. I was here preparing dinner.

287
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:55,568
You said you were making fruit punch.

288
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:59,268
-Ran, taste it, will you? -What?

289
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,168
You're good at cooking, right?

290
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,568
So taste it and let me know what you think.

291
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:04,668
Okay.

292
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:12,268
How about it?

293
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,968
It's a bit too sweet and maybe a bit too cold.

294
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,668
I'm sure she had it in the refrigerator

295
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:20,668
with the contents soaked in syrup.

296
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:21,668
But, this...

297
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:25,468
Right, if she made that just before the incident occurred,

298
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,168
she wouldn't have had to make it that sweet,

299
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,868
nor would it have been that cold.

300
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,468
In other words,

301
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,768
Asako made it part way and put it in the refrigerator.

302
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:38,568
And then, went to the park to meet Jiro.

303
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,868
How can you be so sure?

304
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:42,368
Cocklebur.

305
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:45,468
It can be found on the hem of Jiro's pants.

306
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:51,468
It's a plant that is rarely seen in Tokyo recently,

307
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:55,968
but there are some growing in that park over there.

308
00:17:55,968 --> 00:18:00,268
And on Asako's sneakers at the front door,

309
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,168
cockleburs are also attached.

310
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,668
You lied to Jiro at the park

311
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,668
saying that you dropped your room key.

312
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,268
The cocklebur stuck onto you when you were looking

313
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:13,868
for the key together in the grass, right?

314
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,668
Jiro called the locksmith

315
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:20,568
in order to have him open the door.

316
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:23,668
But, since they were lovers,

317
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:26,368
Jiro also had the key to this room.

318
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,268
Just the other day, I told her to change the lock

319
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,568
to cope with the stalker problem.

320
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,268
This was also a part of Asako's plan.

321
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:38,768
She probably hadn't given the spare key to Jiro yet.

322
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:41,968
And you went on to finish your plan.

323
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:44,468
What's wrong?

324
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:46,268
An attack? Where's your medicine?

325
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:49,168
I think, I forgot it in the room.

326
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:52,068
The locksmith's not going to make it here in time!

327
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:54,568
Jiro... Please...

328
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:58,868
The window of the veranda isn't locked,

329
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:01,168
so can you go up the scaffold used for construction.

330
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:03,468
Really, what a nuisance!

331
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:09,068
While Jiro was using the scaffold used for construction and climbing,

332
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:11,968
you beat him to the room by using the elevator

333
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:15,368
and with the key that you hidden and went into the room.

334
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:26,168
Asako. Why?

335
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:32,068
And after you killed Jiro,

336
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:34,968
you took the hamburger and fruit punch that you half made

337
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:38,668
out of the refrigerator.

338
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:40,668
Even if that were to be true,

339
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:42,768
we don't have enough proof.

340
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:45,968
The bruise on Asako's left hand.

341
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:49,668
If you grab left arm of a person you're confronting with your left hand,

342
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:54,168
the mark of the thumb should be left on the outside of the arm, but...

343
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:57,068
The direction of the bruise is opposite!

344
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:01,468
She bruised by grabbing herself firmly with her right hand.

345
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,868
The other is the zombie mask.

346
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,868
Please take a good look at it.

347
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:10,068
There are little pieces of shattered glass on the inside.

348
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:11,968
What?

349
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,568
It's true!

350
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:17,568
If Jiro broke into the room wearing the zombie mask,

351
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:21,368
glass pieces wouldn't have been found on the inside of the mask.

352
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,468
In other words, after she killed Jiro,

353
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,668
she cracked the glass herself

354
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:32,068
and made him wear the zombie mask after that.

355
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:35,668
And the only one who could've done that is Asako.

356
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,668
You're the only one who could've done that!

357
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,168
Asako.

358
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:45,068
I couldn't forgive Jiro.

359
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:47,968
What you said a while ago, Mr. Hisamatsu,

360
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:51,868
-I heard about it too. -What?

361
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:55,468
After you left the room, Jiro...

362
00:20:55,468 --> 00:21:00,868
Our long days as lovers have already ended!

363
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:04,968
I'm making a new start!

364
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:13,668
We worked so hard together.

365
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:17,468
All our hard times just started to fruit and yet,

366
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:20,668
Jiro drank the sweet juice of that fruit alone

367
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:22,668
and was about to leave me!

368
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:24,868
I just couldn't forgive him.

369
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:56,568
Asako, this just arrived.

370
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:57,868
It's for you.

371
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:09,168
Are you having a good time at your birthday party?

372
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,468
-Happy Birthday. -Happy Birthday.

373
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:13,668
-Here's a gift for you. -Here's a gift for you, a ring.

374
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:17,368
Let's end our comedy pair relationship and going with each other.

375
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:20,368
Please marry me.

376
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:23,768
It's hard for me to tell you to quit being a comedian

377
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:25,668
but take care of your body,

378
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:28,968
and start a new life with me.

379
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:34,868
Strawberry will always live on in both our hearts.

380
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,568
This...

381
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,268
This can't be...

382
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:45,068
Jiro! I'm sorry, Jiro!

383
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:49,168
Jiro!

384
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:52,668
I'm sorry!

385
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:56,268
At times the hearts of people go separate ways

386
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,868
and give birth to irreplaceable mistakes.

387
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:05,168
This case was one of those sad cases.

388
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,068
I wonder if she got to tell him what she wanted to?

389
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,268
That she likes him.

390
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:14,968
What? Why?

391
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:16,868
"Not being able to leave him alone",

392
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,268
I think it is the same as you like him.

393
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:28,068
The person was here until just a while ago.

394
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:31,568
The one who killed him.

395
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,168
Next Conan,

396
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:36,809
"Ms. Kobayashi's Love Affair"

397
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,946
Next Conan's Hint:

398
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:56,246
"Pickup Truck"
