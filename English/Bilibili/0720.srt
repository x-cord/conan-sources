1
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.140
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

2
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

3
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.940
The stage of this episode is at Aso in Kumamoto, the Land of Fire.

4
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.840
Search for the secret data.

5
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:30.047
"Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Aso Edition)"

9
00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:31.647
"Kumamoto Station"

10
00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.647
Accompanied by Ran and Pops Kogoro,

11
00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:36.347
we, the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

12
00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:39.147
came on a sightseeing tour to Kumamoto.

13
00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:44.147
Kumamoto is blessed by a rich water source

14
00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.847
and is Japan's number one clear underground water city.

15
00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:47.247
"Kumamoto Shintoshin Plaza"

16
00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:48.447
What a surprise

17
00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:51.947
that mineral water comes out from an ordinary faucet.

18
00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:56.147
-It's delicious. -Yeah!

19
00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.147
But Kumamoto is known after all for...

20
00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:04.947
Red bull steak and rare horse meat,

21
00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:07.047
and spicy lotus root!

22
00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:09.347
They go deliciously well with Kuma Shochu.

23
00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:11.947
Drinking it in one gulp.

24
00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:14.247
No, I wasn't referring to food.

25
00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:18.247
I would like a healthy Taipien.

26
00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:23.047
When it comes to Kumamoto...

27
00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:25.247
Look! Conan!

28
00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.847
It's Mt. Aso!

29
00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:31.547
Right. As well as being the city of water,

30
00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:33.647
Kumamoto is known as the land of fire.

31
00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.847
"Aso Volcano Museum" -Before going to see the crater,

32
00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:39.047
let's study about the volcano here.

33
00:03:39.047 --> 00:03:40.747
What?

34
00:03:44.147 --> 00:03:46.047
Fantastic!

35
00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:49.647
Well, Genta's the most delighted here.

36
00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.047
Mt. Aso is in fact what most people call it by,

37
00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.947
but it is actually composed of 5 mountains:

38
00:03:53.947 --> 00:03:55.347
Takadake,

39
00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:56.947
Nakadake,

40
00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:58.747
Nekodake,

41
00:03:58.747 --> 00:04:00.547
Eboshidake,

42
00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:02.147
Kishimadake,

43
00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:06.047
and it is formally called "Aso Gogaku".

44
00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:09.347
The place where the volcanic crater we're headed for now

45
00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:11.147
is Nakadake, right?

46
00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:18.247
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:20.047
Are you okay, sonny?

48
00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:21.747
Yep, I'm fine.

49
00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:24.547
Besides, don't call me sonny.

50
00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:25.947
I'm Justin.

51
00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:28.347
Justin Takamori.

52
00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:30.647
Justin?

53
00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.347
Cute.

54
00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.447
Yeah, a lot of people tell me that.

55
00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:39.147
But you're cuter than me, miss.

56
00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:41.247
Huh?

57
00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:43.547
That smile, that wink...

58
00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:47.547
He knows that doing that would make any lady fall for him.

59
00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:50.547
A rival appears.

60
00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:53.747
But you're number 2, miss.

61
00:04:53.747 --> 00:04:55.647
Then, who's number 1?

62
00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:58.047
Of course, it's mommy!

63
00:04:58.047 --> 00:04:59.447
Justin!

64
00:04:59.447 --> 00:05:03.147
I told you not to go off on your own, didn't I?

65
00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:07.747
I'm sorry, mommy.

66
00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:12.247
Right! I'll show you guys something good.

67
00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:13.847
Something good?

68
00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:19.547
Wow, super!

69
00:05:19.547 --> 00:05:22.147
You sure collected a lot of stamps.

70
00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:24.647
You can say that again!

71
00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:26.647
He's still a kid doing stuff like that.

72
00:05:26.647 --> 00:05:29.647
Gosh. What an obnoxious brat.

73
00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:31.047
Did you say something?

74
00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:32.547
Not really.

75
00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:34.047
You're the brat.

76
00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:37.147
My, he sure is a cute little child.

77
00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:39.047
Thank you.

78
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.547
Forgive me for forgetting to introduce myself.

79
00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:43.647
I'm a detective, you see.

80
00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:47.347
My name card...

81
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.547
Huh?

82
00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:51.747
My shiny name card... Where is it?

83
00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:54.147
Let's get going, shall we, Justin?

84
00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.147
Say bye to your friends.

85
00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:58.447
Okay, mommy.

86
00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:00.147
See you.

87
00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:07.047
Found it! This is who I am...

88
00:06:07.047 --> 00:06:10.747
Huh?

89
00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:13.647
What're you doing, Dad? We're going.

90
00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:14.647
Okay.

91
00:06:14.647 --> 00:06:16.847
"Aso Ropeway Station" -Next, we're finally

92
00:06:16.847 --> 00:06:18.547
going to the crater!

93
00:06:33.147 --> 00:06:34.747
This is something!

94
00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.947
It's really impressive!

95
00:06:43.447 --> 00:06:47.047
We don't get to see this crater at all times, you know.

96
00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:48.847
We're lucky.

97
00:06:48.847 --> 00:06:50.447
Huh? Why?

98
00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:54.147
It's because Nakadake here is an active volcano.

99
00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:57.247
It emits poisonous gas sometimes,

100
00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:00.847
so there are times when this place is off limits.

101
00:07:00.847 --> 00:07:02.047
True.

102
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.347
It was worth coming, being that we got to see this!

103
00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:10.247
"Aso Cuddly Dominion" -There are many animals here!

104
00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:12.247
-Let's go! -Yeah!

105
00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:16.247
It's a stuffed Kumamon doll!

106
00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:18.247
May I go take a look?

107
00:07:18.247 --> 00:07:21.647
But if we buy things first, we're going to have to carry them

108
00:07:21.647 --> 00:07:22.947
so let's take a look on our way back.

109
00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:24.847
I see.

110
00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:26.247
Okay!

111
00:07:26.247 --> 00:07:28.947
Mr. Bear...

112
00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:32.447
So she says, but she'll probably forget to buy it anyway.

113
00:07:36.547 --> 00:07:38.747
Look, look!

114
00:07:38.747 --> 00:07:41.347
It's begging for food!

115
00:07:48.647 --> 00:07:50.147
Go! Hurry up!

116
00:08:32.747 --> 00:08:35.247
Boy did I eat!

117
00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.647
He can really eat, can't he?

118
00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:40.547
Huh?

119
00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:47.647
The man just left Kumamon behind

120
00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:49.447
and took the bag with him.

121
00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:53.547
Okay! Nab him as soon as the crowd subsides!

122
00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:55.747
-Be really careful... -Please wait!

123
00:08:55.747 --> 00:08:57.547
-There's a child. -What?

124
00:08:57.547 --> 00:09:00.047
Sir!

125
00:09:00.047 --> 00:09:02.047
This is yours, isn't it, sir?

126
00:09:02.047 --> 00:09:03.847
Darn it!

127
00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:05.547
Hold it!

128
00:09:11.747 --> 00:09:13.147
Ayumi!

129
00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:20.147
I'm not letting you get away!

130
00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:31.247
Precocious brat?

131
00:09:31.247 --> 00:09:33.247
Outta the way!

132
00:09:33.247 --> 00:09:34.247
Watch out!

133
00:09:34.247 --> 00:09:35.747
Mommy!

134
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.947
Justin...

135
00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:46.247
Hold it!

136
00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:56.247
Hey, are you okay?

137
00:09:56.247 --> 00:09:57.947
It's you again?

138
00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:01.747
Justin, did you hurt yourself?

139
00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:03.247
I'm fine!

140
00:10:03.247 --> 00:10:05.147
The ground being grassy saved me.

141
00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:07.247
What a relief.

142
00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.347
Where's my Kumamon?

143
00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:16.547
Without it, my company is...

144
00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:19.447
My company is finished.

145
00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:20.847
What on earth happened?

146
00:10:20.847 --> 00:10:22.447
I wonder.

147
00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:24.547
There! Now, you're okay!

148
00:10:24.547 --> 00:10:25.847
Yep.

149
00:10:25.847 --> 00:10:28.047
What on earth should I do?

150
00:10:28.047 --> 00:10:30.947
I'll have to get it back, or else...

151
00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:33.647
What on earth is going on?

152
00:10:33.647 --> 00:10:36.447
Are you that child's guardian?

153
00:10:36.447 --> 00:10:38.847
Yes, I guess you could say so.

154
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:43.547
Let me introduce myself. This is my business card.

155
00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:45.647
Kogoro Mouri.

156
00:10:45.647 --> 00:10:48.847
You mean you're that great detective.

157
00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:49.947
The way I see it,

158
00:10:49.947 --> 00:10:53.347
it seems that we've interfered with your investigation.

159
00:10:53.347 --> 00:10:57.747
If it's okay with you, won't you tell me what happened?

160
00:11:08.114 --> 00:11:10.314
The thing is 2 days ago,

161
00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:14.714
my company Kumamon Foods was burglarized.

162
00:11:14.714 --> 00:11:16.514
Kumamon Foods?

163
00:11:16.514 --> 00:11:18.314
Kumamon...

164
00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:23.814
I'm Monkichi Kumada, "Kumamon" in short.

165
00:11:23.814 --> 00:11:27.114
I've been called by this nickname ever since I was a kid!

166
00:11:27.114 --> 00:11:30.814
I see. So, you're the original "Kumamon".

167
00:11:32.714 --> 00:11:34.214
President, did you call for me?

168
00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:36.114
You're late, Inoue!

169
00:11:36.114 --> 00:11:37.414
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:37.414 --> 00:11:40.114
But why are the police here?

171
00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:41.714
I called them!

172
00:11:41.714 --> 00:11:44.014
Never mind that. Just explain to him

173
00:11:44.014 --> 00:11:47.514
the circumstances of when the burglar broke in.

174
00:11:47.514 --> 00:11:50.514
Yes, sir. When I arrived at the office in the morning,

175
00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:52.714
I found that the lock of the door had been broken.

176
00:11:52.714 --> 00:11:55.514
So, I rushed to check out the office,

177
00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:57.714
but it didn't look particularly messed up or anything.

178
00:11:57.714 --> 00:11:59.614
So I was sort of relieved.

179
00:11:59.614 --> 00:12:03.814
But my stuffed doll Kumamon was missing.

180
00:12:03.814 --> 00:12:07.114
Kumamon's Kumamon.

181
00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:08.714
Not only that,

182
00:12:08.714 --> 00:12:12.514
but I had this bad premonition, so I looked inside the desk,

183
00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.514
and found that the memory stick with

184
00:12:14.514 --> 00:12:18.414
confidential information of the company inside it was gone.

185
00:12:18.414 --> 00:12:20.914
The data was of a completely new candy

186
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:22.714
that our company originally developed,

187
00:12:22.714 --> 00:12:25.514
having a new sensation and new taste.

188
00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:28.314
It was still pending patent.

189
00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.514
A small and minor business like ours

190
00:12:30.514 --> 00:12:32.614
have to keep on making new items,

191
00:12:32.614 --> 00:12:35.414
and make ends meet by attaining patents for them.

192
00:12:35.414 --> 00:12:39.314
But if that development data is stolen by another company...

193
00:12:39.314 --> 00:12:43.014
like Higo Foods, a major company in this business,

194
00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:45.514
we're finished!

195
00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:47.514
And anything from the culprit?

196
00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:48.914
Yeah.

197
00:12:48.914 --> 00:12:52.214
The following day, we got a call from the culprit.

198
00:12:53.214 --> 00:12:56.114
I want you to buy the USB memory stick

199
00:12:56.114 --> 00:12:58.514
with vital data in it for 10,000,000 yen.

200
00:12:58.514 --> 00:13:00.214
If you report this to the police,

201
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:03.014
the negotiation is off, understand?

202
00:13:03.914 --> 00:13:06.814
And today was that day of the deal, right?

203
00:13:06.814 --> 00:13:11.314
Yes. The culprit told us that he would put the USB memory stick

204
00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:13.714
with confidential data in it inside the Kumamon doll

205
00:13:13.714 --> 00:13:17.414
and exchange it for the bag with 10,000,000 yen in it.

206
00:13:17.414 --> 00:13:20.614
Why did the culprit do something so roundabout?

207
00:13:20.614 --> 00:13:23.614
He probably just wanted to spite me.

208
00:13:23.614 --> 00:13:25.514
What shall we do, president?

209
00:13:25.514 --> 00:13:28.614
The culprit said that if we report this to the police,

210
00:13:28.614 --> 00:13:30.214
the deal is off, right?

211
00:13:30.214 --> 00:13:31.414
Shut up!

212
00:13:31.414 --> 00:13:34.814
The police said that they'll nab the culprit at all cost!

213
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.614
And yet, they...

214
00:13:41.314 --> 00:13:42.514
Koda here!

215
00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:44.414
I nabbed the man that fled!

216
00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:46.514
I confiscated the stuffed doll!

217
00:13:46.514 --> 00:13:49.314
I see! Good work!

218
00:13:49.314 --> 00:13:50.814
You look pale.

219
00:13:50.814 --> 00:13:52.314
Does your wound still hurt?

220
00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:53.914
Wound?

221
00:13:53.914 --> 00:13:57.514
Detective Koda was stabbed by a robber and hospitalized.

222
00:13:57.514 --> 00:13:59.814
He was just discharged yesterday.

223
00:13:59.814 --> 00:14:02.314
No, it's not that.

224
00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:05.914
The fact is there was no USB memory stick

225
00:14:05.914 --> 00:14:08.914
inside the doll that the man had.

226
00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:11.414
-What? -That's ridiculous!

227
00:14:11.414 --> 00:14:13.514
Doesn't that man have it on him?

228
00:14:13.514 --> 00:14:15.514
No, he didn't have it.

229
00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:16.714
Besides, the man says that

230
00:14:16.714 --> 00:14:18.914
he was asked by a man that he happened to meet at a bar to go

231
00:14:18.914 --> 00:14:22.914
and exchange the doll for the bag,

232
00:14:22.914 --> 00:14:25.014
and insists that he knows nothing at all.

233
00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:28.014
Then, he saw what the culprit looked like, didn't he?

234
00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:30.914
The thing is, he says the man was wearing sunglasses and a mask

235
00:14:30.914 --> 00:14:32.514
so he didn't see his face.

236
00:14:32.514 --> 00:14:35.214
-Darn it! -Could it be that the culprit was planning

237
00:14:35.214 --> 00:14:37.814
to just get hold of the 10,000,000 yen to begin with,

238
00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:41.314
without putting the USB memory stick inside the doll?

239
00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:44.514
Officer.

240
00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:46.414
When the man fled,

241
00:14:46.414 --> 00:14:48.714
he bumped into a little child, didn't he?

242
00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:51.914
Yeah, a cute American-Japanese boy.

243
00:14:51.914 --> 00:14:56.014
He also had the same kind of Kumamon doll.

244
00:14:56.014 --> 00:14:57.014
What?

245
00:14:57.014 --> 00:14:59.514
So, maybe the dolls switched

246
00:14:59.514 --> 00:15:02.314
when they bumped into each other, no?

247
00:15:02.314 --> 00:15:04.214
-Is that true? -Yes, sir.

248
00:15:04.214 --> 00:15:08.214
It's true that there was a non-Japanese mother and son.

249
00:15:08.214 --> 00:15:11.414
Okay! Go look for them on the double!

250
00:15:11.414 --> 00:15:14.914
But we don't have a clue as to where to look for them.

251
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.114
In fact, we know that boy.

252
00:15:18.114 --> 00:15:20.014
-What? -It's Justin.

253
00:15:20.014 --> 00:15:22.214
Then, do you know where they went?

254
00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:25.114
Nope, I don't.

255
00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:28.414
But Justin had a stamp book.

256
00:15:28.414 --> 00:15:30.414
So, I think they headed for a place

257
00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:32.114
where he could collect more stamps.

258
00:15:32.114 --> 00:15:34.514
But there are many sightseeing places around here

259
00:15:34.514 --> 00:15:37.814
that will give you stamps, you know.

260
00:15:37.814 --> 00:15:40.414
Yep, but...

261
00:15:40.414 --> 00:15:45.114
he showed us his stamp book at the Aso Volcano Museum.

262
00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:46.814
At that time, he already had the stamp

263
00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:52.114
for Aso ropeway and Aso farmland

264
00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:54.314
so I guess those two places can be excluded.

265
00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:55.614
I see.

266
00:15:55.614 --> 00:16:00.114
Excluding those places, the sightseeing place nearest here,

267
00:16:00.114 --> 00:16:02.914
I think would be Aso Shrine.

268
00:16:02.914 --> 00:16:05.814
Do they give stamps there?

269
00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:08.914
Yes, they do. But how amazing.

270
00:16:08.914 --> 00:16:11.714
You have fantastic observation skills and a great memory!

271
00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:14.214
I guess so!

272
00:16:14.214 --> 00:16:16.714
Okay! Take that child along with you

273
00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:18.314
and head for Aso Shrine.

274
00:16:18.314 --> 00:16:20.214
I'll head for Kumamon Foods

275
00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:22.314
with President Kumada and the others.

276
00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.214
Because the culprit may call.

277
00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:26.214
Yes, sir!

278
00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.514
And?

279
00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:33.914
Why...

280
00:16:33.914 --> 00:16:35.514
Does it have to turn out this way?

281
00:16:35.514 --> 00:16:39.414
I want to find Justin no matter what!

282
00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:42.614
Because I'm the one who got him involved.

283
00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:44.514
It's not your fault, Ayumi.

284
00:16:44.514 --> 00:16:46.514
Right! Don't worry about it.

285
00:16:46.514 --> 00:16:48.014
We've got to do our thing here,

286
00:16:48.014 --> 00:16:51.514
or we'll blemish the name of the Youth Detective Squad!

287
00:16:51.514 --> 00:16:52.914
Yep.

288
00:16:52.914 --> 00:16:55.714
I'll take responsibility for them!

289
00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.814
Please rush over to Aso Shrine!

290
00:16:57.814 --> 00:16:59.414
All right!

291
00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:06.414
"Aso Shrine"

292
00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:14.114
A non-Japanese mother and son?

293
00:17:14.114 --> 00:17:16.714
Yeah, I did see them.

294
00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:18.114
Really, sir?

295
00:17:18.114 --> 00:17:22.814
Yeah. About an hour ago, he stamped his book here.

296
00:17:22.814 --> 00:17:25.014
No doubt about it. It's Justin.

297
00:17:25.014 --> 00:17:26.714
-Yep! -But...

298
00:17:26.714 --> 00:17:29.914
did they say where they were headed for next?

299
00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:31.914
If I remember correctly,

300
00:17:31.914 --> 00:17:33.314
I think he said something about

301
00:17:33.314 --> 00:17:37.714
a place where "A big pig is lying asleep..."

302
00:17:37.714 --> 00:17:42.014
What? A big pig is lying asleep?

303
00:17:42.014 --> 00:17:45.214
There's a big black pig at Aso Milk Farm!

304
00:17:45.214 --> 00:17:47.714
It's always sleeping, too.

305
00:17:47.714 --> 00:17:50.014
-That's got to be it! -But...

306
00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:52.214
Take a look at this, will you?

307
00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:56.714
When tracing Justin's path up to now,

308
00:17:56.714 --> 00:17:58.514
he visited Aso Volcano Museum,

309
00:17:58.514 --> 00:18:01.314
Cuddly Dominion and Aso Shrine.

310
00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:04.014
He's headed north.

311
00:18:04.014 --> 00:18:07.814
But Aso Milk Farm is in the southwest direction, right?

312
00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:10.414
True. It's true that it's in the opposite direction

313
00:18:10.414 --> 00:18:11.614
when you look at the map.

314
00:18:11.614 --> 00:18:17.114
Besides, the Aso Milk Farm is only open till 16:00.

315
00:18:17.114 --> 00:18:19.214
What time is it now, Ran?

316
00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:22.314
Huh? 15:40.

317
00:18:22.314 --> 00:18:24.714
It's pretty far from here

318
00:18:24.714 --> 00:18:27.314
and even if they were to have left about an hour ago,

319
00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:30.614
I don't think that they could've made it there before closing time.

320
00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:33.314
Either way, it'll be closed for sure

321
00:18:33.314 --> 00:18:35.014
by the time we get there.

322
00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:38.714
If they're headed north, there's the El Patio Farm.

323
00:18:38.714 --> 00:18:41.714
I'm sure that there were no pigs there, though.

324
00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:46.314
Other than that, major tourists sites to the north

325
00:18:46.314 --> 00:18:50.614
are the Kuninomiyatsuko Shrine and Mt. Daikanbo.

326
00:18:50.614 --> 00:18:53.114
Mt. Daikanbo?

327
00:18:53.114 --> 00:18:54.314
I see!

328
00:18:54.314 --> 00:18:56.814
Justin didn't say "A big pig",

329
00:18:56.814 --> 00:18:59.214
but rather, "A big Buddha"!

330
00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:01.214
What's a Buddha?

331
00:19:01.214 --> 00:19:04.614
It's a deity. It's called Buddha in English.

332
00:19:04.614 --> 00:19:07.714
Justin's mother is non-Japanese,

333
00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:10.314
so I'm sure that's what he was taught to call it.

334
00:19:10.314 --> 00:19:13.314
A big Buddha is lying asleep...

335
00:19:13.314 --> 00:19:14.614
That's...

336
00:19:14.614 --> 00:19:16.714
It's the landscape of Aso that looks to be the dying Buddha

337
00:19:16.714 --> 00:19:19.114
attaining Nirvana that can be seen from Mt. Daikanbo.

338
00:19:23.014 --> 00:19:26.114
Mr. Kosugi! We've figured out where the child is!

339
00:19:26.114 --> 00:19:27.314
It's Mt. Daikanbo.

340
00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:30.414
No, he's just saying that

341
00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:32.614
and it's not definite yet.

342
00:19:32.614 --> 00:19:35.914
If he says so, I think there's no doubt about it.

343
00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:41.614
"Mt. Daikanbo"

344
00:19:46.014 --> 00:19:47.814
True!

345
00:19:47.814 --> 00:19:50.114
It looks like Buddha is lying asleep!

346
00:19:51.414 --> 00:19:54.214
We've got to hurry and go find Justin.

347
00:19:54.214 --> 00:19:56.514
Yeah.

348
00:19:56.514 --> 00:19:58.714
No! Don't!

349
00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:01.014
This is Justin's!

350
00:20:01.014 --> 00:20:03.714
Just what're you doing to mommy?

351
00:20:03.714 --> 00:20:05.814
Give it back to me!

352
00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:07.314
Hold it!

353
00:20:09.314 --> 00:20:11.914
Let go of me! What do you think you're doing?

354
00:20:14.514 --> 00:20:16.114
Watch out!

355
00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:32.014
-Kajiyama! -Mr. Kosugi!

356
00:20:32.014 --> 00:20:33.914
Please go after that car that just went by!

357
00:20:35.514 --> 00:20:38.214
The child was kidnapped by the culprit!

358
00:20:38.214 --> 00:20:39.714
What?

359
00:20:57.314 --> 00:21:00.914
The culprit's planning to flee into Kumamoto City.

360
00:21:04.914 --> 00:21:06.814
Kosugi here!

361
00:21:06.814 --> 00:21:09.614
This is Inoue from Kumamon Foods!

362
00:21:09.614 --> 00:21:11.814
I just got a call from the culprit!

363
00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:12.814
What?

364
00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:17.214
"Don't come after me, or the child is dead!"

365
00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:20.014
Darn it.

366
00:21:20.014 --> 00:21:22.514
Kajiyama, stop pursuit!

367
00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.214
Huh? But...

368
00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:26.414
They seem to have gotten a call from the culprit

369
00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:29.414
saying that the child will die otherwise.

370
00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:31.914
Okay.

371
00:21:31.914 --> 00:21:36.414
Justin! He tried to help me...

372
00:21:36.414 --> 00:21:39.514
Don't worry. I'm sure he's okay.

373
00:21:42.014 --> 00:21:43.514
Strange.

374
00:21:43.514 --> 00:21:45.114
How on earth did the culprit know

375
00:21:45.114 --> 00:21:48.314
that Justin was at Mt. Daikanbo?

376
00:21:48.314 --> 00:21:51.914
Rather, how did the culprit know that the USB memory stick

377
00:21:51.914 --> 00:21:55.814
was inside the doll that Justin was holding to begin with?

378
00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.614
We found out that there'd been a switch

379
00:21:57.614 --> 00:22:00.314
only after the man who fled got caught.

380
00:22:00.314 --> 00:22:03.214
The ones that knew about this were us,

381
00:22:03.214 --> 00:22:05.514
the officers of the Kumamoto Prefectural, Police-Officer Kosugi,

382
00:22:05.514 --> 00:22:07.614
Officer Kajiyama,

383
00:22:07.614 --> 00:22:10.814
Mr. Kumada of Kumamon Foods and Mr. Inoue.

384
00:22:10.814 --> 00:22:14.214
But when the culprit kidnapped Justin,

385
00:22:14.214 --> 00:22:16.714
Mr. Kumada and Inoue were at the company.

386
00:22:16.714 --> 00:22:19.714
We were at the site of the crime, and we all have alibis.

387
00:22:21.314 --> 00:22:23.514
Which means...

388
00:22:23.514 --> 00:22:27.214
Is there an accomplice to the culprit among the people here?

389
00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:32.314
And who on earth is the culprit?

390
00:23:54.114 --> 00:23:56.414
"Next Episode" -A child was kidnapped?

391
00:23:56.414 --> 00:23:59.414
What are the police doing?

392
00:23:59.414 --> 00:24:01.614
Where are we going now?

393
00:24:01.614 --> 00:24:03.314
Shut up and come with me!

394
00:24:03.314 --> 00:24:05.914
I found it!

395
00:24:05.914 --> 00:24:07.614
Intruder!

396
00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.214
He's doing it on purpose.

397
00:24:10.214 --> 00:24:13.414
To let us know where he is.

398
00:24:13.414 --> 00:24:15.514
He's pretty smart.

399
00:24:15.514 --> 00:24:18.514
I'm sure that they'll figure it out.

400
00:24:18.514 --> 00:24:19.814
