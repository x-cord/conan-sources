1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.440
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.140
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.740
The case where a detective is the victim.

5
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.840
Shinichi solves the case sharply.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.290
We come to this villa on an overnight trip

10
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.490
and meet Kazuyoshi Sunaoka

11
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190
who plays a famous detective

12
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.890
in the popular TV series "Urban Hunter"

13
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.690
and other staff members working on the series.

14
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.190
But behind the scenes of the show,

15
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.690
relations between these people are very hostile.

16
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.190
The window in Kazu's room...

17
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.390
And then with a single gunshot,

18
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.590
Mr. Sunaoka is killed by an unknown assailant!

19
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.290
After firing from the rocks across the valley,

20
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.290
the killer climbed down the rope

21
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.890
and used a boat to escape,

22
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.990
that's what was believed.

23
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.590
It takes 30 minutes to get to the other side,

24
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.890
so no one from the villa

25
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.490
could have possibly committed the crime.

26
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.690
But the killer is one of those three.

27
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.690
I know I'm right.

28
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.090
"Murder of the Famous Detective (Part 2)"

29
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.290
Yes, Mr. Sunaoka's killer...

30
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.390
I believe he went down to the stream and escaped.

31
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.790
I've just issued an all points bulletin and we are searching,

32
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.490
but I must ask all of you once more

33
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.890
to go over the details of what happened.

34
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.890
In the morning,

35
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.490
I was in Mr. Tahara's room going over the scenarios.

36
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.790
Then in the afternoon,

37
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.590
I went to the hunting in the woods with Mr. Sunaoka.

38
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.890
We got back at about 6:30 pm,

39
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.290
then joined everyone for dinner right after that.

40
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.890
After talking with Mr. Nagatsuka,

41
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.290
I stayed in my room until the evening writing.

42
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.290
Mr. Sunaoka called me to his room in the morning

43
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.190
and he told me about switching agencies,

44
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.090
we had a little argument.

45
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390
I see. An argument, you say?

46
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.190
Yes.

47
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.490
I was on the archery grounds in the afternoon.

48
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.890
I ran into Mr. Mouri and his family there.

49
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.790
I got back here after 6 pm

50
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.190
then joined the others.

51
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.390
Me? I was busy working, of course.

52
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.090
I'm alone today so I was very busy,

53
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.590
I don't remember all the details though.

54
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.090
Come on. It's your bedtime, Conan.

55
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.690
But I want to listen a little more.

56
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.390
No! Dad will scold you again.

57
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.790
I know, but it's too early for bed.

58
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.590
I'm sure dad will be at it all night.

59
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.490
You'd better not get in his way so just go to sleep.

60
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.790
All right. I'll go to sleep so you can go now.

61
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.390
No way. I'm staying right here until you're asleep.

62
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.890
All right then, now for after dinner.

63
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.890
It was about 7:50 pm when Mr. Sunaoka

64
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.590
left the restaurant with Ms. Tanigawa.

65
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.990
Right after that,

66
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.990
Mr. Tahara went to the kitchen to get more drinks.

67
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.590
At 8 pm sharp, Mr. Nagatsuka got a call from the station

68
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.190
and went to the front desk.

69
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.390
And right after that, I got a call from Mr. Sunaoka.

70
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.590
He abruptly ended conversation

71
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.590
and that's when we heard the gunshot.

72
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.290
Ms. Tanigawa, who had been taking a shower came out to the veranda

73
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.090
and discovered the bullet hole in Mr. Sunaoka's window.

74
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.190
We went to get Mr. Akashi at the front desk

75
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.890
and got the master key to unlock the door.

76
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.890
At 8:05 pm, we discovered the body.

77
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.490
Which means Mr. Sunaoka was killed between 8 pm to 8:05 pm.

78
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.390
Conan?

79
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.090
He fell asleep unusually fast tonight.

80
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.990
Goodnight.

81
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.890
I thought she'd never leave.

82
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.590
I'd like to go over in more detail

83
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.290
what you were all doing before and after the murder.

84
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.590
Why bother? You know it was somebody from the outside, don't you?

85
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.090
Well, we still must clarify what the victim was doing.

86
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.590
Mr. Sunaoka was alone in his room locked from the inside.

87
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.090
How would we know what he was doing?

88
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.290
Yes. Well, that's true.

89
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.790
We don't even have time to mourn him!

90
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.690
Give us a break!

91
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.690
Excuse me for saying this,

92
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.090
but it seems you three had some bad feelings toward Mr. Sunaoka.

93
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.790
-What? -What was that?

94
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.390
Are you implying one of us killed him?

95
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.990
Not really. This is all part of the investigation.

96
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.490
Mr. Sunaoka seemed very picky about the scenarios.

97
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.790
Isn't that right, Mr. Tahara?

98
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.890
Lately, it seems the viewers solve the crime before I do.

99
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.790
That just won't do.

100
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.890
Mr. Sunaoka, put yourself in my shoes.

101
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.290
I have to write scenarios to fit your personality.

102
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.590
I was only being honest.

103
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.290
And as for you, Mr. Nagatsuka, the producer.

104
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.190
I know all about it.

105
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.990
I hear you're pocketing some of the production fees.

106
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.190
How dare you! That's a lie!

107
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.490
It... it really was a lie.

108
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.090
Well, an investigation will clear that up.

109
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.290
Of course, do what you wish.

110
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.290
Now for Ms. Tanigawa,

111
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.090
Mr. Sunaoka talked about switching agencies, didn't he?

112
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.990
I'm the biggest star your agency's got.

113
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.890
If you lose me, you probably won't be able to stay in the business.

114
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.490
Well, Mr. Detective, I'll catch you again later.

115
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.390
On top of that, you're the only one

116
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.690
without a witness to verify your alibi.

117
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.790
How can you say that?

118
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.090
You all saw me in my room

119
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.590
from the garden restaurant, didn't you?

120
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.690
Yes, but it was after the gunshot.

121
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.090
Another thing, the rest of you

122
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.790
also had an opportunity to contact the shooter.

123
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.590
This is crazy!

124
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.090
But then you can never tell about Ms. Tanigawa.

125
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.590
What do you mean by that?

126
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:27.290
Didn't lover boy dump you?

127
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.290
Mr. Nagatsuka! Don't be ridiculous!

128
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.190
Now now, everybody, just calm down!

129
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.290
Detective Yokomizo!

130
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.390
The findings regarding the rifle are back.

131
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.890
The rifle was

132
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.790
one of those kept in the hunting management office.

133
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.690
The rope also came from there.

134
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.190
The markings on the bullet taken from the victim

135
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.890
and the ones from the rifle were a perfect match.

136
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.290
What is this?

137
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.590
A hole was opened in bottom of the bullet

138
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.490
and the tip's been sharpened.

139
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.890
What was the purpose for this?

140
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.090
It certainly doesn't make sense, does it?

141
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.690
There's spiral grooves inside the hole.

142
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.990
It's like a screw.

143
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.190
Conan!

144
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.790
Hey, you! You're supposed to be sleeping!

145
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.490
I got up because I was so thirsty.

146
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.490
All right already. Go get some water and then go back to bed.

147
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.190
Okay.

148
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.390
I almost forgot.

149
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.190
-Hey, Pops. -What? What is it now?

150
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.490
What did Mr. Sunaoka say on the telephone?

151
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.390
That is none of your business

152
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.790
But those were the last words

153
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.790
of Mr. Sunaoka, the big star, weren't they?

154
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.590
Oh, so you're one of those low brows?

155
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.190
He asked me to come to his room to talk detective talk.

156
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.690
But then he said, "Hey, what's that?"

157
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.590
and seemed surprised and hung up.

158
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.490
I knew it.

159
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.890
Since the rifle markings match,

160
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.190
then what I found mixed in with the pieces of glass...

161
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.490
Where'd they come from?

162
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.690
Which one?

163
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.290
It's so heavy!

164
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.190
I knew it! Just as I thought!

165
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.990
Now I know how the trick was worked.

166
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.890
What's this mark on the floor?

167
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.090
I concentrated so hard on the pieces of glass,

168
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.890
I didn't notice it before.

169
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.490
Could it be...

170
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.690
I knew it.

171
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:48.690
Which means the real weapon should be behind this door.

172
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.690
And the person staying in that room...

173
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.290
is also the killer.

174
00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:02.879
The rifle markings matched.

175
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:05.779
You don't need us here anymore, do you?

176
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.079
Excuse me, officer.

177
00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:10.979
What is it, kid?

178
00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:13.179
I have something to tell you.

179
00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:19.279
Huh? Room 304?

180
00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.379
Detective Yokomizo said to do a secret search.

181
00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:25.479
Here's the master key.

182
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:28.079
-Hurry, okay? -Sure.

183
00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:33.479
Then, we'll be going back to our rooms now.

184
00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:34.679
All right.

185
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:37.479
Shall we continue this at 8 tomorrow morning then?

186
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.979
What? That's so early!

187
00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:41.479
But I guess it's okay.

188
00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:45.479
Thank you for your time.

189
00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:47.879
Mr. Mouri, why don't you get some rest?

190
00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:51.879
We're going to go join the search downstream, excuse us.

191
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.679
Good luck.

192
00:12:04.579 --> 00:12:06.979
Wait a minute!

193
00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:09.679
You three over there.

194
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:13.079
Detective Yokomizo, hear me out first.

195
00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:17.779
That's the pose! So it's hit you, didn't it?

196
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.979
Yes, it finally hit me.

197
00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:25.479
But it doesn't seem like a job for Sleeping Kogoro this time.

198
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.579
You're wrong about that.

199
00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:32.479
After all, the killer is one of those three.

200
00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:33.879
What?

201
00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:36.179
What is that mean?

202
00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:38.079
I understand, Mr. Mouri.

203
00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:39.379
All right, you three.

204
00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:42.579
Why don't you have a seat on the sofa once more?

205
00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:47.879
At the first, it appeared to be an obvious case

206
00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:51.679
where the murderer was someone from the outside.

207
00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:55.679
But why did the murderer leave the rifle behind?

208
00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.679
The murderer could have tossed it into the stream

209
00:12:57.679 --> 00:13:00.579
or hidden it in the woods.

210
00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.879
Another thing, both the rifle and the rope

211
00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:07.279
the murderer used to get down to the stream,

212
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:10.179
why were these things wet by the rain?

213
00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:13.479
Right! It rained in the evening!

214
00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:17.579
If the rifle was left about 8 pm, it is strange that it would be wet.

215
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:20.779
The reason for that is, both the rifle and rope

216
00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:25.879
were planted there before the rain.

217
00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:31.079
In fact, it was dry under some parts of the rifle.

218
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:34.479
That proves the rifle was left there

219
00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.279
before it rained in the evening.

220
00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:42.479
Which means the rifle was what actually the murder weapon.

221
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.879
But the markings matched, didn't they?

222
00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:48.179
Before I explain that,

223
00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:52.279
why do you suppose the murderer went through all that trouble?

224
00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:57.779
Making it appear like he was shot from across valley.

225
00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:00.679
Even if the murderer was an outsider,

226
00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:01.779
all the murderer had to do was

227
00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:05.279
prove he or she never came close to the villa.

228
00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:11.979
There was absolutely no reason to plant fake evidence.

229
00:14:11.979 --> 00:14:16.879
The murderer is someone who needed an alibi.

230
00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:19.879
That's why the scene had to be across the valley.

231
00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:23.879
That's right, the murderer is one of you three.

232
00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:25.879
What?

233
00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.179
Hold on a minute.

234
00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:32.279
We're not magicians,

235
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:35.179
how did we shoot him without using the rifle?

236
00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:39.279
That's right! You haven't been making any sense at all!

237
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.279
And now, I'll go into the details

238
00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:45.179
of how Mr. Sunaoka was actually killed.

239
00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:47.279
This is ridiculous.

240
00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.579
First, the killer takes the master key

241
00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:51.579
from the front desk when no one is around

242
00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:55.579
and sneaks into Mr. Sunaoka's room on the 3rd floor.

243
00:14:55.579 --> 00:14:59.479
Then props up the mattress against the window.

244
00:14:59.479 --> 00:15:00.979
Mattress?

245
00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:03.879
What's a mattress got to do with anything?

246
00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:07.179
The killer then went to the hunting ground management office

247
00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:09.679
and stole the rifle and rope.

248
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.379
Then, the killer went to the rocky area across the valley

249
00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:15.379
and shot at the window in Mr. Sunaoka's room.

250
00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:20.379
The killer then left the rifle there

251
00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:21.779
and tied the rope to the tree

252
00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:25.179
and made it look like the escape was by water.

253
00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:28.179
The killer then snuck back into Mr. Sunaoka's room

254
00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:33.679
and removed the bullet shot into the mattress.

255
00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:36.179
After replacing the mattress,

256
00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:38.579
the killer removed all the broken pieces of glass

257
00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:42.279
and hid the hole by drawing the curtains.

258
00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:43.879
Detective Yokomizo.

259
00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:45.879
The bullet removed from the body

260
00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:48.479
had some work done to it, didn't it?

261
00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:49.579
Yes.

262
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.779
The killer went back to his or her own room

263
00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:53.579
and dug a hole into the end of the bullet

264
00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:55.079
which the killer took out of the mattress.

265
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.779
Tools were used to drill the screw threads

266
00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.579
and the tip was sharpened with a file.

267
00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:04.679
Then something the killer had prepared earlier

268
00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:07.679
was screwed into the bullet.

269
00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:09.679
And now we have a new deadly weapon

270
00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:13.079
with the same markings as the rifle.

271
00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:18.179
After the preparations had been made,

272
00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:20.779
the killer went to the garden restaurant for dinner.

273
00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.979
When Mr. Sunaoka went back to his room,

274
00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:27.279
the killer made up some sort of excuse and got into his room.

275
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.579
And pierced Mr. Sunaoka...

276
00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:33.679
in the forehead, from the front.

277
00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.079
Pierced?

278
00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:37.979
Are you saying the weapon was a knife or arrow?

279
00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:40.279
An arrow?

280
00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:43.679
After killing Mr. Sunaoka,

281
00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:44.779
the killer moved the body

282
00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:45.779
to make it look like the shot came from the window

283
00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:48.179
and opened the curtains.

284
00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:51.079
Then rescattered the pieces of glass around

285
00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:55.579
and removed the tip of the arrow from Mr. Sunaoka's forehead.

286
00:16:55.579 --> 00:16:58.179
Then left without a shag.

287
00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.179
Nice, Mr. Mouri.

288
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:09.979
You should become a scenario writer.

289
00:17:09.979 --> 00:17:12.079
That was a brilliant story.

290
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.079
No, I don't have the talent to become a writer.

291
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.779
All the evidence the killer left behind

292
00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:20.679
showed me the truth.

293
00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:23.779
I'm just the messenger.

294
00:17:23.779 --> 00:17:26.979
For instance, along with the pieces of glass from the window,

295
00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:29.679
I found some coconut fibers.

296
00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:32.679
They were from the mattress.

297
00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:36.179
It probably fell out when the bullet was dug out.

298
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:37.679
The killer didn't notice them

299
00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:41.679
and gathered them up along with the glass.

300
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.279
I see.

301
00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:46.879
After that, the killer hid the real weapon

302
00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:49.579
and then went to another location so as not to under suspicion

303
00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:53.379
and called me on my cellular.

304
00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:55.679
The killer probably saw the number

305
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.279
on the business card I handed out during dinner.

306
00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:03.979
Mr. Mouri, you yourself said the caller was Mr. Sunaoka.

307
00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:07.079
On the phone, Mr. Sunaoka said,

308
00:18:07.079 --> 00:18:09.179
"How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

309
00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:11.279
and we'll talk detective?"

310
00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:13.779
Then, "Huh? Hold on for a second. What is that?"

311
00:18:14.479 --> 00:18:16.379
Well, people...

312
00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:19.579
Does that sound familiar to anyone?

313
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:23.779
That's the dialogue he said on tonight's show!

314
00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:27.079
-Are you sure? -Yes, I'm positive!

315
00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:30.979
I taped it. Why don't you see for yourself?

316
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:32.179
Yes, I'll do that.

317
00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:38.179
It was the opening scene, but please fast forward it.

318
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:42.179
That's it!

319
00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:44.479
How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

320
00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:46.479
and we'll talk detective?

321
00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:49.079
Huh? Hold on for a second. What is that?

322
00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:54.879
I see. The killer recorded this line previously

323
00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:57.979
and played it back to Mr. Mouri on the phone, right?

324
00:18:57.979 --> 00:19:01.579
Then Mr. Sunaoka was already dead when the call was made?

325
00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:05.279
Yes, he was already killed.

326
00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:08.379
The only one without an alibi for that time is...

327
00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:10.379
Detective Yokomizo!

328
00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:13.179
As you ordered, I searched room 304

329
00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:14.479
and look at what I found!

330
00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:16.279
That's a bowgun.

331
00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:18.479
And I found an arrow with blood on it.

332
00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:20.979
So this is the murder weapon!

333
00:19:20.979 --> 00:19:23.979
And there are screw threads on the arrow head.

334
00:19:23.979 --> 00:19:26.979
Mr. Mouri! It's exactly like you said!

335
00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:30.879
I'm sure the killer intended to take them home and destroy them.

336
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:35.579
Officer, did you just say room #304?

337
00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:37.579
You mean...

338
00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:42.079
That's right. The killer was staying in room 304,

339
00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:44.979
Toshiaki Tahara, it's you!

340
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.779
-What? -I don't believe it!

341
00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:53.279
Mr. Tahara, a little past 7:50 pm,

342
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:55.379
you left the restaurant saying you were going to get more drinks

343
00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:59.479
but you went to Mr. Sunaoka's room and killed him.

344
00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:03.679
About 8 pm, you came back looking as if nothing happened.

345
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.779
You deliberately sat far away

346
00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:08.679
so you call me without being seen

347
00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:10.979
then you threw something, possibly a firecracker into the valley

348
00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:13.979
to make us think a shot was fired.

349
00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:20.279
Some detective you are!

350
00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:24.079
Just because the murder weapon was in my room

351
00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:26.479
doesn't mean it belongs to me.

352
00:20:26.479 --> 00:20:29.979
I'm being set up by the real killer!

353
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:34.279
Unfortunately for you, I have more proof.

354
00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:35.479
What was that?

355
00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:37.679
It's your shoes.

356
00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:42.479
At the crime scene, there was a mark...

357
00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:44.979
left by your shoes.

358
00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:48.779
Excuse me, would you mind taking your shoes off?

359
00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:52.279
There's pieces of glass stuck in the sole.

360
00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:57.079
Could they be from the pieces scattered around the body?

361
00:20:57.079 --> 00:21:01.679
I'm sure no one else besides us went near the body.

362
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:07.279
So how could be these pieces of glass get under your shoes?

363
00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:09.579
You were so preoccupied with what you had to do,

364
00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:12.379
you didn't realize you had stepped on them.

365
00:21:12.379 --> 00:21:15.879
You were too caught up.

366
00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:19.679
You win.

367
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:23.179
Mr. Tahara! Why did you do such a thing?

368
00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:26.379
He was also criticizing and making fun of the scenarios I wrote.

369
00:21:26.379 --> 00:21:28.979
If the ratings were bad, he blamed me.

370
00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:32.579
I couldn't forgive that Sunaoka for that!

371
00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:34.279
I wanted to show everyone, the producers,

372
00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:36.979
the actors and the police...

373
00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:40.079
Yes, and I even the most famous detective

374
00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:44.079
that I could commit the perfect crime.

375
00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:48.279
And the victim, of course Bannai Kujirao Sunaoka

376
00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:51.279
was the only choice.

377
00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:25.779
How about the lead in our next series?

378
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.879
The title is "Kogoro, the Famous Detective"!

379
00:23:27.879 --> 00:23:28.979
Will you do it?

380
00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:30.579
The ratings are guaranteed to be high,

381
00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:33.179
you'll be a famous star in no time!

382
00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:35.879
That does sound good.

383
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.379
-Let's get going! -What?

384
00:23:42.979 --> 00:23:45.179
Mr. Mouri!

385
00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:47.879
Ran, we'll want you too!

386
00:23:48.879 --> 00:23:52.279
Mr. Mouri!

387
00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.979
I want a chance to be a star!

388
00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:00.479
"Next Episode"

389
00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:02.779
What was that sound?

390
00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:11.779
She's been shot in the forehead.

391
00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:15.379
You saw a blue-white light?

392
00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:18.079
A blue-white light...

393
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:19.679
What's going on here?

394
00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:22.079
I've got it!

395
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:24.579
