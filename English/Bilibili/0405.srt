1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.640
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.440
They can be the culprit or the actor.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.240
Care is the key to the dying message.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.940
Officer Takagi is on stage.

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.740
Solve the case with smile and peace.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.525
Hello. Are you sleeping?

10
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:09.525
You're gonna catch cold.

11
00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.925
Okay! I gotta call the ambulance!

12
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.025
I found a man lying on the ground!

13
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.225
He's bleeding from this head!

14
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.425
Oh, the place?

15
00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:29.325
I think...

16
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.625
What's taking them so long?

17
00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.925
Why can't they just come right away?

18
00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.425
The hospital is right in front of the train station.

19
00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:43.425
Since they are not coming, I should go and get them!

20
00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:57.125
"The Man Who Called the Ambulance"

21
00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.525
Yeah, that's what I mean.

22
00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.225
The guy who found the victim

23
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:05.025
disappeared from the site of murder.

24
00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:07.325
The first person to find the victim disappeared?

25
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:12.025
I told you! He ran away right after he called 911.

26
00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:13.925
What's the matter?

27
00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:18.025
Is it actually me that you are talking about?

28
00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:21.725
So you are the one who found the victim first? Where were you hiding?

29
00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.425
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu (28), Comedian" -I wasn't hiding or anything.

30
00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:28.325
I left here to get the ambulance!

31
00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:30.225
Did you really?

32
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:32.125
I don't think you needed to

33
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.625
because the victim was already dead long ago.

34
00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.225
That's right.

35
00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:41.525
It seems he died immediately after being clubbed in his head.

36
00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.325
So I appreciate that you came here all the way but...

37
00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.525
I got it!

38
00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:50.825
You left here to get the ambulance which in fact was unnecessary.

39
00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.525
It's strange, isn't it?

40
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:53.725
Name!

41
00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:57.225
What are you talking about? How could I know that he was dead?

42
00:03:57.225 --> 00:03:58.625
Name!

43
00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:00.025
What's your name?

44
00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:03.225
Oh, it's Hiroshi Hiromatsu.

45
00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:07.725
What an arrogant police officer we got.

46
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:11.025
Come on! Your name, address, age, job!

47
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:12.525
Write everything down on this!

48
00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:14.825
"Hiroshi Hiromatsu"

49
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:19.125
It's Hiroshi Hiromatsu no matter which way you read it.

50
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.825
Your name is like a tongue twister.

51
00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:24.725
What can I do? It's my name!

52
00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.725
You're a comedian, huh?

53
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.225
I've never heard of your name before.

54
00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:32.025
Well, I'm not a popular one, really.

55
00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:34.425
If this random man was the first to find the victim...

56
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:36.125
The victim...

57
00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.325
I've never seen something like this before.

58
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:40.525
Peace.

59
00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:43.925
What? The smiling and peace?

60
00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:46.325
What does it mean?

61
00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:47.425
Are you done?

62
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:49.325
-Yes. -Let's see.

63
00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.825
What is it?

64
00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:57.725
Hey, Iwai and Hirano!

65
00:04:57.725 --> 00:04:58.725
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

66
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.725
Find out as much as you can about this guy for me.

67
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:06.425
-You got it? -Yes, sir!

68
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:09.925
Sir, did I write something wrong?

69
00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:18.225
It's Officer Takagi.

70
00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:20.425
I'm Takagi from the metropolitan police.

71
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:22.125
Mr. Takagi!

72
00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:24.325
Hiromatsu?

73
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.925
I'm Sakurada from Beika East Station.

74
00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.225
Do you know him?

75
00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:33.125
Yes, he actually helped me catch shoplifters before.

76
00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:34.325
So, why are you here?

77
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:38.925
It happened to be me, who found the victim first.

78
00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:40.325
You are the first one?

79
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:42.825
Well, maybe there was something else he did as well.

80
00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:44.325
What do you mean by that?

81
00:05:44.325 --> 00:05:48.525
He is suspicious about Mr. Hiromatsu.

82
00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:50.025
Conan!

83
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.625
So, what is it, Mr. Sakurada?

84
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.625
You think Hiromatsu is the murderer?

85
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.725
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

86
00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.725
It's the basics of investigation.

87
00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:02.325
But I did not kill the victim.

88
00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:06.325
Look, I know what kind of person he is. This can't be him.

89
00:06:06.325 --> 00:06:09.725
The reason I think he is the murderer is...

90
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:14.025
I got a phone call from the police.

91
00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:17.525
I'm Yukiko Yasunaga, the owner of Office Yasunaga.

92
00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.825
I'm Sakurada of Beika East Station.

93
00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:23.025
-And you? -You're Mr. Ryoji Mizuhara, right?

94
00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:25.025
I've seen you a lot on TV drama and stuff.

95
00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.025
Oh yeah! You're the actor!

96
00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:28.825
I'm Mizuhara.

97
00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:33.725
Ohkubo was the manager of Mizuhara.

98
00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:35.125
Ohkubo?

99
00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:38.125
Mr. Iwao Ohkubo, the victim.

100
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:41.325
I need you to identify the victim.

101
00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:45.125
What the heck is this?

102
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:46.325
Smile?

103
00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:49.125
A peace sign?

104
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.525
Is it him?

105
00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:51.825
Yes, it is him.

106
00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:54.325
He was my manager, Mr. Ohkubo.

107
00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:56.725
Hiromatsu, what are you doing here?

108
00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:58.425
It's a long story.

109
00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:01.225
Do you guys know each other?

110
00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:04.125
We're living in the same apartment, right next to each other.

111
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:07.025
I see, I understand.

112
00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:09.225
Last time we talked,

113
00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:12.725
you said Mr. Ohkubo was working late last night.

114
00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:15.725
He was actually in my room just a while ago.

115
00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:18.425
It was late last night when he came to my place.

116
00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:23.325
We were talking about my future plan as an actor.

117
00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:25.225
It went on until midnight.

118
00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:30.025
Then, to catch the first train,

119
00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:32.425
he left my place around 4.30am in the morning.

120
00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:38.025
So, he left your apartment and headed to the station

121
00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:40.225
and this was the street that he took.

122
00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:47.325
4.40am.

123
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:51.125
It was 10 minutes after he left Mr. Mizuhara's apartment.

124
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:53.125
I assume the murder weapon was a steel pipe

125
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:55.925
although we haven't found it yet.

126
00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:59.425
Okay then, after 20 minutes, which was 5am,

127
00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.825
you found the victim on the street while you were jogging.

128
00:08:01.825 --> 00:08:03.325
That's right.

129
00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.025
You guys are living on 4th street.

130
00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.825
The train station is this way.

131
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:11.725
And the hospital is located before the station.

132
00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:14.825
So it'll be like this though it's a rough sketch.

133
00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:18.425
Mr. Takagi, since I was interrupted last time,

134
00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.025
now it's a good time to tell you

135
00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:22.625
the reason why I suspect Mr. Hiromatsu.

136
00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.925
He killed Ohkubo?

137
00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:27.025
Did you?

138
00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:29.025
No, I didn't!

139
00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:32.125
First of all, you were the first one to find the victim!

140
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:34.325
There's a possibility that the murderer

141
00:08:34.325 --> 00:08:37.725
left his belongings in the site of the murder.

142
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:40.525
But if he pretends that he is the first person to find the victim,

143
00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:43.025
then he can make an excuse,

144
00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:46.025
saying that these things were there when he found the victim!

145
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.425
Yeah, but...

146
00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:51.725
Second of all, you left the murder scene to get the ambulance.

147
00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.025
You know, people usually don't do that.

148
00:08:54.025 --> 00:09:00.325
Perhaps you left for some other purpose, didn't you?

149
00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:01.825
What's that supposed to mean?

150
00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:03.325
For example...

151
00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.225
This is Sakurada.

152
00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:09.925
The murder weapon was found?

153
00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:12.025
Yes, I'm pretty sure, sir.

154
00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.425
It's got some hair on it

155
00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:18.025
as well as bloodstains which are still wet.

156
00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:20.125
Yes. We found it under...

157
00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.725
Kamitakada Bridge. Just as I thought.

158
00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:24.825
Good job!

159
00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.925
Kamitakada Bridge?

160
00:09:26.925 --> 00:09:31.325
That's a bridge located between this murder site and the hospital.

161
00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:34.725
So, the reason why you headed to the hospital was...

162
00:09:34.725 --> 00:09:37.825
Not to call the ambulance...

163
00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.025
but to dispose of the murder weapon.

164
00:09:44.025 --> 00:09:47.825
Give me a break! Why would I have to kill him in the first place?

165
00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.125
As to that, I already have a clue!

166
00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.425
What?

167
00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:55.325
You said you are a comedian but not popular at all.

168
00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:57.825
You knew that Mr. Ohkubo was Mr. Mizuhara's manager

169
00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:01.525
and you knew that he visited Mr. Mizuhara often,

170
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:05.025
so you begged Mr. Ohkubo to give you a job.

171
00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:06.825
Yet, he refused.

172
00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:08.425
You got mad, and then...

173
00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:10.625
Hold on.

174
00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:13.825
And you know what? The dying message the victim left

175
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:16.025
is telling that you are the murderer!

176
00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:17.925
Dying message?

177
00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:19.525
What is it?

178
00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:22.825
It's how Mr. Ohkubo died. Wasn't it strange?

179
00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:25.525
Smiling with a peace sign.

180
00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:30.325
That was the dying message?

181
00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:32.025
Exactly, that was the murderer's name!

182
00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:34.025
Here. Take a look!

183
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:39.425
"Comedian. Stage name: Smiley Peace"

184
00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:43.325
Smiley Peace.

185
00:10:43.325 --> 00:10:45.925
I knew you were a comedian

186
00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:47.925
but I didn't know that your stage name was this.

187
00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:49.825
Yeah, but I didn't kill him!

188
00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:51.525
Believe me, Mr. Takagi!

189
00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:54.325
Hey, what about his alibi?

190
00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:55.525
Oh, alibi?

191
00:10:57.325 --> 00:10:59.725
If Mr. Ohkubo was killed at 4.40am,

192
00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.925
then I was still in my apartment.

193
00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:03.425
I left there a little before 5am.

194
00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:06.725
It was right after I started jogging when I found the victim!

195
00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:10.025
I wish you could prove that.

196
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:13.525
Yeah, but how can you prove that a man living alone

197
00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:15.425
was in his room?

198
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:19.225
Oh, I remember, after Mr. Ohkubo left,

199
00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:22.525
I set the alarm clock and went to bed.

200
00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:26.225
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

201
00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:28.225
from the room next to mine.

202
00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:31.325
And that was 4.40am, right, Mr. Mizuhara?

203
00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.525
I think so.

204
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.425
Now you have an alibi, Hiromatsu!

205
00:11:35.425 --> 00:11:36.425
Yeah!

206
00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.325
What's that look on his face?

207
00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:43.325
Sorry. May I go home now?

208
00:11:43.325 --> 00:11:47.625
Ohkubo was like a father to you. You must be shocked.

209
00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:50.825
I think you're done with Mizuhara, right?

210
00:11:50.825 --> 00:11:55.525
Well, I will have to see you some other time, but today, yes.

211
00:11:58.025 --> 00:12:00.825
May I go home too?

212
00:12:00.825 --> 00:12:03.425
I haven't asked you about the situation

213
00:12:03.425 --> 00:12:05.925
when you found the dead victim, have I?

214
00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.025
You're right.

215
00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.525
Are you sure?

216
00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:17.625
Got it! Thanks.

217
00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:22.425
Bad news. The alibi you stated is invalid.

218
00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:27.325
I knew you were hiding something,

219
00:12:27.325 --> 00:12:29.325
so I had my officers investigate this area,

220
00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:32.325
searching for some kind of clue.

221
00:12:32.325 --> 00:12:35.025
And guess who was on the security camera

222
00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:38.425
in the convenient store on 3rd street? You.

223
00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.325
And the time was 4.30am.

224
00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:44.225
I'm sorry!

225
00:12:44.225 --> 00:12:46.225
I lied.

226
00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:50.025
I left my apartment to jog before 4.30am!

227
00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:51.625
Hiromatsu.

228
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.625
But, if I told you the truth, I'd become the main suspect!

229
00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:57.725
So that was a lie out of desperation, huh?

230
00:12:57.725 --> 00:13:00.725
That's why you had a strange look on your face.

231
00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:04.225
Maybe that was Mr. Mizuhara's imagination?

232
00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:07.525
I don't know. But that was totally out of blue that he said so.

233
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:09.825
So it was just a coincidence that you lied about your alibi

234
00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:13.125
and Mr. Mizuhara backed you up out of mistaken imagination.

235
00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.325
Is that what it is?

236
00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:18.525
Well, there's no need to lie if you're truly innocent.

237
00:13:18.525 --> 00:13:22.025
Now, I need you to come to the station, Mr. Hiromatsu.

238
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.625
Oh sorry, it's Mr. Smiley Peace!

239
00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:28.825
Mr. Takagi.

240
00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:33.525
The motive of the murder and the disposal of the weapon

241
00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:36.625
are all Mr. Sakurada's idea.

242
00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:40.025
The dying message is the problem, right?

243
00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:43.825
Smiley Peace, I didn't know it was him.

244
00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.925
I'm surprised that Mr. Ohkubo knew that name.

245
00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:49.325
I didn't even know that was a stage name.

246
00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:52.825
Mr. Mizuhara knew the name only because they were neighbors, right?

247
00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:55.525
I haven't seen Mr. Mizuhara on TV lately,

248
00:13:55.525 --> 00:13:58.625
But he used to be on a lot of TV shows.

249
00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:02.725
With a never smile but handsome face. He was cool.

250
00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:07.125
I'm worried about Hiromatsu,

251
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.125
so I'll go and watch the interrogation.

252
00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.025
Smiley Peace.

253
00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:13.825
Smile with a peace sign.

254
00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:15.125
Smile...

255
00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:17.925
Maybe...

256
00:14:21.925 --> 00:14:23.325
You're...

257
00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:25.525
I'm Conan Edogawa.

258
00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:27.925
All right, Conan, what's up?

259
00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:31.625
Officer Takagi told me to ask you something.

260
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:34.525
It's about the conversation

261
00:14:34.525 --> 00:14:36.525
Mr. Ohkubo had with Mr. Mizuhara last night.

262
00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:39.925
You mean the future plan about Mizuhara's career.

263
00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:43.825
Yes, Officer Takagi wants to know more about this future plan in detail.

264
00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:48.625
Okay, so this future plan means...

265
00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.925
Just as I thought!

266
00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:56.125
Now I know what the dying message means!

267
00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:58.025
And...

268
00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:01.825
the real murderer is that person!

269
00:15:07.146 --> 00:15:08.846
Ms. Yasunaga?

270
00:15:08.846 --> 00:15:11.246
You mean the female owner of the production company?

271
00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:13.346
Yeah. She told me to tell you this

272
00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:15.346
because she thought it might help to solve the case.

273
00:15:15.346 --> 00:15:16.746
What?

274
00:15:16.746 --> 00:15:20.446
The future plan means "smile".

275
00:15:21.146 --> 00:15:23.046
Smile?

276
00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:26.846
Ryoji Mizuhara was a cool handsome actor that never smiles.

277
00:15:26.846 --> 00:15:28.346
That's how we sold him.

278
00:15:28.346 --> 00:15:31.346
But that style doesn't work any more.

279
00:15:31.346 --> 00:15:33.546
So, Ohkubo decided to tell him about

280
00:15:33.546 --> 00:15:36.046
switching to a handsome actor with warm smiles.

281
00:15:36.046 --> 00:15:38.646
That's why he visited me last night.

282
00:15:40.546 --> 00:15:42.946
I agreed with that plan,

283
00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:45.946
because Mizuhara looks so sexy when he smiles.

284
00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:49.146
Switching to a smiley actor.

285
00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:50.646
Yeah!

286
00:15:50.646 --> 00:15:52.846
But I'm pretty sure that Mr. Mizuhara was surprised

287
00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:55.046
since he was told so out of the blue.

288
00:15:55.046 --> 00:15:58.846
He was more angry than surprised,

289
00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:01.546
I think it's because he was suddenly told to be an actor

290
00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:03.946
that was totally opposite what he used be, right?

291
00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:05.946
Oh no!

292
00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:08.046
Also, Mr. Ohkubo

293
00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:12.046
treated Mr. Mizuhara as if he were his own child, I heard.

294
00:16:13.146 --> 00:16:15.546
Ohkubo had a sickness actually.

295
00:16:15.546 --> 00:16:16.746
What?

296
00:16:16.746 --> 00:16:19.846
The doctor told him that he had only six months more to live.

297
00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:22.646
So he should've been resting in the hospital,

298
00:16:22.646 --> 00:16:24.746
but he refused, and worked hard instead,

299
00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:28.346
just to make his boy Mizuhara make a great comeback on TV once again,

300
00:16:28.346 --> 00:16:30.946
while sacrificing his life.

301
00:16:30.946 --> 00:16:33.946
He did it all for Mizuhara.

302
00:16:33.946 --> 00:16:36.046
Sacrificed his life...

303
00:16:37.646 --> 00:16:41.446
Then, I think I got the meaning of the dying message!

304
00:16:41.446 --> 00:16:43.046
Really?

305
00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.746
Yeah. If my deduction is correct,

306
00:16:45.746 --> 00:16:48.246
then this case is a really sad one.

307
00:16:48.246 --> 00:16:52.246
Right. This is not a funny case at all.

308
00:16:55.846 --> 00:16:59.646
What is this? Why are you calling everyone to the murder scene?

309
00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:05.246
Listen, Mr. Sakurada, Hiromatsu did not murder Mr. Ohkubo.

310
00:17:05.246 --> 00:17:06.546
The murderer is somebody else.

311
00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:09.046
First of all, about the disposal of the murder weapon.

312
00:17:09.046 --> 00:17:13.046
After the murder, the killer fled from here as you can imagine.

313
00:17:13.046 --> 00:17:15.446
But which way did the killer run away?

314
00:17:16.246 --> 00:17:20.246
Kamitakada Bridge, where the weapon was found, is that way.

315
00:17:20.246 --> 00:17:23.846
Then, the murderer ran that way too?

316
00:17:23.846 --> 00:17:25.646
Not necessarily.

317
00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:28.646
Maybe he went that way!

318
00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:30.946
Criminals usually try to divert police attention

319
00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:33.646
opposite the direction that they flee.

320
00:17:33.646 --> 00:17:36.046
Very simple trick though.

321
00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:40.346
I see. The real murderer is someone that's living around here.

322
00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:41.646
Wait a second.

323
00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:45.646
Mr. Mizuhara, your apartment is this way, isn't it?

324
00:17:45.646 --> 00:17:47.046
Yeah.

325
00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:49.746
Second of all, about establishing the alibi.

326
00:17:49.746 --> 00:17:53.746
Perhaps this criminal act was a compulsive one.

327
00:17:53.746 --> 00:17:57.146
Thus the murderer was not well-prepared, I assume.

328
00:17:57.146 --> 00:18:00.346
But that person came up with a good idea.

329
00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:04.246
You lied about your alibi out of desperation, right?

330
00:18:04.246 --> 00:18:07.646
The true murderer tried to use that lie.

331
00:18:07.646 --> 00:18:09.346
I don't get it.

332
00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:10.646
Don't you remember?

333
00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:13.746
There was one person who was drawn into your lie.

334
00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:18.946
Yes. Ryoji Mizuhara!

335
00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:22.846
You murdered Mr. Ohkubo.

336
00:18:23.346 --> 00:18:25.946
Then I heard the sound of the toilet flushing

337
00:18:25.946 --> 00:18:27.546
from the room next to mine.

338
00:18:27.546 --> 00:18:30.946
That was neither your imagination nor misconception, right?

339
00:18:30.946 --> 00:18:34.746
By saying so, you tried to fabricate your alibi

340
00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:37.646
that you were in your room at that time.

341
00:18:37.646 --> 00:18:39.346
Last night, Mr. Ohkubo

342
00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:43.346
made a suggestion about the future plan of your career.

343
00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:46.546
He told you that you needed to show your smile.

344
00:18:46.546 --> 00:18:49.846
But, you had always been a cool, handsome actor that didn't smile,

345
00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:52.746
and you did not want to lose this image.

346
00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:56.146
So, Mr. Ohkubo's suggestion was not one of your options.

347
00:18:56.146 --> 00:18:58.846
And then you thought Mr. Ohkubo was gonna force you

348
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:02.546
to change your character even if you didn't want to. No way!

349
00:19:02.546 --> 00:19:04.146
Did it go something like this?

350
00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:08.046
I'm Ryoji Mizuhara.

351
00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:11.046
Do you think I am gonna laugh like a teenage brat?

352
00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:14.346
Mizuhara, you murdered Mr. Ohkubo?

353
00:19:14.346 --> 00:19:17.446
This morning, after he left your apartment,

354
00:19:17.446 --> 00:19:19.346
you followed Mr. Ohkubo.

355
00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.246
You are right, Officer Takagi.

356
00:19:34.246 --> 00:19:37.646
But then why did the victim die in such a strange way?

357
00:19:37.646 --> 00:19:39.046
How would you explain that?

358
00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:44.346
Of course, as you thought, that was a dying message.

359
00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:46.546
But it wasn't "Smiley Peace".

360
00:19:46.546 --> 00:19:48.846
It was "smile" and "Victory sign".

361
00:19:48.846 --> 00:19:51.946
It was Mr. Ohkubo's last message to you,

362
00:19:51.946 --> 00:19:55.346
whom he treated like his own child.

363
00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:00.246
Mr. Ohkubo said to you,

364
00:20:00.246 --> 00:20:03.746
Mizuhara, smile. Smile is your new style.

365
00:20:03.746 --> 00:20:06.346
You look amazing when you smile.

366
00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:12.846
I didn't know that.

367
00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.046
This can't be true!

368
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.846
Who in the world would encourage someone

369
00:20:15.846 --> 00:20:17.946
that's actually trying to kill you?

370
00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:19.546
But there are people like that.

371
00:20:21.046 --> 00:20:23.146
That's how much Ohkubo cared about Mizuhara.

372
00:20:23.146 --> 00:20:27.046
He deeply cared about you, didn't you know, Mizuhara?

373
00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:30.546
He had only six months left to live.

374
00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:34.546
But he decided to sacrifice his valuable time for you.

375
00:20:38.546 --> 00:20:40.546
Mr. Ohkubo!

376
00:20:43.046 --> 00:20:44.646
Mr. Ohkubo was thinking about you

377
00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:47.646
until the last moment of his life.

378
00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:51.546
You should pay for your crime and live right for him, Mr. Mizuhara.

379
00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:54.346
All right.

380
00:20:54.346 --> 00:20:58.146
Let me hear your story in the station, okay?

381
00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:01.346
Mr. Sakurada!

382
00:21:01.346 --> 00:21:02.646
Huh?

383
00:21:02.646 --> 00:21:04.146
Could you...

384
00:21:04.146 --> 00:21:06.546
please apologize to Hiromatsu?

385
00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:11.946
Please apologize that you suspected Hiromatsu!

386
00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:15.046
Yes, he did lie about his alibi.

387
00:21:15.046 --> 00:21:17.246
And lying is not a good thing.

388
00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:19.146
But it's partly your fault

389
00:21:19.146 --> 00:21:21.446
because you put too much pressure on him

390
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.846
so that he had to lie!

391
00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:25.446
Am I wrong, Mr. Sakurada?

392
00:21:25.446 --> 00:21:27.546
Suspect the first man who finds the victim.

393
00:21:27.546 --> 00:21:29.846
It is the basics of investigation.

394
00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:34.746
But there's a flaw that people tend to ignore in this principle too.

395
00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:37.846
This applies not only to you, but me as well.

396
00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:42.246
That is, police officers must be free from prejudice!

397
00:21:42.246 --> 00:21:43.646
No matter what!

398
00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.246
I understand.

399
00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:49.146
I apologize.

400
00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:50.846
No, it's okay.

401
00:21:50.846 --> 00:21:51.946
Bye.

402
00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:57.946
Thank you so much, Mr. Takagi!

403
00:21:57.946 --> 00:21:59.646
Now you are free.

404
00:22:00.546 --> 00:22:03.546
You're a man, Officer Takagi.

405
00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:32.546
Well, I thought my life was over

406
00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:35.146
when I heard that the name of the murderer

407
00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:37.846
was Smiling with a victory sign, seriously.

408
00:23:37.846 --> 00:23:41.646
You should've even thought about it in the first place.

409
00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:45.046
Yeah, I don't think Mr. Ohkubo knew

410
00:23:45.046 --> 00:23:48.746
a comedian called "Smiley Peace" anyway.

411
00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:51.446
People of the same industry don't know my name.

412
00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:54.246
That shows how unpopular I am, doesn't it?

413
00:23:55.446 --> 00:23:57.346
Continue to try your best, Hiromatsu.

414
00:23:59.446 --> 00:24:07.746
"Next Episode"

415
00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:10.546
"Dogo Hoshikawa's Illusion Magic Show"

416
00:24:10.546 --> 00:24:11.746
Hey, Hattori.

417
00:24:11.746 --> 00:24:14.046
She just changed the atmosphere, didn't she?

418
00:24:14.046 --> 00:24:16.046
Mr. Masakage.

419
00:24:23.946 --> 00:24:25.446
Next Conan,

420
00:24:25.446 --> 00:24:29.546
"Conan and Heiji's Deduction Magic (Tricks)"

421
00:24:30.273 --> 00:24:32.073
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:32.073 --> 00:24:34.373
"Secret of tricks"

423
00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:35.373
Officer Takagi, can you do some tricks?

424
00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.973
It's transformation. Look, 3, 2, 1.

425
00:24:36.973 --> 00:24:39.477
-Grilled eel! -We're not talking about food, Genta.
