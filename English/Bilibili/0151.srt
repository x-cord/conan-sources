1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,466
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:05,166
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:06,966
Today's episode has the smallest cast ever.

4
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,966
Stay right there for a sudden reversal of circumstances.

5
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,666
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,566
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,966
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,979
A car that is rigged with an explosive explodes at the parental home

9
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:02,579
of Megumi Sakihara, a person who Pops used to tutor in his school days.

10
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,179
The victim who passes away in the incident

11
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,079
turns out to be Megumi's younger sister, Hiromi,

12
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,379
who was reversing the car out of the garage for Megumi

13
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,079
because she was supposedly not good at it.

14
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,579
The suspect turns up to be a man named Hiromasa Takahashi.

15
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,079
He agrees to carry out an exchange murder

16
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,179
with Megumi's husband, Kazuo Sakihara.

17
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:27,379
However, he inadvertently kills Hiromi instead of Megumi.

18
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,379
Both men confess to their crime,

19
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,879
and it looks at first glance that the case had been solved.

20
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,379
She reversed out of such a narrow parking space.

21
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,979
This case has not yet ended.

22
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:57,579
"The Car Explosion Case (Part 2)"

23
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,379
Conan, what's up?

24
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,879
Hey, is anything wrong?

25
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,579
No, it's nothing.

26
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,479
I think Megumi came here to buy us some cake or something.

27
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,679
Let's hurry and go to Megumi's house.

28
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:13,479
Seriously.

29
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,679
What's with that kid anyway?

30
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,579
It's too early to tell Pops about this.

31
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,979
I've got to get more corroborative proof.

32
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,879
I just don't know what to say.

33
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,579
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,979
I am fine, so please don't worry yourself over me.

35
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,279
Please have some tea before it gets cold.

36
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,279
Thank you.

37
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,479
I'll have some, too.

38
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,779
How about some cake, Conan?

39
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,479
Okay.

40
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,279
May I go to the restroom first?

41
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,779
Over there.

42
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:31,979
Sakihara had a phone exclusively for himself in his study upstairs

43
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,379
and took all his calls with that phone.

44
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,379
What's that?

45
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,979
That's the remains of masking tape being peeled off.

46
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,979
Just as I thought.

47
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,779
So, "it" was set up there, after all.

48
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,979
I'll bet you're relieved that Megumi looked way better

49
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,179
than you thought she would, right, Dad?

50
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,679
Yeah. I'll guess she'll do okay.

51
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:30,579
I've got some place to stop by when we get to Beika Station,

52
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,279
so you can both leave me and go home.

53
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,579
All right, but remember, don't be too late.

54
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,479
There's a window.

55
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,179
I see. If it's from that window...

56
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,679
Just as I thought.

57
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:14,579
Okay. I've got the overall picture.

58
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:16,179
Now, all I need is proof.

59
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,379
"Mouri Detective Agency"

60
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,179
I am back!

61
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,079
Pops.

62
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,779
Something bothers me about the case.

63
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:32,879
What?

64
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,879
Well, do you remember Megumi reversed her car

65
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,779
out of the narrow parking space of the supermarket today, right?

66
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,579
Then why did she have her younger sister back her car out for her

67
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,579
when the incident happened?

68
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,479
Besides, on the wall near the telephone

69
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,579
of the upstairs study of Megumi's house,

70
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,679
it looked like masking tape was peeled off.

71
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,179
That means that something was stuck on there, right?

72
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,779
Masking tape?

73
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,479
Did you know that there was a window way inside the garage

74
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,879
where the incident occurred, Pops?

75
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,179
It seems that the window cracked from the impact of the explosion

76
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,379
and a wooden board was placed over it.

77
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,879
But, with a window like that over there,

78
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,679
it's good because you can get a good view of the car

79
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,679
from inside the house.

80
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,079
What are you trying to get at?

81
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:26,179
Are you insinuating that Megumi has something to do with this case?

82
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,479
I don't know.

83
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,179
But...

84
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,379
Don't be ridiculous.

85
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:38,179
I know her best because she used to be my student.

86
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,579
You knew her as a high school student, right, Pops?

87
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,779
Megumi could've changed after growing up.

88
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,079
Don't you dare get cheeky with me!

89
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,479
She hasn't changed a bit!

90
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,179
She's the way she always used to be!

91
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,879
You want to believe so, don't you, Pops?

92
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,879
What?

93
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,179
But, actually she's already...

94
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:08,379
Shut up and go on upstairs!

95
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,979
I'm going to go take a bath.

96
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,579
Seriously. How dare that brat to talk to me like that.

97
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,879
A secret window?

98
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,279
"16 years old Megumi" -Yes, Hiromi and I call it that.

99
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,779
It seems that Dad actually wanted to use this as a door, though.

100
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,779
When I was little and getting into things in the garage,

101
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,979
I would always be scolded from here.

102
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,579
"Police Station" -The record of the testimonies of Sakihara and Takahashi?

103
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:03,879
Yes. I'd like to take a quick look and review the results.

104
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,379
Did anything new come up in later investigations?

105
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,479
According to one of Hiromi's friends,

106
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,379
the late Hiromi seems to have

107
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,779
taken two boyfriends away from Megumi, in her younger days.

108
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,079
Well, I guess you could say that she was very carefree.

109
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,479
It seems that Hiromi was only fooling around for the fun of it.

110
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:31,579
But, it seems that when Megumi decided to marry Sakihara,

111
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,279
although jokingly, she warned Hiromi saying that if she did it again,

112
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,779
she would make her pay for it.

113
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,179
Pops'll probably come up with some sort of

114
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:48,379
circumstantial evidence in his investigation.

115
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,879
But, when it comes to concrete evidence...

116
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,879
I see. Maybe...

117
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,179
Inspector, about what I asked you over the phone a while ago...

118
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,879
Yes. I confirmed with Takahashi,

119
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,879
but the only time he saw her face was at that supermarket.

120
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,379
That's the first and last time he ever appeared before Megumi.

121
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,379
And, how was Takahashi dressed at that time?

122
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,179
He was wearing a jacket and sunglasses.

123
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,379
Just as I thought.

124
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,979
Mouri, what are you up to anyway?

125
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:40,779
Thank you very much, inspector. Goodbye.

126
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,679
Hey, Mouri?

127
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,079
Okay. So, now I've got proof.

128
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,968
What? What do you mean?

129
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,568
Hey, Dad?

130
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:32,568
He hung up.

131
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,468
What's the matter, Ran?

132
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:40,268
Dad's in Akihabara now and says he's going to Megumi's house from now.

133
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:44,368
He said that he is the only one who can persuade her.

134
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,668
I wonder what he means?

135
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:50,168
Ran, let's go to Megumi's house, too!

136
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,168
Seriously.

137
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,868
Why'd you guys have to come, too?

138
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:59,968
I'm sorry, but I was really concerned over your call.

139
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,668
Sorry to keep you waiting.

140
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,368
Thank you very much.

141
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:15,768
And, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?

142
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:21,068
Megumi, I came here today to advise you to turn yourself in.

143
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,568
Hey, Dad.

144
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,168
After finding out that your husband and your younger sister

145
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,268
were having an affair,

146
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:43,768
as an exchange murder was being planned between your husband and Takahashi,

147
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:45,868
you decided to use all this

148
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:49,368
to kill your younger sister that you have always hated

149
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,368
and send your husband to jail on charges of murder, isn't that right?

150
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:57,468
Dad. What a thing to say.

151
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:03,768
Two months ago, you bought a wire-tap

152
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,968
and automatic recorder at a shop in Akihabara.

153
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,668
You asked the salesperson to give you

154
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:10,168
the details on how to use the machines.

155
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:14,168
These are the same modular-type wiretap

156
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,968
and automatic recorder that you bought.

157
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:19,368
I didn't want to do it,

158
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,668
but when I went to the restroom a while ago,

159
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,168
I checked out the upstairs study.

160
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:29,068
You rigged a wire-tap to your husband's study

161
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:32,368
and bugged his conversations with Takahashi.

162
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:35,968
The remains of masking tape being peeled off from the wall is proof.

163
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,968
You were probably planning to listen to the conversation

164
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,868
between your husband and your younger sister at first, weren't you?

165
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:49,668
But, along the way, you find out something awesomely terrible.

166
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:52,468
That is, your husband had agreed

167
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:55,068
to an exchange murder with a complete stranger

168
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,968
and that he had already killed the wife of that man.

169
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:03,868
The time came when it was your turn to be killed by that man Takahashi.

170
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:07,768
You found out that he is planning to rig your car with an explosive,

171
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:11,768
but is undecided, because if he does so in front of your house,

172
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,868
your husband Kazuo, may turn up as a suspect, too.

173
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,968
Therefore, you deliberately tell your husband

174
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,968
that you are driving over to Hiromi's,

175
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,368
because her car just happens

176
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,368
to be at the service station for a safety check,

177
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,668
and the garage is open.

178
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:31,168
Your husband then goes out to a payphone

179
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:34,168
and tells Takahashi all that you told him.

180
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:36,668
Although you didn't listen to their phone conversation,

181
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:41,068
almost positive that Takahashi was going to carry out his murder plan,

182
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:43,268
you went over to Hiromi's.

183
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:47,468
And, after telling Hiromi that you were not good at reversing,

184
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:51,568
you made her back the car out of the garage for you.

185
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,968
Just as you had expected, your younger sister died.

186
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:03,068
But, at that time, just one thing that you didn't expect happened.

187
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,768
I happened to come and see you.

188
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,168
You were surprised and...

189
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:11,668
Wait, Mr. Mouri!

190
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:12,868
Okay!

191
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,368
You wanted her to back out right away

192
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:21,068
because you didn't want me to see through your plan.

193
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:30,968
I did buy the wiretap as you say.

194
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:35,468
I set it up behind the desk after suspecting

195
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,068
my husband of having an affair with someone.

196
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,868
But, I thought it over right away and immediately disposed of it.

197
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,668
Therefore, I didn't actually use it!

198
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:44,768
Did you know that the person he was having an affair with

199
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,668
was your younger sister?

200
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:48,568
I didn't know at all.

201
00:15:57,368 --> 00:16:00,268
Let's presume... This is just a presumption now,

202
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:02,668
that I did act as you had deduced,

203
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,668
what charges am I guilty for?

204
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,468
Takashi is the one who rigged the explosive onto the car,

205
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:16,168
and the person who made him do it is my husband.

206
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:20,868
All I did, if anything is make my younger sister get into a car

207
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:23,168
that was maybe rigged with an explosive.

208
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,468
I'm not an accomplice in a crime,

209
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,768
nor did urge anyone to commit murder for me.

210
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:30,268
Isn't that right, Mr. Mouri?

211
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,568
Just as expected of a student in the law department,

212
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:37,468
and a daughter of a lawyer.

213
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:42,068
Just as you say,

214
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,368
if all you did was get your younger sister to ride the car,

215
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,268
you wouldn't be found guilty of anything.

216
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,868
-Why then... -However,

217
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:52,668
in the case that you made your sister get in the car

218
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:55,368
despite knowing that an explosive was rigged to the car,

219
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,268
or if the possibility that you knew was very high.

220
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,668
You will be charged with homicide!

221
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,868
You mentioned back then

222
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:09,368
that you had to look for something and went into the closet alone.

223
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:12,968
Then, you were watching the garage from the window.

224
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:16,268
And, just as expected, Takahashi came into the garage

225
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,368
to set the explosive onto the car.

226
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,568
After you confirmed all that,

227
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:25,468
you asked your sister to back the car out.

228
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:29,468
In other words, there was a very high possibility

229
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:31,468
that the explosive was being rigged to the car,

230
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,868
and you still made your sister ride it.

231
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,568
Do you have any proof

232
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,568
that I was watching the garage through the closet?

233
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,768
If you do, please show it to me right now!

234
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,968
Right this minute!

235
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,768
You've got proof, Pops.

236
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,668
Remember? The sketch of the man that Megumi said she saw,

237
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:55,568
that was drawn by police officer Honjo.

238
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:04,268
Megumi, where did you say you saw his face?

239
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:06,668
At the supermarket near my house.

240
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:11,868
Strange. The officer mentioned

241
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:15,168
that Takahashi was wearing a jacket and sunglasses back then.

242
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:18,768
But, why is the man in the sketch not wearing sunglasses?

243
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:27,068
Megumi, isn't it true that you didn't even notice

244
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:29,768
Takahashi was watching you at the supermarket?

245
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:34,668
You found out only after you listened to the conversation

246
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:37,768
between Kazuo and Takahashi that you tapped, right?

247
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,768
Then where did she see his face?

248
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,368
From the closet!

249
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,768
She saw him from the secret window of the closet!

250
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:04,468
Megumi, you were watching Takahashi's face

251
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:07,968
from the closet of your parental home.

252
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:11,868
The face of Takahashi who was setting up the explosive.

253
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:15,468
How... how can you be so sure?

254
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:20,368
That day, Takahashi who didn't want anybody to notice him,

255
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,668
was wearing sunglasses until he entered the garage.

256
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:26,768
Of course, he was his sunglasses when coming out, too.

257
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:31,968
However, there was just one time he had to take off his sunglasses.

258
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:37,668
It was when he was setting the explosive onto the car.

259
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:44,468
Because nobody would even dream of doing a dangerous job

260
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:49,468
like setting up an explosive onto a car while wearing sunglasses.

261
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:56,768
In other words, this sketch of Takahashi without his sunglasses

262
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:59,368
is proof that you witnessed Takahashi

263
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:02,268
rigging the explosive to the car in the garage.

264
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:19,968
Just as you say, I happened to hear them.

265
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:24,768
He was planning to kill me

266
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:26,268
and use the insurance money that I was covered with

267
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,368
together with the inheritance money my parents left for me

268
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,368
to open a new boutique that Hiromi was to own.

269
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:36,768
I remember the good old days.

270
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:47,268
I was really happy in those days.

271
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:52,668
I kept hoping that I could go back to those good old days all this time.

272
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:58,668
But...

273
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:01,968
15 years ago.

274
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:04,668
There was something very important

275
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:08,168
that I was supposed to have taught you.

276
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,668
Something more important than studying.

277
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:18,268
But, maybe I can't really teach you much

278
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,068
since I'm separated with my wife and all now.

279
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:21,468
True.

280
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:25,568
But, it's never too late.

281
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:26,868
Repent for the crime that you have committed

282
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,268
and study all over again.

283
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,468
This time, the study of life!

284
00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:36,568
Will you watch over me then again?

285
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:39,068
Sure. By all means.

286
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,068
"Mouri Detective Agency"

287
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:28,068
It's a good thing that the case was solved, but...

288
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:32,368
This case must've really come as a shock to Pops.

289
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,968
Yes, the Mouri Detective Agency.

290
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:44,268
What? Yoko?

291
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:48,668
A concert? Of course, I'll go.

292
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,768
If for you, I'll go and cheer for you or tutor.

293
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,668
I'll do anything you wish! Yes!

294
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:57,268
I guess we've got nothing to worry about...

295
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:01,768
Really. It takes Pops no time at all to get back on his feet.

296
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,668
"Next episode" -It bothers me.

297
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:10,068
I met him somewhere, but I can't remember where.

298
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,368
A MO disc?

299
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,068
What's this?

300
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:19,268
I don't remember buying this.

301
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:21,768
The old man who disappeared.

302
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:24,268
The man wearing sunglasses.

303
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:27,068
Something... something smells fishy!

304
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:29,568
Next Conan,

305
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,389
"The Old Man Disappears"

306
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,570
Next Conan's Hint:

307
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,270
"Window Glass"

308
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,470
The next episode has to do with a mysterious old man.

309
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,370
Gosh, the young people nowadays...

310
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,470
That's what they all say when they get old.
