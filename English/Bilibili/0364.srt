1
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,840
Today's case is a very odd one.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Identical twins are killed at the same time in different towns.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,440
Such a thing is just not possible!

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,240
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,125
"Beika Sports Center"

8
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,025
"Shoichiro Hitomi, (45)" -I beg you, give me a few more days.

9
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,025
Just a while longer!

10
00:02:27,825 --> 00:02:30,225
I've waited and waited all this time.

11
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:32,025
I can't wait any longer.

12
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,225
Why don't you ask your younger brother for help?

13
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,925
If only I could do so...

14
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:48,925
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 1)"

15
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:56,325
What shall I do? What can I do?

16
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,025
Men's room.

17
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,225
-Hello? -Oh, Dad.

18
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, Ran.

19
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,525
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Dad, what about lunch?

20
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,025
Do you think that you'll be coming home?

21
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,825
I'm still working.

22
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,625
Okay, then I'm going with Ran

23
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,525
to the "Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat Buffet"

24
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:43,225
so keep up your good work, Pops.

25
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,125
The Super Cheap All-You-Can Eat place?

26
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:58,125
But he really takes a long time.

27
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,325
Wait, could it be that he noticed me?

28
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,925
What the...

29
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,625
He seems like a totally different person from a while ago.

30
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,725
Oh, well.

31
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,625
"Beika Hotel"

32
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,225
Dad.

33
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:53,325
You two... what brings you both here?

34
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,525
I mentioned it over the phone, didn't I?

35
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,625
Over there.

36
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,425
"Adult 980 yen, Child 600 yen" -Look.

37
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,525
"Restaurant Chuka Cuisine Buffet"

38
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,925
So this is where you two were talking about.

39
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:06,125
Oh, I mean this is no time for something like this.

40
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,325
Excuse me!

41
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,625
I'm Minamizato of room 1050,

42
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,225
"Kaoru Minamizato, (25)" -Uh...

43
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,625
Do you have something for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

44
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,025
No, ma'am.

45
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,525
It can't be because I got a call a while ago

46
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,725
saying that the package was delivered here.

47
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,425
Please check carefully once more.

48
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,925
Oops...

49
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,325
We don't seem to have anything for you after all.

50
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:49,425
I see.

51
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:58,625
It's good.

52
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,725
I feel bad for dad, though.

53
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:03,425
It can't be helped because he's working.

54
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,525
What happened?

55
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,025
-A man fell. -What is it?

56
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:14,425
Conan!

57
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:17,325
It was the man we saw just a while ago!

58
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,825
Which means that...

59
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:19,925
Pops!

60
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,425
How can something like this happen?

61
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,825
While I was tailing him...

62
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:44,325
Shoichiro Hitomi, age 45.

63
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,425
I've been tailing him since this morning.

64
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:49,725
However, please do not ask me who asked me to do so.

65
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:53,325
What on earth happened?

66
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,125
Let me explain.

67
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:46,725
I didn't want him to know that I was tailing him but...

68
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,425
No! Don't!

69
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,325
What's wrong?

70
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:52,825
Is anything the matter?

71
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,825
Don't tell me that...

72
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:05,725
Are you okay?

73
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,925
You're...

74
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:18,025
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

75
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,625
Just what are you talking about?

76
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,325
Never mind that, hurry and get down from there!

77
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,625
No, please overlook this.

78
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,025
Ms. Minamizato,

79
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,725
what is your connection with Mr. Shoichiro Hitomi?

80
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,125
I don't know.

81
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,125
Huh?

82
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,325
I'd like to ask you that question myself.

83
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:59,725
Who on earth is this Mr. Hitomi?

84
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:03,125
He tried to attack you, you know.

85
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,025
What do you mean you don't know?

86
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,025
It can't be the case.

87
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:10,625
It's true! I really don't know who he is!

88
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,925
But...

89
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,325
-Ms. Kaoru Minamizato. -Yes, sir?

90
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:18,325
That's the name you registered on the guest list,

91
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,925
but isn't your real name Kanako Hitomi?

92
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:25,325
And, who's that supposed to be?

93
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:29,425
The wife of Shoichiro's younger brother, Takehiko.

94
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:34,125
No, inspector, I've seen Kanako in a picture but...

95
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,825
Why did you think so?

96
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,825
When I checked the history of incoming calls on Shoichiro's cell phone,

97
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:45,225
the last person he had called to was Kanako Hitomi.

98
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:48,525
Calls? What time was it?

99
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,225
11.20am.

100
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,225
Oh, if so...

101
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,825
He went in at 11.10am

102
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:58,125
and came out at 11.30am.

103
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,925
I guess, Shoichiro...

104
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:06,525
He called his brother's wife from inside the toilet during this time.

105
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,925
May I be excused, now?

106
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,825
I'm sorry, I'd like to be left alone.

107
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:21,725
The name was Anzai, wasn't it?

108
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:27,725
You know, the name you mentioned at the front desk a while ago.

109
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:31,225
Is there anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

110
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,325
I know Mr. Anzai.

111
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,225
Is anything wrong with that?

112
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,525
No.

113
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:50,125
Gosh. What an outright lie to say she doesn't know Shoichiro.

114
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,125
Maybe she really doesn't know him.

115
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,325
No darn way!

116
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,825
Huh?

117
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,025
What happened?

118
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:00,525
Pops, don't you think this is strange?

119
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,925
What's strange?

120
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:05,625
Because Shoichiro had a cell phone, didn't he?

121
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,125
Then why did he use the public phone?

122
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,525
Maybe his phone was out of the service area.

123
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:13,625
It doesn't seem to be so.

124
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,225
Look.

125
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,725
True.

126
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,725
Mouri! Bad news!

127
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,325
What's the matter?

128
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,325
Look at that TV over there.

129
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,325
This is the site of the crime, Haido Condo.

130
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,225
The man who was killed is...

131
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,025
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -It's Takehiko,

132
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,325
Mr. Shoichiro's younger brother.

133
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,125
The same age...

134
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,825
You mean...

135
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,425
they're twins!

136
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,925
The estimated time of death

137
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,125
is around 12.15pm in the afternoon today.

138
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,325
No way. 12.15pm is when Shoichiro...

139
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,525
It happened at the same time?

140
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:54,925
No way. Is something like that possible?

141
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,247
What?

142
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:07,247
The one that asked you to investigate on Shoichiro

143
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:10,947
was his younger brother, Takehiko who was killed at Haido-cho?

144
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,047
Yes.

145
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:17,647
And, what did Takehiko want you to do?

146
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,547
To check on his behavior.

147
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:23,247
According to Takehiko, Shoichiro, because of the fact that

148
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,847
they were identical twins who looked exactly alike,

149
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:31,647
may have been posing to be him and doing fraudulent business.

150
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,447
Oh, and what did you come up with?

151
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,547
Nothing definite yet.

152
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,647
But he really did have a large amount of debt,

153
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,947
and he was being pressured by the loan-sharks

154
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,647
to return the money this morning.

155
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,847
Which means...

156
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,847
that Shoichiro came to Beika Hotel

157
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,447
because he came up with some good idea to pay the money back?

158
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,747
Synchronicity!

159
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:58,347
What's with you, shouting out of the blue?

160
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,147
To think that the older and younger brother who were twins

161
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,547
died at the same time,

162
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,047
seems to be a coincidence...

163
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,547
However, maybe that's not all there is to it.

164
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:10,347
Maybe there was something more fateful involved there.

165
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,447
You mean that's synchro...

166
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,547
Synchronicity.

167
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:17,847
That's the theory that Psychologist Jung came up with.

168
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:26,547
You know, maybe it's the same as how we ran into you at this hotel, dad.

169
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:30,147
I see, I guess you could say so.

170
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,747
There is a possibility of it being a coincidence,

171
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:34,547
but I wonder...

172
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,647
Right, everything fits in too well.

173
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:41,047
We've got to scrutinize that two cases more closely.

174
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,047
The door was locked.

175
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,947
There are no signs of the door being forced opened either.

176
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,247
What an odd looking key hole.

177
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,247
It wouldn't be easy to make a spare key.

178
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,347
Was he killed here?

179
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:15,047
As you can see, the window is cracked from the outside.

180
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:18,047
It seems to have been a robbery.

181
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:23,847
If Takehiko was really killed by someone who broke in to rob him,

182
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:27,547
it would have nothing to do with the case in Beika-cho.

183
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:30,147
Could it actually be a mere coincidence?

184
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:37,347
"Kanako Hitomi, (36)" -You returned home around 2pm,

185
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:42,547
saw your husband dead, and called the police?

186
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,547
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:46,147
And, where did you return home from?

188
00:14:46,147 --> 00:14:48,047
Beika-cho.

189
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:51,547
-Beika-cho? -Beika...

190
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:55,847
Is anything wrong?

191
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:58,747
Is this supposed to be synchronicity too?

192
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:03,247
We were at Beika-cho just before coming here.

193
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:05,647
I see.

194
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:09,747
Shoichiro fell to his death from Beika Hotel.

195
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,547
Shoichiro did...

196
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,947
Oh no, is that true?

197
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,347
It's true.

198
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:20,247
Could it be that you went to Beika-cho

199
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,647
to meet Shoichiro there?

200
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,947
The thing is, we found after checking the outgoing calls

201
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:28,947
that he made on his cell phone, that he had called you.

202
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,247
Yes.

203
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:36,447
Please tell us what he wanted to talk to you about.

204
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,547
Shoichiro mentioned that

205
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,347
he wanted to make up with my husband

206
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:43,847
and asked me to act as their go-between.

207
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,847
Oh, make up.

208
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,147
Yes.

209
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,047
The thing is...

210
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,347
Shoichiro and Takehiko

211
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:56,047
had been working at father's company for quite some time

212
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:59,447
and there were times when the subject of

213
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,047
who will be succeeding father came up.

214
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,247
However, just about then, father suddenly passed away.

215
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,347
Why is it you?

216
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,747
Why are you, my kid brother, the president?

217
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:13,647
Don't ask me, it was in father's will!

218
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,347
Well, it is not hard to understand why dad picked me.

219
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,447
What?

220
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,247
I hear your wife went back to her home country.

221
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,147
Didn't you realize that she was only after your money?

222
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:27,047
That's what father based his decision on.

223
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,547
Shut up!

224
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,647
You're fired. Get out of here, this minute!

225
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:40,047
"Hitomi's Trade Company" -Shoichiro then started a company of his own

226
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,847
but, it didn't work out either and went bankrupt

227
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,347
leaving him deeply in debt.

228
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,447
Then, several nights ago...

229
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:55,747
I apologize. Please, I was wrong.

230
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:58,447
So, please...

231
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:01,047
No, I beg you.

232
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,047
I... I need money...

233
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,847
I don't owe you anything.

234
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:20,147
If only...

235
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,947
If only you weren't here...

236
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:26,747
I wanted them to make up

237
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,447
and become the two brothers that I had know before.

238
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,047
Therefore,

239
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,847
without letting my husband know,

240
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:36,647
I secretly gave Shoichiro my cell phone number,

241
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,047
as well as the spare key to the house.

242
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,747
On the other hand, Takehiko thinking that Shoichiro

243
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,947
being as cornered as he was,

244
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:50,347
may scheme up something using his name,

245
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:52,847
asked me to keep an eye on him.

246
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,847
To think that both of them would die at the same time...

247
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,647
Is this a coincidence...

248
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,447
or rather, some work of fate?

249
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:06,147
What did Shoichiro want when he called Kanako?

250
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:09,847
Didn't you hear? He wanted to make up with his brother.

251
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:12,247
Rather, please, I'd like to know too.

252
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,647
Could you tell us more in detail what the call was about?

253
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:15,947
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,647
-Hello? -Is Takehiko there?

255
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,047
Yes, he is. Would you like me to get him?

256
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:30,347
No, never mind.

257
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,447
I see.

258
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:36,847
Rather, I'd like to discuss something with you, Kanako.

259
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:40,047
I'd like to make up with Takehiko,

260
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,347
but I wonder if you could act as go-between for us.

261
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,947
Really? That's great.

262
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,247
Yes, of course, I'd be happy to!

263
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:50,147
Will you please come meet me at Beika-cho then?

264
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,647
Where in Beika-cho?

265
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,747
Beika Station at 12.30pm in front of the wicket.

266
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:56,947
Bye.

267
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:59,947
"Beika Station"

268
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:03,947
But, although I waited for quite some time,

269
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,447
Shoichiro never showed up.

270
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:14,547
I had no idea that things would turn out this way.

271
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,847
I wonder if he was planning to see her

272
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,547
after he finished what he had to do at Beika Hotel.

273
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,947
I guess so.

274
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:36,747
Only, that's if we believe Kanako's story.

275
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:39,547
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.

276
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,147
For instance, for her to sneak into Takehiko's house

277
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,747
using that tree over there,

278
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,047
no matter how you look at it,

279
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,347
it's impossible for her to do so.

280
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:53,347
I guess so, which means that it is a robbery case after all.

281
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:55,247
If so...

282
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:59,447
The two cases are not related to each other in any way.

283
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:02,947
It can only be explained as a case of "synchronicity".

284
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:06,947
But, just to be on the safe side, let's check on Kanako's alibi too.

285
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:08,247
Alibi?

286
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,247
If Shoichiro didn't die...

287
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:15,347
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako" -He would've met with Kanako

288
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,747
and they would both have a perfect alibi.

289
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:20,047
This would exclude them from

290
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:22,347
the suspect list of Takehiko's homicide case.

291
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,447
But...

292
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:26,547
Shoichiro fell to his death in Beika.

293
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:30,247
And, another character, Kaoru Minamizato comes into the picture.

294
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,947
Although this case involved a simple relationship

295
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,147
between two brothers and the wife,

296
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,147
"Shoichiro, Minamizato" -the appearance of Kaoru

297
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,747
makes the structure of the case even more complex.

298
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,947
Kaoru Minamizato.

299
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:42,947
Who on earth is she anyway?

300
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:47,247
But I really don't know who he is!

301
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,547
How can you say you don't know him?

302
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,547
He attacked you, didn't he, Shoichiro?

303
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:56,747
He must've hand a grudge on you or jealous of you or something.

304
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,547
You don't know him.

305
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:01,547
That's something that is totally unbelievable.

306
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,747
Just what do I have to do to get you to believe me?

307
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,047
Please tell us the truth!

308
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,047
It's true, I'm not lying!

309
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,547
Why would I lie to you after going through

310
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,647
something frightening like that?

311
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,447
God, you tell me...

312
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,847
Why... why is it like this?

313
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,947
Why?

314
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,247
Why is this all happening to me?

315
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:34,647
The incident in Haido-cho is a homicide

316
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,547
so investigation will continue

317
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,147
but this incident can probably be closed as an accident.

318
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,547
Is this a mere accident?

319
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,047
Well, it's true that the fact that Shoichiro falling to his death

320
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,647
was an accident,

321
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,647
but what about the fact that he attacked Kaoru?

322
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:49,947
Assault and battery.

323
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,847
Maybe it's a case of attempted homicide.

324
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:54,347
Even so, the case is closed through the death of the suspect

325
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,647
and when the necessary papers are turned in.

326
00:21:56,647 --> 00:21:58,747
How can it be?

327
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:01,547
I'm sure she's hiding something, though.

328
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:04,147
I wonder if she's trying to protect someone.

329
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,847
I'm sure the press will pursue this case though as an odd case,

330
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,647
in which twin brothers died at the same time

331
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,847
in two separate places.

332
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,247
Maybe it's "synchronicity" after all.

333
00:22:14,247 --> 00:22:16,847
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong, that's not it.

334
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:19,547
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

335
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,047
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

336
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:25,647
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

337
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:29,347
Why did Shoichiro attack,

338
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:32,147
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

339
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:33,947
For what reason?

340
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:06,047
"Next Episode"

341
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:07,947
Dad, nab him.

342
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,047
Okay!

343
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,847
I'm so sorry!

344
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,747
It's the answer to solving both cases.

345
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:21,347
In other words, a frightening perfect crime was being schemed.

346
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:23,847
Perfect crime?

347
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:25,547
Next Conan,

348
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,547
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 2)"

349
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:32,474
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:34,674
"Detective Kogoro's investigation"

351
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,574
In the next episode, Pop's investigation comes in really handy.

352
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:38,974
-How unusual. -Really?
