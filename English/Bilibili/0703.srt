1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,424
I participated in the Bell Tree Express event

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:06,024
with the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,124
Ran and the others.

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:12,924
Suspicious passengers are gathered in car number 8.

5
00:00:12,924 --> 00:00:16,424
The deduction quiz that is held on the train,

6
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:20,224
in the wink of an eye turns into a locked room murder.

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,924
In the mean time, the dark shadow of the Organization

8
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:28,724
closes in on Haibara.

9
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:32,024
Aim for a 100% solution.

10
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,424
Clear all mysteries and codes.

11
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:36,524
A mysterious character and queer trick.

12
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:38,624
Destiny closes in on the speeding train.

13
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,124
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult!

15
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:44,724
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:34,562
"Pitch Black Mystery Express Train (Crossing)"

17
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:37,362
The fire five years ago?

18
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:41,162
What does that have to do with me?

19
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,762
No use playing dumb.

20
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,162
We confirmed just a while ago

21
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:46,262
with the Shizuoka Prefectural Police

22
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:48,262
that was in charge of the incident.

23
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:51,762
We found your name among the people who were rescued.

24
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,362
Isn't that right?

25
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,062
Kendo friends with a rich ex-member of the Self-Defence Force

26
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:58,262
who died in the fire, aren't you Mr. Taisaku Noto?

27
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,362
Oh, yeah.

28
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:03,162
The scar on my cheek is what I got back then.

29
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,162
But, it's not that I was hiding it.

30
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:06,762
Come to think of it, you...

31
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,062
when we first met,

32
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,962
you were carrying something over your shoulder, weren't you?

33
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,462
Maybe you had the tool that you used

34
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:15,962
for the locked room murder trick in there?

35
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,962
That's just a mere bamboo sword!

36
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,662
Bamboo sword?

37
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:24,762
See. Only the bamboo sword is inside, right?

38
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,862
I promised to have a match with a friend of mine

39
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,662
in Nagoya later!

40
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,762
At any rate, if you're done...

41
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,862
Then, sir.

42
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:37,162
Will you run along the corridor for me?

43
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:38,362
Run?

44
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:39,362
Yep!

45
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:43,462
We may have seen the rear view of the culprit when he fled.

46
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:47,862
I'd like to take a movie of you running.

47
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,762
I, indeed am Ando

48
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:53,962
who was rescued along with Mr. Murobashi

49
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,862
from the fire back then.

50
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,862
I didn't mention it because you didn't ask.

51
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:03,362
By the way, what is that big bag you have in your room?

52
00:04:03,362 --> 00:04:07,362
Oh, that's a picture that I was asked to appraise.

53
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,862
Unfortunately, it was fake, though.

54
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,962
May take a look at it?

55
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,762
Yes.

56
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:20,662
It's sure is heavy.

57
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,962
The frame is pure gold, you see.

58
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:26,162
I see, pure gold, eh.

59
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,162
By the way, what was your relationship

60
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:30,462
with the rich man who died in the fire?

61
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,862
He was a collector of fine arts,

62
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:36,262
so I introduced a lot of masterpieces to him.

63
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:41,062
But, almost all of them burned in the fire.

64
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:44,462
But, it's so very heavy. You're pretty strong

65
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,462
being able to carry something like this alone.

66
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,662
Huh? Oh, well, sort of.

67
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:53,462
Then, will you run along the corridor for me, sir?

68
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:59,562
Yes. I can't forget about that fire.

69
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:02,462
Because thanks to that fire,

70
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:06,662
I need this wheelchair to take care of me.

71
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,562
You hurt your legs in the fire?

72
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:13,162
Yes. That's why I can't run along the corridor

73
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,662
like the others.

74
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:18,262
But your maid Ms. Sumitomo can, can't she?

75
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:24,062
All... all I have to do is run?

76
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:27,362
Yeah. Like you always do.

77
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,362
It's hard to believe that the culprit can be specified

78
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:35,062
doing something like this, though.

79
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,862
Granny,

80
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,462
your maid runs pretty fast,

81
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:43,162
was she into sports or something?

82
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,862
Please answer me.

83
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,862
Granny.

84
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:57,262
It's true that I was the fiance

85
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,762
of the grandson of the rich man who died in the fire,

86
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,062
and it's also true that

87
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,362
I was rescued from the burning flames too.

88
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,362
But, what does that have to do with me

89
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,962
running along the corridor for you?

90
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:10,162
Just to be safe.

91
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,462
Please just unlock your door and let me into your room.

92
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:17,762
If you insist on coming in, bring a search warrant!

93
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,462
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,962
Then, did that wristwatch that you said

95
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:25,462
you found in your room, has it rung since?

96
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,162
Wristwatch?

97
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:32,562
As you can see, it's left where it is, but it hasn't rung.

98
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,462
Huh? Where?

99
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:37,562
See! It's on the sofa.

100
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:40,462
I can't see from just this space.

101
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:43,062
Huh? Wait a sec.

102
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:46,962
I got a glimpse of it when Mr. Murobashi's body was found.

103
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,262
From between the space of the door,

104
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:52,662
the trace of the bullet on the sofa that was beyond the corpse.

105
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:05,362
I somehow convinced her run through the corridor,

106
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,962
but I wonder if there was any meaning to it?

107
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,662
I'll go show the children the movie I took anyway!

108
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:12,662
Okay!

109
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,662
Hey! Are you listening, kid?

110
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,462
Hey?

111
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:06,562
Who are you?

112
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:11,962
I'm asking you, who are you?

113
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,662
You haven't changed.

114
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,862
Masumi...

115
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,962
Shu...

116
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:34,262
Big Brother Shu?

117
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:36,462
Are you really Big Brother Shu?

118
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,562
But, why?

119
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,362
I heard that you died, Big Brother Shu...

120
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,462
I wanted to hear that from you.

121
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,262
Is something the matter?

122
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,662
No need to worry.

123
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,862
My little sister's anemic.

124
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,962
Oh, is that so...

125
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:02,062
"Proceed with the plan. Obstacle taken care of."

126
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:20,612
What's the problem?

127
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:23,012
Why did you call us out to the corridor?

128
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:25,212
It seems they've come up with something.

129
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:28,612
Oh, no. We're still in the midst of investigation.

130
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:31,512
But, that boy came to get us.

131
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,012
He said that you'd be starting

132
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:36,112
the Sleeping Kogoro Deduction Show.

133
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:39,112
But, you said so, right, Pops?

134
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,912
That you've figured out what went on!

135
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:45,412
Idiot! I was just speaking of an example.

136
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:55,612
It's come!

137
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,312
The Sleeping Kogoro!

138
00:09:57,312 --> 00:10:01,012
Now that Mr. Mouri's taken that pose.

139
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:03,712
He's solved the case.

140
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,912
The truth of the locked room murder

141
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,512
that was committed in room B.

142
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,212
Who are you?

143
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:12,412
Oh, I'm sorry,

144
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,112
I'm Mr. Mouri's number one disciple, Amuro.

145
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:19,112
Ai's not there?

146
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:20,412
No.

147
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,812
I looked in the restrooms of the cars nearby too, but...

148
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:29,112
Oh, it's mail from Ai.

149
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:32,412
I'm okay so don't worry about me.

150
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,012
That's what's written.

151
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:37,312
It's definitely Ai's mail address, but...

152
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:40,012
Maybe she's with Conan?

153
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,412
I'm sure!

154
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,812
We wanted to go there too, right?

155
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:47,512
If she did, she should've said so first!

156
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:54,112
Right. The locked room murder...

157
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,112
That mystery was solved

158
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:59,512
the second time we visited Ms. Idenami's room E.

159
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:01,312
Hey, what's this about?

160
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,512
Are you saying that I'm the culprit?

161
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,012
I realized after I looked into your room

162
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,712
from the space between the chain locked door of your room.

163
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,812
If the door is chain locked,

164
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,712
no matter how much we look inside,

165
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:16,912
we can't possibly see the sofa that's on the other side!

166
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:21,412
But, when Conan found Mr. Murobashi's body in room B,

167
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,212
despite the door having been chain locked,

168
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:27,712
he said that the sofa to the right was in view.

169
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,612
Maybe that boy mistook what he saw?

170
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:32,912
That's probably...

171
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:34,812
because that room's chain lock

172
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:38,512
had more number of loops than the other rooms, no?

173
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,912
Therefore, the space between the door opened wider.

174
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:42,412
So, the range of vision that could be seen from outside

175
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,112
also expanded!

176
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:47,012
Is that a problem?

177
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,912
A great problem.

178
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:50,612
A chain lock is usually made

179
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,712
so that even if a hand were to be inserted

180
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,912
between the door from outside,

181
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,612
it cannot be opened, but...

182
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:59,812
If there is one chain loop more, making the chain longer,

183
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,212
it would be possible to lock the room

184
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,412
even after leaving the room, you see.

185
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:11,012
Oh, hey!

186
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,712
No! You can't look at the name list!

187
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:15,112
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:18,612
I thought I saw an acquaintance on board, you see.

189
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,912
Please call me, if you need such information!

190
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:23,412
Excuse me.

191
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,312
There are six, as you say!

192
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,412
The chains of the other rooms only have five loops

193
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:39,712
but only the chain of room B here has six loops!

194
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:42,612
So, the locked room mystery has been solved.

195
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,412
But, if someone were to be doing something by the doorway,

196
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,512
wouldn't the conductor have noticed?

197
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,012
That 's true.

198
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:51,712
And he said he was in the corridor the whole time.

199
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:53,812
I did see somebody who was looking this way

200
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,412
through the door, though.

201
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,912
Hey! Who was that?

202
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:00,312
I didn't have a good view.

203
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,012
We were in the tunnel and it was dimly lit too.

204
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,612
Then, that person must be the culprit

205
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,612
who fled to another car.

206
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,912
Someone from the outside could've committed the crime.

207
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,912
Since the conductors who knew our faces

208
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,412
were in the corridor,

209
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,912
none of us in this first class car

210
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:17,412
would've committed such a crime.

211
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,612
But, if that risk were to be worth taking

212
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,812
because of this sound, then what?

213
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:22,912
Huh?

214
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,312
This is the call bell.

215
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:29,112
But who on earth?

216
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,412
Me!

217
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,412
I played the sound of the bell of room B that I rang

218
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:37,612
and recorded in my cell phone a while ago!

219
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:39,912
You heard the bell ringing,

220
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,912
but none of the lamps were lit,

221
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,512
so you went to room A, right?

222
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:47,012
Yeah! Because the bulb for room A was burnt out.

223
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:50,112
That's why I thought that Mr. Noto was calling.

224
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:53,012
That's why Mr. Murobashi of room B

225
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,812
was looking out of his room,

226
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:56,812
watching the conductor and Mr. Noto

227
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,312
arguing with each other, right?

228
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,912
Yeah.

229
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,112
He was on the phone with someone, though.

230
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,112
I see. It was back then, wasn't it,

231
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,612
that the culprit entered room B?

232
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:08,912
The corridors on this train

233
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,312
are narrow enough that opening a door

234
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:12,712
blocks most of the passageway.

235
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,912
If the door of room B were opened,

236
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:18,312
the figure of the culprit coming from the other side of the door

237
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,112
wouldn't be visible from the conductor

238
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:21,612
who is in front of room A.

239
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,912
Yes.

240
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,012
I'm sure that the culprit called Mr. Murobashi and asked him

241
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:26,712
if anything was wrong

242
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,912
because there was a commotion outside.

243
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,912
Moreover, it was when the train was inside the tunnel.

244
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,712
If the culprit called Mr. Murobashi

245
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,112
just before the train entered the tunnel,

246
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:38,412
and what if the culprit who was on the phone

247
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,912
were to come to room B

248
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,912
saying that the reception is bad,

249
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,612
so they'll continue the talk in the room.

250
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,012
This is also a thinkable circumstance.

251
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,512
But, what did the culprit talk to Mr. Murobashi about?

252
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:52,012
About the deduction quiz that is being conducted

253
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:55,412
on board the mystery train.

254
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,612
The culprit passes out fake instruction cards

255
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,612
designating Mr. Murobashi to play the role of the victim,

256
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,512
the culprit to act as the culprit,

257
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,312
and my daughter and her friend

258
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:06,512
to play the role of accomplices.

259
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:09,612
He made the girls and Mr. Murobashi switch rooms

260
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,912
saying that it was to carry out the missing body trick.

261
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,912
Of course, Mr. Murobashi would've reserved

262
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:19,712
room B of the first class car this time too,

263
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,112
so that instruction card was something that was prepared

264
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,812
to deal with any trouble that may come up.

265
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,412
And just to be safe, he chose the children

266
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:27,812
to play the part of detective.

267
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,912
If someone playing the role of the detective

268
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,212
comes to room B of car number 7,

269
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:35,412
the girls would have to stay in that room for a while

270
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:38,512
in order to play the role of accomplices.

271
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,012
Although it looks to be

272
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:41,912
that the trick was seen through right away,

273
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:44,112
and the girls and the children returned to room B in first class

274
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,612
where the murder was committed.

275
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,812
And? I understand up to the point

276
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:52,112
where the culprit moved Mr. Murobashi to room B,

277
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:53,512
but when did the culprit come out?

278
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:56,312
Right! If the culprit killed him after entering room B,

279
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,212
and came out immediately,

280
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,612
then the conductor who was in front of room A

281
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:01,112
would've seen something, right?

282
00:16:01,112 --> 00:16:02,712
But, he didn't see anything.

283
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,912
If so, the one to be suspected is the one

284
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:08,712
who was looking out through the door that the conductor saw...

285
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:10,512
Which door was it?

286
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,912
The door to the very end of the corridor.

287
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:16,212
I saw it when I was in front of room E.

288
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,712
I think it was Mr. Noto's room A.

289
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,712
Hey!

290
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,512
Cut out the unreliable talk!

291
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:25,612
I know the identity of that person!

292
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,612
That's you...

293
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,912
Conductor!

294
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:34,012
Me, the suspicious character?

295
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,712
I'm the culprit?

296
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:36,812
No.

297
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:42,612
What you saw was yourself in front of room E...

298
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:45,912
A mirror. Correct?

299
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,312
Exactly!

300
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:51,212
The culprit had placed mirrors entirely

301
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:53,512
onto the inside of the door of his room,

302
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,712
and when the conductor, called by Ms. Idenami

303
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,612
came in front of room E,

304
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:00,312
the culprit opened the door of his room

305
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,812
so that the conductor wouldn't see him coming out of room B.

306
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,212
But, if the culprit was in room B at that time,

307
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:08,912
how did the culprit open the door to his room?

308
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:11,112
He tied a fishing line to the door knob

309
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,512
and pulled it through the railing of the corridor window,

310
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,812
then pulled it into room B.

311
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:16,912
He then after waiting for the right time,

312
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:20,312
pulled the line and opened the door.

313
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:21,412
Yes.

314
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:22,912
This trick

315
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,812
will not work if the mirror is positioned

316
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,312
too close or too far.

317
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:30,312
Which means that, out of the rooms A, B, C, D and E,

318
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,412
the passenger staying in the room

319
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,812
right in the middle, in room C.

320
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:39,012
Mr. Ando, is the only one who could've carried this out!

321
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:43,612
Strange.

322
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:46,212
I can't get through to Ai, Conan, Dad

323
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:49,012
and even Sera on the phone.

324
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:50,612
I wonder what's going on?

325
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,812
I'm going over to check out the first class car after all!

326
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,112
Oh, hey!

327
00:17:57,112 --> 00:18:00,212
They seem to be right in the middle of the deduction show now,

328
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,412
so I don't think you should intrude.

329
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,412
Mirror?

330
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,812
Just how am I supposed to have carried a large mirror

331
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:16,512
big enough to cover the entire door onto this train?

332
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,212
That picture that you said you were asked to appraise.

333
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,412
If you stick about three mirrors

334
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:25,112
between the canvases of that picture,

335
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:28,112
it seems to be just enough to cover the entire door.

336
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,912
That picture was very heavy too.

337
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:33,312
The frame of the picture is pure gold.

338
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:37,012
No, it's a gold plated wooden frame.

339
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,612
What's heavy is the picture...

340
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,712
Inside the picture, just as Mr. Mouri said...

341
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:47,812
are three mirrors...

342
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:49,812
Judging from the fact that one mirror

343
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,312
is painted with the same color as the door.

344
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:54,012
The mirror seems to have been rigged

345
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:56,012
so that it wouldn't look like one.

346
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,312
Because if left as is, the sign on the door

347
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:02,912
designating room E would reflect on the mirror.

348
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,812
So, Mr. Ando,

349
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:08,712
how do you plan to explain the three mirrors?

350
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:13,212
Please don't say that the mirrors were there to begin with

351
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:14,812
before you were asked to appraise it,

352
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:17,212
and you didn't realize that

353
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:19,712
the picture was abnormally heavy.

354
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:22,312
If need be, we could ask the client

355
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:26,012
who asked you to appraise the picture.

356
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:30,312
That is, if there really is such a person.

357
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:49,012
My. How dare you?

358
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,612
It was my favorite, you know?

359
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:59,112
The one piece that I put into that trunk.

360
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:07,212
Why don't you stop doing things like this already?

361
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,612
Sharon?

362
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,012
Nobody would've guessed.

363
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,112
That the boy would get you, his mother,

364
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,912
involved in our battle.

365
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,912
I was the one who initiated it.

366
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:28,112
If he is the star of the silver screen,

367
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:32,812
I told him to cast the legendary actress of Japan, me!

368
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:34,812
But, how disappointing.

369
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:37,612
I was hoping to learn how to use make-up

370
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,412
to keep glowing even after aging.

371
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,212
However, to find that the great actress

372
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:45,012
Sharon Vineyard was just wearing an old lady's make-up.

373
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:48,112
Oh... It's actually pretty painstaking, you know?

374
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,012
To routinely act as if I'm old.

375
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,312
Never mind that, but the remark that you made

376
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,712
when we passed each other in the corridor.

377
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,312
If we outdo you,

378
00:20:58,312 --> 00:21:01,912
you'll promise to back away from her once and for all...

379
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,012
Just what did you mean by that?

380
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,412
Just exactly that.

381
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:10,912
According to Shinichi, Ai is already on our side.

382
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:14,012
How stupid.

383
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,612
Do you actually think you can outdo us?

384
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:17,912
Did you know?

385
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:21,412
That Shinichi's team is a step ahead right now?

386
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,612
A step ahead?

387
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,312
That girl called Sera who passed out in your room

388
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:27,312
and was left sleeping,

389
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:30,412
has already been carried back to her previous room.

390
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,612
You work quickly, don't you?

391
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,112
But, how strange.

392
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:37,712
The boy's in the midst of the deduction show.

393
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:40,412
I wonder if he has other people to help him?

394
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,012
Beats me. I wonder?

395
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:47,012
We could have a special guest on our side, you know.

396
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:09,212
Big Brother Shu.

397
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,812
Big Brother Shu.

398
00:23:52,412 --> 00:23:54,512
You don't have a chance.

399
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,212
Oh, yes, we do!

400
00:23:56,212 --> 00:24:00,212
Because Shinichi has a hold of Sharon's weak point.

401
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:02,212
Fire? Fire!

402
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,612
Haibara's nowhere in sight.

403
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:15,912
Ai!

404
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,012
Next Conan,

405

"Top-notch Casting"

408

-Gin. Vodka. Bourbon. -What?

409
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:45,212
The names of the liquor that Pops Mouri

410
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,512
-drank in chronological order. -What?
