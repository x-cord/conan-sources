1
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,940
The strings play a murderous tone.

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,740
Annoying human relationships.

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,540
Harmonic tones echo and the case is solved.

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,625
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,725
and went to visit Choichiro Shitara's residence. Pops, Ran and I.

9
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,225
Hasuki had called us

10
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,625
because incomprehensible accidents

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,225
revolving around the famed musical instrument Stradivarius

12
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,425
have been occurring consecutively from the year before last.

13
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,225
Her request was for us to investigate these accidents.

14
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:13,625
However, as soon as we got there,

15
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,525
the annex went up in flames!

16
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,325
Genzaburo who was inside, dies.

17
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,025
Moreover, that night,

18
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:24,025
while Kyosuke was playing the Requiem on his violin,

19
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:27,625
Ayane falls from the 3rd floor to her death.

20
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,025
Left behind are a violin and several traces of things.

21
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,525
What is going on...

22
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:42,225
"Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!"

23
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,225
That's no doubt the bridge of a violin.

24
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:59,625
But, the bridge was on the replica as well as the Stradivarius.

25
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,825
Which means...

26
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,525
there was one more violin.

27
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,225
And one more thing.

28
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,525
There was something that looked like the tip of a chopstick.

29
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,125
And that was...

30
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,725
a tact.

31
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,525
The conductor's staff used in an orchestra.

32
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,025
Yeah, we found something that looked to be the burnt remains of a case.

33
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:21,325
Right, shaped something like this,

34
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,925
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it.

35
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,625
Which means that there was nothing in the case, right?

36
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,725
So that's the story.

37
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,125
But, there is one thing I don't understand...

38
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,825
What is the killer so hung up on?

39
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,625
Come to think of it, Mom told me some time in the past...

40
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,525
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

41
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,225
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

42
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,125
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

43
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,125
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

44
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,025
"Do-Do-Re-Mi-Mi-So"

45
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,925
"Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Do"

46
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,225
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

47
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,325
Well...

48
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,825
There's this thing called a chord.

49
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,525
For example...

50
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,325
This is the "C" chord.

51
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,625
This is "D".

52
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,425
This is "E".

53
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:17,425
Okay...

54
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:25,625
Well? Doesn't this chord make you feel sort of uncomfortable?

55
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,825
Inspector, it's suicide, suicide.

56
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:46,425
The entrance door and the door of the storeroom were both locked up.

57
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,025
In such a locked room, it's impossible.

58
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,625
If Ayane used the chair as a step and jumped out

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,625
the only thing thinkable is suicide.

60
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,525
Then, doesn't it bother you

61
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:59,625
that people with the initials in keeping

62
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,925
with the musical scale, D-E-F-G-A have died.

63
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,825
It's true that before the "A" of Ayane

64
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:09,125
comes Genzaburo's "G". But, it's probably just a coincidence.

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,325
That room was locked too,

66
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:14,225
and the fire was probably caused by him falling asleep while smoking.

67
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:15,925
But...

68
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,025
At any rate, I think we should call it a day...

69
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,125
Dad.

70
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,125
What is it, Ran? What?

71
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,825
Well, after yawning and making a funny looking face,

72
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:34,925
you fall asleep and start your deduction show.

73
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,725
A funny looking face?

74
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:40,725
Right, right, and you also make strange sounds

75
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:42,025
like "hanyah" or whatever.

76
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:43,925
I thought it sounded more like "Hohee"?

77
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,025
No, I think it was "Henyo" the other day.

78
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,325
Right, right, it's this face, this voice!

79
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,925
The Sleeping Kogoro.

80
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,925
He's sure putting on a haughty pose today.

81
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,225
Of course,

82
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,125
because after all I solved the mystery that even you, Inspector,

83
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,325
could not solve despite all your thinking.

84
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:15,725
The truth of what has been happening here at this house from two years ago.

85
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:19,525
But you kept insisting that it was suicide till just a while ago.

86
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:23,125
Well, it was an instant flash of inspiration.

87
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:27,725
Please gather the things I ask for here.

88
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:31,225
After everything's ready please call the four suspects here.

89
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,425
And of course, please don't forget

90
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,925
that famed musical instrument, the Stradivarius.

91
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,125
Okay, what do we bring for you.

92
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,925
No, Officer Takagi, please wait for us in another room.

93
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:41,925
Why?

94
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,025
You'll find out later.

95
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:46,725
Don't come out until I call you, all right?

96
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,425
So, you've figured out who the killer is?

97
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:58,625
Which means you think this is a serial murder case?

98
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,125
Are you referring to Great Uncle Genzaburo and Grandmother Ayane too?

99
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:07,125
Yes, they are all victims that have been killed by one person.

100
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,125
It is most likely that Eimi who tripped over the stairs

101
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,825
and Furuto who fell to his death from the veranda

102
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,125
were also killed by the same person.

103
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,525
"Hasuki Shitara (23), Choichiro's granddaughter" -Oh no.

104
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:20,625
"Choichiro Shitara (72)" -Why would this Stradivarius

105
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,925
have anything to do with solving the mystery?

106
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,125
He's probably figured out who it is was

107
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,225
"Benio Tsumagari (54), Steward" that switched the violin with a replica

108
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,925
then came back here just to return the violin.

109
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:33,225
No. I thought I'd like you to listen to a song I will play

110
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,725
before starting my deduction show.

111
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,025
In other words, a prelude to solving the mystery,

112
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,825
I guess you could say.

113
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,525
Dad?

114
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:47,425
Yes, just like I did in front of you a while ago.

115
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,925
Are you ready?

116
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:55,325
Well... I don't think you should.

117
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,625
Of course you shouldn't.

118
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,425
Just what do you think my Stradivarius is?

119
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,525
Just what do you intend to do

120
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,825
if an amateur like you handles it and scratches it or something

121
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:06,325
Well, well, let's see what he wants to do.

122
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,925
I'm sure he has something in mind.

123
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:11,525
Or, is there some reason why you don't want to let him have it,

124
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,425
Uncle Choichiro.

125
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:17,225
No, I don't. Here...

126
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,025
I'm all ears...

127
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:29,725
So, it was you after all, wasn't it, Kyosuke?

128
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:32,025
You're the one who switched the violin.

129
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,825
Hey, hey, I just handed it over to you

130
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,525
because you said you wanted to play it.

131
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,525
If I remember correctly,

132
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:45,125
the people who handled this violin was in the order as follows.

133
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,125
Kyosuke tuned the violin this afternoon

134
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,525
and handed it over to Hasuki.

135
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:54,025
When she was showing me the violin

136
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,725
fire breaks out at the annex.

137
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:01,025
The Stradivarius that was left on the table

138
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,125
was taken to the storeroom by Ms. Tsumagari.

139
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,825
If the one who switched the violins were either

140
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:10,925
Ms. Tsumagari or Choichiro who could go in and out of the storeroom,

141
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,725
it would have been switched after I played

142
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,225
the violin in Hasuki's room.

143
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:19,025
If my fingerprints are found on the violin,

144
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,525
either one of the two

145
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,025
would've been the one who switched the violin.

146
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:28,425
If so, that person would've let me touch the Stradivarius one more time

147
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:32,325
in order to make unknown when my fingerprints got on the violin.

148
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,825
If it were Kyosuke or Hasuki that did the switch,

149
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,425
it would be the same.

150
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:39,225
They would want me to touch it here.

151
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,125
If my prints are not found on that genuine violin,

152
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:46,525
it would mean that it had been switched to the replica before I played it,

153
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:49,425
and both of you would be suspected.

154
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,325
However, Hasuki and...

155
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,025
Choichiro, as well as Ms. Tsumagari

156
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,625
objected to my touching the Stradivarius.

157
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,725
But, you urged me to go ahead.

158
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,625
In other words, Kyosuke...

159
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,125
this is evidence that you are

160
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,725
the one who had committed the serial murders.

161
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:10,725
Great Uncle... Oh, no...

162
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,625
But, it could be that when Kyosuke was tuning the violin,

163
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,825
it was already the replica.

164
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,325
That's not possible.

165
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,325
With an ear like his...

166
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,025
He would know right off the bat that it's not genuine.

167
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:30,025
Well... But what makes you say he's the murderer?

168
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,525
Ayane's room was locked, and besides...

169
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:36,625
Genzaburo's room that caught fire was also locked.

170
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,125
Hey, kid, show them the stuff.

171
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,825
Okay! Here it is...

172
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:44,925
It's the metal piece that was found in Genzaburo's room.

173
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,125
Take a good look, Inspector,

174
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,025
only the hole on the top part is bent.

175
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,725
If the locked door was destroyed and forced open,

176
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,525
the top and bottom should be bent out of shape.

177
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,025
True.

178
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:10,225
When he found that the firefighter was saying,

179
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,425
that the bolt sticking out of the door,

180
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:14,525
the top part is the knob and the bottom part is the lock.

181
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,625
So from the looks of the direction in which the door was opened,

182
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,725
it doesn't seem to have been locked when it was broken down.

183
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,425
But, when we went back to the burnt remains later

184
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,825
the door key was locked.

185
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,825
Kyosuke locked it.

186
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,325
Back then he pretended that the door was locked

187
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:35,825
and broke it down.

188
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,925
No good, it's locked!

189
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:44,625
When we were all distracted by the sea of flames...

190
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,225
I see.

191
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:52,225
But what has that to do with switching the violin?

192
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:56,925
He used it to make Ayane jump to her death from this room.

193
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,425
What do you mean?

194
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:01,325
But he was in the room downstairs at that time, wasn't he?

195
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:03,625
It was also a trap

196
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,825
to lure Ayane to the window.

197
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,825
Try to imagine...

198
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:12,325
The Stradivarius that she used to stare at every night

199
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,125
as if it were her son is switched for a replica.

200
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,325
Outraged, she destroys the violin.

201
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:18,725
Can you imagine how she felt.

202
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:23,125
She then turns to look towards the window

203
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,725
and listens to the beautiful melody played by Kyosuke.

204
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,425
Hey, kid, show them the other stuff next!

205
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:30,425
Yes, sir!

206
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:47,025
Mr. Mouri, this is...

207
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,825
What is the meaning of this?

208
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:53,525
This is what Ayane saw back then.

209
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:05,188
Don't tell me that Ayane thought that was the real Stradivarius.

210
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:10,788
Yeah, more so, if the Requiem played by Kyosuke

211
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:14,688
from the floor below sounds like the genuine Stradivarius.

212
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:25,288
She used the chair as a stepping stool and climbed up the window,

213
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,388
trying to take the violin...

214
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:33,488
But, I wonder if she'd fall down so easily.

215
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,788
Let me show you how it was done.

216
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:37,988
Hey, kid, go get Officer Takagi.

217
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,688
Okay!

218
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,788
-Then, Ms. Tsumagari... -Yes, sir.

219
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,588
you took the real Stradivarius to the storeroom.

220
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:53,188
Did you call me?

221
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:56,988
Officer Takagi, while Pops was explaining the trick to everyone,

222
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,988
a Stradivarius happen to be hanging out the window.

223
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:02,588
-What? -Since you're tall, you can reach it, right?

224
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,788
Well... I guess so...

225
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,788
I hope there's nothing behind all this?

226
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:13,288
No, no... but be extremely careful will you,

227
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,688
because it's valued at more than several billions of yen.

228
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:19,888
But, mind you it's not my fault if I drop it.

229
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,488
Hey, hey...

230
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:28,688
Watch out!

231
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,688
Be careful, Takagi!

232
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,288
It moved.

233
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,688
When I tried to take the violin, it moved away.

234
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:48,288
I see, a pole was attached to the window frame on both sides,

235
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,288
then the violin is suspended with a string.

236
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,188
Then the more the window is opened,

237
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,588
the farther the violin pulls away.

238
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:55,988
But, Dad...

239
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,888
What if it gets stuck like that?

240
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:01,388
There was no violin or pole anywhere at the site.

241
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:04,488
This is a temporary gimmick that I made

242
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,588
by borrowing a long chopstick from the kitchen.

243
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:09,188
If the two sticks that were used to carry out the crime

244
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,688
were the conductor's staff that was stolen from Genzaburo's room,

245
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,388
they would be very flexible,

246
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:16,188
so the violin that moves to the edge

247
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,688
will eventually fall from its weight.

248
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:22,088
Therefore, if the other string that is attached to the violin

249
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,888
is stuck on to the window frame of the room below,

250
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:28,088
after we ran over to Ayane who we were looking down upon,

251
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:30,588
he secretly went to collect the violin.

252
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:33,388
But, the staff would still...

253
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:35,688
That too...

254
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:38,488
since it was only stuck on using scotch tape,

255
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,188
all he had to do was attach a string to it

256
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,588
to collect it later.

257
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:45,388
The sound that we heard before Ayane fell,

258
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:49,088
is the sound of that violin bumping into the wall...

259
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:50,388
As proof of that,

260
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:54,988
a broken staff was found near the corpse.

261
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,588
He set up this gimmick

262
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:02,288
when he came into this room to tune the Stradivarius.

263
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,488
This is probably when he switched the genuine one

264
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,088
for the replica too.

265
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,888
I'm sure that the conductor's staff

266
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:12,088
and violin that he collected are hidden somewhere in the room below.

267
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,788
Of course, with Kyosuke's fingerprints all over it.

268
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:18,188
It's hard to believe that he had time to erase his fingerprints

269
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,988
or to take the things to another place back then

270
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,288
since Hasuki, who broke out in tears was there.

271
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,588
It can't be... That's all baloney!

272
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,888
Uncle Kyosuke can't be the killer,

273
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,588
because he saved Grandmother

274
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,488
who couldn't make it out of the fire in time.

275
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:37,088
If so, then why?

276
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,888
That's because of the rule of the "musical scale"

277
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:41,888
that even you know of as a musician.

278
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,088
Why do I spread my fingers out when I play the piano?

279
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,788
Because see, when you play notes that are alongside each other...

280
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,288
Cacophony.

281
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:55,388
When notes that are alongside each other are played

282
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,588
it sounds disharmonic...

283
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,088
Don't tell me that...

284
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,288
Exactly.

285
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:02,688
I couldn't stand the fact that Genzaburo with initial "G"

286
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,488
and Grandmother Ayane with initial "A" die at the same time.

287
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:13,688
Why you... just what do you take the life of people to be!

288
00:17:13,688 --> 00:17:16,688
I'd like you to say those words to Uncle Choichiro there too.

289
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,188
What?

290
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,588
Thirty years ago, that old man over there who was to blame

291
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,788
for my father getting seriously hurt, and drove my mother to her death

292
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,788
from the heavy load of caring for father.

293
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:26,188
Thirty years ago.

294
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,388
You mean back when that robbery occurred.

295
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,988
I had completely forgotten about it until two years ago

296
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:35,288
when I was asked to tune the Stradivarius

297
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,288
during that old man's birthday.

298
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,488
The sound of the, the feel...

299
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,688
it brought back memories of when I was still a child,

300
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:46,588
of when my father who gave me the violin.

301
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,588
When I confirmed with Aunt Eimi,

302
00:17:48,588 --> 00:17:51,588
she told me with a pale face,

303
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:53,988
that 30 years ago,

304
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,988
that old man over there borrowed the Stradivarius from Father,

305
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:59,888
saying that he wanted to make Furuto, his son play it.

306
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,488
The old man who fell in love with the tone,

307
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,788
didn't want to return the violin so,

308
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:08,188
he exchanged it for a replica that looked exactly alike.

309
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,088
But, father found out right away and they got into an argument.

310
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:14,588
On top of that, after father fell down the stairs...

311
00:18:15,788 --> 00:18:17,288
he was seriously hurt.

312
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,088
That old man had the nerve to leave father who was seriously hurt as is

313
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,688
and didn't even call an ambulance.

314
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:34,388
He then told the four who were there the following.

315
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:38,688
Genzaburo, tie Ayane and me up and you guys go on home!

316
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,188
We're going to make it look as if we were attacked by robbers.

317
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,588
Don't you want to play this famed musical instrument?

318
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,688
If Danjiro dies, this is mine.

319
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,788
I'll lend it to you any time you want.

320
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:57,088
Aunt Eimi, who told me everything,

321
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,888
was besides herself and left the room...

322
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:13,288
So you decided to take revenge on the four

323
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,888
who agreed to the scheme back then.

324
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,688
When I saw Aunt Eimi trip over the stairs

325
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,688
and fall to her death like Father,

326
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,288
I took it to be a sign from God.

327
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:32,388
Starting from my mother Chiha,

328
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,988
my father Danjiro,

329
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:35,288
Aunt Eimi,

330
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,988
they all died in the order of the musical scale.

331
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,988
And if I lined the initials of the ones who would be dying,

332
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:43,988
I figured it would begin with "C" and end with "C".

333
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:48,388
Well, but after pushing Furuto off the veranda a year ago,

334
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,088
I was sort of flustered when I found out

335
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,488
that the last one on the list with initial "C",

336
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,188
Gramps Choichiro was about to die of an illness.

337
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:03,188
Then, I, who was not at all aware of what took place 30 years ago,

338
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:05,988
was next in line to be killed after all...

339
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:11,288
No, in Germany after C-D-E-F-G-A

340
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,488
comes the alphabet "H", it's pronounced "HA".

341
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:17,288
In other words, it stands for Haga.

342
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:20,388
Uncle!

343
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:31,888
Pops told me to do so,

344
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,688
so I told them to wait below with a mat.

345
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:38,788
Because he said that Kyosuke may commit suicide.

346
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,088
But, if it was initial "H", it could've been Hasuki.

347
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:45,088
It could've been her turn next.

348
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:49,388
Since Kyosuke brought the Stradivarius back to this room

349
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,988
I figured it wasn't going to be so.

350
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:56,188
If Ayane didn't break the replica as she did back then,

351
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,088
it would've been likely that no one would've even noticed

352
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,988
that there was a replica of the Stradivarius at all.

353
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:04,588
The fact that he came to return the genuine one means

354
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,788
that he wanted to leave the famed,

355
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:08,888
legendary gift that his father had given him to its rightful owner,

356
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:11,488
to the one that he had thrown into the same situation

357
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,588
as he was thrown into, when they killed his father...

358
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:18,888
That is, Hasuki. He wanted to give it to you.

359
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:57,188
When I asked you about the melody from my cell phone,

360
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,688
you answered "Are you talking about me?"

361
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,388
Are you talking about me?

362
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,188
Can you tell me what the notes are?

363
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:10,588
H-A-G-A?

364
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:15,188
If in German would it be pronounced HAGA?

365
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:19,188
That's right. You've got a good ear too, sonny.

366
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:22,388
Which means that the notes are Ti-La-So-La?

367
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:23,588
Hey, Conan...

368
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:26,688
Do you know of any song that begins with Ti-La-So-La?

369
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:31,188
It could be some sad, yet nostalgic type of music...

370
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,588
If so, it's probably...

371
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,388
this song?

372
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,188
That song...

373
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:45,988
is The Seven Children, right?

374
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:49,788
"Crow little crow, why do you cry?"

375
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,388
Right, Conan?

376
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:53,888
Conan?

377
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,788
"Next Episode"

378
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,488
What's this threatening feeling I sense

379
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,288
after coming all this way to Kagoshima?

380
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,188
Kogoro Mouri can deceive you no longer.

381
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:09,888
Genuine Satsuma Distilled Spirits is the best.

382
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:14,188
Doesn't something feel sandy?

383
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,888
It's probably the ashes.

384
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,288
What's the matter?

385
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,288
This is...

386
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:25,588
Next Conan,

387
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:29,588
"Kogoro Drunk Over Satsuma! (Part 1)"

388
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,615
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,915
"Sticking to old ways of making liquor"

390
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:36,115
The next episode takes place in Kagoshima!

391
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:37,715
Pops, drinks, eats and gets drunk.

392
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:39,415
What are you going there for, Dad?
