1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,170
The school trip that was memorable

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,070
and shocking in some ways ended, and...

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,970
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,670
What? Conan caught a cold?

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,970
What does that mean?

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,570
Remember how he went

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,870
to stay with Dr. Agasa the night before you left?

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,870
-Yeah. -He caught a cold then

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,670
and was stuck in bed.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,270
Why didn't you call me right away?

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,570
Dr. Agasa thought you'd be worried and want to come home,

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,870
so he asked me not to tell you.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,570
Well, thanks to him, I didn't have to...

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,070
take care of a sick kid.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,570
Gosh.

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,170
Hey, did you see the news about Kiyomizu Temple?

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,170
I heard some high school students solved the murder case.

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,570
Seriously?

19
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,270
Yeah, Heiji Hattori. Isn't he cute?

20
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,470
Yeah, that's the one.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,470
I heard there was another boy and girl, too.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,270
I wonder who they were. I'm curious.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,270
I heard the girl was boyish and cute.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,170
What about the other boy?

25
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,470
More info, please.

"#FightingRedTenguMurder"

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,270
I know! I happened to be there!

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,370
He's the high school detective of the east, Shinichi Kudo!

29
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,870
"Shinichi Kudo - Deceased. Koji Haneda - Deceased"

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,470
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

31
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,470
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

32
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,470
Everyone's talking about Shinichi online.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,470
They can't be allowed to find out.

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,570
His name is Detective Conan.

00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:20,228

39
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:26,628
Your fever seems to have gone down.

40
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:29,828
Then I can go to school today.

41
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,628
-You can't. -What?

42
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:35,028
You can't be too careful when you're getting over a cold.

43
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,128
Besides, your face is still a little red.

44
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,128
Huh?

45
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,728
In any case, you're staying in bed today.

46
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,128
Okay.

47
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,528
Dad, I'll see you later.

48
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,128
Okay!

49
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,228
I managed to trick her.

50
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:59,128
I should double-check my messages.

51
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:01,728
"From: Ran. Subject: Thanks for the message"

52
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,928
Thanks for the message.

53
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:08,428
This means we're dating, right?

54
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,728
Yes! It's not a dream!

55
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,328
It wasn't a dream!

56
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:20,128
I'm hungry.

57
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,828
I only had porridge this morning.

58
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:25,528
I guess I'll wait for an opportunity to slip out

59
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,628
and get something to eat at Dr. Agasa's.

60
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,928
And I'd better give him these.

61
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,128
These are yatsuhashi!

62
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,228
I love these! Thank you!

63
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:43,628
Share them with Haibara.

64
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:48,228
In return, make sure you keep your story straight.

65
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:51,328
They think I was stuck in bed here for three days.

66
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,928
Of course.

67
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:56,228
So, how was the trip?

68
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,028
Did anything good happen?

69
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:01,228
I guess.

70
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,428
More importantly, I saw a bunch of people out front.

71
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:09,328
Was there some kind of case around here?

72
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,928
I'm not sure.

73
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,128
"Incoming Call, Ai Haibara"

74
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,028
Haibara's calling me?

75
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:19,828
Hello?

76
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:23,728
I told you not to draw attention to yourself!

77
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:26,028
Everyone's talking about you online!

78
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:27,028
What?

79
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:30,628
"High school detective Shinichi Kudo solves the case!"

80
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,128
"The rumors that he's dead were wrong!"

81
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,528
They're talking about me online?

82
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,628
This isn't good! The news has spread everywhere!

83
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,828
Which means the activity outside is...

84
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:53,128
Please, Mr. Kudo! Give us a comment!

85
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:56,228
Your son is big news right now!

86
00:06:56,228 --> 00:07:00,528
I told you, I'm just staying here.

87
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:03,928
I've never met their son.

88
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:08,428
But the Kudos have told you about Shinichi, haven't they?

89
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,528
Do you have anything to say about him?

90
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,328
But I really don't have anything to tell you.

91
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,228
Gosh! I messed up!

92
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,428
We have to do something.

93
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:22,128
I hear Dr. Agasa's voice. You're at his house, aren't you?

94
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:25,928
Stay there until I get back.

95
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,228
I'll come up with a plan.

96
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,628
Hey.

97
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:34,328
Haibara.

98
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,428
You live with Hiroshi Agasa.

99
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:41,728
His neighbors are the Kudos, aren't they?

100
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,128
Yes.

101
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:48,528
Have you ever met their son Shinichi?

102
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,128
No, I haven't.

103
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:52,728
Why?

104
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:57,228
There she is. Ai!

105
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:02,328
Everyone's talking about him right now.

106
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,028
I just thought I'd ask.

107
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,328
What's going on?

108
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:10,528
What were you talking about?

109
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:12,828
Nothing important.

110
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,428
There you are.

111
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:19,028
About Maria Higashio...

112
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,828
Come to think of it, she wasn't at school today.

113
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,228
Did something happen?

114
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:25,928
Did she eat too much and upset her stomach?

115
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:29,728
We actually don't know why she didn't come to school.

116
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:33,428
I thought you kids might've heard something.

117
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,228
We haven't heard anything.

118
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,928
Did you contact her parents?

119
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:42,228
Yes. They both work,

120
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:45,628
so I called their offices.

121
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,628
Both of them were away from their desks,

122
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,728
so I haven't been able to get in touch with them.

123
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,128
What?

124
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,428
I'm worried about her,

125
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,728
so could you go to Maria's house and check on her?

126
00:08:56,728 --> 00:09:00,128
I'll head there as soon as I finish up my work.

127
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,028
-Yeah! -Sure.

128
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,128
You can count on us.

129
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,928
Anyway, I'm going to be late.

130
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,328
See you then.

131
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:09,728
Wait, Haibara!

132
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,728
"Higashio"

133
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,428
No one's answering.

134
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:28,028
And it's locked.

135
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,828
You guys really have no idea?

136
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:32,128
No.

137
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:36,528
Wasn't she looking forward to having curry for lunch today?

138
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,628
Now that you mention it,

139
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:42,028
she said she found a letter from her dead grandma

140
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:46,028
in her desk drawer the other day.

141
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:48,528
It sounds like Grandma

142
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:53,128
set up a treasure hunt in her house for me.

143
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,528
Do you guys want to invite Conan

144
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,728
and look for it together sometime?

145
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,428
Sure, let's do it.

146
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:05,328
She told me about it yesterday.

147
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:09,128
Then it's likely she went to look for the treasure.

148
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:12,128
Did she say where her grandmother's house is?

149
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:15,628
Yeah. She said it was across the street,

150
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,128
so that's probably it.

151
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:18,528
"Higashio"

152
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,128
Higashio?

153
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,528
-That must be it. -Yeah.

154
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,228
-Shall we go check it out? -Yeah.

155
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,728
This house is unlocked.

156
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:33,828
What?

157
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,028
You're right.

158
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:40,928
It's Maria's shoes and backpack.

159
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:44,728
Looks like she came here before going to school.

160
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,328
Why?

161
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,728
To check things out before our treasure hunt?

162
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,028
Huh?

163
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:54,628
There's a note next to the welcome mat.

164
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:59,828
It says, "Start! Maria, good luck!"

165
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,428
I see.

166
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,728
So this arrow points in the direction of the treasure

167
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:09,128
or a hint to its location.

168
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:20,928
This isn't good. The crowd keeps growing.

169
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:25,928
"#FightingRedTenguMurder" -Looks like they're here

170
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:28,128
because of this post.

171
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,528
This person writes a blog, too.

172
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:40,928
"Self-proclaimed world's biggest Kudo family fan"?

173
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,228
"Yusaku Kudo, Shinichi Kudo, Yukiko Kudo"

174
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:45,128

176
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,528
This isn't good.

177
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,928
"Higashio"

178
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,028
I found something.

179
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,228
Over there.

180
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,928
What?

181
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,428
You're right.

182
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,428
That's a huge arrow.

183
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:06,628
She must've made it obvious since it's for a child.

184
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,228
There's another note.

185
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,428
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls!"

186
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:15,328
"Did you check for bed head?"

187
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,528
What a nice grandma.

188
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,428
But...

189
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:22,928
the cosmetics in front of the mirror have been knocked over.

190
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:26,428
Maybe Maria did her makeup after reading this.

191
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:29,428
No. The cosmetics probably fell over

192
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:33,728
because of the earthquake this afternoon.

193
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:37,528
The problem is if we follow this arrow,

194
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:42,228
it takes us back to the first arrow we found in the entryway.

195
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,228
There must be another arrow hidden at the entrance.

196
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,028
Like inside the shoe cupboard?

197
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,828
This reminds me of the arrow code Dr. Agasa hid in that mansion.

198
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,428
-I know. -Yeah.

199
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:57,128
Arrow code?

200
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:00,428
It was before you transferred.

201
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,428
If you followed the arrows,

202
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,128
you eventually arrived at a treasure chest.

203
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:08,028
But there was actually another code hidden there.

204
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:13,428
In any case, let's look for the other arrow at the entrance.

205
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:14,928
-Okay. -Okay.

206
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:20,228
Maria will surely be at the end of the arrows.

207
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,428
Yeah.

208
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,328
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls."

209
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:36,228
"Good grooming habits are essential for girls."

210
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:42,928
"Did you check for bed head?"

211
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,628
This is...

212
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:02,895
"Higashio"

213
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,695
Where is it?

214
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:09,695
There aren't any arrows anywhere.

215
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:12,495
There wasn't even one under the welcome mat.

216
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:16,395
Maybe Maria found it and took it with her.

217
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,695
I figured it out.

218
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:22,695
The second arrow isn't pointing at the entryway.

219
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,295
What?

220
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:27,195
This code isn't that simple.

221
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:31,595
This grandmother's code won't be that easy to solve.

222
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:34,595
And don't forget to clean up over there.

223
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,395
Okay...

224
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:41,995
Don't you think this arrow's shape is a little off?

225
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:45,095
Yes. It does seem significant.

226
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:50,395
So if you follow the instructions and open the vanity

227
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:52,495
to check for bed head...

228
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,895
See? Another different arrow appears.

229
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:02,195
-You're right! -Wow!

230
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:03,795
Which means...

231
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:09,295
The arrow is not pointing toward the entryway,

232
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:13,495
but this way, toward this room.

233
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,795
Yeah...

234
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,895
Maria, are you inside?

235
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,695
I don't hear anything.

236
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,795
It opened?

237
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,395
I'm coming in.

238
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:43,895
The bookcase fell!

239
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:47,795
Oh, right. It fell during this afternoon's earthquake.

240
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,895
Is Maria trapped under there?

241
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,095
Let's get it back up!

242
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,195
Yeah...

243
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:56,795
On three. One...

244
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:57,795
Two...

245
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,795
And three!

246
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,295
Maria!

247
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,295
Huh? Maria...

248
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:07,995
She's not here.

249
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:10,595
That's a relief.

250
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,295
Why did only this bookshelf fall?

251
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:20,595
Maria probably removed the thick encyclopedias from the bottom shelf

252
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:22,895
and used them as a footstool.

253
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,495
They became unbalanced while she was doing something,

254
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,595
so it fell during the earthquake.

255
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:29,695
But what was she doing?

256
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,795
Look at this.

257
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,895
There are two weird boxes stuck here

258
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:37,295
so they won't fall out even if the bookshelf does.

259
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:43,695
These books on the floor are comics Maria likes.

260
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:47,695
Yes. Volume 82 was recently released.

261
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:51,395
Huh? There's a note inside the book.

262
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,895
What is it, Mitsuhiko?

263
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,195
What does it say?

264
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:02,095
I'll read it to you.

265
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:05,095
"Don't forget to put things in order."

266
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:06,295
What?

267
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,495
"Don't forget..."

268
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,395
"To put things in order"?

269
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:15,395
Is she telling us to clean up this room?

270
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,295
No.

271
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:21,195
This note seems to have been stuck to the bookshelf.

272
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:24,295
Maybe she meant for these books on the floor

273
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:27,495
to be put back on the bookshelf.

274
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:32,395
Yeah, but which book goes where?

275
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:37,595
The big books only fit on the bottom shelf.

276
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:41,395
Maria removed the big encyclopedias

277
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,595
so she could use them as a stool,

278
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,595
so we can ignore them.

279
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:52,195
Let's start by putting these comics,

280
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:56,695
that recently published volume 82, onto the shelves,

281
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:59,395
starting at the top left.

282
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:04,195
But some of the books don't have covers.

283
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,895
And she might not have all of them.

284
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:13,095
And the books won't fit on the shelves with the weird boxes.

285
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:17,695
If Maria didn't come to school today,

286
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,295
then she probably came to this house before school,

287
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:23,795
followed the notes left by her grandmother,

288
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,695
and became stuck in some room in this house.

289
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:30,595
It's likely she's been trapped for over six hours.

290
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:32,195
What?

291
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,195
So let's hurry up and put these books in order,

292
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,895
just like the note says.

293
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,395
We can worry about the details later.

294
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:42,495
-Got it. -You're right.

295
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,895
Let's split up and start organizing.

296
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,395
Yeah...

297
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:47,495
Hurry.

298
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:56,595
This isn't good, Doc.

299
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,295
There's even a TV broadcast car.

300
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:02,995
But...

301
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:06,295
could one social media post

302
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,695
cause this much of an uproar?

303
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,695
It's not like they posted a photo of me.

304
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,995
This must be the reason.

305
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:19,295
Huh?

306
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:25,895
Search for images of the Tengu murder from two days ago.

307
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,795
Look behind the reporter.

308
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:31,995
It's you and Hattori.

309
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:36,695
I'm right in the shot!

310
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:41,495
The rumor that you were dead had spread quite a bit,

311
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:44,395
leading to this commotion today.

312
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:48,495
Hattori's calling.

313
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:50,995
-Hello? -You moron!

314
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:55,295
The media barged into my school

315
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,395
and demanded I tell them about Kudo!

316
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,795
I thought you said you told them to keep quiet.

317
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:06,195
I was seen with you on TV.

318
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:08,495
What? Are you serious?

319
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:11,695
Anyway, I'll handle things here.

320
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,895
You'd better handle things over there.

321
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,195
Later.

322
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:18,895
Handle things?

323
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,695
What am I supposed to do?

324
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:29,595
We put the books on the shelf in order, but...

325
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:36,995
I don't get it.

326
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:41,695
But each shelf fits 30 books.

327
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:45,495
Now we know the middle four books on the top

328
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,795
two shelves don't have covers.

329
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:52,695
But the third shelf is a mess.

330
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:55,095
We had to put the books in sideways

331
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:57,795
because the boxes were in the way.

332
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:01,595
Since the note said to put things in order,

333
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,195
shouldn't we take out the boxes?

334
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,695
No.

335
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,595
These boxes are the key.

336
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:19,895
Instead of tilting them in the same direction,

337
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:23,195
if you form a V-shape...

338
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,595
See?

339
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,095
It's an arrow!

340
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:32,895
Wow!

341
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,695
But how do we go down?

342
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,195
There's no underfloor storage, is there?

343
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:54,895
The basement!

344
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,195
What?

345
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:01,695
Look. There's something in the room directly beneath that arrow.

346
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:04,495
Let's go.

347
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:05,995
Okay...

348
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:57,495
"Next Episode" -Don't you think that's a huge group of reporters?

349
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,495
Yeah. Did something happen?

350
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:03,495
The bumpy pattern goes all around the room.

351
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:06,595
But it doesn't look like an arrow.

352
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,695
The shadow changed for some reason.

353
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,795
That's it. Which means...

354
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,495
What? You still haven't found Maria?

355
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,195
But it's already evening.

356
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:24,195
Next Conan, "Find Maria (Part 2)"

357
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,138
Next Conan's Hint:

358
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:29,338
"A drinking bird"

359
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:31,638
It's not good that there's an image of the two of you.

360
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,638
-Forgive us. -This is really bad.
