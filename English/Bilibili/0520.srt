1
00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:03.382
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:05.482
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:09.282
The deeply mysterious message in the very expensive wine.

4
00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:10.782
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:12.882
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:15.482
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

7
00:01:55.721 --> 00:02:00.921
"Accusation in Wine Red"

8
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:12.521
Greetings, Mr. Shiratori.

9
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:14.721
Welcome to my retreat.

10
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:18.221
"Murozou Honjyou (42)" -I hope you enjoy tonight's celebration.

11
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.821
Thank you for inviting me.

12
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.721
By the way, where is Mr. Mouri?

13
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:25.921
Right over here,

14
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.321
and I have Grand Vin.

15
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.521
Dad.

16
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.221
You can't shake the wine like that.

17
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:34.221
Why?

18
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.021
It will take time for the dregs

19
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.821
to settle back down into the bottle.

20
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:38.821
Dregs?

21
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:40.521
Dregs are the tannins and pigmentation

22
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.721
that collect at the bottom of the bottle

23
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.721
and change the taste of the wine.

24
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.321
It is all right.

25
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.821
But having you here is such an honor.

26
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.721
Mr. Hirose would be pleased to see you.

27
00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:58.121
The honor is mine to be here for Mr. Hirose's 70th birthday celebration.

28
00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:00.721
I know that he is the president of the National Wine Association

29
00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:03.621
and the recipient of a prestigious French medal.

30
00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:07.621
This is very exciting for me.

31
00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.921
-You over there. -Yes.

32
00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:15.221
Can you explain tonight's arrangement to Mr. Mouri?

33
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:20.321
I was wondering if you could do a skit for tonight...

34
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.521
What do you think Mr. Mouri?

35
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.121
Of course.

36
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:25.521
Excuse me for a second.

37
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:29.221
This is the scenario.

38
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:31.221
Dad, are you sure about this?

39
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:33.421
Leave it to me.

40
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.821
Oh, really?

41
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:38.821
You have hidden in the trunk of the car.

42
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:41.021
The culprit is you.

43
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.921
No, there should be another line before that.

44
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:47.321
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.921
Oh, bother. Why me?

46
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:55.521
You can take the ropeway up to the peak of the mountain.

47
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.121
The view is amazing.

48
00:03:57.121 --> 00:03:58.321
You should take a stroll outside.

49
00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.721
I think we will.

50
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:00.921
Let's go, Conan.

51
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:01.921
Okay.

52
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.021
What are you doing here without an invitation?

53
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:12.021
Are you here to cause some trouble?

54
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:14.221
Speak up, Akamaru.

55
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:19.321
"Goro Akamaru (50)" -I hear you have the Magnum 1959 Petrus.

56
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:24.021
Yes, a wine that probably you can never taste in your lifetime.

57
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:27.621
Can you really understand the taste?

58
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:30.621
I know you couldn't even tell

59
00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:32.521
the taste of a slightly different Neuf du Pape.

60
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.021
Well, poor Mr. Hirose.

61
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:39.821
It is his 70th birthday.

62
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.821
I should have been the one to present this party.

63
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.821
Shut up.

64
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:48.621
Conan, let's go.

65
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.621
Okay.

66
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:57.021
Today is the day that everyone will see who you really are.

67
00:04:57.021 --> 00:05:00.121
Go and make a fool of yourself out there.

68
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:01.421
Conan.

69
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:15.621
What's the matter?

70
00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:16.621
Look.

71
00:05:18.321 --> 00:05:20.521
I can't see anything.

72
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:27.521
"When you couldn't find anywhere to put the body,

73
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:30.721
you hid the body inside the trunk of the car."

74
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.021
"But your wife who didn't have the slightest idea

75
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:38.121
drove the car..."

76
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.321
"Don"t underestimate me.

77
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:49.821
I am the one and only Detective Kogorou Mouri."

78
00:05:49.821 --> 00:05:51.621
Excuse me.

79
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.721
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.021
That was a quick walk.

81
00:05:57.021 --> 00:06:00.521
We were going to take time,

82
00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:03.521
but Conan said he had a stomachache.

83
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:20.521
What are you doing?

84
00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:21.821
I...

85
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:24.121
I was looking for something.

86
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:26.721
I guess I left it somewhere inside the house.

87
00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.821
Where should I put this?

88
00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:31.921
Oh, right. There is fine.

89
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:37.621
Excuse me, do you think that man knows where it is?

90
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:41.021
The man that had white hair and yellow jacket on.

91
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.621
You were talking to him.

92
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:46.621
Yes. We had some business to deal with.

93
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:48.321
But, he went home already.

94
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:49.821
I see.

95
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:01.821
"Of course, I cannot say that you are the culprit

96
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.621
by just assessing the situation."

97
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:05.521
And...

98
00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:07.421
"We need..."

99
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:09.621
"We need some evidence."

100
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:14.221
Did you find it?

101
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:15.521
No.

102
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:18.321
Do you know when they arrived here?

103
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:19.721
At 4 o'clock, I think.

104
00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:55.521
I was looking for...

105
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.321
Again?

106
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:01.721
Is it a hamster or something that you are looking for?

107
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:04.521
It must be really hard to find.

108
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.521
No, it's a ball.

109
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:16.821
You can only enter here with Mr. Honjou's fingerprint.

110
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.521
Fingerprint recognition system.

111
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.221
So only Mr. Honjou can enter here.

112
00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:21.421
I guess.

113
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:24.621
Stop right there.

114
00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:31.821
Mr. Koike, don't worry about the preparations for the party.

115
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:35.221
Can you go and find this ball this child is looking for?

116
00:08:35.221 --> 00:08:40.121
And you can go upstairs and watch TV while you wait.

117
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.121
Okay.

118
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:45.621
Masked Yaiba.

119
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:53.021
Do you like Yaiba too?

120
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:55.321
My grandchildren love them too.

121
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.321
They're going to be in kindergarten this year.

122
00:08:57.321 --> 00:08:59.621
I like him too.

123
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:04.321
I can't do this. The lines are too long.

124
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.321
I told you if you were sure you could do this.

125
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:12.821
I can ask Mr. Honjou if he can change it to a regular speech?

126
00:09:12.821 --> 00:09:14.321
That would be great.

127
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.521
Conan.

128
00:09:27.521 --> 00:09:29.421
How is your stomachache?

129
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.021
It's not so bad.

130
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:37.021
But I need to go again.

131
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:38.421
Conan.

132
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:44.321
Mr. Honjou, do you think you can change Mr. Mouri's skit

133
00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:46.621
to a regular speech for tonight?

134
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:49.121
He cannot remember all the lines.

135
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.521
That is too bad, but of course.

136
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:56.321
Do you think I can have a moment with you, Mr. Mouri?

137
00:10:31.421 --> 00:10:32.721
This is...

138
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:39.821
I see. He did hide Mr. Akamaru here first,

139
00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:42.121
but thought I would find it somehow,

140
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.221
so he moved the body.

141
00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:48.021
A place that is completely safe.

142
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:49.721
It must be the wine cellar.

143
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:10.574
Thank you for traveling so far, Mr. Hirose.

144
00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.474
I am the one to thank you.

145
00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:17.674
"Shinya Hirose (70)" -This is such a huge party.

146
00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:19.774
Mr. Honjou, everyone,

147
00:11:19.774 --> 00:11:21.374
thank you so much.

148
00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:23.674
That over there is Mr. Hirose,

149
00:11:23.674 --> 00:11:25.674
the president of the National Wine Association

150
00:11:25.674 --> 00:11:27.574
and the main guest for tonight.

151
00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:30.974
That's the medal from France.

152
00:11:33.074 --> 00:11:35.574
To Mr. Hirose. Celebrating his 70th birthday

153
00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:39.974
and for his continuing success. Cheers.

154
00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:41.374
-Cheers. -Cheers.

155
00:11:49.974 --> 00:11:51.174
It's delicious.

156
00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:54.574
Mr. Mouri, don't forget about your speech.

157
00:11:57.274 --> 00:12:03.374
Let's now savor the highest-quality Bordeaux wines

158
00:12:03.374 --> 00:12:05.174
that I have chosen for this evening.

159
00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:09.174
A 1985 Chateau Haut Brion.

160
00:12:11.374 --> 00:12:12.974
Is that expensive?

161
00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:17.774
Yes. It costs more than 100,000 Yen.

162
00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:19.774
I am looking forward to this.

163
00:12:19.774 --> 00:12:23.074
It's not only the price that makes a good wine, you know.

164
00:12:27.474 --> 00:12:28.474
Here you are.

165
00:12:39.374 --> 00:12:43.074
Very soft and elegant.

166
00:12:44.374 --> 00:12:45.374
Delicious.

167
00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:48.174
Mr. Mouri, you also enjoy the smell

168
00:12:48.174 --> 00:12:51.774
and color of the wine too.

169
00:12:51.774 --> 00:12:58.074
Next, we have a 1982 Chateau Mouton Rothschild.

170
00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:01.174
That is a beautiful label.

171
00:13:01.174 --> 00:13:03.074
They call it an "Etiquette"

172
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.374
Etiquette?

173
00:13:04.374 --> 00:13:05.374
Yes.

174
00:13:05.374 --> 00:13:10.674
Every year the Mouton has different artists for the artwork.

175
00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:13.774
They are known for their artistic designs.

176
00:13:13.774 --> 00:13:18.174
Chagall drew their etiquette for 1970.

177
00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:19.474
Wow.

178
00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:23.774
This is a 1992 Chateau Le Pin.

179
00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:28.374
A 1986 Chateau Lafite Rothschild.

180
00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:31.374
And a 1990 Chateau Margaux.

181
00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:41.674
Congratulations, Mr. Hirose.

182
00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:44.574
Tell me about the incident

183
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.374
that occurred in Shouhei Kusaka's wine cellar.

184
00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:49.874
Well, I can say that without me,

185
00:13:49.874 --> 00:13:51.974
that case might have gone unsolved.

186
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:56.174
Mr. Hirose, would you excuse me for a second?

187
00:13:56.174 --> 00:13:57.974
Mr. Honjou.

188
00:13:57.974 --> 00:13:59.274
Yes?

189
00:13:59.274 --> 00:14:02.074
I do not see Mr. Akamaru anywhere.

190
00:14:03.074 --> 00:14:05.074
Who is Mr. Akamaru?

191
00:14:05.074 --> 00:14:09.974
He is a French translator and a famous wine critic.

192
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.174
He was here at 3 o'clock.

193
00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:16.474
And why do you know that?

194
00:14:16.474 --> 00:14:18.474
I just saw him earlier.

195
00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:19.674
Right?

196
00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:20.774
Yes.

197
00:14:21.774 --> 00:14:25.174
He said that he was sorry

198
00:14:25.174 --> 00:14:28.074
that he could not be here for the celebration.

199
00:14:28.074 --> 00:14:30.674
I see, that is too bad.

200
00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:32.674
I will have to prepare for the next presentation.

201
00:14:38.474 --> 00:14:40.974
And, about that incident...

202
00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:42.674
Yes, yes.

203
00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:43.974
Conan.

204
00:14:43.974 --> 00:14:44.974
Huh?

205
00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:47.374
Conan said he had a stomachache earlier.

206
00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:50.474
Probably drank too much juice.

207
00:14:53.874 --> 00:14:56.174
Dad, are you okay?

208
00:14:58.974 --> 00:15:00.174
That was a close one.

209
00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:02.874
Nothing... Everything is okay...

210
00:15:02.874 --> 00:15:04.274
No problem.

211
00:15:06.374 --> 00:15:07.374
Hey, little boy.

212
00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.874
Is this what you've been looking for?

213
00:15:11.874 --> 00:15:14.474
It was in the corner of the parking lot.

214
00:15:14.474 --> 00:15:17.574
Yes, this is it. Thank you.

215
00:15:22.174 --> 00:15:24.074
For half a century,

216
00:15:24.074 --> 00:15:27.074
this wine has been waiting for us.

217
00:15:27.074 --> 00:15:30.774
This is a gem in a bottle.

218
00:15:30.774 --> 00:15:36.274
A 1959 magunum bottle of Chteau Petrus.

219
00:15:36.274 --> 00:15:38.274
A 1959?

220
00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:39.474
Magunum?

221
00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:45.474
And I present this to you, Mr. Hirose.

222
00:15:45.474 --> 00:15:47.874
Thank you Mr. Honjou.

223
00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:50.374
This is a great pleasure.

224
00:15:50.374 --> 00:15:53.074
This wine should have been uncorked

225
00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:55.974
and decanted a few hours ago

226
00:15:55.974 --> 00:15:57.874
But when it comes to a wine of this caliber,

227
00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:01.574
it should be fully enjoyable even if we uncork it now.

228
00:16:08.274 --> 00:16:10.274
What is this?

229
00:16:10.274 --> 00:16:12.774
Dad, you did do something.

230
00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:15.174
I'm terribly sorry.

231
00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.274
There was an accident.

232
00:16:18.774 --> 00:16:20.974
That's all right.

233
00:16:20.974 --> 00:16:22.574
After half a century,

234
00:16:22.574 --> 00:16:24.774
even if I pour it directly into the glasses,

235
00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:28.574
I contend that we will find it just as satisfactory.

236
00:16:28.574 --> 00:16:30.174
Will that be okay?

237
00:16:30.174 --> 00:16:32.974
Wine should be treated like a woman.

238
00:16:36.174 --> 00:16:37.774
For you Mr. Hirose.

239
00:16:53.474 --> 00:16:55.374
What is the matter?

240
00:16:55.374 --> 00:16:57.874
The dregs have been mixed.

241
00:16:57.874 --> 00:17:00.074
The flavor is off too.

242
00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:01.674
That cannot be.

243
00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:13.074
May I?

244
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.174
Of course.

245
00:17:15.174 --> 00:17:16.174
Thank you.

246
00:17:19.974 --> 00:17:21.174
You are right.

247
00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:25.074
Why?

248
00:17:25.074 --> 00:17:26.774
Did you shake the bottle?

249
00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:29.274
I wouldn't do such a thing. I am not an amateur.

250
00:17:29.274 --> 00:17:32.374
Perhaps the temperature in the storeroom got too high.

251
00:17:32.374 --> 00:17:34.274
That's also impossible.

252
00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:35.874
The temperature in the storeroom

253
00:17:35.874 --> 00:17:38.474
is kept perfectly regulated through computer control.

254
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.774
Then it is a mystery.

255
00:17:51.974 --> 00:17:54.874
This maybe...

256
00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:59.174
Being mocked by Mr. Akamaru,

257
00:17:59.174 --> 00:18:01.474
Mr. Honjou killed him in rage

258
00:18:01.474 --> 00:18:05.474
and hid him inside the barrel by the tennis court.

259
00:18:05.474 --> 00:18:08.474
But when he noticed that I was sniffing around the house,

260
00:18:08.474 --> 00:18:10.574
he decided to move the body to safer place.

261
00:18:10.574 --> 00:18:13.974
He moved it from the tennis court to the wine cellar.

262
00:18:16.174 --> 00:18:20.374
But Mr. Akamaru was still alive.

263
00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:32.074
And he noticed the Petrus kept in the cellar.

264
00:18:32.074 --> 00:18:33.574
Petrus.

265
00:18:47.374 --> 00:18:50.474
Try this, Honjou.

266
00:18:52.274 --> 00:18:56.074
Judging that Mr. Akamaru hasn't shown up,

267
00:18:56.074 --> 00:18:59.474
he might be unconscious, or worse...

268
00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:04.374
How do I get inside the wine cellar?

269
00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:07.074
Only Mr. Honjou can open it.

270
00:19:08.274 --> 00:19:09.274
I know.

271
00:19:13.274 --> 00:19:15.774
I don't know how it...

272
00:19:16.974 --> 00:19:21.174
The wine is getting to me...

273
00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:24.774
Dad.

274
00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:29.374
Is this the famous "Sleeping Kogorou"?

275
00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:32.774
That is the famous...

276
00:19:32.774 --> 00:19:36.674
Mr. Honjou, it seems like you have fallen into a trap.

277
00:19:36.674 --> 00:19:38.974
-A trap? -Yes.

278
00:19:38.974 --> 00:19:41.674
Someone in this party who is jealous of you

279
00:19:41.674 --> 00:19:44.274
must have come to this party to embarrass you.

280
00:19:44.274 --> 00:19:47.174
They sneaked into your wine cellar

281
00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:49.974
to ruin the wine you have just served.

282
00:19:49.974 --> 00:19:53.374
That's right. That must be it.

283
00:19:54.674 --> 00:19:56.274
Who did it?

284
00:19:57.374 --> 00:19:59.374
But that's impossible.

285
00:19:59.374 --> 00:20:01.574
In order to get into the wine storeroom,

286
00:20:01.574 --> 00:20:04.074
they would have to use my fingerprints to unlock the system.

287
00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:05.774
Most likely the culprit

288
00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:09.374
is someone who's familiar with the security system.

289
00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:13.574
And it's possible they might still be hiding in there,

290
00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:16.374
which is where the remaining wine is.

291
00:20:16.374 --> 00:20:18.174
That would be horrible.

292
00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:21.474
We have to stop that from happening.

293
00:20:21.474 --> 00:20:23.474
Let's go to the cellar now.

294
00:20:23.474 --> 00:20:25.774
Oh no. I can go alone.

295
00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:27.074
It's dangerous.

296
00:20:27.074 --> 00:20:30.174
We don't know what this culprit is capable of.

297
00:20:30.174 --> 00:20:31.874
And we do not want to lose any more wine

298
00:20:31.874 --> 00:20:35.174
while we try to get them.

299
00:20:35.174 --> 00:20:36.174
But...

300
00:20:36.174 --> 00:20:38.174
-I will go too. -Me too.

301
00:20:38.174 --> 00:20:41.074
-We should hurry. -Where is the wine cellar?

302
00:20:47.074 --> 00:20:49.174
Mr. Akamaru. Mr. Akamaru.

303
00:20:49.174 --> 00:20:50.874
Can you hear me?

304
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:51.874
Mr. Akamaru.

305
00:20:53.574 --> 00:20:55.274
Call the ambulance.

306
00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:56.674
Yes. Right away.

307
00:20:58.874 --> 00:21:02.374
What is all this, Mr. Honjou?

308
00:21:02.374 --> 00:21:04.774
I... I...

309
00:21:04.774 --> 00:21:07.874
Mr. Honjou, I will notify the police.

310
00:21:13.374 --> 00:21:16.174
He always mocked me.

311
00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:19.574
Said that I have no class or education

312
00:21:19.574 --> 00:21:23.474
to present myself as a wine lover.

313
00:21:23.474 --> 00:21:28.274
Mr. Honjou, do you really love wine?

314
00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:29.874
Yes, I do.

315
00:21:29.874 --> 00:21:32.274
Well, I don't think so.

316
00:21:32.274 --> 00:21:36.874
The wine cellar is a sacred place for the wine lover.

317
00:21:36.874 --> 00:21:39.674
And to use that to cover up a crime

318
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:40.674
is unforgivable.

319
00:21:46.174 --> 00:21:49.374
Luckily, Mr. Akamaru was stabilized.

320
00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:52.374
And the case was closed.

321
00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:56.574
Perhaps the true victim in this case might be

322
00:21:56.574 --> 00:21:59.274
the bottle whose taste was ruined when it got involved

323
00:21:59.274 --> 00:22:01.474
in the dirty infighting between humans...

324
00:22:01.474 --> 00:22:03.874
That bottle of wine.

325
00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:31.874
"Mouri Detective Agency" -The sweetness, the soft flavor.

326
00:23:31.874 --> 00:23:34.574
Vintage wine does make the difference.

327
00:23:37.174 --> 00:23:38.774
How much was that wine?

328
00:23:38.774 --> 00:23:40.074
It was 10,000 yen,

329
00:23:40.074 --> 00:23:45.274
but I had the people at the store switch it to a 1000 yen bottle.

330
00:23:52.274 --> 00:23:53.974
"Tres Bien"

331
00:23:54.974 --> 00:23:58.674
It's lucky for us that you can't recognize the taste.

332
00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:03.274
This thing I'm feeling...

333
00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:04.274
It can't be?

334
00:24:04.274 --> 00:24:05.774
Yeah, that's right.

335
00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:07.874
It's the antidote for APTX 4869

336
00:24:07.874 --> 00:24:09.474
that could maybe change his body that had become that of a child

337
00:24:09.474 --> 00:24:12.374
to the body of a high school student that it used to be.

338
00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:17.474
Shinichi?

339
00:24:17.474 --> 00:24:18.674
Shinichi!

340
00:24:20.474 --> 00:24:22.274
Don't tell me that you...

341
00:24:24.574 --> 00:24:26.674
Next Conan, a one-hour special,

342
00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:29.074
"Murderer Shinichi Kudo"

343
00:24:40.374 --> 00:24:42.574
Next Conan's Hint:

344
00:24:42.574 --> 00:24:44.674
"Shinichi Kudo".

345
00:24:44.674 --> 00:24:45.974
What? Me, the clue?

346
00:24:45.974 --> 00:24:47.474
Said something?

347
00:24:47.474 --> 00:24:49.488
No... The first episode of the New Year!
