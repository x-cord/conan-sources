1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,040
General, the tiger is afraid of me and won't come out!

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Every night this tiger leaves its screen and causes trouble!

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,440
If you insist that I capture it,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,440
then you must drive it out of the screen!

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,240
Then I, Ikkyu...

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,940
shall tie him up for you!

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,440
While preparing for the school play,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,340
Ms. Wakasa accidentally ruined the tiger screen.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,540
The Youth Detective Squad went to Ms. Wakasa's apartment

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,940
to help her repaint a new screen.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,540
After finishing the screen, while eating dinner,

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,940
we heard loud music coming from the neighbouring apartment.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,440
Since the music wouldn't stop,

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,840
Genta went to her neighbour's apartment to complain.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,840
It finally stopped.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,040
What's wrong, Genta?

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,040
The unconscious man was professional golfer, Teigo Banno.

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
The murdered woman was Mr. Banno's girlfriend

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,840
and model, Kurumi Iiyama.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,840
The words "I love you" were written on Mr. Banno's right cheek in red.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,540
At the crime scene were polaroids of

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,840
what appeared to be a white woman's hand

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
writing the words on his face.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,140
Mr. Banno claimed the woman with white hands murdered Kurumi, but...

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,740
What is this smell?

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,340
It's coming from Kojima's right hand.

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,740
What? Me?

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,940
But I'm not wearing any makeup.

29
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,940
I knew it.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,740
Knew what?

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,640
Didn't I say I'm not wearing makeup?

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,240
No, I'm talking about the perp.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,340
What? The perp?

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,040
Conan, have you already figured out who the perp is?

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,440
The person who killed the model, Kurumi Iiyama, is...

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,840
the professional golfer, Teigo Banno, after all.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,440
-What? -What?

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,640
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,740
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,240
The boyfriend who appears to be a victim did it?

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,640
Expose the secret of the realistic-looking photo!

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,640
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:37,939
The Woman with White Hands (Part 2)

46
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:42,939
But like he said,

47
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:48,639
his right hand was behind his head in the polaroid.

48
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,739
It's hard to imagine

49
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:54,439
someone could write so clearly on their own face.

50
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,539
That's the thing.

51
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,639
I haven't solved that yet.

52
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,139
Sorry you got caught up in this.

53
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,339
It's fine.

54
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,739
-It's not your fault. -What's this piece of paper?

55
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,539
-But you only came here -A convenience store receipt?

56
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,839
-because I ruined the screen. -It's dated this morning.

57
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,439
Come to think of it, Ms. Wakasa.

58
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,439
Yes?

59
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,139
You were late this morning, which was unusual.

60
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,539
I wonder why?

61
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,539
Why?

62
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,439
When I checked my fridge as I was leaving this morning,

63
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,939
I noticed it was empty.

64
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,039
I rushed to the convenience store to buy more groceries.

65
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,039
When I go shopping after school,

66
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,439
most things are sold out.

67
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,139
Really?

68
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,339
I see.

69
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,439
Oh, don't tell the other teachers.

70
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,939
Got it.

71
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,939
I hope the rest of you won't tell, either.

72
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,139
Understood.

73
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,739
You can count on us.

74
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:32,739
Inspector Megure!

75
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,539
How'd it go, Takagi?

76
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,639
There really was a woman wearing a broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

77
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,439
I see.

78
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,439
Several of the residents saw her.

79
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,839
The security camera footage also captured her

80
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,839
riding up and down several times.

81
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,339
Her face was hidden by her hat, though.

82
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,039
I thought so.

83
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,739
-We found the weapon. -What?

84
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,539
It was the 5-iron in Mr. Banno's golf bag.

85
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,639
The 5-iron?

86
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,439
Also, it is belived that the camera inside Ms. Iiyama's bag

87
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,739
have been used to take the polaroid

88
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,939
and the pen used to write the note.

89
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,839
Unfortunately, the perp's fingerprints weren't on either one of them.

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,539
I see.

91
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,439
Was this really the work of a crazy fan like Mr. Banno claims?

92
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:34,539
We'll pursue that possibility for now.

93
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,939
Takagi, go to Mr. Banno's management agency

94
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,339
and check his fan letters

95
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,339
for anyone whose handwriting matches the "I love you" note.

96
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,539
Yes, sir!

97
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:56,139
Sounds like the police suspect the woman we saw.

98
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,439
Yeah.

99
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,339
But the killer is that professional golfer, right?

100
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,239
Yeah. I could tell the moment I met him.

101
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,839
There were two strange things about him.

102
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,839
What? Strange things?

103
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,639
But I can't figure it out.

104
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,739
How did he write on his own face?

105
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,639
What are you doing, Haibara?

106
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,339
She's trying to see if she can write on her own face

107
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,339
by using her phone like a mirror.

108
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,339
There are apps to make your screen reflective.

109
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,239
I'm using one of those to write on my cheek.

110
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,239
But it's not working.

111
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,439
What?

112
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,639
Ai, it looks like you have a spiral on your cheek.

113
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,739
A spiral?

114
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,539
"Permanent Marker" -This is a permanent marker!

115
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,039
Conan.

116
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,939
Don't laugh at Haibara so much.

117
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,739
Yeah, but...

118
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,139
Oh, my.

119
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:08,139
Looks like Genta got tired and fell asleep.

120
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,939
Wait! Genta, wake up!

121
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:15,739
You're sleeping on the tiger painting!

122
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,439
Sorry.

123
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,639
What are you laughing at?

124
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,139
Genta, you look like a tiger.

125
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:29,639
Your sweat must have dissolved the paint

126
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,739
and made it stick to your cheek.

127
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,239
This is bad.

128
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,939
It's okay. This should be easy enough to fix.

129
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,139
Sorry.

130
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,639
Geez. It's all over me.

131
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,339
Don't touch it.

132
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,539
I'll wipe it off for you.

133
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,339
Thanks. It hurts...

134
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,439
Aren't you going to erase the spiral on your cheek?

135
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,239
I accidentally wrote it with permanent marker!

136
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:59,139
I see. I was overthinking it.

137
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:01,539
What?

138
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,339
You didn't find anyone with matching handwriting?

139
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,739
Did you check all the fan letters?

140
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,339
Yes, about 50 of them.

141
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:13,139
"Fan Letters" -What? Only 50?

142
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,139
Yes.

143
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:19,439
Teigo Banno's agency only had this month's fan letters.

144
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,239
They apparently disposed of the rest.

145
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,539
I see.

146
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,839
In any case, find that letter

147
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,839
even if it means turning the agency upside down.

148
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,139
Mr. Banno's girlfriend, Kurumi Iiyama, was murdered

149
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,639
and the words "I love you" were written in red pen

150
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,039
on his right cheek

151
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,339
by this woman with the white hands.

152
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,339
Yes, sir!

153
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,439
Inspector.

154
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,639
I've told you everything I know.

155
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,539
Can I go now?

156
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:52,639
The media seems to have gotten wind of the incident,

157
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,139
and have begun gathering around the apartment building.

158
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,939
And I'd like to stop by my agency

159
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,939
to discuss my next golf tour.

160
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,339
You're discussing your golf tour

161
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,939
when your girlfriend has been murdered?

162
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,839
Like that lady teacher said,

163
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,539
I invited Kurumi here to break up with her.

164
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,339
I'm surprised she was murdered

165
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,439
but since I no longer had feelings for her,

166
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,939
I'm not that broken up about it.

167
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,039
Anyway, the killer is that woman with the broad-brimmed hat

168
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,039
and sunglasses.

169
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,939
It was probably that woman in the photo with white hands.

170
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,939
Hurry up and find her.

171
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,539
They'll never find her.

172
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,439
Conan?

173
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,539
We'll never find her?

174
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,539
What does that mean?

175
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,539
Because that woman...

176
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,539
is Mr. Banno.

177
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,539
What?

178
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,939
What was that?

179
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,739
Please, Ms. Wakasa.

180
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,739
We need you to wait in your apartment until we contact you.

181
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,539
Oh, but...

182
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:03,139
These children claimed to have figured something out.

183
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,539
Figured something out?

184
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,539
Yeah. It's Genta's hand.

185
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:07,639
It hurts!

186
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,139
Try smelling it.

187
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,539
Doesn't it smell like something?

188
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,739
You're right. It smells like cosmetics.

189
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,839
That's right.

190
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,839
That's the smell of foundation that women use when doing their makeup.

191
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,639
Foundation?

192
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,239
What's that doing on Genta's hand?

193
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,939
Remember how we said we came into this apartment

194
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,039
and found the body because the music wouldn't stop?

195
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,639
It got on Genta's hand

196
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,039
when he banged on the door to get inside.

197
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,139
And if you're wondering what that was doing on the door,

198
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,239
it's because the woman we saw banged on the door, too.

199
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,039
Ms. Wakasa, do women put foundation on their hands?

200
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,839
No, not normally.

201
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,339
Then maybe the suspicious woman we saw

202
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,839
was a dark-skinned man wearing foundation to make himself paler

203
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,839
and pretending to be a woman.

204
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,039
I see.

205
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,039
But what makes me that man disguised as a woman?

206
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,839
I'm just dark-skinned.

207
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,339
Because when we first met you,

208
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,339
you said two strange things.

209
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,206
What two things?

210
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:43,906
You still have something on your face.

211
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:46,806
Hey, where is it?

212
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,406
What's on my face?

213
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:49,406
See?

214
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:52,206
Normally when someone tells you that you have something on your face,

215
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,306
you unconsciously try to touch it.

216
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,106
Isn't that what you did, Genta?

217
00:13:57,106 --> 00:14:02,606
Yeah. You'd be curious what color or how much of it was on you.

218
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,906
But you didn't.

219
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,706
You have something on your right cheek.

220
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:12,106
Something? Like what?

221
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:16,206
So your fingers wouldn't smudge the words you'd written.

222
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,506
I see.

223
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,506
So you knew there were words written on your cheek

224
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,106
that would become an important piece of evidence later.

225
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,606
No!

226
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,306
It's not that I knew.

227
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:31,106
I just thought so instinctively.

228
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,706
Since Kurumi was bleeding on the floor,

229
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,306
I thought there might be something bad on me.

230
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,406
In that case...

231
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,406
Do you know what this is?

232
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:45,006
It's the character for love.

233
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,606
What about it?

234
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,906
What? You don't know?

235
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:54,206
One of Ms. Iiyama's fans uploaded the signature

236
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:57,006
"To Yuto Adachi, With love" -they received at one of her events.

237
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:01,506
I traced and enlarged the character for love that she wrote.

238
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,106
When I used my phone as a mirror

239
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,806
to show you the message on your cheek,

240
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,406
remember what you said?

241
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,306
You said it wasn't the dead woman's handwriting,

242
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:14,106
but you don't even know what her real handwriting looks like.

243
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,606
See?

244
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:18,506
It's written in red.

245
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,806
"I love you"

246
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,306
I love you?

247
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:24,506
Did you make the dead woman write that?

248
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,206
No! This isn't Kurumi's handwriting!

249
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,306
Really?

250
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,406
This is Kurumi's handwriting?

251
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:36,006
I did think it looked similar.

252
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:41,606
But like I said, the "love" Kurumi wrote

253
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:44,006
and the "love" on my cheek

254
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,806
were written by two different people.

255
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:50,206
It's obvious enough that it's not Kurumi's handwriting.

256
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,706
So you can tell?

257
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,806
Yeah, in a single glance.

258
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:55,006
In that case...

259
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:01,206
"Love"

260
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:04,406
Do you know which of these is Kurumi's?

261
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:12,406
You looked at the mirrored characters reflected on the phone

262
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,706
and instantly knew it wasn't Kurumi's handwriting.

263
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,906
Well...

264
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:18,906
But it's hard to tell whose it is when reversed,

265
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:22,206
even if it's familiar.

266
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,706
It was just a feeling!

267
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:28,306
I just had a feeling it wasn't hers!

268
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,706
Officer, the photo.

269
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,706
Here.

270
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,706
In any case,

271
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:36,206
the important thing is this polaroid the killer took!

272
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,206
Look!

273
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,106
My right hand is behind my head,

274
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,106
so the white woman's hand in the front isn't mine.

275
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:47,006
Plus, I couldn't have written so clearly on my own face.

276
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,206
If you think I did it,

277
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,506
tell me how I took this photo.

278
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,706
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

279
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:56,106
You ready?

280
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:59,806
-Yes. Go ahead and fall like Conan told us. -Got it.

281
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:03,006
Hey, what are you kids doing?

282
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,206
Just watch.

283
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,206
When you frame the scene like this,

284
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:10,806
doesn't Mitsuhiko's left hand look like Genta's right hand?

285
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:13,706
I see...

286
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:16,206
If you hid her fingertips behind your head,

287
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:20,606
your girlfriend's left hand could have looked like your own right hand.

288
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:25,006
But our skin colors and sleeves are different.

289
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,906
That's easy.

290
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:31,706
You can make your girlfriend's skin look darker

291
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:33,706
by using a dark foundation.

292
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:34,706
For her sleeve,

293
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,506
you could cut the sleeve off another similarly colored shirt

294
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:41,606
and wrap it around her left hand under your head.

295
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,206
Then what about this message?

296
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:47,006
Are you saying I wrote this on my own face?

297
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,406
No, you didn't write it.

298
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,706
You pressed it onto your face, right?

299
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,706
Like a stamp.

300
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:59,106
First you wrote the words "I love you"

301
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,406
on a clear plastic file using permanent marker.

302
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,206
Then you flipped it over

303
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:07,106
and traced the words with a non-permanent marker.

304
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,506
After killing your girlfriend

305
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:11,406
and taking a photo of yourself with nothing on your face,

306
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,306
you created the stamp.

307
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:16,506
Then you pressed the non-permanent marker side of the file

308
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:18,606
onto your cheek.

309
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:21,406
See?

310
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:25,406
Now it looks like the words were written on your cheek.

311
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,006
I see.

312
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:31,106
Then you colored your right hand white using foundation,

313
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,506
applied nail polish and a scrunchie,

314
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:35,906
held the pen and took a picture of yourself,

315
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:41,006
creating that trick photo.

316
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,506
So is this what happened?

317
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:46,706
Having decided to murder Kurumi,

318
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:47,906
you disguised yourself as a woman

319
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:50,306
and lurked around your apartment

320
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,706
to give the other residents the impression

321
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,506
that there was a suspicious woman stalking you.

322
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:57,906
When Kurumi arrived,

323
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:00,406
you killed her with your golf club

324
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,206
and took the trick photo using the technique Conan just described.

325
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:07,106
Then you played loud music from your stereo

326
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,806
so your neighbour, Ms. Wakasa would come

327
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,106
and discover the body,

328
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,106
and showed us the trick photo

329
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:18,506
so we would believe the suspicious woman did all this.

330
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,006
In other words,

331
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:27,206
my initial theory about the imaginary girlfriend

332
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:30,206
was right on the mark?

333
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:32,506
Ai, you're so cool.

334
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,506
If only you didn't have that spiral on your cheek.

335
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:38,306
What about proof?

336
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:41,606
The proof's probably in that bag

337
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,706
you're trying to take out of the apartment.

338
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:48,806
The clear file, foundation, scrunchy,

339
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:52,406
and sleeve you put on Kurumi's left hand.

340
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:55,406
You wouldn't want anyone to see you leaving the apartment with those

341
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:58,006
so you could throw them away.

342
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:04,606
Shall I take a look inside your bag?

343
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,306
It was Kurumi's fault.

344
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:16,606
I wanted to go on my international tour with a blank slate.

345
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:20,206
But she demanded 100 million yen for breaking up with her!

346
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:25,606
I doubt your international tour would've gone well anyway.

347
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,006
What?

348
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:30,206
You probably lost the favor of the God of Golf

349
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:34,606
the moment you used a club as a weapon.

350
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:36,706
What was that, you brat?

351
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,706
Move!

352
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:39,406
Stop!

353
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,606
Watch out!

354
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:46,706
You...

355
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,906
Ms. Wakasa!

356
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,506
It hurts...

357
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,206
Are you okay?

358
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:57,206
Yes. He pushed me and I fell.

359
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,706
Is it true that there was a murder

360
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:09,106
in the home of professional golfer, Teigo Banno?

361
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,806
Who died?

362
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:12,206
Do you have a suspect?

363
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,506
Hold on!

364
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,906
Wait for our announcement for the details.

365
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,206
This guy did it.

366
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:20,506
-What? -Mr. Banno did it?

367
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:23,406
So you were just subduing him?

368
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,706
No, I just fell because he pushed me.

369
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,106
No, stop!

370
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:29,406
Could we get your name?

371
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:30,706
Oh, actually...

372
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,906
Hey!

373
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,206
She's Teitan Elementary School

374
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,306
Class 1-B's assistant homeroom teacher.

375
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:37,306
Ms. Rumi Wakasa.

376
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,506
This is hopeless.

377
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:48,906
I don't know whether she's clumsy or lucky.

378
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:29,606
"Grade School Teacher Saves the Day, Rumi Wakasa!"

379
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:36,406
Grade school teacher saves the day, Rumi Wakasa.

380
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:50,506
Now that's clever.

381
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:58,706
"Next Episode" -Why are we having cake first thing in the morning?

382
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,206
It's good!

383
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:09,906
Do you not care if you never get to eat Amuro's cake again?

384
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,206
That can't happen! We have to catch the perp!

385
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,506
Okay.

386
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:24,406
Next Conan, "The Melting Cake!"

387
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:26,949
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,449
"Electric kettle"

389
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:31,249
Next episode Amuro bakes a cake.

390
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,349
-But it melted. -What does that mean?

391
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:34,549
Watch and find out.
