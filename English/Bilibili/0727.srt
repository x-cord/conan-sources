1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,540
-"Mouri Detective Agency" -Parfait...

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,140
I'm absolutely sure that...

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,540
it's going to be the Tropical Strawberry Parfait!

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,840
No, I feel like...

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,540
it's going to be the gorgeous strawberry chiffon cake today!

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,240
Then, here's for the announcement.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640
The winner of the strawberry battle tonight is...

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,140
The one who made the Tropical Strawberry Parfait,

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,840
Patissier Shuhei Kurimura!

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,340
He has successfully defended his title as champion!

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,040
My God!

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,240
I thought that the champion was going to be defeated today!

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
It's fantastic, don't you think?

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,740
He's defended his title for six consecutive weeks now!

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,440
We'll see you again next week

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,340
on Which Sweet Will Win...

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Hey, delinquent girl!

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,340
Don't you have to go home?

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,440
It's almost 8pm.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm just checking the program out beforehand, okay?

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Because I'm going to be an audience of this show

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,640
together with Ran next week.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
That's right.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,240
I can use father's connection

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
if you'd like to come, Mr. Mouri?

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,340
What makes you think I'm going to make an appearance

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,140
on such a super sweet confectionary program like that?

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,140
Oh well, that's too bad.

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,340
I heard that Yoko Okino may be coming

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,540
as a guest judge.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
I would like to go with you,

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,340
my lady Sonoko!

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,540
He's such a simpleton.

34
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,440
Will you escort me and the others

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,340
on your rental car then, Mr. Mouri?

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,840
Your wish is my command.

37
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,540
But, what should I do about the one other person?

38
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,240
Five of us have been invited, you see.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,840
Mother has to work.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Then why don't we...

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,340
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,140
An impossible crime is committed

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,240
while the program is on air.

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,340
The mystery that is hidden in the box of fruit.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:54,128
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 1)"

50
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,728
Huh?

51
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,528
You mean it's okay for me to go too?

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,128
Yep, Conan wants you to come at all cost.

53
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,328
Is... is that so?

54
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:04,028
Yep.

55
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,428
If you're inviting me,

56
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:06,728
I could never turn you down.

57
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:11,728
I've got something I want to ask you too.

58
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,728
Well, I just hope that when we're in the audience,

59
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:17,028
we don't stand out too much

60
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,128
that we catch the judge, Mr. Takegi's eyes.

61
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,428
Mr. Takegi?

62
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,328
You don't know him?

63
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,228
He's the big shot of Japan's Patissier Association,

64
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,728
the Legendary expert of Sweets, Shoutoku Takegi.

65
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,728
If we catch his eyes, what happens?

66
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,128
Half way through the program,

67
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:36,428
Mr. Takegi picks someone from the audience

68
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:40,728
to try the sweets.

69
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:43,428
And if you correctly identify the fruit

70
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,528
that is used in the sweets,

71
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:47,528
you get to eat the winning sweets of that program.

72
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,128
But, if you don't make it,

73
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:51,728
they chase you out of the studio right that minute.

74
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,728
Is that man called Takegi that strict?

75
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,628
Yep. Although today's champion

76
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:59,028
won six consecutive wins,

77
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:01,928
Mr. Takegi's score is always really tough.

78
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:05,628
Well, the challenger's score is even lower, though.

79
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,228
Come to think of it,

80
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,728
it seems that the champion Mr. Kurimura

81
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,028
is going to be opening another branch again.

82
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,928
It'd be nice if he opens a branch in Beika Town too.

83
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:18,228
But, don't you think...

84
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,928
there's something suspicious about that champion?

85
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:23,328
Because even yesterday he coincidentally happened

86
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,428
to bring ice cream and jelly that go well strawberries,

87
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,928
the theme of that day.

88
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:29,128
What's with you?

89
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,228
Are you saying that the champion's cheating?

90
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,428
I don't think he would do such a thing.

91
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:36,428
Even the TV staff don't know

92
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,628
what the theme fruit will be until the box is opened.

93
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:41,428
The box is the old looking iron box

94
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,828
that was opened at the start of the program, right?

95
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,728
Any TV staff could easily open it

96
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,028
and take a peek, no?

97
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:51,028
But it's made so that you can't do that!

98
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:54,228
Each time, person known as the master of selecting fruit

99
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,728
packs a load of the theme fruit into the box.

100
00:05:57,728 --> 00:05:58,728
After the fruit is packed,

101
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:01,528
the box is locked for the time being.

102
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,428
Then the box is sent to the TV station.

103
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,628
The program director who receives the box

104
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,028
then places a different lock on it

105
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:10,328
and sends the box back to the home of the master of fruits.

106
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,528
The master then opens his own lock.

107
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,028
After this the box is sent back to the TV station.

108
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,328
Then the MC who receives the key

109
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:22,528
at the start of the program unlocks the box.

110
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,228
And then for the first time,

111
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:25,828
we find out what the theme fruit is.

112
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,628
I see.

113
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,328
It's an old code.

114
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,328
A code?

115
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,328
Before, when communication devices

116
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,028
weren't as advanced as they were now,

117
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,528
that's how people used to exchange confidential letters.

118
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,728
By using this method,

119
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:41,628
the people who have the key

120
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,428
are the only people who can see the contents.

121
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:44,728
I see!

122
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,828
Even if somebody were to want to look inside

123
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,228
while delivering the box,

124
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:50,128
they couldn't possibly do that, huh?

125
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:52,728
By the way, just how are we supposed

126
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,528
to keep from standing out?

127
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:57,328
There are a lot of women in the audience so...

128
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:00,928
Why don't you try wearing girlish clothes?

129
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,228
Girlish?

130
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,128
Well, but the one who'd stand out

131
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:07,328
most is that man with the mustache, though.

132
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,728
Oh, Mr. Takegi...

133
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,828
If it's about the fruit that'll be used in tomorrow's show,

134
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,028
I've already finished packing them.

135
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,128
Oh.

136
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:18,628
-"Terafumi Kasuga, age 45" -We had choice fruit

137
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:21,428
from all over the nation sent to us this time too.

138
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:23,028
So, rest assured.

139
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,128
Well, I'm going to confirm it then.

140
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,328
Oh, no.

141
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:28,628
Even for you, Mr. Takei,

142
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,528
I can't show you the contents!

143
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,328
Isn't that what we promised?

144
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,928
Don't worry about it.

145
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,628
It's not the contents of the box that I want to see.

146
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:41,028
-"Shoutoku Takegi, age 69" -It's the key.

147
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,928
I guess it's locked tight.

148
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,328
Of course.

149
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:53,328
Are you sure that nobody saw you packing the fruit?

150
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:56,628
Yes. Like always I packed the box alone

151
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:59,028
in this storeroom.

152
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,828
I carried in boxes that are delivered

153
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:05,228
to restaurants and other businesses as camouflage too.

154
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:08,628
So, I'm sure that even the couriers didn't realize a thing.

155
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:10,928
If so, if anything were to be leaked outside,

156
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:14,928
it could only be from your mouth.

157
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,028
Oh, so the box of forbidden fruit

158
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,428
-"Nichiuri TV" -has arrived.

159
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,028
Then, let's hurry and lock it up

160
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:23,828
and send it back, Furuya.

161
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:25,228
Oh, yes sir.

162
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,428
The padlock to be used

163
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,528
is in my desk as always.

164
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,428
-"Toshide Taruoka, age 48" -No matter what you do,

165
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,328
don't look inside, all right?

166
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,728
Mr. Takegi just bawled me out

167
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:38,228
right before going on air during the previous program.

168
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:39,928
-"Wataru Furuya, age 31" -I couldn't do that anyway,

169
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:43,028
because it's already locked with another key.

170
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:45,528
That's true.

171
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,928
They're going through that bothersome method again?

172
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,028
If so, Mr. Takegi should pack the box

173
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:51,628
and lock it himself.

174
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,328
He says that he wants to be surprised too,

175
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:56,528
seeing the contents when the program's being aired.

176
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,228
Well, he's getting old too.

177
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,328
To tell the truth,

178
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:04,028
we have a prospective candidate to replace him.

179
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:10,828
How about it?

180
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,528
I look a little more girlish, don't I?

181
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:21,728
That...

182
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,228
What part of you is different from always?

183
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:29,328
I'm wearing cute flower pattern undies.

184
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,328
It's sort of embarrassing, though.

185
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,528
What's the use if people can't see it.

186
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,028
By the way, where's Yoko?

187
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,728
She's nowhere.

188
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:42,028
If she's one of the judges,

189
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,028
maybe she's waiting in another room

190
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,428
for the sweets to be delivered?

191
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,428
Huh?

192
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:47,828
Don't worry,

193
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,828
she'll be displayed on the monitor.

194
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:55,328
Then, it's no different from watching TV at home!

195
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,328
That...

196
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:00,728
I'm sorry, we'll quiet down.

197
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,928
Excuse me,

198
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:04,628
but you're the renowned detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri, right?

199
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,328
Oh yes...

200
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,428
I have something I'd like to discuss with you.

201
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:10,928
Yes?

202
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,628
We'll start airing then!

203
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:33,028
Five seconds to go!

204
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:36,028
Four, three...

205
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,128
Welcome to our cooking arena.

206
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:44,828
Please enjoy a very sweet evening tonight.

207
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:47,728
Before announcing the fruit for tonight,

208
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,328
I'd like to introduce our two guests

209
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:52,328
that we have invited over to our arena.

210
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:55,328
It will be her second appearance...

211
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,928
"Which Sweet Show"

212
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:58,828
Ms. Yoko Okino!

213
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,328
And the other guest is...

214
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,828
the great detective...

215
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,228
The great Kogoro Mouri Sensei!

216
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,528
What's with this turn of events.

217
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,228
He's substituting for Mr. Takegi

218
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:19,328
and yet doesn't look at all nervous.

219
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,428
Give it your best shot, Dad!

220
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,428
Huh?

221
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:23,828
Nope, the ones who have to give their best shot

222
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:25,828
are the chefs.

223
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:29,828
Do you eat a lot of sweets, Detective Mouri?

224
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:33,428
Yes! I have a soft spot for sweet things.

225
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:36,628
Oh, really?

226
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,728
Which means your wife frequently makes you sweets?

227
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,228
My wife?

228
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:44,628
No... her's is not edible!

229
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:50,428
Mom was looking forward to seeing this program.

230
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,228
Don't show it to her,

231
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:53,828
because it's not live on air anyway.

232
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:54,828
Hey...

233
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:58,028
Is it true that Mr. Takegi's whereabouts is not known?

234
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,828
Yep. The staff was saying that

235
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,928
they can't get a hold of him at all.

236
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:04,528
He hasn't come to the studio,

237
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,128
much less to the TV station either.

238
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:10,328
Oh, look, the box is going to be opened!

239
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,028
Now...

240
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:15,428
Challenger, Patissiere Goa Enokido.

241
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:19,928
Champion, Patissier Shuhei Kurimura.

242
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,728
We will announce the fruit

243
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,528
that you will be using in its entirety tonight!

244
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:27,828
We'll be using the key

245
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,628
that we received from Mr. Taruoka,

246
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,728
who like always has locked

247
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:32,728
in the safety deposit box of Tohto Bank...

248
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:39,528
To open this box of forbidden fruit!

249
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,128
A padlock like that

250
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,628
could easily be opened

251
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:47,028
by a person who is good at picking locks.

252
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,228
Aside from how it looks,

253
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,428
it seems to be a special lock

254
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,528
that has an electronic chip embedded it in.

255
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,828
If you try to pry it open

256
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:55,828
and stick something into the keyhole,

257
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:57,528
a buzzer goes off.

258
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,528
I heard that a spare can't be made easily either.

259
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:02,128
Well, I guess if it were Sir Kid,

260
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,328
it'd be duck soup.

261
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:09,428
Sera...

262
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:12,028
I have something I'd like to ask you later.

263
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:15,228
What is it... ask me now.

264
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,828
Okay, then, let me ask you...

265
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,128
Let me show you!

266
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,828
The fruit for today is...

267
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,828
Sera, are you...

268
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:31,628
maybe like me...

269
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:38,428
No way.

270
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:56,671
Isn't that Mr. Takegi, the judge?

271
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:57,671
No joke.

272
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,671
Hey, Conan!

273
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,671
You stay here!

274
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:04,971
From here and beyond,

275
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,371
it's our territory.

276
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:09,971
Our?

277
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,171
Hey, sonny!

278
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,771
No good.

279
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:20,471
He's already cold.

280
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,871
Looks to be so.

281
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,771
The cause of death

282
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:26,671
is probably this wound on the back of his head.

283
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,871
Judging from rigor mortis,

284
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:31,271
he's been dead for more than half a day.

285
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,571
Huh?

286
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,571
On the brim of the box,

287
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,671
there are traces of blood having been wiped off.

288
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,571
Moreover, this...

289
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,171
The blood being wiped off is also seen on the inside,

290
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,371
which means...

291
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,371
He hit his head on the box

292
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,571
when the lid was open and died.

293
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,071
And was packed into the box

294
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,071
together with the apples.

295
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:54,171
Is Mr. Takegi really dead?

296
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:58,371
Yeah, so call the police right away.

297
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,071
I think it's better to have the audience in the studio

298
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,671
wait in another room too.

299
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:06,071
They may have witnessed something, you know.

300
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,371
Then...

301
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,771
Let's have Detective Mouri who is in another room

302
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:11,271
come here too.

303
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:14,871
That would be better wouldn't it, Conan?

304
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,271
Do you know him?

305
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:19,371
He's Mr. Kenzaki, who acts the role of Detective Samonji.

306
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:21,871
I worked with him on another case before.

307
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:25,571
Oh... you mean that funny detective?

308
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,371
Funny...

309
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,071
I see.

310
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:34,871
In other words, inside the box where the fruit

311
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:37,471
to be used on the cooking program,

312
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,471
the corpse of Mr. Takegi the chief judge of the program,

313
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,471
was packed inside.

314
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:46,571
Mr. Takegi couldn't be contacted for a while.

315
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,871
But, I didn't think that he would've been put in a box.

316
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,971
You mean you started airing the program

317
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:54,571
despite the chief judge being absent?

318
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:59,471
I, who just happened to be in the audience of the program,

319
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,071
was singled out as his substitute.

320
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,571
Inspector!

321
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,571
Why you?

322
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,671
You're not gourmet or anything.

323
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,071
It's because I asked the producer to do me a favor.

324
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,771
Since I heard that the airing time was closing in,

325
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:17,371
I thought Mr. Mouri would come forth.

326
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,871
I knew he was going to be at the studio

327
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,171
through the text mail.

328
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,271
Mr. Kenzaki also said that if it were Mr. Mouri,

329
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,571
he would have it easy too,

330
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,071
because he is also an acquaintance.

331
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,371
Isn't that right, Producer Taruoka?

332
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,571
Yeah.

333
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,371
I thought that if it were the great detective Mouri,

334
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:34,271
it would settle in nicely as part of the program, you see.

335
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:39,071
But, is that rumoured about the key of the box true?

336
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:41,171
That two keys are used to lock it?

337
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:42,271
Yes.

338
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:45,771
First of all, the food coordinator Mr. Kasuga

339
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,771
packs the box with the fruit

340
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,071
that is the theme for the day.

341
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,471
He locks it with a padlock

342
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:51,171
and sends it to Nichiuri TV.

343
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,471
Then after I receive that box,

344
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,171
I lock it with a different padlock

345
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,471
and send it back to Mr. Kasuga's residence.

346
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,971
Then again Mr. Kasuga unlocks the padlock

347
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,071
that he had used at his residence,

348
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,371
and sends it back once again to the TV station.

349
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,971
The MC Kenzaki, at the beginning of the show,

350
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:07,671
uses the key that he receives from me

351
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,471
to open my padlock.

352
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,071
Here for the first time,

353
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,071
everybody finds out what the theme fruit is.

354
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:18,571
Well, this method is one that Mr. Takegi had proposed

355
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,971
to make sure that the fruit inside the box

356
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:24,071
would not be leaked beforehand.

357
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,671
Which means...

358
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,571
that the one who could've put the corpse into the box

359
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,171
would be Mr. Kasuga who first locked the box,

360
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:35,171
or you, that had the last key.

361
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,371
No way...

362
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,771
I do give the key to the MC,

363
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,471
but I do it while the program is being aired, you know?

364
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:44,071
Until then, the key is stored

365
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,071
in the safety deposit box of Tohto Bank,

366
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,571
and is not in my hands.

367
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:51,671
The padlock is kept in the drawer of my desk,

368
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,071
and the assistant director locks the drawer.

369
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,771
Who is that assistant director?

370
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,771
Mr. Furuya right there.

371
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,071
He always locks the drawer

372
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,371
and is also in charge of taking care of the box.

373
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:06,971
Which means that he's the one who carries it around too?

374
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:08,471
Although I do take of the box,

375
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:11,671
it's not like I watch it 24/7.

376
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,271
Carrying the box around is left to the young assistant directors.

377
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:16,771
I just accompany them.

378
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:21,271
Well, there are times that I go alone

379
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,971
to the storage room where the box is kept

380
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,671
to check whether the lock had been pried open or not.

381
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,771
Then if at that time,

382
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,271
you sniff the box carefully,

383
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,371
wouldn't you be able to tell what's inside the box?

384
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,771
No way!

385
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:32,971
Because to fill the space between the lid and the box,

386
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,471
a rubber packing like the ones

387
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,571
used for refrigerators is attached.

388
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:40,471
Then the only one left would be Mr. Kasuga,

389
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,271
the first one to lock the box.

390
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,571
Come to think of it,

391
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:45,371
last night another staff member said that

392
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,871
Mr. Takegi asked for Mr. Kasuga's address.

393
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:50,771
Then, maybe he went to Mr. Kasuga's home.

394
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:52,371
Yes.

395
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:54,071
It's true that Mr. Takegi came over

396
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:56,471
to my house last night.

397
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:59,671
Just after I finished packing the box.

398
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,671
Before the staff came to pick up the box.

399
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:06,671
Mr. Kasuga, what brings you here?

400
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:09,771
I came because Mr. Takegi called me.

401
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:12,171
He said that he was going to nab the perp

402
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:14,271
who is leaking information about the contents of the box.

403
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,271
He said that he'd expose the perp

404
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,471
while the program is being aired,

405
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,771
so to come and watch.

406
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,771
Then, Mr. Takegi went to your house to...

407
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:25,871
To check the padlock that I locked

408
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,671
and to make sure that I wasn't doing anything

409
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,871
I wasn't supposed to do.

410
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:33,271
After all, I'm the only one who knows what's in the box.

411
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,971
He seems to have suspected me

412
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:37,971
for leaking information about the contents.

413
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:41,771
And, what did Mr. Takegi do after that?

414
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:45,271
He left as soon as the staff came

415
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,971
to pick up the box.

416
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,371
Isn't that right?

417
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:49,571
Yes.

418
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,871
No doubt about it

419
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,471
because two young assistant directors were watching.

420
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,771
Hey...

421
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:58,771
There's no time to put the corpse in the box then.

422
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,571
Moreover, what bothers me more

423
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,471
is Mr. Takegi's actions.

424
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:07,671
Why was he going that far to check the box?

425
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:11,671
Yeah. It sounds like he already knew that

426
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,771
the contents of the box was being leaked outside.

427
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:17,471
Maybe he just thought it was being leaked

428
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,471
to Mr. Kurimura, the champion,

429
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,571
who won for six consecutive weeks?

430
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:22,671
Huh?

431
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:26,171
It seems that he always brought ingredients

432
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,671
that went along well with the theme fruit.

433
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:30,271
So, maybe he suspected

434
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,071
that Kurimura knew the contents of the box.

435
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,571
Is... is that so?

436
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:35,971
Yes.

437
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,871
At the start Mr. Takegi used to say,

438
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,971
luck was also a talent.

439
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,871
What bothers me even more

440
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,671
is that Mr. Takegi didn't come to this studio,

441
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,071
much less the TV station.

442
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,171
Really?

443
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,171
I know that after the arrangement meeting,

444
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:55,171
he left the TV station.

445
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,371
If so, where on earth was the corpse

446
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:00,671
put into the box?

447
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,171
Inspector Megure!

448
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,971
Huh?

449
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,971
It seems that last night Mr. Takegi

450
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,771
secretly came to the TV station

451
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,071
and mingled among the extras of a samurai show.

452
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:16,171
What?

453
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:17,971
The director of the samurai show knew Mr. Takegi

454
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:21,071
who asked him to do a favor.

455
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,071
Saying something to the effect that

456
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:24,371
he wanted to catch his enemy off guard.

457
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:25,771
I see.

458
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:26,871
He wanted to make it look

459
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,571
as if he wasn't at the TV station

460
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:32,071
and wanted to try catching the perp in the act.

461
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:35,171
Mr. Takegi always wore a kimono,

462
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:36,471
so it probably would've been easy for him

463
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:38,371
to mingle among the extras.

464
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,271
If so...

465
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,571
It's very likely that Mr. Takegi was hiding

466
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,571
in the storeroom where the box was stored,

467
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,371
ambushing the perp.

468
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:52,271
Why?

469
00:21:56,371 --> 00:22:00,871
There were traces of blood being wiped off

470
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:03,871
by the area where the lid and box match.

471
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:06,071
That means that the box

472
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,571
was at the scene of the crime, no?

473
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,571
True.

474
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,071
I see.

475
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:19,671
That's where Mr. Takegi was killed.

476
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:25,471
By the perp...

477
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,771
Who secretly opened the box.

478
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,971
-"Next Episode" -The suspects were narrowed down

479
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,271
to three people but...

480
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:58,171
Who on earth is the perp?

481
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,571
To begin with, the method of how the padlock was opened

482
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,171
is a mystery.

483
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:05,571
I see, so that's the story.

484
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,571
Then, the earlier the better.

485
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,271
Huh? Start what?

486
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:14,171
Well, it's just...

487
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:16,371
a little magic show.

488
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,771
Next Conan,

489
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:21,771
"A Treasure Box Full of Fruits (Part 2)"

490
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,871
Next Conan's Hint:

491
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:41,971
"Apples"

492
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,071
Our hands are tied.

493
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,171
Over a box full of apples.

494
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:46,871
What a baffle.
