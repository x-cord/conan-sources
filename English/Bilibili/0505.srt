Young one, I warn you,

the best time is before you get married.

15
00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:21.255
Cut it out, dad.

16
00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:24.255
Come on, Dad. Hurry up and get ready.

17
00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:27.955
Huh? Wasn't dinner supposed to be at 10:00?

18
00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:29.755
It's still 6:30.

19
00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:33.255
So, let's leave early and go pick mom up.

20
00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.255
Pick her up? You mean at her office?

21
00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.055
No, at the beauty shop.

22

Beauty shop?

23
00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:44.055
Wait a minute. You mean that dinner was delayed to 10:00

24
00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:46.355
just so that she could go have her hair cut?

What's the problem?

26
00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:50.255
After all, she's trying to look nice for you, dad.

27
00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.855
Cut out the crap! There's no such side to her!

28
00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:00.255
Come on and get dressed up too, dad.

29
00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.355
I'm home.

she'll be outraged!

40
00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:43.955
Is that why you're cutting my hair in the bathroom instead of your shop,

41
00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:46.055
so you can avoid the eyes of other people?

42
00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:49.155
I mean, I'm just trying to be thoughtful

I'm sorry, there's a customer who specially reserved tonight.

I mean, I don't intend to make today the last time I'll be coming here.

No. Today will be the last time.

Yes, the other staff seem to have had other matters to attend to.

I'm fine, no need to worry about me.

You want to dye, cut and perm your hair like always, right?

65
00:04:52.755 --> 00:04:56.655
Yes. I just need you to cut the ends of my hair evenly.

66
00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:58.555
Okay, I'll start by washing your hair then,

67
00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:00.455
so please go over to the shampoo stand!

who is getting her hair cut at this time of day?

72

No big deal. After all, you've nothing to do, anyway.

73
00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:20.555
Mom was saying her appointment is at 8:00,

74
00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:23.655
so maybe you'll get to see mom with her hair down.

75
00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:26.055
I've seen a load of her with her hair down

76
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.955
to the point of getting sick of it when I was young!

77
00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:32.555
But you sure decided quickly to go and pick her up, Pops.

78
00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.855
Okay, hair dye all done!

79
00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:38.555
I'm going to leave you here for 10 minutes like this

80
00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:42.955
till the dye sets in, so please wait a while.

81
00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:45.055
Are you going out somewhere?

82
00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:46.755
Yes. I'm going to drop by at the convenience store

83
00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:47.855
after throwing out the trash.

84
00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:51.455
I see. I thought I was going to get to talk to you like always,

85
00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:53.155
but too bad.

86
00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:56.555
I look forward to that each time you come too!

87
00:05:56.555 --> 00:05:59.855
Stories about the cases that you've handled and all,

88
00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:02.455
plus the stories about your famous detective husband.

89
00:06:02.455 --> 00:06:04.555
Well, I'm going to be having dinner

90
00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:07.355
with that famed detective after this,

91
00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:10.055
so I guess I'll go get some good stories from him.

92
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:14.255
Then I've got to set your hair nicer than usual tonight!

93
00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:15.855
I'll hear you out on your love stories about your husband

94
00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:18.055
while I'm cutting your hair.

95
00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:20.355
It's not lovey-dovey stories that I want to talk about, but complaints.

96
00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:24.655
If I remember correctly,

97
00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:28.555
the beauty shop was somewhere right up this slope.

98
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.955
It's been a while since you've both met,

99
00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:33.355
-so talk nicely, okay, dad! -Yeah.

100
00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:36.255
I'll make sure that I give it to that old lady tonight.

101
00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:39.455
What was that?

102
00:06:39.455 --> 00:06:40.855
Not again?

103
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:47.155
What was that sound all about?

104
00:06:47.155 --> 00:06:51.355
It sounded like something bump into something then, dropped.

105
00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:54.555
But nothing looks to have been dropped anywhere.

106
00:06:54.555 --> 00:06:57.455
It doesn't seem like anything hit a car either.

107
00:06:57.455 --> 00:06:59.655
Maybe it's that.

108
00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:02.955
Look, on top of the trash below in the trash dump.

109
00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:05.855
What is it?

110
00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:12.655
Hey, isn't that the body of a person?

111
00:07:12.655 --> 00:07:15.355
Call an ambulance and the police right away.

112
00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:20.955
What? What's that sound?

113
00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:25.255
How do you like it?

114
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.255
Thank you, it's perfect!

115
00:07:29.255 --> 00:07:31.255
Thank for waiting.

116
00:07:32.455 --> 00:07:35.455
Doesn't it sort of sound noisy outside?

117
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.855
It seems as if something has happened.

118
00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:40.755
The sirens of police cars can be heard, too.

119
00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.555
Would you like to go take a look?

120
00:07:42.555 --> 00:07:44.255
Yes, I guess so.

121
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:47.655
But if it's a crime, it's more my husband's job than mine.

122
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:49.455
I guess so.

123
00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.855
No. What I need is

124
00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:56.355
to be defended by you, Attorney at Law Kisaki.

125
00:07:58.455 --> 00:08:00.855
Back down, back down!

126
00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:04.655
From the driver's license he had on him,

127
00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:08.255
the victim is Mr. Shiro Eisaku, age 28.

128
00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:12.255
The cause of his death is loss of blood from being slashed in the neck.

129
00:08:12.255 --> 00:08:14.755
If we take into account, Mr. Mouri's story saying

130
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:17.355
that he coincidentally heard something drop,

131
00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:20.155
after the victim was slashed in the neck,

132
00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:22.655
his body was thrown over that guard rail on the road above over there,

133
00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:24.655
then fell in here.

134
00:08:24.655 --> 00:08:28.955
But when we heard the sound from the road above,

135
00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:31.855
there was no one in sight.

136
00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:34.255
-Is that true? -Yes.

137
00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:38.955
It could be that the body was thrown from the bed of a vehicle

138
00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:42.955
with a high body like a truck.

139
00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:46.855
But I don't think I heard sounds of a truck.

140
00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:48.355
Right.

141
00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:49.555
What we heard were three sounds,

142
00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:52.655
the sound of something bumping into something,

143
00:08:52.655 --> 00:08:55.155
the sound of something falling

144
00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:58.555
and a rattling sound like something was being rolled along!

145
00:08:58.555 --> 00:09:02.455
So, you heard a crash, thud and rattling sound?

146
00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:04.155
Well, so much for the sound,

147
00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:06.555
but if a body were to be thrown over,

148
00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.955
the culprit would most likely have had to be a man.

149
00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:11.755
Right. And not just an ordinary man,

150
00:09:11.755 --> 00:09:14.155
but a strong and stout wrestler or something.

151
00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:15.755
A wrestler?

152
00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.555
Inspector, don't you know?

153
00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:20.855
The victim is Shiro Eisaku, a wrestler

154
00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:24.155
who was scheduled to challenge the champion!

155
00:09:24.155 --> 00:09:27.155
He was famous for not letting his opponents attack him from behind,

156
00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:29.255
and weighed 90 kilograms.

157
00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:30.855
Anyone who could've slashed the throat of this man,

158
00:09:30.855 --> 00:09:33.255
then throw him over ever so lightly,

159
00:09:33.255 --> 00:09:35.855
has to be someone who is nimble as well as super muscular.

160
00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:37.455
No.

161
00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:40.755
A woman could've slashed his throat too, don't you think?

162
00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:42.155
Although that depends on the condition this man was in

163
00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:44.655
during the time he was killed.

164
00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:46.555
You!

165
00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.055
Eri, why are you here?

166
00:09:51.055 --> 00:09:52.955
That's for me to say.

167
00:09:52.955 --> 00:09:54.855
I mean, the cafe that we were going to eat at

168
00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:57.355
is not in this direction, is it?

169
00:09:57.355 --> 00:09:59.355
Well...

170
00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:01.855
We just happened to be here!

171
00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:06.155
Well, at any rate, if the victim is a wrestler,

172
00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.855
let's investigate all the wrestlers

173
00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:09.555
that may have had a grudge against him to start!

174
00:10:09.555 --> 00:10:11.755
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:13.755
How stupid can the police get.

176
00:10:13.755 --> 00:10:17.355
They can go snooping around all the wrestlers they want.

177
00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:19.055
No matter how hard they check,

178
00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:21.355
they'll probably never track the culprit down

179
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:23.755
to a nobody beautician like me.

180
00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.155
You live in the neighborhood, don't you?

181
00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:32.455
Yes, I guess.

182
00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:35.755
Do you know of any barber or beauty shop near here?

183
00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:40.255
Conan, why are you asking her something like that?

184
00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:45.255
Because, when I looked at the throat of the man who died,

185
00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:49.655
I saw a lot of small cut strands of hair mixed with blood!

186
00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:52.055
What? Really?

187
00:10:58.155 --> 00:10:59.955
You're right!

188
00:10:59.955 --> 00:11:01.955
I just thought that

189
00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:06.355
maybe he went to get his hair cut before he was killed!

190
00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:07.755
I see.

191
00:11:07.755 --> 00:11:10.755
Besides, the blood flowing from his neck

192
00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:13.455
has a strange looking uneven spot to it.

193
00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:17.455
Now that you mentioned it!

194
00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:21.555
Isn't this because when he was slashed in the throat,

195
00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:24.555
he had a cape or towel on?

196
00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.055
I see!

197
00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:27.655
If the culprit is a barber or a beautician,

198
00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:30.755
be it that the victim is a super strong wrestler,

199
00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:33.755
it would be easy to poke a sharp object

200
00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.055
from behind him without being suspected!

201
00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:42.555
What's up, Takagi?

202
00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:46.755
Well, Conan happened to notice something strange just now.

203
00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:52.655
I see. In other words,

204
00:11:52.655 --> 00:11:57.655
it is most likely that the barber or beautician is a super macho guy.

205
00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:58.755
Yeah.

206
00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:02.755
A man who could carry this man ever so lightly.

207
00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:05.055
I'll go check to see

208
00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:08.455
if there's such a person in this neighborhood then.

209
00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:10.455
If so, why not ask her?

210
00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:12.455
She may know somebody

211
00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:16.955
because she's also a barber or beautician herself.

212
00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:19.955
Right, Miss?

213
00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:21.755
What the?

214
00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:23.755
What is it?

215
00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.655
This boy...

216
00:12:25.655 --> 00:12:27.955
What's with him anyway?

217
00:12:38.766 --> 00:12:42.766
She's also a barber or beautician herself.

218
00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:44.966
Right, Miss?

219
00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.566
You are?

220
00:12:48.566 --> 00:12:49.866
Yes.

221
00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.066
Yes!

222
00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:54.666
She was cutting my hair for me till just a while ago.

223
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.666
Which means that the beauty shop

224
00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:57.966
that you had an appointment at today was...

225
00:12:57.966 --> 00:13:00.966
Yes, at Ms. Hasaka's shop.

226
00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:04.666
I hear that this shop is originally her late father's shop, though.

227
00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:07.166
Conan, it's amazing

228
00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.066
that you figured out she was a beautician.

229
00:13:09.066 --> 00:13:10.166
Her hands!

230
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.566
She has a corn on the second joint

231
00:13:12.566 --> 00:13:15.366
of her ring finger of her right hand, doesn't she?

232
00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:18.666
Excuse me, please show me your right hand.

233
00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:20.066
Yes.

234
00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.866
Excuse me.

235
00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:24.166
Yes, she does.

236
00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:27.566
That's corn was made because she has to let her ring finger

237
00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:30.266
through the loop of the handle of the scissors all the time!

238
00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:31.666
I see.

239
00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:33.066
And if you look even closer,

240
00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:36.466
the color of her nails are kind of brownish too, right?

241
00:13:36.466 --> 00:13:39.466
That's because she's always using chemicals to dye

242
00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:42.366
and shampoo the hair of her customers.

243
00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:46.166
How come you know all this stuff?

244
00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:50.066
I saw it on a TV special on beauticians.

245
00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:53.466
TV again. You're watching too much TV!

246
00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.566
It's way better than you watching the horse races, dad.

247
00:13:56.566 --> 00:13:59.066
The horse races are a must for men!

248
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:01.066
Is that so?

249
00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:06.766
Well, then how many barbers and beauty shops are there

250
00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:09.066
in this area, do you know?

251
00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:13.066
Well, you see, Mr. Shiro Eisaku who was killed

252
00:14:13.066 --> 00:14:15.466
is a wrestler who weighed 90 kilograms!

253
00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:17.766
Mr. Mouri and his party here, who happened to pass by

254
00:14:17.766 --> 00:14:21.066
heard the sound of something falling.

255
00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:25.266
Moreover, a lot of cut pieces of his blonde hair

256
00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:28.566
was mixed in the blood around his neck.

257
00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:29.666
And considering that

258
00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:32.466
there was an uneven spot in the blood around his neck,

259
00:14:32.466 --> 00:14:35.766
it can be deduced that Mr. Eisaku was having his hair cut

260
00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:37.666
when he was slashed in the neck with a sharp object,

261
00:14:37.666 --> 00:14:41.666
then thrown out from somewhere.

262
00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:43.066
Will you please help us and tell us

263
00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:46.666
if you know of any barber or beautician in this area

264
00:14:46.666 --> 00:14:51.766
that would be able to carry a guy like him up?

265
00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:55.866
Yes. Well, there are 2 or 3 others besides this shop here,

266
00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:59.166
but I don't know if there's anyone that strong in any of those shops.

267
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:02.466
You're pretty mean, aren't you?

268
00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:04.266
Because when I asked you a while ago

269
00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:07.966
whether you knew of any barbers or beauty shops near here,

270
00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:10.466
you didn't answer me!

271
00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:13.266
Why didn't you tell me back then

272
00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:15.366
that you owned a beauty shop too?

273
00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:17.866
-That's because... -You're meaner,

274
00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:21.266
asking her that question, despite already knowing all that!

275
00:15:21.266 --> 00:15:22.466
But...

276
00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:24.266
No buts!

277
00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:27.866
Now, keep an eye on him

278
00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:30.266
so he doesn't go running here and there!

279
00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:31.366
Yes.

280
00:15:31.366 --> 00:15:34.166
I couldn't answer you right away

281
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.766
because I was a bit flustered, you see.

282
00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:38.966
-Flustered? -Yes, sir.

283
00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:42.566
I came and found out that the victim was him, so...

284
00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:46.666
Do you know the victim Mr. Eisaku?

285
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:49.066
I know you'll find out later anyway,

286
00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:50.866
so let me tell you from my side.

287
00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:54.066
We used to be classmates in high school.

288
00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:56.466
There was a time when I used to go with him too.

289
00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:59.866
Then, Mr. Eisaku used to come to your shop too?

290
00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:02.466
Yes, he used to come here often to get a hair cut

291
00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:04.166
until he got engaged.

292
00:16:04.166 --> 00:16:05.966
Engaged?

293
00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:08.766
Come to think of it, I saw an article in the sports newspaper!

294
00:16:08.766 --> 00:16:11.366
If so, there could be a motive here too.

295
00:16:12.466 --> 00:16:13.766
Ms. Hasaka.

296
00:16:13.766 --> 00:16:17.766
You could also have a motive for wanting to kill Mr. Eisaku!

297
00:16:21.066 --> 00:16:22.566
Hold it!

298
00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:25.066
What a thing to say out of the blue, just like that?

299
00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:30.366
If a woman lives near the place where her ex-boyfriend is found dead,

300
00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.666
it's only natural to suspect her, isn't it?

301
00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:35.666
How can you jump to such illogical conclusions?

302
00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:38.166
-Officer Takagi. -Yes?

303
00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:41.266
What is the estimated time of his death?

304
00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:47.766
Mr. Mouri found the body at about 20:30.

305
00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:51.466
So, it was probably about 20 minutes before that.

306
00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:54.366
If so, she couldn't have committed the crime!

307
00:16:54.366 --> 00:17:00.066
Because she was doing my hair all the while from 20:00 to 21:00!

308
00:17:01.966 --> 00:17:03.966
Are you sure she was with you, right through?

309
00:17:03.966 --> 00:17:06.566
Yes, she was beside me, practically the whole time through.

310
00:17:06.566 --> 00:17:10.066
Well, she did leave to attend to some matters in between,

311
00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:12.166
but that was just for about 10 minutes.

312
00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:15.166
Then, she could've used those 10 minutes to...

313
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.266
No way!

314
00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:20.266
Her beauty shop is farther up above this slope, you know!

315
00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:23.066
It's too far a place for her to slash the throat of a big man,

316
00:17:23.066 --> 00:17:24.766
then carry him over here!

317
00:17:24.766 --> 00:17:26.966
But...

318
00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:28.966
But what?

319
00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:36.966
Oh no. Mom and dad are glaring at each other again.

320
00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:43.466
But, if what Eri said a while ago is true...

321
00:17:44.066 --> 00:17:48.766
Would you like to come to my shop?

322
00:17:56.966 --> 00:17:59.566
I guess this kind of thing off and on is not bad.

323
00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:04.966
Turn left at that intersection over there.

324
00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.366
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

325
00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:11.866
When making a turn at the intersection,

326
00:18:11.866 --> 00:18:13.966
you're supposed to turn on your blinkers early, and check both sides!

327
00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:15.966
Keep to the traffic rules, will you?

328
00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:19.366
Oh boy. Then, why ride with me?

329
00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.066
That's my shop over there.

330
00:18:22.066 --> 00:18:23.266
What?

331
00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:30.766
Conan!

332
00:18:31.366 --> 00:18:34.066
What a terrible driving!

333
00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:36.766
It would've been better to walk here than take the car!

334
00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:41.366
-Are you all right? -Yep.

335
00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:42.966
I see.

336
00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:45.466
Ms. Kisaki, you were sitting here,

337
00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:48.466
having your hair cut by Ms. Hasaka?

338
00:18:48.466 --> 00:18:49.466
Yes.

339
00:18:49.466 --> 00:18:52.866
She always cuts my hair for me after work,

340
00:18:52.866 --> 00:18:56.166
and today I had an appointment at 20:00.

341
00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:58.066
I got to the shop at 20:00.

342
00:18:58.066 --> 00:19:01.566
She started then and shampooed me for 10 minutes.

343
00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:03.866
Dying my hair took 20 minutes.

344
00:19:03.866 --> 00:19:05.766
Shampooing me again took 10 minutes.

345
00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:07.966
Giving me a perm took 10 minutes,

346
00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:10.066
she shampooed me again for 10 minutes.

347
00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:11.966
Then cutting my hair took 15 minutes.

348
00:19:11.966 --> 00:19:14.266
Then the last shampooing took 10 minutes.

349
00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:16.966
Finally, blow drying and setting my hair took 10 minutes.

350
00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:20.366
It took about an hour to finish everything, didn't it?

351
00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:21.566
Yes.

352
00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:24.266
You sure have fantastic memory.

353
00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:26.366
She always does it for me,

354
00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:30.166
and besides, I was supposed to go out to dinner with somebody afterwards.

355
00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:31.766
So, I kept glancing at the clock.

356
00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:36.266
And? When and where did you go off to attend to your matters?

357
00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:37.566
During the waiting time for the color

358
00:19:37.566 --> 00:19:40.066
to set into my hair after she dyed it.

359
00:19:40.066 --> 00:19:43.266
If I remember correctly, I think it was

360
00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.466
for 10 minutes between 20:20 to 20:30.

361
00:19:45.466 --> 00:19:47.166
Yes.

362
00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:51.366
For 10 minutes, between 20:20 to 20:30...

363
00:19:51.366 --> 00:19:55.366
Then, she probably used that time to kill him!

364
00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:57.266
By car, it doesn't take 3 minutes

365
00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:59.266
to get from the scene of the crime to here.

366
00:19:59.266 --> 00:20:00.766
You know...

367
00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.866
I don't have a driver's license,

368
00:20:03.866 --> 00:20:06.666
and all I did was throw out the trash and go to the convenience store.

369
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:08.966
-Throw out the trash? -Yes.

370
00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:11.066
I threw the trash out at the trash dump

371
00:20:11.066 --> 00:20:12.166
beside the convenience store where I went shopping.

372
00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:14.166
-The convenience store? -Yes.

373
00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:17.266
It's close by, so shall we go there too?

374
00:20:19.566 --> 00:20:20.966
Please come this way.

375
00:20:20.966 --> 00:20:23.366
-A back road. -Yes.

376
00:20:23.366 --> 00:20:27.166
This way is faster than taking the main road.

377
00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:28.966
Whose scooter is this?

378
00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:32.866
It's a keepsake of my late father, and I'm riding it now!

379
00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.366
I used it when I went to the convenience store a while ago too

380
00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:37.566
because I bought a bag of rice.

381
00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:40.666
Then, you placed the body in the back of the scooter and...

382
00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:43.166
-Idiot! -What?

383
00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:45.166
It's more than difficult trying to just put a person

384
00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:47.466
weighing 90 kilograms in the back of a scooter,

385
00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:49.166
and you're saying that she fixed the body on

386
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:52.066
and moved it some place without anybody noticing? No way!

387
00:20:52.066 --> 00:20:56.666
Just how do propose she threw the body down from that position?

388
00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:59.866
That's why, I was just stating a possibility.

389
00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:04.166
And how do you get to the convenience store?

390
00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:06.966
Yes. If you take that side road over there,

391
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:09.466
it takes you to the road in front of the convenience store.

392
00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:12.066
Hey!

393
00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:14.466
Is that way the direction where the trash dump

394
00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:16.066
that the body was found is?

395
00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.366
Yes.

396
00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:21.066
Hey, Conan.

397
00:21:26.866 --> 00:21:28.266
Just as I thought.

398
00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:29.866
The trash dump where the body was found

399
00:21:29.866 --> 00:21:32.866
is two stories below right up ahead.

400
00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:37.066
But, unless you use a crane or something,

401
00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:39.366
it would be impossible to throw a person over into the trash dump.

402
00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:44.566
A popular wrestler Mr. Shiro Eisaku is killed

403
00:21:44.566 --> 00:21:47.966
and his dead body is found in a trash dump.

404
00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:50.866
Back then, we heard three sounds.

405
00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:57.666
I wonder what that sounds were of?

406
00:21:58.766 --> 00:22:00.666
Mr. Eisaku was killed

407
00:22:00.666 --> 00:22:04.666
when he was getting his hair cut at a barber or a beauty salon.

408
00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:08.466
If so, the most suspicious person would be Ms. Minayo Hasaka

409
00:22:08.466 --> 00:22:10.266
who runs a beauty shop in the neighborhood.

410
00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:13.766
Minayo also used to be Mr. Eisaku's ex-girlfriend.

411
00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:19.466
However, Minayo was doing Eri Kisaki's hair from 20:00 to 21:00.

412
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:22.166
Minayo was away from Ms. Kisaki

413
00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:25.766
only for 10 minutes from 20:20.

414
00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.766
If Minayo is the killer,

415
00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:30.266
how did she take Mr. Eisaku's body which is 90 kilograms

416
00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:33.766
to the trash dump in a matter of 10 minutes?

417
00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:38.366
Is Minayo really the killer?

418
00:22:38.366 --> 00:22:41.366
And, what exactly were causing

419
00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:44.666
the three sounds that we heard back then?

420
00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:13.366
"Next Episode" -The traffic sign pole.

421
00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:16.566
It's dusted off. There are tiny, thin lines.

422
00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:18.266
What're these lines?

423
00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:21.466
You're hurt, after all!

424
00:24:21.466 --> 00:24:23.166
Hurt?

425
00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.966
No way!

426
00:24:24.966 --> 00:24:28.866
Do that after you get a court issued arrest warrant, will you?

427
00:24:28.866 --> 00:24:32.066
Okay, so you want evidence,

428
00:24:32.066 --> 00:24:34.666
proving that she could also have committed the crime.

429
00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:40.766
Next Conan, "Lawyer Eri Kisaki's Testimony (Part 2)"

430
00:24:55.966 --> 00:24:58.566
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:58.566 --> 00:25:00.766
"A Motor Scooter"

432
00:25:00.766 --> 00:25:01.966
This case is totally Greek to me.

433
00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:03.066
Are you into greeking (gibberish) or something?

434
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:04.666
-Why? -You always look puzzled.

435
00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:05.966
Hey, you!
