1
00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:03,366
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:05,066
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,966
The upside down trick is finally solved!

4
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,466
An unfinished manuscript corners the killer.

5
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:10,866
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,566
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:03,745
I, Toshihisa Manda who was confined to my room at the hotel

9
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:06,445
snuck out of the hotel

10
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:11,645
and killed my disciple and ghost writer Kohei Haramoto!

11
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:14,145
Soon afterwards, I returned to the hotel

12
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,245
and established a fake alibi.

13
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:19,245
We were playing baseball

14
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:22,545
and ended up chasing the ball over to Mr. Haramoto's place.

15
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:25,145
And, in the house...

16
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:32,345
We find Mr. Haramoto who had been murdered!

17
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:40,145
"Result of the Tumble (Part 2)"

18
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:41,645
I see.

19
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:44,345
So, when you children came to look for the ball

20
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:46,245
and took a look into this house,

21
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:49,945
you found this man bleeding from the head and lying on the ground.

22
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:53,345
I wonder if a robber did this.

23
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:56,545
The place doesn't seem to be all that messed up, though.

24
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,045
I think the killer knows him.

25
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,245
What?

26
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,645
Look here.

27
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:07,945
There's a sign that says "Do Not Enter" on the door of this room.

28
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:09,445
And what about it?

29
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,345
It tells you that somebody's in the room.

30
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,545
Right.

31
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:15,245
If somebody opens the door, the owner of the house will see him.

32
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,345
It'd be impossible to go around behind him without being noticed.

33
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,745
In my case, I would deliberately make noise,

34
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:23,245
and when the person comes out of the room,

35
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:27,645
I would be waiting with the murder weapon in my hand ready to kill him.

36
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,245
What a frightening thing to say, Ai.

37
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:33,645
Right, I'm sure Mr. Haramoto let the killer into the room himself.

38
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:35,945
A person like you that he knows well.

39
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,145
Huh?

40
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,945
What's the estimated time of death that the coroner came up with?

41
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:43,545
About two hours ago, about 3 in the afternoon.

42
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,845
By the way, where were you about that time?

43
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:49,245
I was confined to my room at the New Beika Hotel right through

44
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,945
since last night.

45
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:54,345
New Beika Hotel is near here.

46
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:55,945
2 or 3 minutes by car,

47
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,245
and it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes if by bike.

48
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,645
Mr. Shimaki, were you with him too?

49
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:05,345
No. I was at the elevator hall near Sensei's room

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,945
waiting for the manuscripts to be completed.

51
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:11,845
But, unless he passes by me, he can't leave the hotel,

52
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,645
so I don't think he could've snuck out.

53
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,245
And when was the manuscript completed?

54
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:20,945
Hey, hey, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

55
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:22,345
No, that's not it.

56
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,745
We're asking just to be safe. And?

57
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:28,445
Yes, it was completed at about 4pm.

58
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,545
After that, I checked the manuscript in the room of the hotel.

59
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:33,645
Then in order to discuss the next novel,

60
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,045
we took a cab over to Sensei's house.

61
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,245
I see.

62
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,845
Could there have been a friend of Mr. Haramoto,

63
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,645
who harbored a grudge against him?

64
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:45,545
I wonder. He was a reticent man.

65
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:47,245
He said that he wanted to be a novelist

66
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,745
so I had him help me organize my manuscripts and stuff like that.

67
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:55,845
That's why a lot of my novels are in his computer.

68
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:58,145
Even the ones that were turned down are inside.

69
00:04:58,145 --> 00:04:59,845
A while ago, you mentioned that

70
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:03,145
you were letting him live in this house or something like that.

71
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:07,745
Yes, this is the house that I lived in with my family

72
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:08,945
but it was getting to small for us,

73
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,845
so we had to get a new house across the street.

74
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,645
Well, my sons have left the house and are on their own,

75
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,945
my wife has already passed away,

76
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,345
and I'm living in the house opposite all alone.

77
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,345
I didn't feel like having the house demolished,

78
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:24,045
so I had him live here.

79
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:27,545
For living here alone, his place is quite organized.

80
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:30,945
He had a housekeeper come here once a week.

81
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:37,245
But! I think that Mr. Haramoto liked to organize things to begin with

82
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,845
because only a mirror is in the drawer.

83
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:41,945
Hey, Conan!

84
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,645
But something's strange.

85
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,445
There are blood stains on the desk

86
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,545
and a cracked piece of the flower vase on the mirror,

87
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:51,445
there's no blood in the drawer.

88
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:54,045
It looks as if something else were in here.

89
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:55,045
What?

90
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:59,345
So the culprit was after something that was in this drawer?

91
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:02,345
Mr. Manda, do you have any idea what it could've been?

92
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:03,845
No.

93
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:07,945
By the way, I think it's about time that you realize.

94
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:12,145
Right. There something even stranger in the room over here.

95
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:14,345
Strange?

96
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,545
See, in this room.

97
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,245
The shelf, shelf!

98
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:23,245
The mini cars, dolls and, books are all toppled upside!

99
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:25,245
True.

100
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,545
Why?

101
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,045
What the...

102
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,845
A cat?

103
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:32,745
Your cat?

104
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,345
You shouldn't leave your cat to roam at the scene of the crime!

105
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:37,645
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,945
I was so upset that I completely forgot.

107
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:43,045
Inspector, a woman has come in front the back door.

108
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,545
What's with you people

109
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,845
entering into someone else's house without permission?

110
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:49,345
Ms. Ichimura.

111
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,245
Oh, Sensei, you're here?

112
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,845
What? Mr. Haramoto was...

113
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:58,645
I didn't do it. I'm just a housekeeper.

114
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:00,345
Oh, so you're the housekeeper.

115
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,245
Then could you tell us?

116
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,345
Yes?

117
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:09,845
Oh, this is Mr. Haramoto's mischief.

118
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,245
His mischief?

119
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:15,345
Yes, he usually does incomprehensible mischief.

120
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:17,945
Such as stacking slippers up high one after the other,

121
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:21,645
loosen all the light bulbs in the house making them unusable,

122
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:25,245
line up video tapes in the locker and set them up like dominos.

123
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:29,145
Then he watches what happens from hiding and grins.

124
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:34,245
He like to watch me troubled putting everything back in order.

125
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,645
So, it's the same thing here.

126
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:40,845
Because of course he knows I'll be here at this time.

127
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,745
Oh, so it was just mischief?

128
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,945
But, if so, it's understandable.

129
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:49,145
Yes, although it's really childish.

130
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:52,545
Really. I was wondering what kind of trick this was.

131
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:55,945
No. Mr. Haramoto's not the one who turned everything upside down,

132
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,245
the culprit did it.

133
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:00,645
See. Look at this book.

134
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,145
The cover is out of place and ripped, right?

135
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,945
It's proof that this was turned upside hastily.

136
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,145
There is a mini car with a broken side mirror,

137
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,045
and even a doll that has fallen inside the case.

138
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:14,245
These are important collections for Mr. Haramoto.

139
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,245
Even if he were to do mischief, I'm sure he'd be more careful.

140
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,345
-And... -Since he knew

141
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:22,445
the housekeeper was coming in two hours,

142
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:25,145
he didn't have to rush, is what you want to say, right?

143
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:26,645
Right.

144
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:30,045
Then, the culprit's the one who did it after all, but why?

145
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:32,945
The most thinkable thing is to hide something.

146
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,045
Yeah. If only one is turned upside down,

147
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:41,245
it would look unnatural so other things were also turned upside down.

148
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:45,245
May I be excused to leave?

149
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,145
It's time that I have to return to the editing section.

150
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,945
Hey, you're coming back after you finish the proof, aren't you?

151
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:55,045
We've got to discuss the next story.

152
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,845
But Sensei, we couldn't possibly discuss the next mystery story

153
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,045
on a day like this.

154
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,545
Mystery?

155
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:03,345
I thought you only wrote historical novels.

156
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:06,545
I'm going to challenge a new field.

157
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,045
To tell the truth, it's almost completed.

158
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:11,845
Come to think of it, there were some lined out on that shelf too.

159
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:15,245
Yeah, more than half were mystery stories.

160
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,645
Yes, yes, Mr. Haramoto liked detective stories.

161
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,845
He used to say that his debut novel would be a detective story.

162
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,845
The detective that Mr. Haramoto was thinking of

163
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,945
-was an interesting character. -Ms. Ichimura,

164
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:30,945
didn't he ask you to do something for him today?

165
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,145
What?

166
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:36,345
Well, he used to often ask you to go buy things for his collection

167
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:39,345
when he didn't have time to go out.

168
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,945
Today, he asked for morning call and...

169
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:46,145
oh, he asked me to make a dentist appointment too, that's about it.

170
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,645
I didn't go buy anything for him.

171
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,345
I see. Well, the thing is,

172
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,345
when I called him a while ago from the hotel, he said that

173
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:55,845
he was glad that his collection was completed.

174
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,445
Oh well, forget it, then.

175
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:00,745
He was probably talking about some useless collection again.

176
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:02,945
You called Mr. Haramoto today?

177
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:05,645
Yes. When I'm stuck making a story,

178
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,645
I call him a lot for a change of mood.

179
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,545
How was he back then?

180
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:14,245
He was his own usual self.

181
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,045
I see.

182
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,945
What do you see?

183
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,145
Don't tell me you've figured out who the killer is?

184
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:23,645
Yeah, the culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down,

185
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:27,045
but thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down!

186
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:38,396
The culprit didn't try to hide things by turning them upside down?

187
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,196
But thought that it would be hidden if things were turned upside down?

188
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:42,596
Rather, to put it accurately,

189
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:44,796
the culprit thought that it would hide it for him.

190
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:46,396
Hide it?

191
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,396
Hide what?

192
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,296
Well, proof of that was kind of messed up

193
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,496
because the culprit got the upper hand, though.

194
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:53,996
Hey, don't tell me...

195
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,596
That he's the culprit?

196
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,596
Yeah, most likely.

197
00:10:57,596 --> 00:11:01,996
Okay, I'll finish the proofs and the editing section and come back.

198
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,996
Then, could I be excused too?

199
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,996
I'd like to prepare for the discussion, and take him home too.

200
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,096
All right.

201
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:12,296
I'll be at home right opposite here, so please call me if you need me.

202
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,196
Hey, he's going to leave!

203
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,996
Is it okay, Conan?

204
00:11:15,996 --> 00:11:18,796
You're going to be discussing a detective story

205
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:21,896
that you've never written before, aren't you, sir?

206
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,396
-Yeah. -I can't wait to read it

207
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,996
because I just love mystery stories!

208
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:30,096
I wonder if any of it is in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

209
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:32,696
I wonder.

210
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:37,096
Huh, why are you letting him go off so cheerfully?

211
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,596
I thought you were going to corner the culprit.

212
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:44,096
Well, I guess you have your reasons for doing what you're doing.

213
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:47,396
But, your attitude of knowing all by yourself and snickering

214
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,596
really bugs me.

215
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:51,596
Okay, I'll tell you!

216
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,696
But, promise you'll cooperate.

217
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,396
-Sure! -Of course.

218
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,296
I mean, his disciple's just been murdered

219
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,296
and I don't see how he can go on with the discussion.

220
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,296
True.

221
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:07,796
What should I do?

222
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,296
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,996
Well, this mini car is broken!

224
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,596
The side mirror is broken off.

225
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,896
I didn't touch it.

226
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:21,996
Which means that the person who did this was really upset?

227
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,896
But, it's strange.

228
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:29,296
Mr. Haramoto did all this to surprise the housekeeper, right?

229
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,396
That's right,

230
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:33,596
because he knew that the housekeeper would be here at 5pm.

231
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:37,296
I'm sure this collection wasn't all that important to him.

232
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:40,896
But, the novelist said that Mr. Haramoto was saying that

233
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:43,896
his collection was completed so that he was happy.

234
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,796
The point is what collections he's talking about.

235
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,196
Yes, we can't tell by his words

236
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:54,096
whether it was the mini cars, the dolls or the books.

237
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,096
Finally completed.

238
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,396
Turned upside down in haste.

239
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,096
Did you catch cold, Conan?

240
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:07,896
No, it's cat hair! There are so many all over here.

241
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:09,096
Cat?

242
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:12,896
Come to think of it, Mr. Manda let his cat roam here for a while

243
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,496
even during investigation.

244
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:17,196
That's why there's so much cat hair here.

245
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,996
Mr. Manda's not very nice, is he?

246
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:21,396
Oh? What do you mean?

247
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,796
Because he heard the sound of something cracking,

248
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:27,896
so he came outside to look and saw us go into the house.

249
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,096
That's why he came after us, right?

250
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,796
If I were him, I wouldn't bring the cat here,

251
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,296
and even if I did bring the cat, I would carry it all the while.

252
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:39,896
The kitty may after all, hurt itself with the thing that cracked.

253
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:44,196
Yeah, it kind of seems like he let the cat go on purpose.

254
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,496
He let the cat go on purpose?

255
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:50,996
Detective Yako Hyakki grinning her tightly pursed lips

256
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,496
and started to reveal the case.

257
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:03,396
She of course had the police detective speak in her place.

258
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,096
So, this is it.

259
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:13,996
So, you're finally here. What took you so long?

260
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:18,296
I'm sorry, my hands were somewhat tied.

261
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:21,396
Getting right down to business, please tell me, will you?

262
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,896
About the detective story you thought up, Sensei.

263
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,796
You've already started writing it, haven't you?

264
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:29,096
Yeah, the fact is, it's written up to almost the last part

265
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,496
but I'm stuck on how the ending should be

266
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,396
since the detective herself is the victim of the murder.

267
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,596
What?

268
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:37,796
Yeah,

269
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,596
the woman lawyer who is killed at the beginning of the story

270
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,096
appears as a ghost and possesses her best friend who is a detective

271
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:47,396
and discloses the truth of the case.

272
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:50,596
Oh, that sounds interesting.

273
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,896
The name of the character playing the woman lawyer-detective

274
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,496
is Yako Hyakki.

275
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,296
Great name, isn't it?

276
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:00,596
Who could it be at this time of night?

277
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,896
Inspector.

278
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,496
I'm sorry, but could you wait until our discussion is over

279
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:06,996
if you need to talk to me?

280
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,396
No, we'll need you to talk to us,

281
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:12,596
because we've finally figured it out.

282
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,096
You've figured it out?

283
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,696
You mean who the murderer is?

284
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:16,796
Yes.

285
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:20,896
The one who killed Mr. Haramoto is you, Mr. Manda!

286
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,496
Huh?

287
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,596
It sure was a surprise,

288
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:28,096
that the novelist Mr. Manda was the killer.

289
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,796
But, wasn't Mr. Manda

290
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,696
confined to the room in that hotel from last night,

291
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,696
and during the time the murder was committed at about 3pm,

292
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:36,396
wasn't he in the room?

293
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:38,196
The editor, Mr. Shimaki

294
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:41,196
couldn't have been watching in front of the door all the while,

295
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:43,296
so Mr. Manda probably snuck out of the room

296
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:45,696
disguised as a bellboy or something.

297
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:49,196
Then, with a bicycle or something that he had prepared beforehand,

298
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,896
and rushed over to Mr. Haramoto's house.

299
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:55,196
Then, he snuck up from behind and hit him with the flower vase.

300
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:57,396
His alibi was supposed to be established

301
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,896
after rushing back to the hotel,

302
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,896
but a problem came up.

303
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,596
Yes, the cat that you brought along

304
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:09,496
disappeared in the room next to the murder site.

305
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:13,196
You panicked and looked for him but he wouldn't come out,

306
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:16,396
and that's when you remembered that

307
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:20,396
Mr. Haramoto had told you that his collection was finally completed

308
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,896
and that he was happy.

309
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:25,696
You live right opposite Mr. Haramoto.

310
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,496
If you leave the backdoor open,

311
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:31,796
the cat would come back on its own if it gets hungry.

312
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:34,996
But if before that the cat walks around

313
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:39,496
and cat hair is found on the collection that was just completed today,

314
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:43,796
it would serve as proof that you had come to the room today.

315
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,096
After all, the cat as well as yourself

316
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:49,096
were supposed to be confined in the hotel room from last night.

317
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:51,796
That's when you came upon the idea of

318
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,996
turning all of Mr. Haramoto's collection upside

319
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,096
and making the housekeeper, Ms. Ichimura who will come in two hours

320
00:16:57,096 --> 00:17:00,896
straighten everything out, so that the cat hair will fall to the floor.

321
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,896
But, will just turning everything upside down

322
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,296
make cat hair come off that easily?

323
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,296
It doesn't really matter,

324
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:11,196
so long as Ms. Ichimura testifies that she turned them back up.

325
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,296
Because the cat hair that's on the floor

326
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:14,996
could've got on to the collection

327
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:16,896
while she was returning the collection right side up.

328
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:19,996
But, I wonder why he did something so bothersome

329
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,196
as to turn everything upside down.

330
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:25,696
If it were me, I would just drop everything to the floor.

331
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,596
That wouldn't look like mischief, would it?

332
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:30,296
If she thinks that a thief entered the house

333
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:33,696
and called the police, that would be it, right?

334
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:39,196
But, we found it before the housekeeper came.

335
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:42,996
Right, so I'm sure Mr. Manda was really flustered.

336
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,696
That's why he had to think even deeper.

337
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:49,096
When he saw us go into the house,

338
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,396
Mr. Manda on the spur of the moment carried his cat

339
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:51,796
and ran over right away.

340
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,296
Then, he let the cat go in that room.

341
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:55,796
So that nobody would be able to tell

342
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:57,396
when the cat hair scattered all over the place.

343
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:02,196
I see! That's why he got angry when I tried to touch the cat.

344
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:05,796
If the police came while I was carrying the cat,

345
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,596
his whole plan would've gone to waste.

346
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:12,796
But, he succeeded in getting rid of the evidence.

347
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:16,396
With no proof, he could say it's just your imagination.

348
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,596
Yeah, but I left bait behind.

349
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:23,396
That's terrific deduction, Inspector.

350
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:27,696
I'd recommend that you write a mystery novel.

351
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:33,696
But, where's the proof? You can't arrest me without it.

352
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,196
Of course, I'm not the killer though.

353
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:40,696
I'll make use of this in my next detective story...

354
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:45,596
There were detective stories in Mr. Haramoto's computer too.

355
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:48,196
The unfinished mystery story

356
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:51,996
of ghost detective Yako Hyakki, the main character!

357
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:55,196
We asked for Editor Shimaki's cooperation,

358
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:58,896
and set a microphone on his clothes.

359
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,096
What we heard through the microphone of your next story

360
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,496
also had to do with a ghost detective by the name of Yako Hyakki.

361
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:08,696
That's why I told you, didn't I? That he took care of all my works.

362
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,796
Oh, that's right.

363
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:13,596
Were you the one who wrote all of it?

364
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:15,596
Well, of course.

365
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,296
To be honest,

366
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:20,496
the children who were playing around with the computer found it.

367
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:23,096
The children and my men were reading it till a while ago,

368
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,996
hoping it would give us some clue.

369
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:27,996
I'm ashamed to say, there is something I cannot understand that

370
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:30,096
I would like you to tell me about.

371
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:33,496
Who is the killer and what kind of trick was used?

372
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,896
That's...

373
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:41,696
I don't mind if you'd show me the disc case with that story in it.

374
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:45,096
The disc case that you stole from Mr. Haramoto's desk,

375
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,396
the one with what looks to be his blood on the case.

376
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,296
You should've been reading it till just a while ago!

377
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:55,296
After you came back from the hotel till the time you found Mr. Haramoto,

378
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,396
and when you got home just a while ago,

379
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,296
you were with the editor right through

380
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,796
and wouldn't have had time to read it at all!

381
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:05,996
Despite this, you explained the story to Mr. Shimaki just a while ago!

382
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,096
Don't tell that the boy...

383
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,496
I can't wait to read it.

384
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:13,396
I wonder if it's in Mr. Haramoto's computer.

385
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,796
He set it up so that the novel would be read

386
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:18,996
before I got to hide the disc that is evidence.

387
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:23,096
That disc and case are in your room, aren't they?

388
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:27,796
Sensei!

389
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,596
I'm no longer a Sensei.

390
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:36,196
I'm just a plain aged man, who lost his wife

391
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,696
and have no energy left to do anything.

392
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:44,296
All my stories for the last 2 to 3 years were written by Mr. Haramoto.

393
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:49,196
Of course, I did a lot of fixing at the start.

394
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,696
But, he gradually started disliking me fixing his story,

395
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:55,396
and lately I haven't been able to say a thing about his works.

396
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:57,096
Then, finally...

397
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:58,496
Please leave everything up to me,

398
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:01,796
while you sit in the audience already,

399
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:05,196
since you've already passed over your baton.

400
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,996
I just couldn't forgive those words of his,

401
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:12,696
because they were so sad and so vexing.

402
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:16,296
Then, why did you steal his detective story?

403
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:18,296
I suddenly came up with the idea

404
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:22,396
that I could probably write better than he can.

405
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:24,796
But, I lost.

406
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,196
No matter how hard I think,

407
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:29,796
I could never figure out who the killer or what the trick is.

408
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:34,796
I guess I was never cut out to write mysteries.

409
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:05,796
Oh, the conversation with the housekeeper.

410
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:08,396
Yeah, when she tried to talk about the detective

411
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:10,696
that Mr. Haramoto thought up,

412
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,496
Mr. Manda interrupted her.

413
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:16,096
That's when I hit upon the idea that maybe he stole Mr. Haramoto's story.

414
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:18,096
But, there's still a mystery left.

415
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,396
Huh? The killer in that novel is...

416
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:21,796
No, not that.

417
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:24,996
About the collection that Mr. Haramoto said he finally completed.

418
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,496
Oh, that?

419
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,296
He was probably talking about his teeth.

420
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,796
What?

421
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,496
Ms. Ichimura the housekeeper said that

422
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:35,896
Mr. Haramoto had told her to make a dentist appointment for him today.

423
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:38,796
Remember the mirror that was in the desk?

424
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,596
I think that Mr. Haramoto was looking at his teeth

425
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,696
that were finally nicely in place at the time he was struck.

426
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:46,196
Besides, one of the pieces of the flower vase

427
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,596
that was found in the drawer

428
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,296
was a crown.

429
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,796
What?

430
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:55,996
Why didn't you tell something important like that to Inspector Megure?

431
00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:58,796
Because I already figured out who the killer was

432
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,796
and besides, this had nothing to do with the case.

433
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:05,096
That's why it doesn't matter.

434
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:14,896
Warning of murder?

435
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:21,096
The novelist was killed by a character that appears in her novel?

436
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,096
To complicate investigations?

437
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:26,196
I wonder if anyone would do something like this just for that purpose.

438
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:32,596
Next Conan,

439
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,596
"My Favorite Mystery"

440
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:54,296
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:56,496
"Marinated ginger slices from a sushi shop"

442
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:57,796
What kind of fish is a "gari"?

443
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,596
Oh come on, that's what marinated ginger slices are called.

444
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,596
Really, a moronic gink.
