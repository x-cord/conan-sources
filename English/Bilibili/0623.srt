1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,240
We're in big trouble!

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,440
The Youth Detective Squad's in a pinch!

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,240
It all started when we started playing Kick the Can!

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,140
We were in a building that was scheduled to be brought down,

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,240
and nobody was inside,

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,740
so I thought it was okay to play there,

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,440
but I heard a banging sound from inside!

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
The rhythm that was being pounded was "252",

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,940
the code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,740
uses to indicate that there is someone needing to be rescued.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,940
We looked around thinking that somebody needed help.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,540
But the people who were making the noise

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,540
were workers who were going to bring down the building.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,840
So, we were kind of thrown off, but...

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,640
Conan realized

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,440
that they were actually bad people

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,940
and that they had locked someone up!

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,540
We were going to contact the police,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,640
but the men found us and...

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,540
They caught Conan!

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,740
The doorway of the building is blocked and we can't escape,

22
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,740
so we've got no choice but to find a way to contact the police but...

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,740
If we do so, those guy will find out right away.

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,740
So, we agreed to use Ai's idea to deceive those men!

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,840
Although the strategy seemed to work at first,

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,340
next, Ai was caught.

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,040
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,440
You must be true to yourself.

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,940
Decipher the code and overcome

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,140
the pinch you're in, Detective Squad.

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:16,415
"Emergency 252 Part 2"

35
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:18,915
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

36
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,415
-Call the police, the police! -Hurry, hurry!

37
00:03:21,415 --> 00:03:23,615
It's calling now...

38
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:25,615
Hey brats!

39
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,115
Can you hear me?

40
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,515
If you dare call the police,

41
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:34,515
the brown-haired girl and boy with glasses are going to die! You get that?

42
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,715
What?

43
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,215
Yes! 911...

44
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:41,015
"Calling" -Is something wrong? Is it an accident?

45
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,715
Hello?

46
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,615
What's the matter?

47
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,715
Hello?

48
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,015
Hey!

49
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:56,415
Aren't you going to report this to the police?

50
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,115
I've got no choice.

51
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,815
We'll get Conan and Ai in trouble!

52
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,915
But now what? What do we do?

53
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:06,915
What shall we do?

54
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,015
At any rate, let's hide somewhere!

55
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,215
Okay.

56
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,715
There aren't any sounds of sirens...

57
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:26,215
Which means the brats are obeying my orders.

58
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:30,115
So, what do we do with these two kids?

59
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:33,915
Take them to the fourth floor where the gramps is locked up!

60
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,915
I'll go look for the rest of the brats.

61
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:40,915
By the way, are you sure that gramps has money or what?

62
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,915
Yeah, I hear he's making millions.

63
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:48,015
But, no one answers each time we call his house!

64
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:50,215
She'll be back soon.

65
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:51,615
His only daughter about intermediate school age,

66
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:54,315
who answers the phone sometimes!

67
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,815
We'll threaten that daughter and make her bring the ransom here.

68
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,515
Then we'll lock her into this building too,

69
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,815
and set fire to the place before we split.

70
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:02,915
Right.

71
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:06,215
But, talk about a bunch of unlucky kids.

72
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,215
If they didn't come play here,

73
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,215
they didn't have to become burnt black and down to ashes.

74
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,215
Okay, I'll go look for the other kids,

75
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:16,815
so you watch those two.

76
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,015
You can never tell what they'll do.

77
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:20,715
Yes siree.

78
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:31,015
Darn!

79
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,015
Why aren't they anywhere in sight?

80
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:37,115
Hey, it's already after 6 pm, you know!

81
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,515
We'd better hurry or the parents of these brats

82
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,815
may start getting worried and make a fuss.

83
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:44,415
How's the old man doing?

84
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:48,215
The old man that we kidnapped and locked up inside that locker!

85
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:51,715
Oh, when I looked in a while ago, he was still asleep.

86
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,315
And? Did you call the old man's house?

87
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,515
Yeah, I've been calling for some time now,

88
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:59,915
but no one's answering!

89
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:04,415
I wonder where those brats disappeared to, anyway.

90
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,615
Did you look good enough?

91
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:11,415
Yeah, I'm not sloppy like you but rather meticulous, you see.

92
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,715
I looked through every nook and cranny!

93
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:17,315
And they still can't find them,

94
00:06:17,315 --> 00:06:19,615
which means they're unmistakably hiding

95
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:23,115
in one of the lockers of this room.

96
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:33,415
They got here before we were brought here,

97
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,915
and ended up not being able to come out.

98
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,215
We've got no choice,

99
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,815
let's look once more and if we still can't find them,

100
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,715
let's set fire to this place and split.

101
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:45,115
Yeah, I guess we'll just have to give up on the money.

102
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,815
Make sure you pour the gasoline thoroughly!

103
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,015
Aye! You can count on me!

104
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:50,715
What shall we do?

105
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,515
We'll all be burnt black.

106
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,215
Maybe we've got no choice but to beat them up after all.

107
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,615
Right.

108
00:06:56,615 --> 00:07:01,115
Maybe it's our chance right now, since that man's alone.

109
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:03,515
That sound just now is from the detective squad badge...

110
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,115
Huh?

111
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:10,415
-Just as I thought. -Maybe this is...

112
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,815
It's Conan after all.

113
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:16,115
Conan's tapping on the floor using the detective squad badge!

114
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,415
The sound we just heard was,

115
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:24,515
first, twice, next five times and finally four times, right?

116
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,715
Isn't this the "what's it called" code

117
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,015
that you mentioned before, Mitsuhiko?

118
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,815
The code that the Tokyo Metropolitan Fire Department uses!

119
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,415
"254" means...

120
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:36,015
to wait at the site.

121
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,515
Oh, that's right.

122
00:07:40,515 --> 00:07:44,715
Don't you guys dare move from there until I tell you to!

123
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:55,715
But, things do look pretty bad.

124
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:58,915
Those guys kidnapped an old man from somewhere and locked him up.

125
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:02,615
They're also demanding ransom.

126
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,215
We, who just happened to come play here,

127
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,915
coincidentally run into them.

128
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,615
Ai and I are caught and rendered helpless.

129
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:14,715
One of the men is pouring gasoline in the room

130
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:16,915
so that he can burn all of us together with the hostage,

131
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:19,815
and the other one is off looking for Genta and the others.

132
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:24,815
The kids are probably in one of the lockers of this room

133
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,415
and cannot come out.

134
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,915
In order to get out of this predicament,

135
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,715
the only thing to do is to get the one standing guard

136
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:35,015
away from this fourth floor room but...

137
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,215
Stink...

138
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:39,615
I guess I'll really pour all of it out

139
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,115
just before igniting the place.

140
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:46,715
With my mouth gagged and both my hands and legs tied,

141
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,415
the only thing I can do isto give orders to Genta and the others

142
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:52,315
by banging the detective squad badge against the floor.

143
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,115
How do I get him to go outside with this?

144
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:59,715
I guess I'll try calling the home of the old man we kidnapped again then.

145
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,415
Telephone...

146
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,215
Come to think of it...

147
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:08,215
Huh? Conan, your cell phone standby display

148
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,515
is the man at the detective agency!

149
00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:13,415
Yeah, when Pops came back drunk the other day,

150
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:16,615
he fooled around with this and the standby display's been this way since.

151
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:20,215
Mine is of me doing sparklers!

152
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:23,315
I've got it in my school bag, so I'll show it to you later!

153
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:25,715
Mine is Kamen Yaiba!

154
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,415
How about you, Ai?

155
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,115
Doc's sleeping face.

156
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,715
Mine is of a stray cat living in the neighbourhood

157
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:36,815
but I seem to have dropped it while playing kick the can.

158
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:39,615
Wait a second.

159
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:44,715
My cell phone is in the second floor corridor where I passed out.

160
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:48,915
Ayumi's is probably in her school bag on the first floor.

161
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:53,415
Genta's is probably somewhere on the third floor where he was hiding.

162
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:57,215
Before Ai was captured by them, they body checked her,

163
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,115
but she had no cell phone on her,

164
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,515
so it must be in her school bag lying there

165
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:05,615
that was kicked by one of the kidnappers.

166
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,315
And Mitsuhiko's is...

167
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,815
The cell phones are nicely scattered in place!

168
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:24,115
I tell you, when the heck is the daughter f that old man

169
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,615
going to come home anyway?

170
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:27,815
Hello.

171
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,715
What?

172
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,215
A young man answered the phone?

173
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:36,515
Yeah.

174
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:39,615
Are you sure you called the old man's house, or what?

175
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:43,215
I'm sure I dialed the right number!

176
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:46,615
I hung up and re-dialed the number right away after confirming it

177
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,115
but the same man answered again!

178
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,115
And? Did you talk to that man about anything?

179
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:57,015
Of course not. I thought he was a cop and hung up right away!

180
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:58,715
Idiot!

181
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:00,415
It couldn't have been a cop

182
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:04,415
because no one knows that the old man's been kidnapped or what yet.

183
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:07,415
But the story's different!

184
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:10,515
At first the story was that the old man is living with his daughter

185
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:12,115
who is about intermediate school age that sometimes picks up the phone.

186
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:14,015
Our plan was to threaten her

187
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,415
and make her bring over the ransom, correct?

188
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,715
Something's not right.

189
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:19,815
I guess so.

190
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,515
Since things are starting to look sober,

191
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,915
I guess we've got no choice.

192
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,315
Let's set fire to this place and split!

193
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:29,715
Let's burn to ashes the hostage as well as the kids!

194
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,915
Set fire to this place and split?

195
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,715
I mean all the kids have seen our faces!

196
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,915
Rats, I've got to do something right away.

197
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:41,015
What about the kids that we haven't found yet?

198
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:42,315
How should I know?

199
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,415
A sound is coming from the detective squad badge again.

200
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,015
The sound is "555".

201
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:54,415
"555" is the code for report by phone.

202
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,415
Maybe he wants us to contact the police?

203
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:02,215
No, that would be "554" dispatch the police.

204
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:04,915
Then, where are we supposed to call?

205
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:13,815
That sound again.

206
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,415
The figure from the sound is "953"!

207
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:21,815
"953" is a code that means the cause of the fire is, playing with fire.

208
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,715
Isn't he trying to say,

209
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:26,215
"Tell the police that they're planning to set this place on fire"?

210
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:29,015
But, the code for arson is "951".

211
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,615
Then, maybe it means to call the person who is playing with fire?

212
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:35,515
Person who's playing with fire?

213
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:38,615
I get it! Ayumi's cell phone!

214
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:42,215
It probably means to call Ayumi's phone

215
00:12:42,215 --> 00:12:45,315
that has a standby image of her playing with sparklers!

216
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,915
What're you all worked up about?

217
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:52,015
Set the place on fire and hurry on down here!

218
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:55,015
Who knows where the other brats are,

219
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:57,015
but by the time people realize that the building's on fire,

220
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:00,715
they'll be covered with smoke and crossed over!

221
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:01,915
Hold it!

222
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,715
It's the ringtone of the cell phone.

223
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,915
The brats are on the first floor!

224
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,015
Hey, where the heck are you?

225
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,515
Give yourselves up and come out here!

226
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:14,015
Okay, next...

227
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,615
"655"...

228
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:27,515
"655" is totally wasted!

229
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,715
Meaning a person who is totally wasted.

230
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,415
Then...

231
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,315
It's Conan's cell phone!

232
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,515
Because his standby image was one taken together

233
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,715
with the drunk man at the detective agency!

234
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,715
Hey, how about it?

235
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,515
Did you find the brats?

236
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,415
Well, the ringtone suddenly stopped

237
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:48,915
and it seems that the cell phone was switched off.

238
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:52,215
No, it's upstairs!

239
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:54,915
A ring tone from another cell phone is ringing upstairs.

240
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,215
I'll go look for them, then.

241
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,015
No! I'll go!

242
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,715
You stay there and watch the kids!

243
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,415
Don't tell me that they all split up and hid in different places.

244
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:15,615
"Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya Calling"

245
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,715
"One missed call"

246
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:21,915
Okay, before he finishes climbing the stairs, here goes the next one.

247
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,115
Address unknown?

248
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:36,215
Yeah. "658" is a code that

249
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:38,415
indicates someone with an unknown address!

250
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:39,715
What's that mean?

251
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,815
It means someone who doesn't have a stable home he lives in

252
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,615
and goes here and there.

253
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,615
Don't tell me

254
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:48,415
that means the stray cat on the standby display of my cell phone?

255
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,915
Another ringtone?

256
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,915
Hey! It's another ringtone from the top floor.

257
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:03,415
If it's that sound, I can hear it slightly

258
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,015
from the place on the fourth floor where I am now too!

259
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,815
Maybe the brats are climbing up to the top floor?

260
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,615
Okay, this is it.

261
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:18,915
"652: Bed-ridden aged person"

262
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:21,615
"652" means bed-ridden aged person.

263
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,115
I'm sure that's...

264
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,815
The standby image of Ai's cell phone.

265
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,515
-Doc's sleeping face! -Doc's sleeping face!

266
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:36,215
I think I heard the voices of the kids just now.

267
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,115
Hey.

268
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:44,015
Don't tell me that they're in one of these lockers.

269
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:06,262
Hey!

270
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,562
It's the vibe sound of the cell phone!

271
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,862
And, I hear it really near too!

272
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:14,762
Hey, what's up?

273
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,262
It's stopped.

274
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:19,962
It seems that the brats are looking for each other

275
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,362
by communicating on their cell phones.

276
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:25,062
Okay, block the door of that room with something,

277
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,462
and you search for them too!

278
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:29,162
-Okay! -I'll ambush them at the stairs,

279
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,162
so you threaten them with your voice and corner them,

280
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:32,962
then, we'll sandwich them!

281
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:44,462
Well, I guess this'll do.

282
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,262
Hey brats, get out here!

283
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:49,662
I know you're some place nearby!

284
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,162
Strange.

285
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,862
I don't hear anything anymore.

286
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:57,362
Same here.

287
00:17:07,662 --> 00:17:09,062
It's the brat's cell phone!

288
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,662
It was dropped in the corridor!

289
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,562
What does that mean?

290
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:15,262
The brat was ringing the cell phones of his friends

291
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,562
one after the other to confuse us.

292
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:20,762
Then, where the heck are the brats?

293
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:23,262
I see! I got it!

294
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:25,362
It's the room that he's locked up in!

295
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:29,562
This was a strategy to pull you away from that room!

296
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,962
So, the brats are in that room?

297
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:35,362
Yeah! We've haven't looked through the lockers in that room at all!

298
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,662
Darn! Then the voices of the brats that I heard a while ago was...

299
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:39,662
Punks!

300
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:42,762
Never mind and just go get all the brats and nab them!

301
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:48,062
Darn! Those brats, how dare they get wise with me!

302
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:49,662
Gotcha!

303
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,062
Hey?

304
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,562
Hey, what's the matter?

305
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:58,162
Did you find the brats?

306
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,362
Answer me!

307
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:02,062
No, the brats all got away.

308
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,262
Maybe they've already reported us to the police.

309
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,562
I'm getting out of here because I don't want more trouble!

310
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:08,462
I think you should split as soon as you can too!

311
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,662
Hey!

312
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:11,162
Hold it!

313
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,862
But, why did he let one get away?

314
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,762
Because if it's just one, if we join hands, we could...

315
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:23,062
Don't worry!

316
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:27,562
As to the other guy, he'll spit it all out at the police.

317
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,362
There're no more weapons left,

318
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:32,162
so there's no need to take anymore risky chances!

319
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:46,062
No. Footsteps... do you hear them?

320
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,862
It's getting closer.

321
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,562
He didn't run away.

322
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:03,562
You guys stay back!

323
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,262
This thing I sense...

324
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:12,362
Don't tell me that it's...

325
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,062
Subaru.

326
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,562
What brings you here?

327
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:32,262
Well, the lights didn't go on even after sundown

328
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:34,262
so I got worried and went to check things out.

329
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,462
Then, I found the front door unlocked,

330
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:39,062
and neither Doc nor that girl was there.

331
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:41,262
I was wondering what I should do,

332
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,462
when two calls came in with no one talking.

333
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:46,862
So, I thought that maybe both of them got messed up in a case

334
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,762
or something and were in trouble.

335
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:52,262
I went into Doc's room and used the spare pursuit glasses

336
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:54,262
I found there and tried to pinpoint the location

337
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,462
of the detective squad badge.

338
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,962
That's how managed to get here!

339
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,962
Then, don't tell me that the old man that was kidnapped is...

340
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,062
Yes.

341
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:04,362
It's somebody that all of you know very well.

342
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:10,662
Dr. Agasa!

343
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:14,062
-Doc! -Doc!

344
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,762
I think that if the front door wasn't locked,

345
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,762
the culprit probably disguised himself

346
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:21,062
as a courier or something and got in,

347
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:24,262
Then kidnapped Doc and locked him up here.

348
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,562
They probably mistakenly thought that

349
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,562
since Doc invents many things,

350
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:31,762
he must be making millions from them.

351
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,462
I guess so.

352
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:38,962
Doc's inventions are all junk and he's actually dirt poor.

353
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:42,362
Then, the intermediate school girl that sometimes answers the phone is...

354
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:44,462
Were they talking about Ai?

355
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:48,262
Ai has a very grown up voice as well as a style of talking too.

356
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:49,962
By the way, Subaru,

357
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:53,162
did you run into the other culprit?

358
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,762
I found him passed out on the stairs.

359
00:20:55,762 --> 00:21:00,062
I'm sure he tripped in his haste to run down the stairs when fleeing.

360
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:02,762
But Subaru's like superman!

361
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,062
Sensing the slightest abnormality and coming to the rescue.

362
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,362
I guess so.

363
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:13,162
To come and check the house out only because the lights weren't turned on.

364
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,162
It's like you've been watching the house right through.

365
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,162
Yes,

366
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,762
the fact is, I was watching the house right through for you to come home!

367
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,362
I made too much curry for lunch,

368
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,062
so was thinking of sharing it with you.

369
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:41,162
Curry.

370
00:21:41,162 --> 00:21:45,362
So, tomorrow we're all having curry for lunch at Doc's house!

371
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,262
Curry is said to be the most delicious on the second day too.

372
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,962
"The Next Day"

373
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:22,662
You mean you kicked the wall not knowing what "252" meant?

374
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:25,462
Yeah, I heard the voices of you all,

375
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:28,562
so I kicked the wall hoping for the faintest chance that you would hear me!

376
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:32,062
With a strong desire that you would call the police right away!

377
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:42,462
Call the police right away...

378
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,462
It's coincidentally "252".

379
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:49,262
I'm glad that my feelings got through somehow and am glad!

380
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,062
Goes to show you can transmit your thoughts if you try!

381
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:56,862
You mean I sound that old?

382
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,162
"Next Episode" -You're looking for the answer

383
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:04,262
to a love letter that you received 13 yeas ago?

384
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:06,262
See, it's her!

385
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:08,162
-Cute! -Cute!

386
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:12,462
That specially produced drama of the memory of her and I

387
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:15,362
is carved deep within my mind.

388
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:16,862
Video?

389
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,762
Maybe you made a video letter

390
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:22,462
and kept it in one of the videos here?

391
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:28,425
Next Conan, "Video Letter of Conan's First Love"

392
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,931
Next Conans Hint:

393
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:33,731
"Sweaty Person"

394
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,331
The next episode is about Officer Chiba's first love.

395
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,310
First love is so ordinary.
