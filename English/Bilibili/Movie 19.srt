00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,820
(New York)

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,600
Coming up next...

3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,250
is the centerpiece of today's auction!

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,750
A masterpiece of international fame

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,250
and humanity's greatest treasure.

6
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,220
It was once thought to be lost but here it is.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,100
Vincent van Gogh's

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,570
Sunflowers!

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,800
What is...

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,100
that Sunflowers?

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,100
Didn't that Sunflowers perish in a fire during the war?

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,520
Everyone, please remain calm.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,150
Please allow us to explain the lot in detail.

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,850
When van Gogh was in Arles,

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,820
he was said to have drawn seven pieces of Sunflowers.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,470
The second piece of the Sunflowers is part

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,100
of the exhibit this time around.

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,450
In 1945,

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,770
the painting was destroyed in a fire during
an air raid on Ashiya in Japan, or so it was believed.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,200
However, a painting of the same artwork was

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,100
discovered last year in Arles.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,200
This piece was appraised by our experts

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,900
who have verified its authenticity

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,650
as the work of van Gogh himself.

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,070
Yes, it is now your turn

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,270
to give this Sunflowers a new life!

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,320
And so...

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
This rare masterpiece by Vincent van Gogh,

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,650
the second Sunflowers,

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,270
shall be auctioned off at the starting price
of 10 million dollars!

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,970
Wow! The bidding starts at 10 million dollars?

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,470
And the price keeps increasing by 100,000 dollars with each bid.

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,970
If I have that much money,

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,220
I would've taken a holiday in space!

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,800
We have a bid of 20 million dollars over the phone.

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,850
And 20.5 million dollars online.

37
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,300
50 million dollars!

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,270
That person is...

39
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,220
I knew it.

40
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,220
I guess that closes the bidding.

41
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,800
100 million dollars!

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,850
Didn't you hear me?

43
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,920
100 million dollars!

44
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,470
I said 100 million dollars!

45
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,220
110 million dollars.

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm looking for 110 million dollars.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,470
Anyone?

48
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,170
Damn it!

49
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,270
- Who is that mustachioed old man?
- Yes, 110 million dollars.

50
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,670
- What should we do now?
- 120 million dollars.

51
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,520
- It's fine.
- 130 million dollars.

52
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,200
The bidding war starts when it gets to 200 million.

53
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,120
Of course.

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,450
200 million dollars!

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Suzuki is here!

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,900
Yes, 200 million dollars!

57
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,820
Um...

58
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,520
If I didn't hear it wrongly,

59
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,720
bidder #705 raised it to 200 million dollars.

60
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,650
Oh!

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,300
He's the famous...

62
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,320
Mr. Suzuki!

63
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,700
Has the online bidding caught up?

64
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,800
Hey, Uncle!

65
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,320
Everyone is going to pull out!

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,920
I don't have a habit of

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,620
spending too much time shopping.

68
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,650
S-Shopping, you say?

69
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,570
There's no need to wait for online bidders!

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,050
300 million dollars!

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,320
I said 300 million dollars!

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Hammer price!

73
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,570
Hammer price!

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
Sold at 300 million dollars!

75
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,320
Conan-kun, it's starting!

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,920
(van Gogh's Painting, Returns to Japan!!)

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,170
Come on! Hurry up!

78
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,800
What have you created this time?

79
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,750
Could this be a robot?

80
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,600
Make it move, Professor!

81
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,620
It'll bring you your most important treasure.

82
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,420
(Suzuki Group  Jirokichi Suzuki)
Why hasn't this piece seen the light of day until recently?

83
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,050
That's because this painting was

84
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,570
believed to have been destroyed during World War II.

85
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,970
Destroyed?

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,750
Then is this piece a fake?

87
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,500
No.

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,750
It's just been referred as fake all along.

89
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,550
(Van Gogh's Sunflowers Believed to be Destroyed in Japan)
Please take a look.

90
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,100
(Is It Fake? Is It Real?)
This is news from last year.

91
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,520
In the city of Arles, France,

92
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,420
a painting believed to be van Gogh's

93
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,900
was re-discovered.

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,150
Now that you mention it,

95
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,820
the painting made headlines

96
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,550
when it was found under the roof of an old house.

97
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,120
It did.

98
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,450
And that was the second Sunflowers in this auction.

99
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,820
Come on, I'm starting.

100
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,150
Yay!

101
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,300
He brought it!

102
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,500
I brought the biggest one we have.

103
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,400
Push this button here.

104
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,320
Will it give me broiled eel and rice?

105
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,370
That's just impossible!

106
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,000
What are the possibilities of it being a forgery?

107
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,300
Indeed. The experts had been very meticulous about it.

108
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,120
After it was handed to the auction house,

109
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,950
it was put under a complete and thorough scrutiny.

110
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,770
As a result,

111
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,670
it was confirmed that the canvas was of the same type used by

112
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,570
van Gogh in his other paintings while he was in Arles.

113
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,300
Something better than broiled eel and rice...

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,700
(Complete)
...like, an extra serving of it?

115
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,350
How is that possible?

116
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,150
Oh, it's out!

117
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,520
Huh?

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,550
It's still a watermelon.

119
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,050
Come on, it failed again.

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,650
The fun starts now.

121
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,800
Kamen Yaiba!

122
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,770
Wow!

123
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,270
It's Kamen Yaiba!

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,900
Cool!

125
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,220
How did you do this?

126
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,100
What is the Professor doing?

127
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,950
There are other things he can make.

128
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,350
Does this make the Sunflowers at Ashiya, a forgery?

129
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,970
Yes, that is indeed a possibility.

130
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,200
Furthermore, a new theory has emerged

131
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,820
that van Gogh had painted eight Sunflowers

132
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,270
instead of just seven.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,620
The Sunflowers that was sold at the auction

134
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,870
and the Sunflowers in Ashiya

135
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
are both said to be

136
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,850
replicas painted by van Gogh himself.

137
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,420
Do artists really replicate

138
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,670
their own artwork?

139
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,520
They do.

140
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,850
Out of the seven pieces of Sunflowers

141
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,220
three of them are replicas.

142
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,500
All of them

143
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,220
are painted by van Gogh himself.

144
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,220
Van Gogh is interesting

145
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
but can you show some interest in Professor's work too?

146
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,720
It's quite the work of art.

147
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,870
That's a rare compliment.

148
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,120
Yay!

149
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,920
Looks like the press conference is about to begin.

150
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,170
Let's take a look at the broadcast

151
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,320
live in New York.

152
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,400
Well...

153
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,050
Let's have a comment from

154
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,150
Jirokichi Suzuki-san

155
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,270
on his successful bid for the Sunflowers.

156
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,220
Of course.

157
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,620
I am truly happy

158
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,820
to have won the bid at the highest price in history, as planned.

159
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,420
What? Are you saying that

160
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,600
purchasing the painting at 300 million dollars was planned?

161
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,870
Exactly.

162
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,050
All of this is

163
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,970
to hold a Sunflowers art exhibition in Japan.

164
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,500
Art exhibition?

165
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,500
The Suzuki Group seeks to

166
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,000
gather all artworks of the Sunflowers scattered

167
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
across the world

168
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,950
at Lake Rock Art Museum

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,270
to hold an art exhibition titled

170
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,350
"Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition".

171
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,820
That's our announcement.

172
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,970
Ms. Suzuki!

173
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,220
How many pieces of Sunflowers are you referring to?

174
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,550
Is the purchase of the Sunflowers
in this auction a part of the plan?

175
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,370
Yes. Everything has been planned
so we can announce the art exhibition here today.

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,370
Including the piece we won the bid for today,

177
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,500
we've gathered seven pieces of Sunflowers.

178
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,400
All seven pieces?

179
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,820
Isn't that impossible even for a Japanese conglomerate?

180
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,350
Don't worry. The project is already underway.

181
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,150
We've already informed

182
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,620
all the art galleries and private owners
of Sunflowers around the world

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,420
about our intention to gather all Sunflowers
and hold an art exhibition.

184
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,470
By winning the bid

185
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,870
for the Sunflowers

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that was on display in this auction,

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,870
we've gained their commitment

188
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,550
and cooperation.

189
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,420
Moreover,

190
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,800
I've hired seven specialists

191
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,600
to preserve and transport the pieces,

192
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,100
and also

193
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,000
promised to keep them secured.

194
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,900
Seven specialists?

195
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,370
I've gathered them for this day,

196
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,520
the Seven Samurai.

197
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,800
Are they the Seven Samurai?

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They are.

199
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,670
They are all elites who had studied in Netherlands and France,

200
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,220
and have a passion in everything related to van Gogh.

201
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,200
From the left, a specialist in art history,

202
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,120
and in charge of appraisals,

203
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,950
Natsumi Miyadai.

204
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,000
Pleased to be here.

205
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,850
(Natsumi Miyadai  Art History and Appraisal Curator)

206
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,820
Similarly,

207
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,520
the expert in charge of art restoration and preservation,

208
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,370
(Koji Azuma  Art Restoration and Preservation Curator)
Koji Azuma.

209
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,350
Next is the person in charge of planning the art exhibition,

210
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,320
Keiko Anderson.

211
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,350
(Keiko Anderson  Exhibitions Curator)
I'm Keiko, pleased to be here.

212
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,470
The man in charge of transportation the paintings,

213
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,270
(Taizo Ishimine  Transportation Curator)
Taizo Ishimine

214
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,370
I'm Ishimine.

215
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,620
And the director for

216
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,650
the Sunflowers Exhibition,

217
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,000
Kumiko Kishi.

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,570
(Kumiko Kishi  Exhibition Director & Curator)
I will ensure the art exhibition be a success.

219
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,800
Finally, I have the New York City Police Department's

220
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,700
Inspector Charlie to cooperate with us on the security.

221
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,170
(Charlie  New York City Police Department)
I will protect the Sunflowers.

222
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,720
Well, you mentioned that there are Seven Samurai,

223
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,920
but I only see six of them here.

224
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,400
The last person is the

225
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,200
security reinforcement personnel in Japan.

226
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,700
His name is Kogoro Mouri.

227
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,620
What?

228
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,420
Of all people, the seventh person is Mister?

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,220
Isn't this about time for Kiddo Killer to appear?

230
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,850
Do your best, Kikuchiya-san.

231
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,570
Oh, wow!

232
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,870
Sonoko-neesan is on the TV!

233
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,220
You're right!

234
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,470
Let's go watch it!

235
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,150
Yeah!

236
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,100
Will you be displaying

237
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,500
the Sunflowers you've won the bid for

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,470
if all seven paintings are not gathered?

239
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,420
No.

240
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,900
I'll never do it unless all seven are gathered.

241
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,050
Then, in that case...

242
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,320
Don't worry.

243
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,270
The Sunflowers Exhibition has been my lifelong dream.

244
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,120
And there are no dreams

245
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,420
I cannot make come true!

246
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,250
T-This can't be!

247
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,670
K-Kiddo card!

248
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,850
Who's that?

249
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,300
He has a gun!

250
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,500
Get the security!

251
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,350
Drop the gun.

252
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,520
Didn't you hear me?

253
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,750
Hurry up and drop the gun!

254
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,170
No way!

255
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,700
I can't see anything!

256
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,450
Something's happening!

257
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,370
Kiddo-sama!

258
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Kiddo!

259
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Stop!

260
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,650
Stop or we'll shoot!

261
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,070
What's going on?

262
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,520
Stop!

263
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,320
Freeze or we'll shoot!

264
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,900
Kiddo is on the 103rd floor.

265
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,900
We've cornered him at the east corridor!

266
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,770
Kiddo!

267
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,650
Drop the gun.

268
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,470
Now!

269
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,400
Good.

270
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,370
Slowly put your hands up,

271
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,670
and get on your knees.

272
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,570
Didn't you hear me?

273
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,370
Put your hands where I can see them!

274
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,000
Kiddo-sama!

275
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,050
Good, that's it.

276
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,320
Slowly now.

277
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,120
Stop it, Charlie!

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,320
Damn it!

279
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,600
That Kaito Kiddo!

280
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
Looks like he got away.

281
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
The scene is in a state of confusion

282
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,120
with no reports of casualties.

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,020
The NYPD are...

284
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,550
Huh? It's over already?

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,470
Did Kiddo steal the Sunflowers?

286
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,900
That's strange.

287
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,850
I thought Kiddo only steals gems?

288
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,520
There was only a glimpse of it

289
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
but was that really Kiddo?

290
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,250
You seem to be in trouble.

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,750
Why are you here?

292
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,750
I heard that

293
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,170
Kiddo is targeting the Sunflowers.

294
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,520
I can help you out, if you like.

295
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,720
(Detective Conan
Sunflowers of Inferno)

296
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,020
While I was at the amusement park

298
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,650
with my childhood friend and classmate, Ran Mouri,

299
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,500
I happened to witness a man in black making a dubious dealing.

300
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,020
I was too focused into watching the deal

301
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,400
that I didn't realize there was
another accomplice coming up behind me.

302
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,720
I was given poison by that man

303
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,820
and when I woke up, my body has shrunk!

304
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,170
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo is alive,

305
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,920
they'll come after my life again

306
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,420
and harm the people around me.

307
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
I decided to hide my identity
with the advice from Professor Agasa,

308
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,000
but when Ran asked for my name,

309
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,250
I introduced myself as Conan Edogawa on a whim.

310
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,520
In order to gather information about them,

311
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,620
I stayed with Ran's family, whose father works as a detective.

312
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,470
By the way, there is another person other than the Professor
who knows my true identity.

313
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,270
Ai Haibara. Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

314
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,450
She used to be

315
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,750
an accomplice of those men in black.

316
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,320
When she escaped from the organization,

317
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,670
she took the same poison as I did, and her body shrunk.

318
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,570
And then there are...

319
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,600
Kaito Kiddo and his underling.

320
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,550
I haven't settled my score with them yet.

321
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
As a detective,

322
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,000
I swear I will catch them this time!

323
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,200
Even though I've become smaller, my brain remains the same.

324
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm the great detective!

325
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,820
Only one truth will prevail!

326
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,970
This airplane will soon be landing at Haneda Airport.

327
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,850
As we prepare for landing,

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,450
please store your baggage

329
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,750
(Lake Rock Art Museum)
in the upper shelf as per the takeoff procedure.

(Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition)

331
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,070
(Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition)
Or, keep them under your seat.

332
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,070
This is the dummy that we've retrieved.

333
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,970
You seem happy.

334
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,170
That's because Uncle always got tricked.

335
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,020
He's happy someone else got tricked too.

336
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,400
More importantly, is this alright?

337
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,170
You don't even allow the CA

338
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,800
into this area except in case of emergency,

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,370
but you easily let that young man in.

340
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,670
That's because he's the detective representing Japan.

341
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,850
There's no need to worry.

342
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,350
But what if he is Kiddo in disguise?

343
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,450
Their physique seems similar too.

344
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,250
You're such a worrywart.

345
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,570
Just watch closely.

346
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,300
What did I tell you?

347
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,950
What are you doing, old man?

348
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
Charlie is being suspicious.

349
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,550
Besides, why is that American dude onboard too?

350
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,670
Didn't your duty to escort the Sunflowers end at the airport?

351
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,150
You didn't have to come to Japan, did you?

352
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,200
Our contract certainly states that
I am on escort duty while in the US.

353
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,550
However,

354
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,320
now that I know Kiddo is targeting the Sunflowers,

355
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,050
there's no way I can let that slide.

356
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,700
That's why you're the samurai I've chosen.

357
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,070
You must protect the Sunflowers.

358
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,420
Of course, just leave it to me.

359
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,420
If Kiddo Killer joins us,

360
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,800
then we'll be unstoppable!

361
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,320
Natsumi-san, are you alright?

362
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,650
Yes.

363
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,050
I'm just feeling a little bit sick.

364
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,770
Then you should take a walk inside the airplane, like I did.

365
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,420
Come on.

366
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,520
It isn't good to keep sitting on such a long journey.

367
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,870
Thank you very much.

368
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,350
Where are you going?

369
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,570
To the lavatory.

370
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,170
(Haneda Airport)

371
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,220
Hey, hey!

372
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,520
They might be targeted by Kiddo,

373
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,520
so why are they on such a flashy airplane?

374
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,320
We, the police, have also told them to keep a low profile.

375
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,100
Apparently it wasn't just a form of transportation,

376
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,870
but also serves as a marketing gimmick.

377
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,400
Stopping that is your duty, Inspector Nakamori!

378
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,220
Do you seriously think that old man will listen to me?

379
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,170
Well, there's nothing we can do.

380
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,970
So he came back on this.

381
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
Is the Sunflowers onboard as well?

382
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,620
Geez!

383
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,450
Why are you always following me?

384
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,820
What can you do about it?

385
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,000
Jirokichi-san said to bring Conan-kun along.

386
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,750
Right?

387
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,570
After all, Conan-kun is Kiddo Killer!

388
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,570
Geez!

389
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,950
That's just a bunch of superstitious rubbish.

390
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,850
Don't go crawling everywhere, you hear?

391
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,570
You're just complimentary.

392
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,370
Okay.

393
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,250
Ran!

394
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,150
You'd better

395
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,370
keep your eyes on this kid!

396
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,300
I intend to do that all the time.

397
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,320
I wonder who's this.

398
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,200
Excuse me.

399
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,070
Oh, Sonoko!

400
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,250
Oh, Ran?

401
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
We're about to land soon.

402
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,350
But I thought I'd let you in on something good!

403
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
Actually, it's meant to be a surprise,

404
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,500
so I was told to keep it a secret but...

405
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,020
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,250
What? Shinichi is with you?

407
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,620
I-It's not like Shinichi being onboard will

408
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,520
make me...

409
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,220
Sonoko-neechan, is Shinichi-niichan there?

410
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,620
He was sitting right there a moment ago.

411
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,520
Sonoko, what's happening?

412
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,220
Sonoko!

413
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,950
What's going on, Ran?

414
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,820
Right after I heard her screaming, there was a really loud sound.

415
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,800
What did you say?

416
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,720
Inspector Nakamori,

417
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,300
come here!

418
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,070
Looks like something has happened onboard.

419
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,900
What?

420
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
- I don't have such a report coming in.
- It can't be Kiddo...

421
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,150
It's no use!

422
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,520
Right aileron and slat

423
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,820
are both unresponsive!

424
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,820
Forget it.

425
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,520
Shut down the fourth engine immediately.

426
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Activate the fire extinguishing system.

427
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,450
Got it.

428
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,020
A human?

429
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,620
This is control tower.

430
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,700
Flight 2501.

431
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,820
Roger that.

432
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,870
Freeing up Runway A.

433
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,900
Can you get there?

434
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,400
This is Flight 2501.

435
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,300
We'll try to.

436
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,570
Just in case, please divert all nearby airplanes!

437
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,420
Understood.

438
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,820
Notify all flights.

439
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,900
Confirm their fuel,

440
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,970
and proceed with an emergency diversion.

441
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,870
Hurry up!

442
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,720
We're running out of time!

443
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,270
Yes, sir!

444
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,270
Attention all flights.

445
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,900
Damn it.

446
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Even though it's heading towards the airport,

447
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,750
with its current altitude,

448
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,250
it'll fly past the runway.

449
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,120
Please let this work.

450
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,920
Attention to all passengers!

451
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,800
The airplane has encountered an engine trouble

452
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,070
and will rapidly descend to make

453
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,200
an emergency landing possible.

454
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,920
I repeat.

455
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,420
Please ensure you've fastened

456
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,470
your safety belts.

457
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,570
15,000 feet.

458
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,820
10,000 feet.

459
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,500
Now!

460
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,420
What?

461
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,200
Kiddo-sama!

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,600
What?

463
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,670
Did you say Kiddo?

464
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,370
Where is he?

465
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,750
Where is that Kiddo?

466
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,820
Where is he?

467
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,470
Did he say Kiddo?

468
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,750
Is he at the scene?

469
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,100
Hello? Hello?

470
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,620
Bad news, Inspector Nakamori!

471
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,870
There's indeed trouble onboard, as suspected!

472
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,250
They'll be making an emergency landing on Runway A!

473
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,520
An emergency landing?

474
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,050
Damn it!

475
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,270
I can't see anything from here!

476
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,220
Conan-kun!

477
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,850
Sonoko!

478
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,900
Answer me!

479
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Sonoko!

480
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,500
Uncle, stop!

481
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Please wait!

482
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,550
Advisor Suzuki!

483
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,120
It's dangerous to move about right now.

484
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,920
But...

485
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,420
If Kiddo is here then that means

486
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,250
the Sunflowers is...

487
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,920
We will be making an emergency landing shortly.

488
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,120
As you are aware,

489
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,700
we've lost maneuverability due to the explosion.

490
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,900
As such,

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,900
this landing will be extremely difficult.

492
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,800
Please pray for a safe landing.

493
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,650
Alright, let's do this!

494
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,120
Good, next!

495
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,700
Next!

496
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,650
Hurry up!

497
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,070
This is not a drill!

498
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,250
(Japan Civil Aviation Bureau 8)

499
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,620
Not good!

500
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,720
The aircraft won't stabilize!

501
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,750
Don't give up!

502
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,470
Try again!

503
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,120
Yes!

504
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,020
Ran! Help me!

505
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,520
Out of my way!

506
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,750
Is that it?

507
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,820
Hey, it's here!

508
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,820
It's fluttering.

509
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,250
It's no use! Its altitude is too high!

510
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,320
This is going to be terrible.

511
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,900
Damn!

512
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,020
Do as I say!

513
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,550
Engage the reverse thrust!

514
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,670
But we might lose control of it!

515
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,670
Don't think! Just focus on stopping!

516
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,150
Yes!

517
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Engaging the reverse thrust!

518
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,450
What's happening?

519
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
Attention everyone at the international terminal...

520
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,370
Not good!

521
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,770
It'll crash!

522
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,220
Stop! Stop! Stop!

523
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,400
Please! Stop!

524
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,950
That was close.

525
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,000
Shinichi! Sonoko!

526
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,770
This is control tower.

527
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,670
Flight 2501.

528
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,320
Can you hear me?

529
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,320
Flight 2501!

530
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,100
Please respond, over!

531
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
Flight 2501!

532
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
This is Flight 2501.

533
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:38,900
We're sorry.

534
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,950
We've ignored the directions

535
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,100
and changed the runway without permission.

536
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,900
That aside,

537
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,750
is everyone alright?

538
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,250
We barely missed a collision with the gate.

539
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,100
We're all safe!

540
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,500
We request for immediate evacuation
of the passengers and the crew.

541
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,620
Roger that!

542
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,050
Are you alright,

543
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,820
kid?

544
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,720
Y-Yeah.

545
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,700
Hey, hey.

546
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,650
This is really a close shave.

547
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,520
Yes.

548
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,150
One wrong step and

549
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,870
it would've been ended up horribly.

550
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,900
That's true.

551
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,300
But Kiddo would never do such a thing.

552
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,900
That's...

553
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,200
It can't be!

554
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,050
Kiddo!

555
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:21,700
Damn it!

556
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,650
I'm not letting you get away!

557
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,770
Hey, kid! Where are you going?

558
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,320
Kiddo is flying in the air with the Sunflowers!

559
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,920
What?

560
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,800
Is that true?

561
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,050
Shinichi!

562
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,050
Sonoko!

563
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,770
Sonoko!

564
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,600
Are you okay?

565
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,950
Where are you now?

566
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,220
Calm down, Ran.

567
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,670
I'm okay.

568
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,900
That's great!

569
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,000
More importantly,

570
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,400
has Kudo-kun gotten in touch with you?

571
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,050
From Shinichi?

572
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,100
Not yet, though.

573
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,220
I see.

574
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,870
Did something happen to Shinichi?

575
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,270
Isn't he with you?

576
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,250
The thing is...

577
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,370
I can't find Kudo-kun anywhere!

578
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,250
Hey, boy!

579
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,150
This place is off-limits!

580
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,670
Damn it!

581
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,670
Where did he go?

582
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,770
Hey! Wait up, boy!

583
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,270
Who's calling now?

584
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,700
The number you have dialed is currently busy.

585
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,070
- No way, Shinichi.
- Please leave your message after the beep.

586
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,320
Please, pick up.

587
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,000
Sorry, Ran!

588
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,270
I'm running after Kiddo right now!

589
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,820
I'll call you back!

590
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,620
I'm so glad...

591
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,020
Shinichi...

592
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,850
Where is he?

593
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,170
Where is he?

594
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,350
I'm not letting you get away!

595
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,870
Go!

596
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,220
Damn it!

597
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,300
But...

598
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,950
When Kiddo jumped off the building,

599
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,020
he wasn't holding the Sunflowers.

600
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
Deducing this from the time I lost sight of him,

601
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,200
he must have hidden it somewhere in that building.

602
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,120
That's it!

603
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,020
These are the only instruments we can gather in the airport.

604
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,270
This is good enough.

605
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,650
We only need to check for damages.

606
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,520
Shall we begin?

607
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,270
Of course.

608
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,520
I hope it's just some dirt.

609
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,550
If there's even one scratch,

610
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,150
his dream to hold the exhibition will be ruined.

611
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,100
Inspector Nakamori, please take a look at this!

612
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,950
Just as we suspected, Kiddo was caught

613
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,170
by the surveillance camera at the rooftops!

614
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,100
About 1 hour 15 minutes ago,

615
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,150
he was seen flying right above us.

616
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,350
At that point in time,

617
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,400
he should still be carrying the Sunflowers.

618
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,320
Yes.

619
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,470
But why did Kiddo leave the Sunflowers behind in that building?

620
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,700
The second Sunflowers is heavy and big.

621
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,970
Perhaps air resistance here is too strong
to escape on a hang glider.

622
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,770
After things had calmed down,

623
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,600
he intended to come back to retrieve it,
but this squirt here saw him.

624
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,350
I-I didn't find it myself.

625
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,450
Shinichi-niichan said he saw

626
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,000
Kiddo hid it while he was running after him.

627
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,100
So,

628
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,370
where is that high school detective now?

629
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
When Kiddo appeared,

630
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,500
he was nowhere to be found.

631
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,450
Sounds like he is Kaito Kiddo to me.

632
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,700
I think that's not possible.

633
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,350
You're right!

634
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,320
There's a call log from 1 hour 15 minutes ago with Kudo-kun.

635
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,970
This coincides

636
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,770
with the time of the photograph.

637
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Crap!

638
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,420
Now it really turned out just as that American said.

639
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,270
That nonsense aside,

640
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,550
the question is why did Kiddo pass by this airport?

641
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,570
He might be curious about the airplane he detonated.

642
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,150
After all, cold-blooded murderers
do nonchalantly return to the crime scene.

643
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,050
No way.

644
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,350
Hey, you there!

645
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,670
Don't lump Kiddo-sama together with those murderers!

646
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,170
Open your eyes!

647
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,970
He almost got you killed!

648
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,400
I cannot accept the fact that Kiddo would do

649
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,820
something like crashing an airplane.

650
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,970
Excuse me.

651
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,070
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

652
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,420
It has been dirtied after being exposed to so much smoke

653
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,650
but there's no need to restore it.

654
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,650
Oh, is that so?

655
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,170
That means there is still hope!

656
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,220
Great work, everyone.

657
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,870
You'll all get busy soon.

658
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,500
No matter what happened,

659
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,820
I'm glad we found it again so soon.

660
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,700
Yes.

661
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,700
If it was left any longer under the hot sun like that,

662
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,320
it would've been ruined by not just the heat
and ultraviolet rays.

663
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,020
Well done, squirt!

664
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,370
That's why

665
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,750
you're the Kiddo Killer!

666
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,170
Like I said, it wasn't me.

667
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,900
This is the vault that the Suzuki family
has built using its wealth.

668
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,650
Re: Iron Raccoon!

669
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,400
Keeping it here

670
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,570
will put me at ease.

671
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,000
But didn't the Iron Raccoon

672
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,150
got broken into by Kiddo-sama?

673
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,650
No worries.

674
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,350
It has been remodeled.

675
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,200
Right?

676
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,150
Lupin.

677
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
(Setting Complete)

678
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,770
Alright. Go confirm that everyone is out.

679
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes, sir.

680
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,320
All in order.

681
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,920
There's no one inside.

682
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,720
Right.

683
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,400
(Activating Lock)
Iron Raccoon, activate!

684
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,020
According to the investigation
by the Metropolitan Police Department

685
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,120
and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism,
traces of a bomb

686
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,020
(What's next? Sunflowers Exhibition)
were found on the outer wall of the airplane's cargo compartment,

687
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,900
and the authorities are now searching for
the aircraft mechanic who has since gone missing.

688
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,120
Looks like the owners of the Sunflowers

689
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,270
(Rocky Road Ahead for Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition!?)
are reluctant to loan them now.

690
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,420
(Van Gogh's Sunflowers Exhibition Plan Ruined,
Owners of the Collection Reluctant to Loan)

691
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,850
Huh? Dad, you don't need to attend the meeting?

692
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,600
Yes.

693
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,820
There's a big race today.

694
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,050
Hey, hey.

695
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,550
- You're skipping it for that?
- What if you get fired for being absent on the first day?

696
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,070
There's no way they'd fire a great detective.

697
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,220
Here. These got delivered into our postbox.

698
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,700
What are these?

699
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,620
Letters?

700
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,620
These could be fan letters!

701
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,400
Conan-kun.

702
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,720
Sonoko invited us to attend the meeting.

703
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,050
Do you want to go together?

704
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,520
I want to go but...

705
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,220
I promised to go to the art gallery with the others today.

706
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,020
I see.

707
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,600
Well, that's okay.

708
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,620
And...

709
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,350
Has Shinichi

710
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,370
gotten in touch with you?

711
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,270
Nope, he hasn't.

712
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,370
If he had gone to the US, he could've just said something.

713
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,900
After he chased Kiddo, he never called me again.

714
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,100
Ran...

715
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,500
Conan!

716
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,150
We're here to pick you up!

717
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,650
Let's go, Conan-kun!

718
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,870
Y-Yeah!

719
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,250
Hurry, hurry!

720
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,250
Professor!

721
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,570
Conan's coming!

722
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,770
Haibara-san!

723
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,800
Looks like we can get going soon!

724
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,550
So, I'm heading out now.

725
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,020
Be careful out there!

726
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,470
See you later!

727
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,620
Yeah.

728
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,370
Ran!

729
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,870
What is it?

730
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,600
Call the police now!

731
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,150
It's Kiddo!

732
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,750
This Kiddo card

733
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,170
was in one of the letters!

734
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,420
Tonight,

735
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,350
left of La Berceuse,

736
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,220
the first replica will be mine.

737
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,020
(Tonight, "Left of La Berceuse)
Damn you, Kiddo!

738
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,100
((the first replica)" will be mine. Kaito Kiddo)
So you haven't given up yet!

739
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,250
As you are aware,

740
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,350
the owners of the Sunflowers

741
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,450
are now reluctant to loan their piece
after what happened recently.

742
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,420
And so,

743
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,750
in order to regain their trust,

744
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,950
we've added security system

745
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,520
dedicated to counter Kiddo at Lake Rock.

746
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,370
Last night,

747
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,500
Natsumi's suggestion

748
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,170
to hide surveillance cameras among the sunflowers

749
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,670
have already been adopted.

750
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,900
If anyone has any good ideas,

751
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,670
please let me know.

752
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,450
Of course,

753
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,820
I will spare no expense!

754
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,700
Of course!

755
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,470
It is our mission to make this exhibition

756
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,770
a success.

757
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,750
We will compile a list of ideas

758
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,750
and submit it to you.

759
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,300
Good. I'm counting on you.

760
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,550
Charlie.

761
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,670
You will lend us a hand, correct?

762
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,870
Of course.

763
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,420
He calls himself a phantom thief

764
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,850
but he is actually a murderer
who will do anything to attain his goals.

765
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,670
No. He is a terrorist!

766
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,950
What do you know about him?

767
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,620
That plane crash might not even be

768
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,520
his doing in the first place!

769
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,500
Then, allow me to ask.

770
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,120
Other than Kiddo,

771
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,850
who else had a reason to blow up the airplane?

772
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,020
Jirokichi-sama.

773
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,600
May I have a moment, please?

774
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,620
What is it about?

775
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,750
My apologies.

776
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,070
Inspector Nakamori would like to
speak to you as soon as possible.

777
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,250
Very well.

778
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,050
Transfer it over.

779
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,270
At once.

780
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
I'm on the line. What is it?

781
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,600
Sure. I understand.

782
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,700
It's impossible for the Iron Raccoon to be broken into,
but I'll check it out.

783
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,770
The meeting is adjourned for 1 hour.

784
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,000
Is something wrong?

785
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,820
What happened?

786
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,200
It can't be... Kiddo-sama?

787
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,450
Yes. A new message seems to
have been delivered to Detective Mouri.

788
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,050
What did the message say?

789
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,000
Tonight,

790
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,820
left of La Berceuse,

791
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,350
the first replica will be mine.

792
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,450
So he said.

793
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,220
It can't be...

794
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,920
Is it about being on the left in a set of three?

795
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,400
Then, the first replica refers to...

796
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,050
Yes.

797
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,500
Everyone, please wait here for a moment.

798
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,750
Advisor!

799
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,220
Going by the message,

800
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,170
Kiddo's target isn't the Sunflowers in here.

801
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,500
"Left of La Berceuse" and "the first replica" refer to

802
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,520
the fifth piece of the Sunflowers.

803
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,820
Additionally,

804
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,520
the Sunflowers believed to be painted fifth is,

805
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,550
as you already know,

806
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,270
currently in Japan.

807
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,100
(Sompo Japan Nipponkoa  Headquarters)
At the Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Museum of Art.

808
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,600
Art gallery?

809
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,300
They said it's a place to see drawings.

810
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,670
Sounds fun, right?

811
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,420
Thank you for visiting us all the time!

812
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,150
It's my first time at an art gallery.

813
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,550
Me too! Me too!

814
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,950
We're up so high!

815
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,750
This is amazing!

816
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,370
Look!

817
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,900
We can see the Skytree!

818
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,120
You're right!

819
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,200
Aren't you guys here to see the Sunflowers?

820
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,570
Oh, that's right!

821
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,270
Alright! Let's go see the Sunflowers!

822
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,800
Hey, no running!

823
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,720
Geez.

824
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,570
Are they actually interested in the Sunflowers?

825
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,250
Oh.

826
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,850
It wasn't them who wanted to see it.

827
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Right, Professor?

828
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,250
Before the Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition begins

829
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,300
I'd better be well prepared.

830
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,650
He's a crowd follower?

831
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,820
In any case,

832
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,550
I didn't think you'd come here.

833
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,150
Are you sure you shouldn't be at the meeting?

834
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,720
They have six samurai over there after all.

835
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,120
But more importantly,

836
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,150
what is Kiddo up to now?

837
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,600
Hm?

838
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,170
It's really strange to see him be interested in anything

839
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,920
other than gems.

840
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,650
Is that why you're here to
see van Gogh's Sunflowers that he's targeting?

841
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,370
Yeah.

842
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,850
If I can learn more about this,

843
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,470
I might be able

844
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,470
to deduce

845
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,100
his motive and his next moves.

846
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,220
Huh?

847
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,550
It ends here.

848
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,150
Which is the Sunflowers?

849
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,600
Oh! Found it!

850
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Which one? Which is the Sunflowers?

851
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,520
This is it, right? The middle one!

852
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,720
So pretty!

853
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,200
This is amazing.

854
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,970
Say, what's so amazing about this again?

855
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,670
What?

856
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,400
You guys!

857
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,100
You'll get kicked out if you guys don't keep it down!

858
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,950
I'm sorry they're such a nuisance.

859
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,320
It's fine.

860
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,170
So this is the fifth Sunflowers that he painted.

861
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,770
Hey, Professor!

862
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,170
It is indeed marvelous!

863
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,850
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

864
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,200
Please don't mind me.

865
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,220
So we've seen the Sunflowers.

866
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,500
Are you done already?

867
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,950
Yeah!

868
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,120
Let's go buy souvenirs!

869
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,200
Let's go!

870
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,470
Come on. Let's go, Professor.

871
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,270
Yes, of course.

872
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,950
Geez. What did they come here for?

873
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,120
Little girl,

874
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,070
you seem to be interested in something other than the Sunflowers.

875
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,600
Huh?

876
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,850
Pardon my sudden intrusion.

877
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,720
I couldn't help asking because you stared at him like I once did.

878
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,000
Granny,

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,570
do you come here often?

880
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,500
Yes, every day.

881
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,570
You really love van Gogh's Sunflowers, huh?

882
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:00,650
I do.

883
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,600
But it isn't this Sunflowers.

884
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,350
It's over here.

885
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,750
Looks like it's still safe.

886
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,270
What's going on, Mister?

887
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,000
Huh? Why are you here?

888
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,070
You too, Mister.

889
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,050
Nice timing, squirt.

890
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,320
Come join us.

891
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,600
Is it Kiddo?

892
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,350
Yes.

893
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,850
His next target is-

894
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,920
(Hideo Harada)
Advisor Suzuki!

895
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,820
(Seiji Togo Memorial  Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Museum of Art  Director)
Having that conversation here is just...

896
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,150
Oh, pardon me.

897
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,270
As you have confirmed,

898
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,170
nothing is out of place for now.

899
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,350
In order to not disturb the other visitors,

900
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,420
may I request that you take any further discussion
to the drawing room?

901
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,170
He's right. Well, let's go back for now.

902
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,050
Haibara! I'll stay here with Mister and the others.

903
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,800
You should go back with the gang.

904
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,170
And...

905
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,720
I know. Keep this a secret from the kids, right?

906
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,900
Yeah, thanks!

907
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,450
He really trusts you.

908
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,170
We aren't

909
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,120
as close as you think, Granny.

910
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,950
Not at all.

911
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,350
Your eyes shine like mine did, 70 years ago.

912
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,270
And that is similar to what the sunflower means,

913
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,950
"You're the only one I look at."

914
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,320
But just looking will lead to regret someday,

915
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,050
just like what happened to me.

916
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,350
People only realize how precious
something is after they've lost it.

917
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,620
Just like that Sunflowers.

918
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,170
Haibara!

919
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,200
Let's go home!

920
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,950
Huh? Where's Conan-kun?

921
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
He went back first.

922
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,820
Looks like something urgent has come up.

923
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,050
Again?

924
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,100
That's what he said.

925
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,020
- Thank you for the advice.
- Maybe he's just at the toilet!

926
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,600
I'll make sure I won't regret anything.

927
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,470
It's too bad you didn't get much time to admire it, Professor.

928
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,400
It's fine.

929
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,620
I get to look forward to the Japan Marveled
by Sunflowers Exhibition!

930
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,020
Kiyosuke-san...

931
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,400
(Tonight, "Left of La Berceuse (the first replica)"
will be mine. Kaito Kiddo)

932
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,650
How does this warning mean that

933
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,350
the Sunflowers in our museum is the target?

934
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,950
La Berceuse is

935
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,650
the painting of a woman rocking a cradle by van Gogh.

936
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,050
It isn't the Sunflowers.

937
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,870
No.

938
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,850
What was written after that are the main points,

939
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,820
"left" and "the first replica".

940
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,120
"Left" probably refers to a set of three.

941
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,950
Set of three?

942
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,700
Yes.

943
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,700
As in, three pieces of paintings hung together.

944
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,470
Well,

945
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,600
I can understand that much.

946
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,220
What?

947
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,420
But more importantly,

948
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,520
why doesn't it mean La Berceus but Sunflowers?

949
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,700
That's because...

950
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,170
What was it again?

951
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,820
You're so hopeless.

952
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,250
Pull yourself together!

953
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,250
You're a samurai, right?

954
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,220
Why don't we have

955
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,850
Koji Azuma-san, who deciphered the warning,

956
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,270
to explain it in detail?

957
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,850
Oh, that's right!

958
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,370
Azuma, if you will?

959
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,350
Y-Yes, sir!

960
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,070
As Detective Mouri had mentioned just now,

961
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,520
assuming we're right about the set of three,

962
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,300
now try to imagine putting La Berceuse in the middle.

963
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,500
What are the paintings that should be hung on both its sides?

964
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,520
Oh, it's the Sunflowers!

965
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,420
That's right.

966
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,470
It was even illustrated in a letter

967
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,420
written to his younger brother, Theo.

968
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,700
It should be unmistakable.

969
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,020
When you arrange the paintings as per the illustration,

970
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,900
the Sunflowers that should be placed
on both sides of La Berceuse are

971
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,720
(Third  Seventh)
the third and seventh piece on the right,

972
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,700
(Fourth  Fifth  Sixth)
and the fourth, fifth, and sixth on the left.

973
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,950
Of the three, the one of the left

974
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,450
(Original  Replica 1  Replica 2)
is the first replica of the Sunflowers,

975
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,970
and is the fifth Sunflowers currently
on display in this art museum.

976
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,220
I see. Now I understand why

977
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,370
the Sunflowers in our art museum is the target.

978
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,470
Well,

979
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,550
what should we do now?

980
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,070
Kiddo's warning mentioned tonight.

981
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,420
Have the Sunflowers moved to a safe place immediately.

982
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,650
We cannot arrange that so suddenly.

983
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,850
I understand.

984
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,520
I will explain the situation to our visitors
and close the museum ahead of time.

985
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

986
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,750
Alright, good.

987
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,450
Gently now. Right, that's it.

988
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,860
- Keep going straight, and all the way that side.
- Is there anything we can help with?

989
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,450
Yes, indeed.

990
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,900
That's the cheetah transporter Ishimine for you.

991
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,200
They got here in just 30 minutes!

992
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,370
There's another hour until sunset.

993
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,020
Looks like we'll barely make it.

994
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,820
Yes.

995
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,570
Yes, be gentle. Okay, that's it.

996
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:24,070
Is there anything we can do to help?

997
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,320
Let's see...

998
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,100
While we're packing,

999
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,350
can you please bring the lid over?

1000
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,270
Got it. Natsumi.

1001
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,500
Let's carry the lid over.

1002
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Sure.

1003
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,070
I'll help too.

1004
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,220
Wait, we'll do it.

1005
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,650
Ishimine-san wouldn't like anyone

1006
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,270
outside the team to get involved.

1007
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,070
She's right.

1008
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,650
Thank you for the offer.

1009
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,650
O-Of course.

1010
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,500
Ready?

1011
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,270
We'll lift it on a count of three.

1012
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,050
We're done packing.

1013
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,150
Good job.

1014
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,350
We brought the lid.

1015
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,370
Oh, thanks.

1016
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,220
We'll handle the rest.

1017
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,500
Isn't it about time we inspect the vault?

1018
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,020
Yes, you're right.

1019
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,750
Director.

1020
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,470
May I have a moment, please?

1021
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,500
It's just as Charlie-san said.

1022
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,920
Since the warning mentioned tonight,

1023
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,200
that means Kiddo will have to steal it from the vault.

1024
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

1025
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,620
It's nothing.

1026
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,470
Go on.

1027
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,200
Yes, sir.

1028
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,550
Wait!

1029
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,300
There's something under the lid!

1030
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,520
Hey, kid!

1031
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,700
We already running out of time,

1032
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,670
so don't make a scene!

1033
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,750
But it looks like a Kiddo card!

1034
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,770
What?

1035
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,170
Lift the lid.

1036
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:29,720
Yes, sir.

1037
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,100
It's a card!

1038
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,170
This can't be...!

1039
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,020
Natsumi-san,

1040
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:37,900
hand it to me.

1041
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,200
Oh, here.

1042
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,820
This is certainly a Kiddo card.

1043
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,950
I've already taken the Sunflowers. Kaito Kiddo.
(I've already taken the Sunflowers. Kaito Kiddo)

1044
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,450
Already taken?

1045
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,000
Isn't the Sunflowers here?

1046
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,800
That's it?

1047
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,720
Is that all that's written on it?

1048
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,920
What's the meaning of this?

1049
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,700
It can't be...

1050
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,650
the Sunflowers right here has already....

1051
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,800
Is it a fake?

1052
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,050
Who could've thought Kiddo would lie about the time of crime?

1053
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,900
Yes.

1054
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,450
This isn't like the usual Kiddo!

1055
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,600
No, wait.

1056
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,200
Something's wrong.

1057
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,150
He is just a thief.

1058
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,720
I'm sure he'll do whatever it takes to steal,

1059
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,820
even if it means becoming a murderer.

1060
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,320
How is it?

1061
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,820
If this is a fake,

1062
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,070
then it is forged in great detail.

1063
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,650
It's difficult to make an accurate appraisal here.

1064
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,520
Is that so?

1065
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,000
May I request that you entrust this to us?

1066
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,750
I can quickly make

1067
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,270
an accurate appraisal at our atelier.

1068
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,920
Very well.

1069
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,070
If the possibility of it being swapped with a fake is high,

1070
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,800
I'm sure the upper management will approve of this.

1071
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,300
That won't be necessary,

1072
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,350
Director.

1073
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,070
What do you mean?

1074
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,620
You're being disrespectful!

1075
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,900
T-That's Kaito Kiddo!

1076
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,200
That's it!

1077
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,250
This appraisal itself is Kiddo's trap!

1078
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,770
That Sunflowers is, without a doubt, the real deal.

1079
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,320
I can guarantee it.

1080
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,220
Off you go.

1081
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,920
Kiddo! How dare you tricked us?

1082
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,900
Stop!

1083
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,920
Azuma-san, Miyadai-san! Are you okay?

1084
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,250
More importantly, the Sunflowers got stolen!

1085
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,670
Catch Kiddo!

1086
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,470
What?

1087
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,400
The Sunflowers!

1088
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,700
Wait, Kiddo!

1089
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,200
This is Nakamori.

1090
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,250
Kiddo has stolen the Sunflowers and is on the run!

1091
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,320
He is likely to appear at the rooftop!

1092
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,270
Be on the alert!

1093
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,920
Roger that!

1094
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:57,950
We've got eyes on Kiddo!

1095
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,750
He's on the highest platform at the roof.

1096
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,020
Not good! He'll get away!

1097
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,150
If only I have my gun.

1098
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,870
Kaito Kiddo is firing multiple flying objects.

1099
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,700
We've lost sight of Kiddo!

1100
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,470
What? Search for him!

1101
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:24,720
Is that him?

1102
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,300
He got us!

1103
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,400
Where is he?

1104
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,250
It's no use now.

1105
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,520
Damn, what a villain.

1106
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,120
He stole it at night, just as he warned.

1107
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,870
This is the card Kiddo slipped inside my breast pocket.

1108
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,170
I will return the Sunflowers I had stolen

1109
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,520
for a measly 10 billion yen.

1110
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,070
Let's meet up 2 hours later at Touto Plaza Hotel, in Room 1412.

1111
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,570
All money needs to be in cash,
removed from the case and arranged on the bed.

1112
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,920
If you can't do it, then the deal is off. Kaito Kiddo.

1113
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,420
Get 10 billion yen in 2 hours?!

1114
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,100
So Kiddo's target from the start

1115
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,070
is money, after all.

1116
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,850
But...

1117
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,270
why has he changed so much?

1118
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,150
There must be a reason.

1119
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,520
Could he be an impostor?

1120
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,050
The museum

1121
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,420
cannot possibly prepare 10 billion yen in 2 hours!

1122
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,070
There's only one person in this entire Japan

1123
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,170
who can fulfill such a nonsensical demand.

1124
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,950
Very well.

1125
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,550
I will get the money prepared.

1126
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,570
You will?

1127
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,100
On a few conditions.

1128
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,900
If we managed to safely recover the Sunflowers,

1129
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,150
I'd like you to loan it to my exhibition.

1130
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,520
That's of course!

1131
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,220
If we can really recover it,

1132
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,200
I'm sure the upper management will not object.

1133
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,900
Then, can you help persuade

1134
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,620
the owners of the five remaining pieces?

1135
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:54,770
I understand.

1136
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,300
I will do my best.

1137
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,250
Splendid!

1138
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,150
Alright, that concludes the negotiation.

1139
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,250
We'll head for the hotel right away!

1140
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:01,700
Yes, sir!

1141
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,400
Director, as soon as you're ready,

1142
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,020
please head there immediately.

1143
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,820
O-Of course.

1144
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,550
Will you be going ahead,

1145
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,300
Charlie?

1146
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,870
No. I'll go get something important.

1147
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,500
Something important?

1148
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,170
Yes.

1149
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,550
Something essential in arresting Kiddo.

1150
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,820
I got it.

1151
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,420
But come back before it's time for the deal.

1152
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,850
Please rest assured.

1153
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,270
I will be back before the time.

1154
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,420
Excuse me. If it's possible,

1155
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,550
I have another request.

1156
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,020
Hm? What is it?

1157
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,050
Tell me.

1158
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,600
There's someone I'd like to

1159
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,420
introduce at your spectacular Sunflowers Exhibition.

1160
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,700
Who is that?

1161
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,320
Ever since our museum exhibited the Sunflowers,

1162
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,800
there is an old lady who'd come by

1163
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,520
every single day.

1164
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,870
That granny was here today, wasn't she?

1165
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,820
Yes, she was.

1166
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,170
Perhaps that painting brings back memories.

1167
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,950
She wouldn't look at any other paintings

1168
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,970
but kept gazing longingly

1169
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,820
at the Sunflowers the entire time.

1170
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,170
I'll allow it.

1171
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,670
Thank you very much!

1172
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:07,870
It's me.

1173
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,300
I need that, after all.

1174
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,820
Are you sure?

1175
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,920
In this country, just possessing one

1176
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,550
is enough to make you a criminal.

1177
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,470
I don't care.

1178
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,200
I cannot let a terrorist who blow up a plane be at large.

1179
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,300
Alright. I'll prepare it immediately.

1180
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,020
Thank you, Mark.

1181
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,550
1 hour later,

1182
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,120
I'll collect it at the parking lot behind Touto Plaza Hotel.

1183
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,450
Understood.

1184
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,700
(Touto Plaza Hotel)

1185
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,800
This is the entrance lobby, here.

1186
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,570
All in order.

1187
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,520
Emergency stairs. No suspicious person in sight.

1188
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:42,350
Curse it!

1189
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,100
We won't make it at this pace!

1190
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,120
I'm sorry I'm late.

1191
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,020
Inspector Nakamori, how is the security?

1192
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,120
I have officers stationed at every entrance and exit.

1193
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,700
That's meaningless if he is already inside the hotel.

1194
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,520
Even so, I will not repeat the previous mistake.

1195
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,120
I will not let him leave this hotel!

1196
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,720
Hurry up! We're running out of time.

1197
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,170
Bring them inside!

1198
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,620
I'll put this here.

1199
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,350
Hurry!

1200
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,550
Excuse me.

1201
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,320
Do you think we can negotiate even in this situation?

1202
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,650
This is Kiddo's instruction.

1203
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,050
We have to listen to him.

1204
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,350
In any case, don't randomly talk to us from now onwards.

1205
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,320
If he finds out that we're involved,
this will all come to nothing.

1206
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,770
O-Of course.

1207
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,900
But still...

1208
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,570
Why does he want the money to be laid out like that?

1209
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,150
What choice do we have?

1210
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,570
It is Kiddo's instruction, after all.

1211
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:44,550
Kid!

1212
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,450
Keep it down!

1213
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,950
Okay.

1214
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,820
Do you want to see the monitor?

1215
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,920
Y-Yeah.

1216
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,400
Wait a minute.

1217
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:56,850
There you go.

1218
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,970
Thanks!

1219
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,170
You're so kind.

1220
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,600
It's because we need your help.

1221
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,350
You've previously proven your insight and agility.

1222
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,270
Indeed, you deserve the name Kiddo Killer.

1223
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,420
T-That was a coincidence.

1224
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,100
And I'm just an elementary school kid.

1225
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,020
I don't have such prejudice.

1226
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,970
If you find something, let us know.

1227
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,000
Got it?

1228
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,450
Okay.

1229
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,270
For an amount as large as 10 billion,

1230
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,220
it's common to request it to
be transferred into an overseas bank account.

1231
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,620
The fact that he demanded cash,

1232
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,420
it must mean something.

1233
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,850
W-What?

1234
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,070
The reporters are here?

1235
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,500
What's going on?

1236
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,020
No one should know about this deal except us!

1237
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,300
That should've been the case

1238
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,220
but the entire city

1239
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,670
is gradually congregating.

1240
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,470
The situation at the parking lot

1241
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,470
is already out of control.

1242
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,320
In front of hotel's left entrance,

1243
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,200
the reporters have started a live broadcast!

1244
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,270
(LIVE Touto Plaza Hotel)
I'm reporting from the entrance of Touto Plaza Hotel.

1245
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,210
(Breaking News Live Broadcast  Another Warning From Kaito Kiddo!!)
With the statement from Kiddo that

1246
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,700
(What's next? Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition)
he is only interested in the second and fifth Sunflowers...

1247
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,300
That damned Kiddo!

1248
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,020
Is he trying to create confusion by feeding the reporters?

1249
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,070
Inspector Nakamori!

1250
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,520
If Kiddo did tell them himself,

1251
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,250
then the deal will not be called off because of this commotion.

1252
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:05,920
Yes.

1253
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,050
In any case, we're running out of time!

1254
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:10,150
Let's give up unloading the money!

1255
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,920
We have no choice. There's two more minutes to go.

1256
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,170
It's fine to just leave the case open!

1257
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,920
Everyone! Withdraw from the scene!

1258
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,700
Director.

1259
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,450
We'll be on standby in the opposite room.

1260
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,170
Excuse me...

1261
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,320
Please stay right there!

1262
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,070
Hurry!

1263
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,370
This is quite the warm room.

1264
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,220
Can I open the window?

1265
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,000
Please bear with it.

1266
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,820
Kiddo might not be coming in through the door.

1267
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,150
Right.

1268
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:42,170
All personnel have withdrawn.

1269
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,400
Alright, that's good.

1270
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,520
All units, be on standby until

1271
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,670
further instructions from me.

1272
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,500
Roger that.

1273
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,070
This is Kiddo we're talking about.

1274
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,250
He must have planned something.

1275
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,820
I need to find it before the deal takes place.

1276
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,170
Why do I have a bad feeling?

1277
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,300
Something feels different from a moment ago.

1278
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:04,920
Crap!

1279
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,050
So that's it!

1280
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,120
Shit!

1281
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,670
That brat took the master key.

1282
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,570
Damn, I'm running out of time!

1283
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,770
Come on, faster!

1284
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,070
Kiddo Killer!

1285
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,770
What happened?

1286
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,550
Hurry, get in!

1287
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,370
Care to explain what's going on?

1288
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,500
The water level in the bottle
that the director drank from has risen.

1289
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,470
The air pressure in the room is probably getting higher.

1290
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,250
What is he planning?

1291
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,600
I don't know.

1292
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,500
But we need to get the air pressure in the room
back to normal as soon as possible.

1293
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,250
That's what Kiddo expects.

1294
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,000
Hey, hey, hey!

1295
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,920
What are they doing?

1296
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,470
Are they going to ruin everything?

1297
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,500
There's only 20 seconds left until the time of the deal.

1298
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,700
Damn, it won't open!

1299
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,550
The door is being blocked by the high pressure inside the room!

1300
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,750
Those guys are doing whatever they please!

1301
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,120
There's nothing we can do now.

1302
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,620
We have less than 10 seconds now.

1303
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,900
Let's just proceed as it is.

1304
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,700
5 seconds to go.

1305
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,650
4

1306
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,620
3

1307
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,500
2

1308
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,400
1

1309
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,550
0

1310
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,520
What's going on?

1311
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,920
Has he come?

1312
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,350
Alright, it's opening!

1313
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,100
Kiddo!

1314
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,900
Damn, that Kiddo!

1315
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,250
It's Kiddo!

1316
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,070
So the information that Kiddo made a deal with the Suzuki Group

1317
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,100
is true, after all!

1318
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,220
He's getting away!

1319
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,000
Are you injured?

1320
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,070
Did Kiddo bring the Sunflowers?

1321
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,400
I don't know.

1322
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,070
Charlie-san!

1323
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,700
Look!

1324
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,300
Look at the painting above the bed!

1325
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,320
You two!

1326
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,300
How dare you ruin-

1327
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:31,970
Charlie!

1328
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,650
Where's he?

1329
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,920
What happened to Kiddo?

1330
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,200
He got away.

1331
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,770
And the Sunflowers?

1332
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,850
It's fine.

1333
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,420
The Sunflowers is safe.

1334
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,750
That's the Sunflowers!

1335
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,170
We got it back!

1336
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,500
Yes, however...

1337
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,450
The money...

1338
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:51,920
It's fine. It's fine.

1339
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,000
Well done!

1340
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,770
Let's have a press conference right now!

1341
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,700
Advisor Suzuki,

1342
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,870
please tell us your thoughts on winning

1343
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,920
this confrontation against Kaito Kiddo again.

1344
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,900
I'm not afraid of Kiddo!

1345
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,000
To all the owners of Sunflowers,

1346
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,070
no worries!

1347
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,820
What's...

1348
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,050
with this better-than-expected development?

1349
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,300
(NEWS TODAY)

1350
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,200
This man has made

1351
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,200
the headlines

1352
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,700
for protecting two of the world's famous paintings
from Kaito Kiddo.

1353
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,950
It was first planned by Jirokichi Suzuki,

1354
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,970
- Look at that!
- It was first planned by Jirokichi Suzuki,

1355
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,100
- Hey, I want to go to that exhibition.
- now holding the Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition

1356
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,920
- Oh, that Sunflowers one?
- has become a reality.

1357
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Along with these two,

1358
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,620
all the other Sunflowers by van Gogh from all over the world

1359
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,870
are gathering in Japan one after another.

1360
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,470
Our special guests for today are

1361
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,320
the ones who brought about the Japan Marveled
by Sunflowers Exhibition,

1362
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,920
(Special Feature  Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition)
the advisor to the Suzuki Group,

1363
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,420
(Impregnable!! More About Lake Rock Art Museum's Security System)
Jirokichi Suzuki and

1364
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,170
his niece, Sonoko Suzuki.

1365
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,800
Who's that old man?

1366
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,000
(Kabukicho Ichiban-gai)
Isn't he the one whose blimp hit the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge?

1367
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,250
The venue for the exhibition is at the Lake Rock Art Museum.

1368
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,970
That isn't a familiar name.

1369
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,120
That's because it's an

1370
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,970
art museum built especially for this exhibition!

1371
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,070
That's very interesting!

1372
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,250
In order to provide the optimum environment
and flawless security for the exhibits,

1373
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:14,450
striking a balance between these two factors requires

1374
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,570
(Everything About Lake Rock Art Museum!!)
for the layout to be re-examined from the start.

1375
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,570
Let's take a look at the video presentation

1376
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,470
with Sonoko Suzuki-san as our commentator.

1377
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,920
Lake Rock Art Museum is

1378
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,350
built by remodeling a limestone cave,

1379
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,870
owned by the group.

1380
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,470
It's a structure that extends eight floors underground,

1381
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,250
with an exhibition room on every floor

1382
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,200
for each piece of the Sunflowers collection.

1383
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,220
Visitors can take their time to stroll around.

1384
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,150
Additionally,

1385
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,600
when our visitors reach and

1386
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,950
gather at the lowest level,

1387
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,300
all the Sunflowers that were on display

1388
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,870
at every floor will be moved to

1389
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:51,320
the eighth floor with a specialized elevator.

1390
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,420
While the visitors wait for the elevator to the surface,

1391
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,320
they get to enjoy viewing all

1392
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,400
seven pieces of the Sunflowers together!

1393
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,700
I see!

1394
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,050
Instead of admiring all seven pieces at once from the get-go,

1395
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,200
we're given the opportunity to see the

1396
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,150
beauty of each piece individually in a new light.

1397
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,700
That's not all.

1398
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,370
Our security is also perfect!

1399
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,100
Should any abnormality be detected on the Sunflowers,

1400
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,600
the sensor will immediately activate

1401
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:27,200
a mechanism that will store the piece
in a fireproof and waterproof case.

1402
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,800
So there is no danger of damage by fire or flooding.

1403
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,500
Furthermore,

1404
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,950
even if the Sunflowers got stolen within the museum,

1405
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,920
the security system will instantly activate

1406
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,050
and block all exits and entrances.

1407
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,820
Even if Kaito Kiddo disguised himself

1408
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,300
and slipped inside with the other visitors,

1409
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,920
he can never escape!

1410
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,370
Our safety measure is flawless too!

1411
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,570
The elevator to the surface and

1412
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,220
and the bare minimal lighting

1413
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,450
will not stop the security system

1414
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,900
from working.

1415
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,400
Are you saying that the museum can generate its own power?

1416
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,220
Yes. We've prepared a video about it,

1417
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,820
so please take a look.

1418
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,400
As you can see, the water from the lake is pumped

1419
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,200
and stored in a water tank at the topmost floor.

1420
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,110
When the need arises,

1421
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,500
the water flowing from such a height

1422
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,470
will generate electricity.

1423
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,900
(Main Transformer) (Electric Generator)
With this power,

1424
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,770
we can send our visitors to the surface,

1425
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,170
and at the same time, the Sunflowers will

1426
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,600
be sent into an emergency underground vault

1427
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,700
using a specialized rail.

1428
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,020
That's amazing!

1429
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,300
This is indeed perfect!

1430
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,550
It's truly an impregnable fortress

1431
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,500
built to protect the Sunflowers!

1432
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,300
Indeed!

1433
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,370
In this vigorous environment,

1434
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,170
to be able to admire all seven pieces of the Sunflowers

1435
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:34,000
and humanity's greatest treasures

1436
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,320
is truly the very essence of
"Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition"!

1437
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,300
We're been informed that this exhibition has a limit of

1438
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,600
100 visitors per day,

1439
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,500
and be held for only one month.

1440
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,300
When will you start the lottery for the tickets?

1441
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,620
It begins as of this second!

1442
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:50,620
Really?

1443
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,970
If you access the group's homepage,

1444
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,250
you can enter the lottery right away!

1445
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,270
It starts simultaneously around the world,

1446
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,570
so the numbers will be astronomical!

1447
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,700
Everyone,

1448
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,970
don't miss this opportunity, okay?

1449
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:04,800
I missed!

1450
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,650
(Missed)

1451
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,220
I thought we'd win a ticket

1452
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,900
with the Professor's network!

1453
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,750
What the heck?

1454
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,100
Everyone missed!

1455
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:11,950
Professor,

1456
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,250
what happens if you win one?

1457
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,600
The initial photograph of your face
that you uploaded gets officially registered,

1458
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,820
then you'll be given an ID and PIN number.

1459
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,400
When you enter those at the application page,

1460
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,070
the ticket will be delivered to you soon.

1461
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:26,900
Professor,

1462
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,100
you know this pretty well.

1463
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:29,900
It can't be!

1464
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,020
That's right.

1465
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,320
I won a ticket!

1466
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,000
That's a creepy laugh.

1467
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,450
Professor, please!

1468
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,520
Let me have it!

1469
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,850
I want to see it!

1470
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:41,550
Me too!

1471
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,650
Ayumi too!

1472
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,500
Absolutely not!

1473
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,170
That's very immature, Professor.

1474
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,900
That's right, Professor!

1475
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,020
Immature!

1476
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,420
What a pickle.

1477
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,920
Oh! Since you really want it,

1478
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,900
then let's have a quiz!

1479
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,670
It's a three-choice question,
so you only have one chance to answer.

1480
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,420
Got it?

1481
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:01,920
Yeah!

1482
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:02,720
Yay!

1483
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,070
That's our professor!

1484
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,170
Now, let the quiz begins!

1485
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,750
What does the Little Sunflower in a sunflower field

1486
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:11,720
hates the most?

1487
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,720
One, the spider.

1488
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,620
Two, the snake.

1489
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,020
Three, the scorpion.

1490
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,300
That means...

1491
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,070
spider, snake, and scorpion, right?

1492
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,800
Yeah. So the answer is-

1493
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,300
No! Shh! You two cannot answer this.

1494
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,150
I got it!

1495
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,420
I've got it too!

1496
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,050
Ayumi too!

1497
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,070
The answer is three, the scorpion!

1498
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,900
That's wrong, Genta-kun!

1499
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,300
But a scorpion has poison.

1500
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,620
There are poisonous spiders and snakes too!

1501
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,820
For real?

1502
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,200
Whoopsie.

1503
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,420
The correct answer is one, the spider.

1504
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,720
Why's that?

1505
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,670
That's because spider is "kumo".

1506
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,220
Huh?

1507
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,070
Geez!

1508
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:49,370
It sounds the same as the cloud (kumo) in the sky!

1509
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,820
Little Sunflower loves the sun,

1510
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,900
of course it hates the cloud that gets in the way!

1511
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,200
Oh, shoot.

1512
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,970
So it had nothing to do with poison.

1513
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,350
There you have it.

1514
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,100
I'm not giving up my ticket

1515
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,300
to anyone!

1516
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:05,850
so that's what happened.

1517
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,170
Everyone was thinking about

1518
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,850
going to see the Sunflowers.

1519
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,300
Can we?

1520
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,870
Can we, please?

1521
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,720
Please?

1522
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,950
Please!

1523
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,050
Very well!

1524
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,750
Yay!

1525
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,720
Is it really okay?

1526
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,770
However!

1527
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,800
I'll have you work for me harder than ever before!

1528
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,720
Thanks, Kiddo Killer-san!

1529
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,550
Advisor Suzuki.

1530
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,000
We should reconvene the meeting soon.

1531
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,800
Yes, you're right.

1532
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,020
Let's go, kids!

1533
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,500
I'll take you home!

1534
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,570
Okay!

1535
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,520
Uncle,

1536
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,400
don't forget about Ran

1537
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,400
and Shinichi's ticket.

1538
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,170
Of course.

1539
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,400
Ishimine,

1540
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,470
I'm sorry but can you go ahead?

1541
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,020
Of course.

1542
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,100
Please contact me when you've confirmed the time

1543
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,070
and route for each vehicle.

1544
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,920
Sure.

1545
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:49,820
Hey.

1546
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,720
How will you transport it to the art museum?

1547
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,150
Even if the security at Lake Rock is flawless,

1548
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,500
transporting it there is the most dangerous!

1549
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,670
No worries.

1550
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,650
We've prepared a large number of dummy transporting vehicles.

1551
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,500
I'm the only one who know
which vehicle carries the real paintings.

1552
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,550
I see!

1553
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,400
It'll be fine if you're handling this.

1554
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:07,700
But,

1555
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,870
if you're going to use that,

1556
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,500
then don't forget that there's no life in this world

1557
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,620
that can be cut short so lightly.

1558
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,200
I'll keep that in mind.

1559
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,250
However, if you keep pursuing your ideals,

1560
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,350
you will be betrayed by reality someday.

1561
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,120
Just like what happened with Kaito Kiddo.

1562
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,120
Hey, kid!

1563
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,900
What are you doing? Let's go!

1564
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,900
Everyone's waiting.

1565
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,770
Okay!

1566
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:36,900
Looks like I'm on someone's black list.

1567
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,370
Excuse me.

1568
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,050
Master,

1569
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,270
you have a delivery and a message.

1570
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:44,720
Thank you.

1571
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:46,270
Who is it from?

1572
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,100
Why is it sent here

1573
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,570
instead of the company?

1574
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,400
Be quiet, Lupin!

1575
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,470
Goodness, how spoiled.

1576
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,820
T-This can't be... Kiddo!

1577
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:03,870
Please let me take a look.

1578
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,470
There's no doubt about it!

1579
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,570
It's a Kiddo card!

1580
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:07,670
And that is?

1581
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,970
It looks like a present.

1582
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,870
What's gotten into you, Lupin?

1583
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,500
Advisor, please stand back!

1584
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,270
That's enough.

1585
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,400
Lupin, heel!

1586
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,150
What?

1587
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,770
This stench and flammability!

1588
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,520
Is it phosphine?

1589
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,170
It's a highly flammable liquid.

1590
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,450
Everyone, get out of here!

1591
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,550
Are you alright, Charlie?

1592
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,250
Yes.

1593
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,370
It's alright now.

1594
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,200
Go and contact

1595
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,770
Inspector Nakamori at once!

1596
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:41,400
Y-Yes, sir!

1597
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,100
Are you sure?

1598
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,600
This is an incident that could've taken lives.

1599
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,250
If you report this to the police,

1600
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,450
the exhibition will have to be postponed

1601
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,250
or, in the worst-case scenario,

1602
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:51,770
be cancelled altogether.

1603
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,400
Indeed.

1604
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,450
Charlie-san does have a point.

1605
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,870
I got it.

1606
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,200
All of you, too,

1607
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,300
don't say a word about this to anyone.

1608
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,120
Understand?

1609
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,270
Yes, of course.

1610
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,570
Good boy, Lupin!

1611
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:08,670
You really have a good nose!

1612
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,750
Charlie-san, just in case,

1613
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,220
let's seal off this room.

1614
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:12,820
Sure.

1615
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,900
Kaito Kiddo.

1616
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,700
You've shown your true colors, at last.

1617
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,370
I will not go easy on you anymore.

1618
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:34,120
(Cheetah Delivery)

1619
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,300
Alright!

1620
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:36,320
Alright!

1621
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,070
Stop!

1622
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:41,470
Just how many dummies has he prepared?

1623
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,450
More importantly, what do you think of

1624
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,500
that incident just now?

1625
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:45,350
What do you mean?

1626
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,700
About Kiddo's motive.

1627
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,950
If Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition

1628
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,100
gets canceled,

1629
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,550
the second and fifth piece

1630
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,470
of the Sunflowers will be removed

1631
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,650
from Lake Rock Art Museum.

1632
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,400
He will have another chance to steal them again.

1633
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,520
That's it?

1634
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,050
In that case,

1635
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,820
he could've waited until the exhibition ends a month later.

1636
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,850
Why is Kaito Kiddo

1637
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,320
in such a hurry?

1638
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,470
(Turpentine Oil)

1639
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,500
Ladies and gentlemen!

1640
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:04,600
Thank you

1641
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,420
for joining us at the

1642
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,220
Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition today!

1643
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,150
And now, let's invite the host of this exhibition,

1644
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,270
Jirokichi Suzuki,

1645
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,450
for the opening speech.

1646
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Well,

1647
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:22,000
I'm sure everyone here are fascinated by the scent of sunflowers,

1648
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,720
so are you ready?

1649
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,620
Alright, with this...

1650
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:33,520
Japan Marveled by Sunflowers Exhibition is officially launched!

1651
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,200
We will start the admission now.

1652
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,870
Please have your ticket in hand

1653
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,570
and line up in a single file.

1654
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,270
Excuse me. My name is Ran Mouri.

1655
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,720
Please show me your tickets.

1656
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,270
It's for the six of us.

1657
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,270
I've verified your tickets.

1658
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,820
This way, please.

1659
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,670
We're the first!

1660
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,300
Wow!

1661
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,400
Ran-neechan, hurry up!

1662
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,020
Are you going in as a group?

1663
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,620
Yes.

1664
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,800
Will the representative of the group

1665
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,050
place the tickets into the ticket barrier?

1666
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,100
Of course!

1667
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,220
(Ran Mouri  Conan Edogawa  Ai Haibara
Genta Kojima  Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya  Ayumi Yoshida)

1668
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,920
Is the admission going smoothly?

1669
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,470
Yes.

1670
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,350
Both the exhibition's environment

1671
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,900
and security system are working perfectly.

1672
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,820
Good.

1673
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,170
Well then, other than Goto,
everyone else can go back to your positions.

1674
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:18,820
Yes, sir!

1675
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:21,220
Huh, wait a minute!

1676
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,200
Can he really handle this alone?

1677
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,400
Don't worry.

1678
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:26,300
It's all automated.

1679
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,720
Besides, it's best to keep the number of people

1680
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,570
with access to this room to a bare minimum.

1681
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,200
Well, you're right on that.

1682
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,150
Huh?

1683
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,320
Hey, what is it?

1684
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,500
N-Nothing.

1685
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,650
You're such a noisy fellow.

1686
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:40,920
What's this?

1687
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:43,470
That detective kid is here, too?

1688
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,020
Goto,

1689
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,570
is there anyone suspicious?

1690
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:48,620
Just a moment ago,

1691
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,500
the first group of visitors got off the elevator

1692
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,950
to view the first Sunflowers at the exhibition room.

1693
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:53,950
Only one person

1694
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,320
headed to view the second Sunflowers instead.

1695
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,700
I'll pull it up on the monitor.

1696
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,370
She's strange.

1697
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,820
Why'd she start with the second piece?

1698
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,970
Can't we have another view?

1699
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,500
Goto!

1700
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:08,500
Yes, sir!

1701
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,270
What's this?

1702
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,520
Is she crying?

1703
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,350
I guess she really wanted to see

1704
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,600
the second Sunflowers.

1705
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,670
Advisor,

1706
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,600
she's clearly not Kiddo.

1707
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,470
Bring the monitor back to view all the cameras.

1708
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,200
Oh, you're right.

1709
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,700
Back to main.

1710
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,770
Yes, sir.

1711
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,220
Wow, this is so beautiful!

1712
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,570
But these are all fake, right?

1713
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,870
They would've wilted if they're real.

1714
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,050
I don't mind them being fake

1715
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,700
but can't they make them smell good?

1716
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,050
This is strange.

1717
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,700
This is Natsumi-san's idea

1718
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,020
but I don't think she mentioned anything

1719
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:50,250
about the fragrance.

1720
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:51,700
That aside,

1721
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,520
let's go take a look at the

1722
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,800
second Sunflowers that our Suzuki Group has bought!

1723
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,900
That's a great idea!

1724
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,150
Let's go!

1725
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:01,770
Yeah!

1726
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,870
Surveillance cameras?

1727
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:06,720
So they've set it up everywhere like this.

1728
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,720
Conan-kun!

1729
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,020
What are you doing? Let's go.

1730
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,420
Okay!

1731
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,420
Look! There it is!

1732
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,350
You're right!

1733
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,400
Amazing!

1734
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,170
This is

1735
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,920
what I've been wanting to see!

1736
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,770
Ran!

1737
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:29,870
Hurry!

1738
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:30,750
Shinichi-kun is here!

1739
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,170
No way!

1740
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,720
Shinichi!

1741
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:37,520
Sonoko, where's Shinichi?

1742
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:38,620
Sorry.

1743
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,650
I lost him.

1744
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,020
Is he really here?

1745
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,850
Now that you mention it...

1746
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,370
I didn't get a good look at him but...

1747
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,850
Maybe you mistook someone else for him?

1748
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,750
I hope that's the case.

1749
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,020
Considering the security at the time of admission,

1750
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,170
the thorough bag check and X-ray scan

1751
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,950
make it impossible to enter in a disguise.

1752
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,070
In this case, the only thing Kiddo can do is...

1753
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,370
to impersonate me because

1754
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,150
we somehow have similar features.

1755
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,450
(14 = (11 persons + 1 person) + 2 persons)
What's this memo?

1756
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,970
Kiddo card!

1757
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,150
He really did impersonate as me!

1758
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,070
How is it?

1759
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,520
He's not over here too.

1760
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,550
I'm sorry.

1761
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,400
I guess I really mistook someone else for him.

1762
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,250
Ran-neechan! Sonoko-neechan!

1763
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,250
Conan-kun, be quiet!

1764
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,070
Take me to the security room!

1765
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,400
It's a Kiddo card!

1766
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,070
Kaito Kiddo is already inside

1767
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,350
the Lake Rock!

1768
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:38,970
(14 = (11 persons + 1 person) + 2 persons)
(15 = (11 persons + 1 person) + 2 persons + 1 person)

1769
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,870
What does this mean?

1770
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,470
If we insist upon an association with the Sunflowers,

1771
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,300
then there should be paintings
by van Gogh that depicts 15 stalks of sunflowers.

1772
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,800
The fourth, fifth, and sixth piece

1773
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,720
have 15 stalks of sunflowers in them.

1774
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,270
So, are there any with just 14 stalks?

1775
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,150
There shouldn't be one.

1776
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:56,720
No.

1777
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,500
There's a theory that 14 and 15 stalks

1778
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,470
means the same in van Gogh's Sunflowers.

1779
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,950
In a letter to his younger brother, Theo,

1780
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,600
van Gogh referred to the painting

1781
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,320
with 15 stalks of sunflowers as 14 stalks.

1782
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,120
If that number

1783
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,950
signifies the number of sunflowers,

1784
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,050
then what does the numbers that follow represent?

1785
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:15,670
When van Gogh referred to

1786
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,820
the Sunflowers as 14 stalks,

1787
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,950
he probably meant the twelve apostles of Jesus and

1788
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,400
Theo and Gauguin,

1789
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,670
or at least, that's how the theory goes.

1790
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,400
Yes!

1791
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,550
That must be it!

1792
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,850
What does that mean?

1793
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,750
Please take

1794
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,920
another look at the card.

1795
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,720
Eleven plus one person refers to

1796
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,220
(Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ)
the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ,

1797
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,000
plus two persons,

1798
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,520
(Theo  Gauguin)
said to be Theo and Gauguin.

1799
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,820
Adding it all up, the total is 14 persons.

1800
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:43,120
And when it's referred to as 15 stalks,

1801
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,770
the one other person

1802
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,900
(van Gogh)
is said to be van Gogh himself.

1803
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,350
Assuming that interpretation is correct,

1804
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:50,920
then the question is,

1805
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,600
what do these formulas mean?

1806
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,000
I wonder why Kiddo-sama

1807
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,670
left such a confusing warning behind.

1808
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,750
How can we be sure that Kiddo card

1809
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,950
is really a warning

1810
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:00,700
in the first place?

1811
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,020
It's fine.

1812
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,320
Whatever this Kiddo card

1813
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,900
is warning us about,

1814
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,700
we can just arrest him

1815
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,600
and just ask for ourselves!

1816
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,020
Please lend us your cooperation

1817
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,120
to lock Kiddo inside Lake Rock!

1818
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,250
O-Of course.

1819
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,150
Goto,

1820
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,870
get the staff to usher all the visitors to the exit.

1821
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,370
Yes, sir.

1822
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,470
But then...

1823
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,600
it hasn't even been an hour since the opening!

1824
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,400
There will be a riot if you do that!

1825
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,700
No worries.

1826
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,400
Since we don't know what could happen on the first day,

1827
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:34,300
we've only invited the company's staff and Sonoko's friends.

1828
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,070
Advisor!

1829
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,100
We'll be on guard duty, as planned.

1830
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:38,820
Good.

1831
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,470
I'm counting on you all,

1832
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:42,370
the Seven Samurai.

1833
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,400
That's right!

1834
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,570
We had an emergency protocol in place.

1835
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,170
As we've discussed,

1836
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,620
when you move away from your position,

1837
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,000
we'll inform each other.

1838
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,700
Got it.

1839
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:55,700
Everyone,

1840
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,820
something seems to be happening at the Sunflowers Exhibition.

1841
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,100
We apologize for the inconvenience.

1842
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:01,570
Please calmly head for the elevator.

1843
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,300
Kiddo must be here!

1844
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:05,350
The Detective Boys gotta investigate!

1845
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,900
You mustn't!

1846
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,220
Kiddo is dangerous this time around.

1847
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,250
You guys mustn't leave my side!

1848
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,800
Okay.

1849
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,920
How is the visitors' exit protocol doing?

1850
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,120
It's going smoothly.

1851
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,670
If a problem should arise,

1852
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,750
it would be at the various inspections at the exit.

1853
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,100
X-ray scan is unnecessary.

1854
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:25,020
Let them leave the building after returning their belongings.

1855
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,270
Kiddo might escape if you do that.

1856
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,520
No worries.

1857
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,650
You're also well aware that

1858
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,920
he isn't someone who'd run away

1859
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,770
when his target is right in front of him.

1860
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:35,520
Well...

1861
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,920
he'd most probably remain within the museum.

1862
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,150
That's it!

1863
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,200
We'll seal all the exits and entrances

1864
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,850
with the bulwarks and lock him inside.

1865
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,400
Since he's able to get inside Lake Rock,

1866
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,500
it should mean that Kiddo is now not in disguise

1867
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,770
and does not carry any magic tools.

1868
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:52,620
In this situation, we can definitely win against him!

1869
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,970
I also have twelve trustworthy comrades

1870
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,450
remaining inside the museum.

1871
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,450
(14 = (11 persons + 1 person) + 2 persons)
Twelve trustworthy persons.

1872
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:02,820
That's it!

1873
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,500
The twelve apostles aren’t written as twelve persons,

1874
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,800
(11 persons + 1 person)
but instead as 11 persons plus 1 person.

1875
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,350
(1 person)
Could that mean...

1876
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,520
Uncle Jirokichi!

1877
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,920
Aren't your twelve trustworthy persons

1878
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:15,370
the same number of people as

1879
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:16,670
Jesus Christ's apostles

1880
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,020
that's written on the Kiddo card?

1881
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,600
I was wondering why didn't

1882
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,600
Kiddo just write it as twelve persons all along.

1883
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,250
Did one of them get left out of the group?

1884
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:26,750
That's...

1885
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,370
Judas, isn't it?

1886
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,450
Judas the Betrayer!

1887
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,320
So, Kiddo-sama is

1888
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,750
trying to tell us that there's

1889
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:35,950
a traitor among us!

1890
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,120
That means

1891
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,600
someone other than Kiddo is targeting the Sunflowers.

1892
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,200
Advisor Suzuki,

1893
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,670
I would like to re-investigate

1894
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,720
the profiles of all seven samurai.

1895
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,350
He might be trying to shake our trust

1896
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:50,670
and take advantage of the chaos in security.

1897
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,550
Then I won't let them know

1898
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,600
about the re-investigation.

1899
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:54,600
Good.

1900
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,420
In that case, there shouldn't be any damage done.

1901
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:58,420
I'll leave that to you.

1902
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,100
Of course.

1903
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:04,020
The visitors and staff have all left building.

1904
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:04,920
Alright.

1905
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,520
Lower the bulwarks at once!

1906
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:06,970
Yes, sir!

1907
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,270
Closing the bulwarks.

1908
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,070
Please keep moving.

1909
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,170
The visitors and staff are

1910
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,370
gradually coming out of the Lake Rock Art Museum.

1911
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,700
What has happened inside the museum?

1912
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,420
Apparently, even the visitors

1913
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,050
were not told anything at all.

1914
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,920
The other places with insufficient surveillance are

1915
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,520
the server room and the powerhouse.

1916
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,670
But...

1917
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,300
Only personnel involved know their locations.

1918
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,620
Maybe I should give it a look.

1919
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,670
This is Charlie.

1920
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,700
I've checked all vulnerable points

1921
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,050
I found no trace of Kiddo inside the museum.

1922
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,100
Roger that.

1923
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,600
There's no one left inside the museum.

1924
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,620
Everyone, back to your positions.

1925
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:58,550
It's about time.

1926
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,570
(Danger High Voltage)

1927
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:08,570
Damn!

1928
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,050
Wait, Kiddo!

1929
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,550
(High Voltage  No Entry  Water Spraying
Sprinkling Strictly Prohibited)

1930
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,050
Damn it!

1931
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,870
What?

1932
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:33,570
Is it a power outage?

1933
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,400
It's fine.

1934
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,350
Switch to the auxiliary power supply at once!

1935
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:36,870
Yes, sir.

1936
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,520
Prioritize the monitor with the Sunflowers.

1937
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,520
I got it.

1938
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:42,920
Pulling it up on the monitor.

1939
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,950
It's fine.

1940
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,120
The Sunflowers are fine.

1941
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:47,970
Alright.

1942
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,820
Pull this monitor up too!

1943
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,720
We have information from Megure.

1944
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,420
Yes, sir!

1945
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:54,750
It's on!

1946
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,450
Goto,

1947
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:57,120
what just happened?

1948
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,600
There's trouble in the electrical control room.

1949
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,700
Lighting, main elevator,

1950
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,170
and the surveillance cameras had stopped functioning.

1951
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,120
I'll tighten

1952
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,300
the security on the second and fifth piece immediately.

1953
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,270
That Kiddo...

1954
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,250
He stayed inside the museum after all.

1955
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,900
No. This might not

1956
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,700
be Kiddo's handiwork.

1957
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,450
What do you mean?

1958
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,550
After re-investigating the Seven Samurai,

1959
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,870
a suspicious person has emerged.

1960
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:22,900
What?

1961
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:23,750
No way!

1962
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,620
In Arles, France, where van Gogh was said to have

1963
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,000
painted seven pieces of the Sunflowers,

1964
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,470
is also where this person's twin brother

1965
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,150
(Seven Samurai Investigation Files)
has passed away half year ago.

1966
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,550
The police at the scene found a gunshot wound to the chest

1967
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,300
and detected gunpowder residue on his right hand.

1968
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:40,150
They concluded the case as a suicide.

1969
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,770
And who was this person?

1970
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,100
Koichi Azuma.

1971
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,570
Did you say Azuma?

1972
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,520
Yes, he's the older brother of Koji Azuma,

1973
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:51,300
the person in charge of art restoration!

1974
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,650
It wasn't a suicide.

1975
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,300
I killed Koichi.

1976
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:54,970
Over there!

1977
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,800
Look at the monitor with the Sunflowers!

1978
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,770
At the monitor with the second piece!

1979
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,050
Azuma!

1980
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,920
Why?

1981
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,950
He was your brother!

1982
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,520
Koichi-niisan had

1983
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,270
a change of heart after we finally found

1984
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,550
the Ashiya Sunflowers.

1985
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,550
They found the Ashiya Sunflowers?

1986
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,050
What are you talking about?

1987
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,650
That Sunflowers was destroyed in a fire

1988
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,150
during the war.

1989
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:16,700
No.

1990
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,320
That's historically untrue.

1991
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,400
That day...

1992
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,270
The day Ashiya got raided by air,

1993
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:23,470
the city was burning in a sea of fire

1994
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,670
like the very depiction of hell.

1995
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,570
Apparently, my grandfather who was

1996
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,020
hired as the carpenter by the businessman

1997
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,900
who purchased the Sunflower,

1998
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,520
ran into the burning mansion alone to rescue

1999
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,670
the painting that

2000
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,370
had been firmly fixed to the wall

2001
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:38,670
to prevent theft.

2002
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,970
Azuma-san!

2003
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:09,950
Miss!

2004
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,500
Azuma-san!

2005
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,350
What are you-

2006
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,170
Don't come!

2007
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,770
No...

2008
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:20,720
Miss!

2009
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,300
I'm leaving the Sunflowers to you!

2010
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,550
No, Azuma-san!

2011
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,520
Watch out!

2012
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,500
Miss, we have to get out!

2013
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,400
No! Azuma-san!

2014
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,320
Even if we lose this war,

2015
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,420
I will never let anyone

2016
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,650
take that Sunflowers away!

2017
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,500
Azuma-san!

2018
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,000
Azuma-san!

2019
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,700
Miss!

2020
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:42,870
Please hurry!

2021
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:47,350
Next time...

2022
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,320
in Japan...

2023
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,620
just like what Mushanokoji-sensei had said...

2024
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,500
in an art gallery...

2025
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,520
show the entire world...

2026
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,050
that Sunflowers.

2027
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,400
Our father had always told us this story.

2028
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,620
After our father died,

2029
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,320
we kept looking for the Ashiya Sunflowers,

2030
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,050
with only the words of the servant who

2031
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,500
took the painting from my grandfather's hands.

2032
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,250
The words of the servant?

2033
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:25,020
According to him, he faked the painting

2034
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,070
to avoid confiscation by the GHQ,

2035
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,570
and sent it away to Europe.

2036
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,770
I-It can't be...

2037
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:32,920
The Sunflowers I purchased

2038
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,270
is the Ashiya Sunflowers!

2039
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,350
It didn't get burned!

2040
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,500
Yes. The two of us

2041
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,020
finally tracked it down.

2042
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:41,620
(Experts Gather in Front of a House,
Overlooking Sunflowers in Arles, France)

2043
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,650
(I finally found this old house at the outskirts of this commune.)
We found the Ashiya Sunflowers

2044
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:44,950
(A painting by van Gogh (1850~90) was found in Arles, France.)
hidden under the roof

2045
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,520
(According to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands,)
of an old house.

2046
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:46,550
(The appraisal is being conducted. Directors of both museums
are convinced that it is authentic.)

2047
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,770
(The appraisal is being conducted.
Directors of both museums are convinced that it is authentic.)

2048
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,450
But...

2049
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,000
Because we've spent so many years searching for the Sunflowers,

2050
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,870
my brother had a change of heart.

2051
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:57,370
He said the Sunflowers should

2052
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:58,970
remain in this land of Arles

2053
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
that van Gogh loved.

2054
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,400
Otherwise,

2055
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:03,320
he'd die here.

2056
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,700
I couldn't forgive my brother

2057
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,750
for betraying the wish of

2058
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,450
our father and grandfather.

2059
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:09,770
We quarreled

2060
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,050
and as we were fighting,

2061
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,520
the gun was accidentally discharged.

2062
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,100
I killed my brother.

2063
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,120
Nii-san...

2064
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,370
I-I...

2065
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,070
Run.

2066
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,900
Nii-san!

2067
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,600
You have to run!

2068
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:41,600
But...!

2069
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,550
Just go!

2070
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:08,520
And then...

2071
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,770
When I found out about the Japan Marveled
by Sunflowers Exhibition,

2072
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,820
I joined as a curator.

2073
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,920
Thanks to this, I got to witness

2074
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,270
the moment the Ashiya Sunflowers

2075
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,570
returned to Japan.

2076
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,200
The wish handed down from my grandfather's
generation has come true.

2077
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:25,600
That's why, after this exhibition is over,

2078
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,870
I intend to turn myself in.

2079
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,170
But things sped up.

2080
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,100
I understand.

2081
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,600
Megure from the MPD is heading here right now.

2082
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:37,350
You will turn yourself in, correct?

2083
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:39,220
Yes, of course.

2084
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:42,550
But I'm not the suspicious person you're looking for!

2085
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,850
What are you saying now?

2086
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:45,970
Hey!

2087
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,100
The sunflowers are burning!

2088
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,020
Don't try to fool us!

2089
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,420
It's really burning!

2090
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,020
Oh no! It's a fire!

2091
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,970
Put it out, hurry!

2092
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:53,700
Hey!

2093
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:54,920
What's going on?

2094
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,370
What about the heat sensors in the sunflowers?

2095
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,200
(Room Temperature Rising)
It is showing an abnormal number!

2096
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,900
It looks like...

2097
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:01,220
a fire has really occurred!

2098
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,820
(Disaster Prevention System Down)
Can it be extinguished?

2099
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,650
Negative.

2100
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,050
The Disaster Prevention System is down!

2101
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,770
Then, we have no other choice.

2102
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:08,900
All of you, pull out!

2103
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,670
Goto, leave the surface bulwark open.

2104
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,250
Yes, sir!

2105
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
Let's go! Follow me, everyone!

2106
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:15,620
Conan-kun, come on!

2107
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:16,520
O-Okay!

2108
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,900
Hurry up, Mister!

2109
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,400
The fire is spreading here!

2110
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,120
I know, just a bit more!

2111
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,670
(Emergency Escape) (Emergency Escape) (Emergency Escape)
Alright! Let's go, boy!

2112
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,000
Come on, hurry!

2113
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,870
This way, everyone!

2114
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,620
Forget it! Just get on!

2115
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,620
Conan-kun, hurry!

2116
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,550
Is everyone not hurt?

2117
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,520
Yes, we're all alright.

2118
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,070
Conan-kun, are you alright?

2119
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:47,400
Yeah. But more importantly,

2120
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,020
are the Sunflowers safe?

2121
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:50,000
Don't worry.

2122
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,420
The program is working normally.

2123
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,870
But the second and fifth piece are...

2124
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,200
No need to worry, boy.

2125
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,970
No. I didn't see it wrongly.

2126
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:03,420
I'm sure there were two left!

2127
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,300
If I don't do something soon,

2128
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,370
the second and fifth Sunflowers will be burnt!

2129
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,920
Just what is...

2130
01:24:19,950 --> 01:24:21,350
Just get us down!

2131
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:22,100
Yes, sir!

2132
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,170
According to Inspector Nakamori's instruction,

2133
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:26,220
he will bring Azuma to the back door.

2134
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,600
Over here!

2135
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,350
Hurry!

2136
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,820
I've taken Azuma into custody from Inspector Charlie!

2137
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:46,270
But what on earth has happened here?

2138
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:47,620
A fire broke out!

2139
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,120
I'm sorry but I need you to help lead
the evacuation from the air.

2140
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:50,970
Understood!

2141
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,520
We'll be leading too!

2142
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,350
Of course!

2143
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,170
Huh? Conan-kun?

2144
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,120
It can't be...

2145
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,220
Damn it!

2146
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,170
This is bad!

2147
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,500
If I don't hurry up...

2148
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,450
It won't be just the Sunflowers but me too!

2149
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:10,120
Kiddo!

2150
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,620
You!

2151
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,070
Did you come back?

2152
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,720
More importantly, what about the other one?

2153
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,200
Is the fifth Sunflowers safe?

2154
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:18,100
Yeah!

2155
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,420
The stopper over there came off easily

2156
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,970
but the one here got stuck at an odd angle.

2157
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,450
If we don't get it out, the paint will melt!

2158
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:26,520
Out of the way, Kiddo!

2159
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:28,770
Stop it, you idiot!

2160
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It's the Sunflowers, you know?

2161
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:32,070
It is humanity's treasure, you know?

2162
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:40,130
Did it work?

2163
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,800
You were aiming for me, weren't you?

2164
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,420
This isn't the time for that!

2165
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,220
It's no use.

2166
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,850
Damn it!

2167
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,070
Just how sturdy did that old man built this?

2168
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:52,350
Conan-kun!

2169
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:55,950
Shinichi!

2170
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,800
It was really you, after all!

2171
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:58,770
Hey!

2172
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,870
Are you listening?

2173
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,920
It's going to get dangerous if we don't get out soon!

2174
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,100
- Ran-neechan!
- Ran!

2175
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,100
- Help us!
- Help us!

2176
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:06,850
What do you mean?

2177
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,620
The Sunflowers got stuck!

2178
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,900
To get it out,

2179
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,300
we need to break the wall!

2180
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,770
I can't possibly do that!

2181
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,070
You can do it!

2182
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,600
Okay. I'll try.

2183
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:18,820
Stand back, Shinichi.

2184
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,370
Conan-kun, you too.

2185
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:21,120
Okay.

2186
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,470
Please work!

2187
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:26,720
Ran!

2188
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,050
I did it!

2189
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,870
Alright! Let's get out-

2190
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:46,800
Hey, Ran!

2191
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,900
Cut it out!

2192
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,400
What should we do now? The corridor is...

2193
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,350
It'll be fine. Stay behind me.

2194
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,520
O-Okay.

2195
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,970
Jii-chan, can you hear me?

2196
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,550
Calm down. Don't panic.

2197
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,750
Understood.

2198
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,800
Ran.

2199
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:26,700
Hold on tight.

2200
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,420
Don't let go, alright?

2201
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,220
You can't mean!

2202
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,000
W-What's going on?

2203
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,100
It looks like the water

2204
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,320
from the tank is gushing out!

2205
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:58,600
Doesn't that mean

2206
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,520
the fire will be extinguished?

2207
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,270
Hey! Where's Conan?

2208
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,850
Huh? He's not here?

2209
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,450
Isn't he with you?

2210
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,570
Ran is not here too!

2211
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,470
Where's Ran?

2212
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,620
Those kids!

2213
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:12,650
Where have they gone at such a chaotic time?

2214
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,820
I thought

2215
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,350
they were right behind me until a moment ago.

2216
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,100
I can't get through to her phone.

2217
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:18,200
Uncle Kogoro,

2218
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
they might have gone down first.

2219
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,950
I'll go look for them!

2220
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:22,950
Alright, thanks!

2221
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,970
Let's go too!

2222
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,120
- Okay!
- Yeah!

2223
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,000
Kudo-kun, you can't be...

2224
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,620
Are you okay, detective?

2225
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:38,800
Forget about me. How's Ran?

2226
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,520
Ran! Wake up!

2227
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,620
She's alright.

2228
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,100
She fainted after being underwater for a while.

2229
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,700
Hey, look!

2230
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,020
The water flow is tapering off.

2231
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:55,570
All the water from the tank must have flowed out.

2232
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,550
Oh!

2233
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:58,650
I'm worried for the Sunflowers. Let's go!

2234
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:03,220
Did you

2235
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,020
already know what the culprit is up to?

2236
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,300
Yeah.

2237
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,070
If the sunflowers along the corridor become a fuse for fire,

2238
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:11,800
then the tube road will have to be inundated with water.

2239
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,050
Then that means...

2240
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:17,020
the culprit is the one who suggested
for the tube road to be filled with sunflowers.

2241
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,300
Yeah!

2242
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:20,750
You finally know who the culprit is.

2243
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,920
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2244
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,620
Hey!

2245
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,670
How do you plan on getting out?

2246
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,900
If we keep climbing up along this tube road

2247
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,150
and get to the topmost floor near the exit,

2248
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,770
maybe we can get out through the elevator shaft.

2249
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,200
How did you actually plan on doing it?

2250
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:36,950
Hm?

2251
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,050
Your escape!

2252
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,570
I'm sure you must have already gotten that planned.

2253
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:45,300
If I can fly to the exit I've prepared
at the back of this limestone cave,

2254
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,000
then I'll get outside in a jiffy.

2255
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,020
But if I have to carry this missy and you,

2256
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,820
then I probably can't make it there.

2257
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,020
Kiddo...

2258
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,900
Anyway...

2259
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,670
If you already knew what the culprit is planning,

2260
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:57,050
why didn't you prevent it?

2261
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,750
I knew about the plan

2262
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:02,120
because I stole it from the culprit's computer

2263
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,650
but they could have had accomplices.

2264
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:06,920
I planned to stop them from causing a power outage

2265
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,700
but Detective Charlie found me

2266
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,720
and chased me around.

2267
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:14,120
I thought it might be solved much sooner

2268
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,220
if I were to

2269
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,420
send an enigmatic warning to a certain someone, though.

2270
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,850
I'm sorry, alright!

2271
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,520
Give me a minute.

2272
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,100
I'll get our escape route ready.

2273
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,420
I'll check if we can get out through

2274
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,950
the elevator hall up ahead.

2275
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,550
In the meantime,

2276
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:33,300
you go catch the culprit.

2277
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:34,200
I got it.

2278
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,400
I'll be in trouble if you let them pull

2279
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:38,600
another dirty trick.

2280
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:42,770
Yeah.

2281
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,020
Well then, I'll leave that to you.

2282
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,700
Shinichi...

2283
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,820
Hang on, Ran.

2284
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,800
This is bad.

2285
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,550
Because it took too long to extinguish the fire,

2286
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,200
the air pressure within the cave is unexpectedly getting lower!

2287
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,450
This place will collapse if we don't get out soon!

2288
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,120
The door is opening.

2289
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,470
Please watch your step.

2290
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:14,100
The door is opening.

2291
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,200
Please watch your step.

2292
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,900
Good! The Sunflowers are safe!

2293
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

2294
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:23,870
This is odd!

2295
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:25,250
There are only six pieces!

2296
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,300
What did you say?

2297
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,070
You're right!

2298
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,550
There's one piece missing!

2299
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:30,270
What is going on?

2300
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,300
(Verified)

2301
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,050
It's the second Sunflowers.

2302
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,400
The Ashiya Sunflowers didn't get sent here.

2303
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:42,450
Why?

2304
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,850
Why is it only the Ashiya Sunflowers?

2305
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,150
Please don't worry.

2306
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:47,350
That voice is...

2307
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,970
Shinichi Kudo?

2308
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:50,050
Yes.

2309
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,050
The Ashiya Sunflowers got stored inside

2310
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:54,320
the fireproof and waterproof case a moment ago.

2311
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,070
It's you again!

2312
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,700
You're always butting in!

2313
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,270
Well, please listen to what I have to say.

2314
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,420
The person whom everyone had assumed

2315
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,570
to be the traitor

2316
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:05,470
had protected the fifth Sunflowers

2317
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,900
and the Ashiya Sunflowers from Judas.

2318
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:11,120
So there is a traitor among us.

2319
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,220
Yes.

2320
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,750
But it's alright now.

2321
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,750
I already know who Judas is.

2322
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,320
We've already taken Koji Azuma into custody.

2323
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:19,950
You're wrong.

2324
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,600
Azuma-san isn't the traitor.

2325
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,520
He has a point.

2326
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,020
Koji Azuma has

2327
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,770
no motive to burn

2328
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:28,750
the second Sunflowers.

2329
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,250
Besides, when the sunflowers started burning,

2330
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:34,170
he was engaged in a conversation with all of you.

2331
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:36,050
Well, that's true but...

2332
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,450
There can't be

2333
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,300
a traitor among us here!

2334
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,120
Yes.

2335
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:43,270
We're all comrades who had done
our best to protect the Sunflowers.

2336
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:44,220
He's right.

2337
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,220
The one who implied that there's a traitor was

2338
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,300
Kaito Kiddo.

2339
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,200
It's silly to even believe in

2340
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,450
that burglar's words.

2341
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:52,870
That's right.

2342
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,100
I think we should be happy that

2343
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,570
the Sunflowers are safe.

2344
01:32:56,570 --> 01:32:57,970
Are you sure about that,

2345
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,650
Natsumi Miyadai-san?

2346
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,450
Even though you started the fire.

2347
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,920
What are you talking about?

2348
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,750
Your aim was

2349
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,900
to burn the Ashiya Sunflowers

2350
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,320
and the fifth Sunflowers.

2351
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:11,850
You were aiming to

2352
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,520
destroy these two pieces of the Sunflowers

2353
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,350
from the very beginning.

2354
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:17,020
Stop saying such nonsense!

2355
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:19,100
Why would I do something like that?

2356
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,300
Alright then.

2357
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,150
Let's go over everything, one by one.

2358
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,070
After Kaito Kiddo went wild at the auction site,

2359
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,000
the security got tightened

2360
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,270
and you couldn't

2361
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:32,020
lay your hands on the Sunflowers.

2362
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:34,950
So you gave up on destroying it in the US

2363
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,200
and attempt again during its flight to Japan.

2364
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,950
You bribed a worker

2365
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,070
and planted a bomb

2366
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:42,870
near the door of the hangar.

2367
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,450
But this was also foiled by Kiddo.

2368
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,000
So you switched

2369
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,500
your target from the second

2370
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,820
to the fifth piece of the Sunflowers.

2371
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,420
Kiddo caught on to that early

2372
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,970
and sent a warning to Detective Mouri,

2373
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,970
(Tonight, "Left of La Berceuse" will be mine. Kaito Kiddo)
putting everyone on the alert again.

2374
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,470
Since your plans have been foiled twice,

2375
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,770
this time you tried to stay one step ahead of Kiddo

2376
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,250
by planting a fake Kiddo card under the wooden lid

2377
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,620
that was being used to transport the painting

2378
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,120
so you could request it

2379
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,740
(I've already taken the Sunflowers. Kaito Kiddo)
to be sent to your atelier.

2380
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,400
So you're saying that Kiddo played the villain

2381
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:16,170
to protect the Sunflowers?

2382
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,270
That's a lie!

2383
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,520
That's just your imagination speaking!

2384
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,770
That's right.

2385
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,750
Natsumi loves van Gogh's Sunflowers

2386
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:23,950
more than anyone else,

2387
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,070
there's no way she'd do something like that!

2388
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,050
Yes. Besides,

2389
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:30,270
why would she want to destroy just two of the pieces?

2390
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,670
You have a point.

2391
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:34,770
I still don't know why she wants to only destroy that

2392
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:35,870
two pieces of the Sunflowers.

2393
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,820
You're just a detective wannabe.

2394
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:38,500
Well,

2395
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:40,620
we can leave asking Natsumi-san herself

2396
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,820
for the reason later.

2397
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,870
Let's get to the main point.

2398
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,270
Natsumi-san,

2399
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:47,250
I heard you're the one

2400
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,270
who suggested decorating

2401
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:50,620
Lake Rock's tube road with sunflowers.

2402
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:52,050
Is that true?

2403
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,000
Y-Yes.

2404
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,020
You took advantage of your position as an appraiser

2405
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,250
and poured turpentine oil,

2406
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,070
that was often used in art restoration,

2407
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,420
into the groove

2408
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:02,750
of the sunflowers from the highest floor

2409
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,000
and used it a fuse.

2410
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:07,970
That's just because the traitor

2411
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,620
took advantage of my idea.

2412
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:12,570
Don't treat me like a criminal

2413
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,770
over something so trivial!

2414
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:16,470
I see...

2415
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:19,150
I really wanted you to turn yourself in

2416
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,670
but if you want more concrete evidence,

2417
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,120
I'll show it to you later.

2418
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,300
It's the plan to destroy

2419
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,570
the two pieces of the Sunflowers found on your computer.

2420
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,670
Looks like...

2421
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,470
there's no point in hiding it now.

2422
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,820
You joined my team in order to destroy

2423
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:40,570
the fifth Sunflowers and the Ashiya Sunflowers.

2424
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,570
Is that correct?

2425
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:43,700
That's right.

2426
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,750
But things didn't go

2427
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,170
as well as I had planned

2428
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:49,450
because of that nuisance, Kaito Kiddo.

2429
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,000
So you started a fire in Lake Rock,

2430
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,250
where it'd be difficult for Kiddo to intervene,

2431
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:57,020
and attempted to burn both the Sunflowers.

2432
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:58,520
Yes.

2433
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,920
But I didn't plan on turning this into such a big mess.

2434
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:04,100
The plan was to make use of the power outage

2435
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:05,270
to deal with the Ashiya Sunflowers

2436
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:07,170
and the fifth Sunflowers.

2437
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:09,750
That was supposed to be the end of it.

2438
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,770
But right after Kiddo,

2439
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:13,320
the men in black got in the way.

2440
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,200
I'll tighten the security on the second

2441
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,450
and fifth piece immediately.

2442
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,300
But how did you plan on destroying the Sunflowers?

2443
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,720
If you touched it,

2444
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,170
the safety device will be activated.

2445
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,050
That's easy!

2446
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,950
I just have to splash it with the phosphine I carried with me.

2447
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,470
Phosphine?

2448
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:31,220
It's a dangerous chemical that could spontaneously combust

2449
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,650
even at room temperature.

2450
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,000
So, you were the one

2451
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,120
who tried to kill me?

2452
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,170
I see!

2453
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:38,900
If the organizer is dead,

2454
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,100
the opening will be delayed.

2455
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:43,570
Even the exhibition itself could get canceled.

2456
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,900
But, why?

2457
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,900
This fire and that explosion on the airplane...

2458
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,050
If things went wrong,

2459
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,250
you would've ended up dead too!

2460
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,050
Natsumi!

2461
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,370
That's...

2462
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:57,670
That's just how much I love van Gogh's Sunflowers!

2463
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,250
I'd rather die than

2464
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,100
let those two forgeries be displayed

2465
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,770
alongside van Gogh's Sunflowers!

2466
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,270
There's no truth in what you've just said.

2467
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,670
The fifth Sunflowers

2468
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:12,450
has been proven to be authentic in an article

2469
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,570
by the Art Institute of Chicago and Van Gogh Museum!

2470
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,100
Van Gogh and Gauguin

2471
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,400
split a canvas between them for their paintings.

2472
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,570
That's more than enough proof.

2473
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,450
Since you're an appraiser,

2474
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:25,250
you should've already known this.

2475
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,320
B-But...

2476
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:27,770
Additionally,

2477
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,050
even though you said you'd rather die,

2478
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:33,020
you only blew up the airplane right before landing.

2479
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,550
And in this fire,

2480
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:38,700
you've already determined the best time and place
to escape before starting the fire.

2481
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,120
T-That's...

2482
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,450
If you had really intended to die,

2483
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,070
then why didn't you stay in Lake Rock

2484
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:46,000
and stop Kiddo from putting out the fire?

2485
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,020
In the end,

2486
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:49,870
you're just another criminal

2487
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:51,900
who thinks of nothing but yourself!

2488
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:54,570
You're not a curator at all.

2489
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,850
Who could've thought it was you?

2490
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,670
Give me your hands.

2491
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,550
She loves van Gogh's painting so much that

2492
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,600
she believed in her own prejudice than the truth of the appraisal

2493
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,850
and dyed her hands in crime.

2494
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,220
Looks like that's all done and over with.

2495
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:12,720
Yeah. What about you?

2496
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,650
Can we climb up?

2497
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,350
Only if I climb alone.

2498
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,070
What should we do?

2499
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,500
Should we call for help?

2500
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,150
I think we'd better not.

2501
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,550
If we're not careful about it,

2502
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:22,100
this could turn into a secondary disaster.

2503
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,150
Crap!

2504
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:27,920
Are you okay?

2505
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,350
Yeah! More importantly, how long do you think
this place can hold out?

2506
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,870
It's already a miracle that

2507
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:32,970
this place hasn't collapsed yet.

2508
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:34,820
If there's even a tiny hole in the ceiling,

2509
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:37,100
this place will collapse from the air gushing in all at once!

2510
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:38,020
Kiddo!

2511
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,320
Can you fly if you only take Ran along?

2512
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,870
Hey, don't be stupid!

2513
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:43,400
Can you fly or not?

2514
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,320
Which is it?

2515
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,320
Tell me!

2516
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,200
I probably can.

2517
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:50,850
But I can't be sure that I can keep flying

2518
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,950
while avoiding the falling rocks in a space

2519
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,100
where the air pressure keeps dropping.

2520
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,750
RAN!

2521
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,900
Kiddo!

2522
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,350
Get Ran to safety!

2523
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,720
Damn it!

2524
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:30,470
That was not cool!

2525
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,750
There must be another way to escape.

2526
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,670
This body of a child can...

2527
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:53,750
Damn it!

2528
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,350
At this rate, I'll definitely fall!

2529
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,100
Where's the exit?

2530
01:39:58,870 --> 01:39:59,720
Is that it?

2531
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:07,870
Go!

2532
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,400
This body

2533
01:40:10,450 --> 01:40:12,650
should be able to fit into the Sunflowers' emergency chute.

2534
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:18,220
Damn it!

2535
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,400
The Ashiya Sunflowers!

2536
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:36,750
No way!

2537
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:37,900
The water tower!

2538
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,950
We need to find the two of them!

2539
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,350
This looks bad!

2540
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,670
Look!

2541
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,720
He can't be...

2542
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:51,970
...still inside, right?

2543
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,120
That was so close!

2544
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,070
We escaped by a hair's breadth!

2545
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:03,700
Shinichi!

2546
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,270
You came to save me, didn't you?

2547
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:08,970
Yeah. It's alright now.

2548
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,250
Okay.

2549
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,250
Where are you going?

2550
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,020
Haibara-san!

2551
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,920
Kiddo and Ran-san are flying there!

2552
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:20,750
For real?

2553
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,850
Let's go take a look!

2554
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:23,370
Sonoko-neesan!

2555
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:26,300
Ran-neesan and Kiddo are flying there!

2556
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,900
- Ran and Kiddo-sama?
- Where?

2557
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,270
Did she say Kiddo?

2558
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:34,900
Damn it. Not this way?

2559
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,300
There's no other exit now.

2560
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:38,800
At this rate,

2561
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,700
it's going to be a double suicide with the Ashiya Sunflowers.

2562
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:00,050
No way.

2563
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:08,270
You managed to get out, right?

2564
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:09,800
Detective.

2565
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:15,300
- Ran!
- Ran-neesan!

2566
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,120
Ran! Where are you, Ran?

2567
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,850
Ran! Are you alright?

2568
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,600
Dad.

2569
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,420
Ran! Are you hurt?

2570
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:33,320
Are you okay?

2571
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:34,750
Yeah.

2572
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:36,820
Shinichi saved me.

2573
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:37,420
What?

2574
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,750
You're wrong.

2575
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,620
It was Kiddo who saved you.

2576
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,800
His glider went whoosh!

2577
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,370
Don't you remember?

2578
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,600
That's right, I...

2579
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,370
Then...

2580
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:51,270
That wasn't Shinichi but Kiddo...

2581
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:52,350
Anyway,

2582
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,470
what about the kid?

2583
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,400
Where is he?

2584
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,520
What? Conan-kun isn't here?

2585
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,050
Yes. You were the only one

2586
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,150
Kiddo was carrying.

2587
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:01,220
It can't be!

2588
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,700
Then... Conan-kun is still...

2589
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:09,450
What? No way!

2590
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,520
Oh no!

2591
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,650
Damn it!

2592
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:20,450
At this rate,

2593
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:21,520
I'd drown in less than a minute

2594
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,000
before I find the exit!

2595
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,100
If I kick the ball

2596
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,870
I might be able to move this away,

2597
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:29,550
but that won't prevent this place from getting submerged.

2598
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:30,950
That's it!

2599
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:31,970
The water!

2600
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,850
The fact that this much water is surging in,

2601
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:37,820
that means this place has a lower water level

2602
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:38,800
than the lake!

2603
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:40,000
And that means...

2604
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:42,270
If I can mess with the way this place is collapsing

2605
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:43,200
with the fireworks ball,

2606
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,570
the balance in pressure will collapse

2607
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,250
and it will all...

2608
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,600
be swept towards the lake!

2609
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,550
Alright, I'm free!

2610
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,070
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0!

2611
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,150
- Conan-kun!
- Conan!

2612
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:13,700
What are you doing, Conan?

2613
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,520
Please come out!

2614
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:17,920
Damn it! What is he doing?

2615
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,420
Conan!

2616
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,020
He'll be fine.

2617
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:25,050
If it's Conan-kun, I'm sure he's...

2618
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:28,350
Please...

2619
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,670
Come out...

2620
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:31,420
Conan-kun...

2621
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,900
Just a bit more.

2622
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,520
Just a little bit more...

2623
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:53,270
Something's coming up!

2624
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,400
It's the Sunflowers!

2625
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,620
It's safe!

2626
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,720
That's the Sunflowers

2627
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:00,800
that Conan-kun and I help

2628
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,270
put into the case!

2629
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,070
So I'm sure Conan-kun must be nearby!

2630
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:06,220
Everyone,

2631
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:07,670
look for Conan-kun!

2632
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:10,370
Conan-kun, where are you?

2633
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:12,100
Conan-kun!

2634
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:15,400
Conan-kun!

2635
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:20,720
Ran...

2636
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:26,620
Something's floating up again!

2637
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,150
He's right!

2638
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,420
Behind the painting!

2639
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,300
Where?

2640
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:40,470
Alright, wait right there!

2641
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:41,750
I'm so relieved.

2642
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,770
Uncle Kogoro, are you okay?

2643
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,720
Conan-kun!

2644
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,700
Well done, squirt!

2645
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,450
That's my Kiddo Killer!

2646
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:53,870
Are you alright, kid?

2647
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,720
Yeah.

2648
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,570
You did great protecting the Sunflowers.

2649
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:57,800
What a feat!

2650
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:02,120
He's always stealing the best parts.

2651
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:05,070
There are still things I don't understand.

2652
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,720
Care to explain?

2653
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,650
How did you know who the culprit was from the beginning?

2654
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:12,970
I got a request via voice message.

2655
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:17,320
It said to steal the second and fifth Sunflowers.

2656
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,170
I see.

2657
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:20,600
For someone who is an expert in disguise,

2658
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,620
you must have immediately recognized

2659
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,200
the owner of the voice

2660
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:24,920
as soon as you hear it again.

2661
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:28,770
But why did you have to interfere with the culprit's plan?

2662
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:31,070
What benefit does that bring you?

2663
01:46:31,570 --> 01:46:32,970
I want to show

2664
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,800
the Ashiya Sunflowers to someone.

2665
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:36,250
Show it to someone?

2666
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,720
That day...

2667
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:39,950
When everything was in flames after an air raid,

2668
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:44,100
there was a woman to whom the carpenter
had entrusted the Sunflowers.

2669
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,720
She was secretly in love with him and

2670
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,600
watched him perished in the fire with her own eyes.

2671
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,170
How did you know such an old story?

2672
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,870
I heard all about it from the man

2673
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:54,750
who was right there with them.

2674
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:56,720
He was a student

2675
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,850
living in the mansion as a servant.

2676
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:02,850
This was a request

2677
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,350
from that man who saved

2678
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:06,750
his first love from the sea of fire.

2679
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:10,870
It was him who wanted to show her the Sunflowers.

2680
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,720
I see.

2681
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:16,970
Then that explained everything.

2682
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:18,470
Are you sure?

2683
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:19,870
Don't you want to catch me?

2684
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,350
I'll let you go this time.

2685
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:25,550
Someone like you can never dream of

2686
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,570
catching me.

2687
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:29,600
I'm only overlooking this

2688
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:32,200
for the sake of your client

2689
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,070
who treasured his sorrowful feelings of love.

2690
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:37,850
I was wrong about you,

2691
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:38,970
Inspector Charlie.

2692
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:41,470
As was I.

2693
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,020
Not here!

2694
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:49,820
Not here!

2695
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:50,570
Not here!

2696
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:51,650
Where is it?

2697
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,970
Where has it gone?

2698
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,650
Since I can't find it after looking everywhere,

2699
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:58,220
it must have been stolen by someone!

2700
01:51:58,450 --> 01:51:59,470
Who is it?

2701
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:02,070
Who stole my ticket?

2702
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:04,500
Aren't you going to tell him that it's canceled?

2703
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,000
He'll find out when he watches the news.

2704
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:09,170
Hey, that's just rude.

2705
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:11,100
Apparently, I'll have regrets

2706
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,600
if I keep looking at you.

2707
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,220
What's that?

2708
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,770
That's an advice I got from someone.

2709
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:19,470
Let me just see the ticket!

2710
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,700
Ticket!

2711

(Detective Conan)

2712
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:43,150
Kir, Bourbon.

2713
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:45,120
You can't be...
