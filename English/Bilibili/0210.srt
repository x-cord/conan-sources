1
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.140
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.140
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.840
A mysterious separate building on the legendary pond.

4
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.740
The windmill turns as the water changes color.

5
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.599
Mr. Mouri? You mean that renowned detective?

9
00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.599
Yes, well...

10
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.399
I got a notice from Mr. Shiro Suzuki of the Suzuki financial group

11
00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.299
that someone else would be attending in his place,

12
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.299
but I had no idea that it would be you.

13
00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.699
Don't be too hard on me, please.

14
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.999
Just as expected from the master of the tea ceremony.

15
00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.299
What a splendid house!

16
00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.999
A tea ceremony, what a drag.

17
00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.299
I wonder why I came along.

18
00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.599
Conan, let's go.

19
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.199
Okay.

20
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.499
I guess I'll have to go through with it.

21
00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.799
"The Legend Of The Five Colored Water Palace (Part 1)"

22
00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.699
How beautiful! Fantastic!

23
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.399
What a terrific scenic view it is!

24
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.899
How wondrous for it to be glowing golden.

25
00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.199
You can say that again.

26
00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.599
Is this the first time you've seen a pond?

27
00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.199
At this time of year, depending on the angle of the sun,

28
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.899
the surface of the water changes into five different colors.

29
00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.199
I see.

30
00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.499
So that's why your home

31
00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.899
is called the "Five Colored Water Palace".

32
00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:12.999
That's right.

33
00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.899
By the way, may I ask what your names are?

34
00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:16.999
Oh, how rude of me.

35
00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.699
They are the master's disciples.

36
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.599
"Morio Yakura (42)" -This is Mr. Yakura, an antique dealer,

37
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.699
"Yukari Mimura (33)" -And she is a company owner, Ms. Mimura.

38
00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.799
Hello.

39
00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.399
He is the renowned detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri and his family.

40
00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.099
You mean that famous detective?

41
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.899
What an honor.

42
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.099
"Yoshiko Hanasaki (40)" -Now that you are all here,

43
00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.699
I will go and inform the master.

44
00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.699
Master?

45
00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.899
The master of the tea ceremony.

46
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.399
How interesting.

47
00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:53.599
I wonder what sort of reception

48
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.799
the finicky master is going to give Mr. Renowned Detective?

49
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.599
That's why I didn't want to come here in his place.

50
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.999
I'm sorry, but Sonoko pleaded with me.

51
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.799
Huh? It's the maid.

52
00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.599
Which means that the master is there.

53
00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.599
Is that building in the middle of the pond the tea room?

54
00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.599
Huh? Oh, I guess so.

55
00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.199
The solemn atmosphere is just fantastic!

56
00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.099
It is indeed the world of "Wabi Sabi"!

57
00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.699
I'm sure that's the tea room!

58
00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.199
Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.099
It is called the "Five Colored Retreat"

60
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.599
because it is built on top of the pond that changes color.

61
00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.799
It was built to get away from worldly affairs

62
00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:42.299
as well as to forget about time.

63
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:44.299
It's called the "Five Colored Retreat"?

64
00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.499
What a wonderful tea room.

65
00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.199
Hello, Ryoichi.

66
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.899
He is the master's son.

67
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:52.599
"Ryoichi Aonogi (28)" -Mr. Mouri.

68
00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:53.999
Thank you for coming all this way.

69
00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.399
Oh, you've already heard about him?

70
00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.199
While you're at it,

71
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.099
why don't you tell him about the monster story, too?

72
00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.299
Monster? What is that about?

73
00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:08.499
Well, it is what you would call a superstition regarding this pond.

74
00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:11.499
No, let's not talk about it.

75
00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.499
I just came to say hello, so if you will excuse me.

76
00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.299
Good grief.

77
00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:24.499
Ms. Mimura, I think you gave Ryoichi a bad time.

78
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.699
Well, let me tell you about it

79
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.799
over some plain hot water over there.

80
00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.799
I hear it was towards the end of the Edo Period.

81
00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:39.099
This pond used to be filled with cold and clear spring water,

82
00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.599
and was much larger than it is now.

83
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.999
Now, a beautiful woman appears near the pond.

84
00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:51.999
She plays the flute and changes the color of the pond,

85
00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.999
entertaining all who come to see her.

86
00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.399
One day, a wealthy merchant fell for the woman.

87
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.699
He then built a house near the pond.

88
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.099
The woman married the man under one condition.

89
00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.299
She said, "The pond is mine, and no one shall set foot on it".

90
00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.899
However, the merchant breaks this promise,

91
00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:19.099
and builds the bedroom in the middle of the pond.

92
00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.099
Not only does he get angry at his wife

93
00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.699
who clings to him and pleads him to move the bedroom away,

94
00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.399
He kills her...

95
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.699
and sinks her body into the pond.

96
00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.699
One night, however, a large serpent appears from the pond

97
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.199
and attacks the merchant.

98
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.999
The serpent turns out to be the woman.

99
00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.499
She became the monster that resides in the pond.

100
00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.299
Although the merchant is badly wounded,

101
00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.699
he somehow makes it back to the bedroom.

102
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.499
Since there is a talisman for keeping away evil spirits

103
00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:54.699
was posted in the room,

104
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.599
he was no longer in danger of being attacked.

105
00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.199
However, the monster kept waiting day and night

106
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.999
for the merchant to come out.

107
00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.199
The merchant was exhausted beyond capacity.

108
00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.899
It is said to have hung himself in the building.

109
00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.799
It is still said today that the pond changes color

110
00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:22.199
because the monster changes into the figure of the woman

111
00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.899
and appears to blow the flute.

112
00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:29.199
To think that there is a story like that about the pond...

113
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.199
Everyone!

114
00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.999
Thank you very much for waiting.

115
00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.199
Please follow me to the tea room.

116
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.699
Huh? Isn't Ryoichi joining us?

117
00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.699
Although he is the master of the tea ceremony's son,

118
00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.599
he isn't the least bit interested on it.

119
00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:51.399
Oh, that sure is a problem.

120
00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:56.199
Anyway, I haven't said my greetings to the master yet.

121
00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.899
Please excuse the rudeness.

122
00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:04.299
The master rarely comes out recently.

123
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:09.299
He does not in particular, cross this bridge alone.

124
00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:19.899
Master, I've brought the guests.

125
00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.199
Master?

126
00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.099
Maybe the monster ate him up?

127
00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:32.499
Just what are you doing?

128
00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:34.099
Monster!

129
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.599
How rude of you to look inside like that!

130
00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:43.499
This is a sacred tea room, understand?

131
00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:47.699
Leave! Leave this tea room right this minute!

132
00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:50.399
Master, please calm down.

133
00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.999
He is our guest today, Mr. Mouri!

134
00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.099
What? A guest?

135
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:58.099
You mean that person who came on behalf of...

136
00:08:58.099 --> 00:09:00.599
Goodness.

137
00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:03.299
Huh? A windmill in a place like that?

138
00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:05.899
Excuse me, is that windmill there just for decoration?

139
00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.999
That's used to send water to the river in the garden.

140
00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:10.899
I hear it operates electrically now.

141
00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:13.999
A timer is set and it moves accordingly.

142
00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:16.899
It used to be famous as the water used for tea.

143
00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:18.499
But ever since this tea room was built,

144
00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:21.199
the amount of water decreased drastically.

145
00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:23.899
Ms. Mimura, the master will hear you.

146
00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:31.799
I'm sorry for my rudeness a while ago,

147
00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.499
in spite of you having come all this way.

148
00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:39.199
Thank you for spending your time here with me today.

149
00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:42.299
Thank you for inviting us over.

150
00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.499
Talismans for keeping away evil spirits.

151
00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:53.999
There are talismans posted everywhere.

152
00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:57.099
Is he afraid of the monster of the pond, after all?

153
00:09:57.099 --> 00:10:01.899
Master, did you already look at the object that I asked Ms. Hanasaki

154
00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.599
to hand over to you a while ago?

155
00:10:04.599 --> 00:10:05.699
Huh?

156
00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:06.999
It is an object that had been handed down for generations,

157
00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:10.699
and was given to me by a master ceramist from Kyushu.

158
00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.699
"Ryozo Aonogi (65)" -I'm surprised that you got hold a of it.

159
00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:14.699
Although it's simply expected of

160
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:16.899
one who runs a large scale business in antiques.

161
00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.699
I shall use that tea bowl

162
00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:21.899
during the tea ceremony to be held this evening.

163
00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.099
Thank you very much.

164
00:10:27.599 --> 00:10:30.299
That tea bowl is likely to be very fitting.

165
00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:33.399
It will add glamour to my last practice of the tea ceremony.

166
00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.799
What do you mean by "last"?

167
00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.399
Mr. Mouri, today we have some fish that is superb

168
00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.999
as a side dish to drinking sake

169
00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:45.099
that we would like for you to taste.

170
00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:46.699
Okay...

171
00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:49.599
Ms. Hanasaki, will you warm up the sake for us?

172
00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:51.099
-Master! -Master!

173
00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:53.699
Master.

174
00:10:53.699 --> 00:10:55.899
Final tea ceremony?

175
00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:57.399
Just what does he mean?

176
00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:13.099
My feet are numb!

177
00:11:13.099 --> 00:11:15.799
Dad, how embarrassing!

178
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:18.399
I'm going to get ready for the night,

179
00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:21.199
so don't let anybody come near the tea room.

180
00:11:21.199 --> 00:11:23.199
Yes, master.

181
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.999
Where are you going, Ms. Mimura?

182
00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:39.599
I've got another commitment.

183
00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.999
Just what do you mean?

184
00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:43.599
I'll be right back!

185
00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:46.799
How selfish can she get?

186
00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:49.899
The master personally invited us, and yet...

187
00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.399
Mr. Yakura, the bath is ready.

188
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.499
Thank you so much.

189
00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:02.599
The water of the pond has changed color!

190
00:12:02.599 --> 00:12:04.799
The reflection from the light is gone,

191
00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.999
and the inside of the pond can be seen, that's why it's green.

192
00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:11.599
Next, it will change to crimson when the sun tilts its angle.

193
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:18.099
Ms. Hanasaki, what on earth happened to this fishing rod?

194
00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:20.399
Well...

195
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:24.099
Master told me to burn it.

196
00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:26.599
I thought so.

197
00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:29.799
No, Mr. Ryoichi!

198
00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:31.099
Ryoichi!

199
00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:32.899
We have guests tonight,

200
00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:36.399
so I'd advise you to wait until the tea ceremony is over.

201
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.899
I know, I'm just going to put my fishing rod away.

202
00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:44.599
Fishing is Ryoichi's only hobby.

203
00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:48.599
What a cruel thing for the master to do.

204
00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:50.999
But to suddenly burst out in rage,

205
00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.799
and burn fishing goods out of the blue?

206
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:55.399
I wonder if you can call that mere foul temperament.

207
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.099
His wife passed away

208
00:12:57.099 --> 00:13:00.899
exactly during the completion of that tea room last year.

209
00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.199
She took the legend very seriously

210
00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:07.799
and was against the building of the tea room to the very end.

211
00:13:08.899 --> 00:13:11.299
It sure sounds familiar.

212
00:13:11.299 --> 00:13:13.399
Yes, sort of.

213
00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:15.299
Among us, it is rumored

214
00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:18.599
that some have seen the shadow of the monster.

215
00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:20.099
I see.

216
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.299
In other words, you're saying

217
00:13:21.299 --> 00:13:22.599
that the master has become difficult to get along with

218
00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:24.499
because of his fear for the monster?

219
00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:26.999
Not really. He laughs it off saying

220
00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:29.499
that it's superstition without any grounds.

221
00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:31.999
I'll go get the bath ready.

222
00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:36.499
I guess I'll go take a bath, then.

223
00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.199
Please excuse me.

224
00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:44.899
I wonder if there is really such a thing as a monster?

225
00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.999
Don't be ridiculous!

226
00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.799
Who is it?

227
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:22.989
Huh? You're...

228
00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:24.489
Are you bored?

229
00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.289
Sort of.

230
00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:29.889
Did you catch that big fish?

231
00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:31.189
Yes, that's right.

232
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:35.889
Conan, there you are!

233
00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:37.389
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:40.989
Shall we go to the guest room and eat some candy?

235
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:42.489
Okay.

236
00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:47.089
Hey! Conan, where were you?

237
00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:49.189
He was at Ryoichi's room for a while.

238
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:52.289
There was a large fish print decorating his room.

239
00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:54.889
Well, Ryoichi is really something.

240
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:57.289
He invites me to go night fishing with him sometimes,

241
00:14:57.289 --> 00:15:00.389
but I can't come anywhere near him when it comes to catching fish.

242
00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:03.289
That's the burglar alarm.

243
00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:05.589
Maybe somebody's come.

244
00:15:13.989 --> 00:15:15.989
Huh?

245
00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:19.489
Why might she be looking around?

246
00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:22.989
Huh?

247
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:27.289
Look, the pond is red now!

248
00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:30.789
It's so bright that I can't bare looking at it.

249
00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:31.989
It's 4pm.

250
00:15:31.989 --> 00:15:35.689
Just about this time, the sunlight diffuses reflection

251
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:37.689
Oh, I'm so hot.

252
00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:40.689
Ms Hanasaki, do you have anything cold to drink?

253
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:43.589
Ms. Mimura, where were you?

254
00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:46.389
What? It's none of your business, isn't it?

255
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:51.189
Her clothes are falling apart and she is sweating profusely.

256
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:53.889
She must've been in one heck of a rush.

257
00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:56.389
Ms. Mimura, how rude of you!

258
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.389
He invited you ever, after all, you know.

259
00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:02.789
Just who the heck do you think you are?

260
00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:05.289
It's a tea ceremony that is to be given by the master!

261
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:08.289
It is utterly rude to run out on him like that!

262
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:11.489
Come on now, both of you.

263
00:16:11.489 --> 00:16:13.089
I hear that this will be the last tea ceremony

264
00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:14.889
he will be carrying out.

265
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:17.089
That's it!

266
00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:20.789
I'll bet you were dying to have the master resign!

267
00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:24.189
Just what do you mean by that, Ms. Mimura?

268
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:27.389
I would rather you not make ugly assumptions!

269
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:28.589
Now, now.

270
00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:31.889
All right. I'm so sorry.

271
00:16:34.489 --> 00:16:36.089
Oh, how upsetting!

272
00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:38.389
Even the color of the pond looks hot.

273
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:46.489
What's wrong?

274
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:50.289
That's...

275
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:52.189
It's the master!

276
00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:55.289
Father?

277
00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:07.189
Father?

278
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:08.889
What's with all this blood?

279
00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:11.089
No good, the door is locked!

280
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.689
Is there any other entrance?

281
00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:13.989
The washing basin entrance is behind.

282
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:15.289
Ryoichi!

283
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:17.489
The door to the washing basin is also locked!

284
00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:19.889
We've got no choice, let's kick the door open!

285
00:17:19.889 --> 00:17:21.189
Please move out of the way.

286
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:29.089
Master?

287
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:30.989
Master!

288
00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:38.289
No good. He's dead.

289
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:39.989
Father...

290
00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:43.389
It's the legend!

291
00:17:43.389 --> 00:17:47.389
Just as in the legend, Master was killed by the monster!

292
00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:51.289
Father!

293
00:17:56.389 --> 00:17:57.889
Thank you.

294
00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:01.489
Huh? Hello there, Conan.

295
00:18:01.489 --> 00:18:03.289
Officer Yokomizo?

296
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:05.789
Which means that Mr. Mouri is also here, right?

297
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:08.289
Yes, he's over there.

298
00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:13.889
Hello, Mr. Mouri. I'm sure glad to see you again.

299
00:18:13.889 --> 00:18:17.589
I'm sure not happy to see you, though.

300
00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:20.589
You don't have to hide your embarrassment.

301
00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:21.989
Officer Yokomizo.

302
00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:24.389
What we've found out so far is that

303
00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:26.089
this door of the miniature entrance was locked

304
00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:28.489
from the inside by a long wooden stick.

305
00:18:28.489 --> 00:18:32.189
As for the window, the sliding door was slightly open.

306
00:18:32.189 --> 00:18:34.789
However, as you can see, it is blocked by a trellis.

307
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:37.989
To the east, there is the entrance to the washing basin,

308
00:18:37.989 --> 00:18:40.689
but this was also locked from the inside.

309
00:18:40.689 --> 00:18:43.389
Are you saying that all the doors were locked?

310
00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:44.989
Yes.

311
00:18:44.989 --> 00:18:48.789
The estimated time of death is between 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm.

312
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:50.589
The corpse was bleeding

313
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:51.989
However, the direct cause of death

314
00:18:51.989 --> 00:18:55.889
is thought to be suffocation by strangulation

315
00:18:55.889 --> 00:18:57.589
It's suicide.

316
00:18:57.589 --> 00:19:00.589
Take a look at the blood stain.

317
00:19:00.589 --> 00:19:02.589
The master first tried to commit suicide

318
00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:05.389
by slashing his wrist at the porch.

319
00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:08.889
But he failed, so then he maybe he tried slashing his neck.

320
00:19:08.889 --> 00:19:11.089
If so, that explains the blood stains

321
00:19:11.089 --> 00:19:14.789
that are seen all the way from here to the tea room.

322
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:18.889
If he failed to commit suicide at the porch

323
00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:20.589
and tried to hang himself,

324
00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:23.189
he wouldn't have had the time to lock the room.

325
00:19:25.589 --> 00:19:27.589
The windmill is spinning.

326
00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:29.989
Gosh.

327
00:19:29.989 --> 00:19:32.189
Talk about a small entrance!

328
00:19:36.889 --> 00:19:38.989
There are remains of a thumbtack or something

329
00:19:38.989 --> 00:19:41.089
having been stuck in the back of the door.

330
00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:53.189
The rope was cut in a strange fashion.

331
00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:54.789
It seems to have been cut part way,

332
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:56.789
but pulled apart towards the end.

333
00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:06.289
The hanging scroll is spread out on the floor.

334
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.789
He must've been getting ready for the tea ceremony

335
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.389
to be held this evening.

336
00:20:09.389 --> 00:20:11.189
Although he was getting prepared,

337
00:20:11.189 --> 00:20:13.789
he impulsively chose to die.

338
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:16.389
I guess that's what happened.

339
00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:18.789
The writing is only half done.

340
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:19.789
Huh?

341
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:23.189
This rubbish? Wooden shavings?

342
00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:25.789
Even on the tatami floor...

343
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:26.889
I see!

344
00:20:26.889 --> 00:20:29.389
It's wood from the pillar that the rope was tied onto.

345
00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:33.189
Huh? But there is a scrat on the wood that served as support.

346
00:20:34.489 --> 00:20:36.689
I can't see too well.

347
00:20:39.189 --> 00:20:41.089
Hey, when the heck did you get in here?

348
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:42.689
Stop getting in the way!

349
00:20:45.889 --> 00:20:47.589
Will you carry me on your back?

350
00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:49.289
What the heck are you talking about?

351
00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:51.289
Get out of here!

352
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:53.189
Hey, what are you try to do?

353
00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:56.289
Just as I thought!

354
00:20:56.289 --> 00:20:57.789
Marks of friction are left on places

355
00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:00.989
other than where the rope was hung.

356
00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:03.589
Moreover, it's still new.

357
00:21:04.589 --> 00:21:05.889
Pops!

358
00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:08.389
Suit yourself!

359
00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:11.289
He was killed by the legendary monster?

360
00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:15.289
Do you expect me, a police officer, to believe that?

361
00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:18.489
There's no doubt about it!

362
00:21:18.489 --> 00:21:20.089
From the blood stains on the porch

363
00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:21.489
to the fact that he hung himself,

364
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:24.489
it's all so similar to the legend!

365
00:21:24.489 --> 00:21:26.689
There may be no monster,

366
00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:29.989
but he was killed as the legend said.

367
00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:32.989
So it's just as if he were killed by the monster.

368
00:21:32.989 --> 00:21:37.389
This tea room shouldn't have been built after all.

369
00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:39.289
Right after the completion of the tea room,

370
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:41.689
his wife dies of a heart attack.

371
00:21:41.689 --> 00:21:44.889
And now the master.

372
00:21:44.889 --> 00:21:48.189
This is unmistakably the doings of the monster.

373
00:21:49.389 --> 00:21:51.189
Which means...

374
00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:54.589
He seems to have been pretty worn out mental,

375
00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:57.489
so I'm pretty sure he committed suicide.

376
00:21:57.489 --> 00:21:58.789
Yes.

377
00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:05.289
No, this is not suicide.

378
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:09.489
It's homicide!

379
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:11.389
I'm sure that someone here

380
00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:14.389
schemed a very clever trick and killed the master

381
00:22:14.389 --> 00:22:16.589
after making it look like the master committed suicide!

382
00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:21.889
Who could have done this?

383
00:22:21.889 --> 00:22:25.189
Who is pretending to be the monster?

384
00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:00.289
"Next Episode"

385
00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:02.789
The way this rope was tied...

386
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:04.489
Maybe...

387
00:24:04.489 --> 00:24:07.889
What's with you always making tributes of expensive containers?

388
00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:09.389
Speak for yourself!

389
00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:12.589
I heard you invested so much money

390
00:24:12.589 --> 00:24:14.589
to the point of running your company bankrupt!

391
00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:16.589
I'll bet that all you're concerned about is how it looks on the outside

392
00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:19.689
and don't care about how it looks on the inside!

393
00:24:19.689 --> 00:24:21.589
Care only about how it looks like on the outside?

394
00:24:23.389 --> 00:24:24.789
