1
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.740
This pot is my pride and joy!

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.540
Will some appraise it for me?

3
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.140
So, he's Doctor Agasa.

4
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.540
If all cases were men,

5
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.440
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

6
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.040
Doc's house is the target?

7
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.740
Ayumi's disappearance and shadows of the Organization.

8
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.940
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:47.505
"Doc's Video Site (Part 1)"

12
00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.605
The curry looks delicious!

13
00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:55.505
Yep. With this much,

14
00:02:55.505 --> 00:02:58.305
it won't matter how many helpings Genta comes back for.

15
00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:00.105
True.

16
00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:01.305
All we have left to do now is to put the lid on

17
00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.005
and keep it simmering for a while.

18
00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:07.305
Let's see, I guess I'll try tasting it before that.

19
00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:09.005
Ouch.

20
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:13.005
Nobody that brings rice on his plate is going to get to taste this.

21
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:14.405
Stingy...

22
00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:16.705
Wait just a little while more, okay, Doc?

23
00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:19.405
I guess I have no choice.

24
00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:21.505
By the way, did you figure it out, Conan,

25
00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:23.605
the value of that pot?

26
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:27.105
No. I only know that it seems to be really old,

27
00:03:27.105 --> 00:03:28.305
but I haven't figured out what era it's from

28
00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:30.605
or who made it yet.

29
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:33.805
Well, I'll find out by the time Genta

30
00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.105
and Mitsuhiko get back.

31
00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:37.905
"We're having curry today"

32
00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.905
"Curry from afternoon"

33
00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:42.805
"We'll have curry in the evening too while we're at it"

34
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.305
Genta.

35
00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:47.405
-Huh? -I know it's Doc's wallet,

36
00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:49.305
but don't you think you bought too much?

37
00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:51.905
All he asked us to get were drinks.

38
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.905
Who cares! It's good to have a lot of Yaiba chocolates

39
00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.105
and Yaiba snacks, right?

40
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:59.205
Conan asked me to get him a soccer magazine too, besides.

41
00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.705
I bought yogurt, your favorite for you too, Mitsuhiko.

42
00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:02.905
Thank you.

43
00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:04.605
Oh, it's you guys!

44
00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.205
Are you acquainted

45
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.505
with Doctor Agasa who lives here?

46
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:11.305
Yes.

47
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:14.405
You were with Ran the other day.

48
00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.905
So, you're a girl after all.

49
00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:19.905
Yeah. My name's Masumi Sera.

50
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.205
But, you don't have boobs, so it's kind of...

51
00:04:24.205 --> 00:04:25.205
True.

52
00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:29.005
They're supposed to be popping out anytime soon.

53
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.305
That's right, thank you last time.

54
00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:38.005
You two helped during that hole up case, right?

55
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:40.805
I was one of the hostages too, you see.

56
00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:42.105
Is that right?

57
00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:44.105
Well, it's thanks to us, Youth Detective Squad

58
00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:46.405
investigating and all I guess!

59
00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:49.305
And Shinichi Kudo too!

60
00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:53.505
Yeah. Doc said, that a high school detective

61
00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:54.605
that happened to be his acquaintance

62
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:57.705
coincidentally came along and solved the case!

63
00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:02.705
But we were told by Haibara to keep this a secret.

64
00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:04.205
Haibara?

65
00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:07.205
Are you talking about the quiet looking girl

66
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:09.705
with short hair that's living with Doc?

67
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:12.005
Yeah... She's not that quiet, though.

68
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:13.705
Have you ever met her?

69
00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:16.005
No. I just got a glimpse of her

70
00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:19.805
on the video website together with Doc.

71
00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:21.805
He was boasting that when he cleaned out his storeroom,

72
00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:25.005
he found an expensive looking pot!

73
00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:27.405
He wants somebody to appraise it.

74
00:05:28.405 --> 00:05:31.905
But, why do you have to keep the thing about Kudo a secret?

75
00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.805
The house next door is his house, isn't it?

76
00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:35.905
Beats me.

77
00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.905
That house is always vacant,

78
00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.505
but that day it seems he went back to pick up something he forgot,

79
00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:43.105
and while he was at it, he stopped over at Doc's place.

80
00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.805
Maybe somebody's still there?

81
00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:48.105
I saw the curtains flutter just a while ago.

82
00:05:48.105 --> 00:05:49.505
Oh, that's probably...

83
00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:51.105
Subaru!

84
00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.705
Subaru?

85
00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.705
His apartment was burned in a fire,

86
00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:57.105
so it seems he's living there now.

87
00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:02.205
I thought that somebody was living there without permission.

88
00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:04.805
But, I guess I was just worrying for nothing.

89
00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:16.905
It smells good!

90
00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:18.605
Can we start eating already?

91
00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:21.305
-Not yet. -Wait about another half an hour.

92
00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:24.405
What? You mean we have to wait 30 more minutes?

93
00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:26.905
Is it really going to take that long.

94
00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:31.505
But, there's a little that we can taste before, the whole works.

95
00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:34.405
Hors d'oeuvre? You mean appetizer?

96
00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:36.605
Right, right! So, we get to eat curry

97
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:39.805
as an hors d'oeuvre and also a big serving as the main dish?

98
00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:41.505
No way!

99
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.405
Genta, you and Doc are too gluttonous!

100
00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:49.705
I can't stand it anymore, unless I keep myself busy!

101
00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:52.905
What're you doing, Conan?

102
00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:57.105
I'm checking the pot that Doc got out of the store room,

103
00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:00.505
but I think it's best to have it appraised by an appraiser.

104
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:02.505
Oh, you mean the stuff

105
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.905
that Doc was boasting about on his video site?

106
00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:06.805
Hey, Doc! You really don't remember?

107
00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:09.105
Who you bought the pot from?

108
00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:13.805
No. I remember I bought it at a flea market some years ago, though.

109
00:07:13.805 --> 00:07:17.305
Together with that carpet that you're sitting on right now.

110
00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:19.105
You mean with this old worn out carpet?

111
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.505
Yeah, I laid it out because it came out

112
00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:23.305
together from the storeroom with the pot.

113
00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:27.105
Hey, Genta!

114
00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.705
Don't go kicking the soccer ball in the room!

115
00:07:29.705 --> 00:07:31.505
I can't help it, can I? I'm so hungry.

116
00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:34.505
I feel like I'm going to die.

117
00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:57.105
Yes. I'm sorry.

118
00:07:57.105 --> 00:07:59.005
One more time, from the bottom of your heart!

119
00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:02.605
Yes. I'm seriously very sorry.

120
00:08:02.605 --> 00:08:05.005
Well... it's okay already.

121
00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:07.605
It's not okay! We've got to go

122
00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:10.805
buy the ingredients for remaking the curry, you know!

123
00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.405
So, I already told you that we'd go out to buy the groceries,

124
00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:16.605
so you stay back home.

125
00:08:16.605 --> 00:08:18.105
I can't afford to let you guys go

126
00:08:18.105 --> 00:08:20.805
because you'll buy unnecessary stuff again!

127
00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:22.105
Yes...

128
00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.105
Okay then, I'll go get the meat at the shop

129
00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:25.605
where they're having a sale!

130
00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.405
Let's meet later at the supermarket then!

131
00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:31.805
Haibara.

132
00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.405
I think it's about time you forgive him.

133
00:08:34.405 --> 00:08:37.205
You're scarier than my mom.

134
00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:38.305
Listen...

135
00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:40.905
You're not getting a second helping of curry, Genta.

136
00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:43.505
What? No way.

137
00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.305
Come on, pretty please...

138
00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:48.105
-No. -Miser.

139
00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:11.405
Ayumi, I put your clothes in the basket!

140
00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:12.905
Thank you!

141
00:09:26.905 --> 00:09:30.805
It's Ai's clothes!

142
00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:32.805
It smells of Ai.

143
00:09:33.805 --> 00:09:37.505
Doc! I finished taking a bath!

144
00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:44.205
What?

145
00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:47.705
Haibara was shown on the video site?

146
00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:49.305
Are you serious?

147
00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:52.405
Yes. Haibara appeared on the video site

148
00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:54.605
that Doc was boasting his pot about a while ago.

149
00:09:54.605 --> 00:09:57.005
Masumi said so.

150
00:09:57.005 --> 00:09:59.805
Masumi?

151
00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:01.705
Where'd you see her?

152
00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.605
In front of Doc's house.

153
00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:06.305
When we came back after buying the drinks.

154
00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:07.905
But, it's strange.

155
00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:11.005
I wasn't supposed to be on the video site.

156
00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:13.805
Then, confirm that with Doc.

157
00:10:13.805 --> 00:10:18.105
-I'm doing so now. -But, what it is?

158
00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.405
It's not connecting.

159
00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:22.705
Hey, Conan!

160
00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:25.605
Don't tell me that...

161
00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:30.805
Don't tell me that...

162
00:10:45.305 --> 00:10:46.405
Doc!

163
00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:48.005
Ayumi!

164
00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:49.305
Are you all right?

165
00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.505
Hey, Doc.

166
00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:57.505
Hey? Get a hold of yourself!

167
00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:03.705
Doc! Are you all right? What happened?

168
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:07.505
The doorbell rang, so I went to answer it

169
00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:10.005
and I was suddenly shot with a stun gun.

170
00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:11.505
A stun gun?

171
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.705
Maybe they came after

172
00:11:13.705 --> 00:11:16.205
the pot Doc were boasting about?

173
00:11:18.005 --> 00:11:21.005
No, the pot is right here.

174
00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:28.205
The coffee that is spilled on the floor.

175
00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:31.205
Moreover, there's a trace of something having been here.

176
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:33.705
Hey...

177
00:11:33.705 --> 00:11:35.805
Ayumi's nowhere!

178
00:11:35.805 --> 00:11:37.705
What?

179
00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:40.705
The old carpet's gone too.

180
00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:42.605
Since coffee was also spilled

181
00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:45.805
on the floor where it was laid out.

182
00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:48.805
It means that when Ayumi was attacked,

183
00:11:48.805 --> 00:11:50.705
she was pushed down to the floor where the spilt coffee was

184
00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:52.605
and rendered immobile.

185
00:11:52.605 --> 00:11:53.705
Then it is most likely

186
00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:56.905
that she was wrapped in the carpet and carried away.

187
00:11:56.905 --> 00:11:58.305
Why in the carpet?

188
00:11:58.305 --> 00:12:00.205
Because instead of putting her in a big bag,

189
00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:02.805
it would look like some movers or renovators

190
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:06.905
have come to carry the carpet away,

191
00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:09.105
thus avoiding needless suspicion.

192
00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:10.605
Then, was she kidnapped?

193
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.805
But, why would they take Ayumi?

194
00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:15.805
I mean she only happened to be here, after all.

195
00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:19.305
Hey, Doc! You can get the video

196
00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.805
that you uploaded on the site right away, can't you?

197
00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:22.505
Yeah.

198
00:12:22.505 --> 00:12:25.005
This pot is my pride and joy!

199
00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:27.505
I'd like someone to appraise it for me!

200
00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:29.805
Only Doc is on.

201
00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:31.205
No, wait.

202
00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:33.405
Something's on your glasses, Doc.

203
00:12:43.005 --> 00:12:45.005
Maybe they were

204
00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:48.805
after you, Haibara.

205
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.881
Then, is this the story?

206
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:05.081
The culprit mistakenly thought

207
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:06.981
that Ayumi was Ai and kidnapped her?

208
00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:09.781
Yeah. It's very likely.

209
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:12.681
It's more natural to think that the culprit saw the video

210
00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:15.181
that was aired on the video site

211
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:18.381
and learned that I was here in this house and took her away.

212
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.481
They probably came here

213
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:23.681
after seeing that we left to go shopping,

214
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:25.781
shocked you with the stun gun,

215
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:29.081
wrapped Ayumi who was here in the carpet and took her away.

216
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:31.981
Then, you mean the culprit was watching this house?

217
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:34.781
-Yeah. -But, if they were watching us,

218
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.481
they should've seen Haibara go out with us, right?

219
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:40.681
Haibara was wearing a cap back then

220
00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:42.681
and her hair was rolled inside it, right?

221
00:13:42.681 --> 00:13:45.281
It's not surprising that the culprit overlooked her.

222
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.281
Besides, the change that I put out for Ayumi

223
00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:53.481
were the same clothes that Ai was wearing in the video.

224
00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:55.181
If she had her head covered with the hood,

225
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:58.081
they would think that she was Haibara.

226
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.381
It... it's my fault.

227
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.481
If I didn't play soccer in the room,

228
00:14:02.481 --> 00:14:04.981
we wouldn't have had to go shopping.

229
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:07.481
It's not your fault.

230
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.381
I'm to blame.

231
00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:12.581
This is what my abominable circumstances

232
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:14.581
brought about...

233
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:19.981
No, wrong.

234
00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:21.981
It's not your fault.

235
00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:25.581
If it were those guys, they wouldn't mistake Ayumi for you.

236
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:26.581
But...

237
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:29.781
Besides, think about it... this situation.

238
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:34.281
I'm checking your image using Doc's PC now.

239
00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:36.681
If this is the doing of the men in black,

240
00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:41.281
they would've killed Doc and ambushed you.

241
00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:43.981
The data in this PC would've been deleted first thing,

242
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:45.681
the house would've been burned down

243
00:14:45.681 --> 00:14:48.681
and all traces of you having been would've been totally erased.

244
00:14:48.681 --> 00:14:51.281
But, what if this is a trap?

245
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:53.381
Since I, their target wasn't here,

246
00:14:53.381 --> 00:14:56.081
they pretended being kidnappers, took Ayumi away

247
00:14:56.081 --> 00:14:59.881
and are trying to lure a flustered me out, then what?

248
00:14:59.881 --> 00:15:02.581
Maybe they kidnapped her to find out

249
00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:05.781
how much she knows about me.

250
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.181
If that's what they wanted to do,

251
00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:09.781
they would've kidnapped Doc.

252
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:13.081
They would never go through the risk of kidnapping somebody.

253
00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:15.181
They would investigate secretly,

254
00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.281
scheme a plan and before you know

255
00:15:17.281 --> 00:15:19.281
it everything is erased. That's how they do things, right?

256
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:23.081
Hey, you guys! What're you guys whispering about anyway?

257
00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:24.081
It's nothing.

258
00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:25.681
Can't we pursue the whereabouts of Ayumi

259
00:15:25.681 --> 00:15:28.381
using your glasses, Conan?

260
00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:32.281
Because Ayumi always carries her transmitter detective badge with her.

261
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.181
No. I checked on that a while ago,

262
00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:37.481
but the badge is in this house.

263
00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:39.581
She probably left it in the clothes

264
00:15:39.581 --> 00:15:41.881
that she was wearing before she changed clothes.

265
00:15:41.881 --> 00:15:44.081
At any rate, let's call the police.

266
00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:48.481
What's that sound?

267
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:50.581
The ringtone of a cell phone?

268
00:15:50.581 --> 00:15:52.681
It's coming from that pot!

269
00:15:56.881 --> 00:15:58.681
It's Ayumi's cell phone!

270
00:15:58.681 --> 00:16:01.881
"Read the mail and follow orders!"

271
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:06.481
One mail's come in.

272
00:16:06.481 --> 00:16:08.181
It's Doc's address.

273
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.481
Don't tell me that...

274
00:16:09.481 --> 00:16:11.881
My cell phone was stolen.

275
00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:15.281
What orders are they talking about?

276
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:18.881
Find this cat. It should be around there.

277
00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:21.381
Mail this cell phone when you find it.

278
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:24.081
We'll release the girl in exchange for the cat.

279
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.881
Of course if you contact the police, the girl dies.

280
00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:28.981
What does it mean?

281
00:16:28.981 --> 00:16:32.881
Was Ayumi kidnapped because of that gray cat?

282
00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:34.181
I guess so.

283
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:37.081
At any rate, we've got to find that cat fast

284
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.981
or else I guess it's certain that Ayumi is in danger.

285
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:43.681
Okay! I'll forward the image of this cat to all of you,

286
00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:44.781
so let's split up and search for it!

287
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:46.481
Aye...

288
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:50.881
Darn, it's nowhere!

289
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:52.781
Any call from the culprits?

290
00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.381
Not yet.

291
00:17:54.381 --> 00:17:57.881
We can't judge the size of the cat from this image,

292
00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:00.781
so I mailed them several times to ask them.

293
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:02.881
I wonder why they're not answering.

294
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.581
Don't tell me that they gave up looking for the cat

295
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.081
and already took Ayumi's...

296
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:09.581
Idiot! What makes you think that guys who would kidnap a child

297
00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:13.681
in order to look for their cat, give up that easily?

298
00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:17.181
It's your mail address, Doc.

299
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:20.081
-It's from the culprits. -What does it say?

300
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:24.681
No joke! Is that for real?

301
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:26.381
Yeah! You guys are searching

302
00:18:26.381 --> 00:18:28.781
near the apartment complex on 3 chome, right?

303
00:18:28.781 --> 00:18:30.381
Yes.

304
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:33.081
This is what's written in the culprit's mail.

305
00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:35.581
The cat's been found. We will release the girl

306
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:39.381
in the trash dump at the apartment complex on 3 chome.

307
00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:49.081
Ayumi...

308
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:51.481
She's nowhere.

309
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:52.681
Don't tell me that...

310
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:05.781
-Ayumi! -Ayumi...

311
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:16.681
You're fine now.

312
00:19:23.481 --> 00:19:25.681
But, I'm sure glad

313
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:28.481
that Ayumi came back safely.

314
00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:30.381
She doesn't seem to be hurt anywhere too.

315
00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:31.881
I'm fine!

316
00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:36.281
My cell phone was wrapped in the carpet together with Ayumi,

317
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:39.381
and although the back of the carpet got a bit dirty,

318
00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:41.581
it came back with no stains too.

319
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:43.581
But, how ruthless.

320
00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:45.481
Yes. They ask us to search for their cat,

321
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:46.781
but after they find it,

322
00:19:46.781 --> 00:19:51.081
they dispose of Ayumi together with the trash.

323
00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:53.881
They said it was an important cat or something.

324
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.181
Huh? Did you hear the culprit's voice?

325
00:19:56.181 --> 00:19:58.581
Yep. It was a high pitched, nauseating,

326
00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:00.181
strange voice, though.

327
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:03.281
They used helium gas to change their voices, right?

328
00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:06.381
And? Did the culprits say something else?

329
00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:09.081
Well, they seemed really rushed.

330
00:20:09.081 --> 00:20:11.381
They were saying that it was their master's cat

331
00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:13.481
so they would be in trouble if they didn't find it.

332
00:20:13.481 --> 00:20:16.481
Could it have been the cat of some super rich person?

333
00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.281
Beats me.

334
00:20:18.281 --> 00:20:19.881
It seems that the cat got away near here,

335
00:20:19.881 --> 00:20:22.081
and they mistakenly thought that Doc had picked it up

336
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:24.081
and was feeding it.

337
00:20:24.081 --> 00:20:26.281
He was shouting saying that if Doc had the cat,

338
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:28.881
the cat toilet, the water and feeding bowls

339
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:30.481
should be somewhere so to find it.

340
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:33.481
You mean the culprit wasn't alone?

341
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:35.581
Yeah. There seems to have been two.

342
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:37.181
They both had strange voices

343
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:40.581
and were wearing a cap with holes for their eyes and mouth.

344
00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:42.981
You mean a twosome wearing mask caps?

345
00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:44.781
Super bad guys!

346
00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:47.881
But, they let me out of the carpet once,

347
00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:49.781
and let me drink water.

348
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.981
Even after they wrapped me back into the carpet,

349
00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:54.981
they asked me if I could breathe okay.

350
00:20:54.981 --> 00:20:57.281
Moreover, they said they wrapped me in the carpet

351
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:01.581
because all they had on them was a cat carry bag.

352
00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:05.981
In other words, the cat keeper of some rich person,

353
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:08.481
carelessly makes the cat get away and panics.

354
00:21:08.481 --> 00:21:10.281
Then, wanting to get the cat back,

355
00:21:10.281 --> 00:21:13.181
he commits a kidnapping case.

356
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:14.881
But, it ends up being a stupid story

357
00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:16.681
where the keeper eventually finds the cat on his own.

358
00:21:16.681 --> 00:21:19.181
But... If so, they should've honestly said,

359
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:21.481
"It's our master's cat, so if you picked it up,

360
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.481
please give it back to us".

361
00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:24.681
I wonder about that.

362
00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:27.181
If the owner of the cat is found to be rich,

363
00:21:27.181 --> 00:21:29.181
an exorbitant reward may be demanded,

364
00:21:29.181 --> 00:21:31.181
and this way, the fact that they let the cat flee would be

365
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:32.281
revealed to their master, right?

366
00:21:32.281 --> 00:21:35.881
No, I don't think it's such a simple case.

367
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:38.481
No matter if they saw us leave to go shopping,

368
00:21:38.481 --> 00:21:39.781
unless they already knew that Doc

369
00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:42.481
and Ayumi were the only ones in the house,

370
00:21:42.481 --> 00:21:44.681
I don't think they could do something like break into a house

371
00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:46.581
with just a stun gun.

372
00:21:46.581 --> 00:21:49.381
Besides, it didn't even take us 30 minutes to go

373
00:21:49.381 --> 00:21:51.481
and come back from shopping.

374
00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:53.181
If it was a house that they broke into for the first time,

375
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:56.281
do you think they could've passed Doc out with the stun gun,

376
00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:59.081
confirm that the cat was nowhere inside,

377
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:03.881
then wrap Ayumi in the carpet and carry her out?

378
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:07.581
Moreover, they even found Doc's and Ayumi's cell phone too.

379
00:22:07.581 --> 00:22:09.781
Then, don't tell me that the culprits...

380
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:12.481
Yeah. They knew

381
00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:16.381
that you and Doc live in this house, just the two of you.

382
00:22:16.381 --> 00:22:20.081
That all four of us come over here to play,

383
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:23.581
and that all of us own cell phones too.

384
00:22:23.581 --> 00:22:25.981
But how did they get that information?

385
00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:29.581
Has anybody you don't know come over to this house recently?

386
00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.481
Come to think of it, yes.

387
00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:34.581
-About three pairs. -Three pairs?

388
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:40.481
See, the ones who saw the video site that you just saw came.

389
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:41.781
The culprit is probably among

390
00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:44.481
the three pairs of people who came.

391
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:47.081
I'll find them for sure.

392
00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.981
"Next Episode" -Russian Blue?

393
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:14.281
I'm sure that Ran's mother's cat was also a Russian Blue.

394
00:24:14.281 --> 00:24:16.981
If it's a pot and cat, we should look at the pot-cat video site.

395
00:24:16.981 --> 00:24:20.381
It's really cute how the cat goes into the pot.

396
00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:21.381
What?

397
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:25.481
Am I not supposed to take a bath until the culprit is caught?

398
00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:28.681
Well, it'll only take a short while.

399
00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:32.681
Because we're going to raid the culprit's place from now.

400
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:34.081
Next Conan,

401
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:38.281
"Doc's Video Site (Part 2)"

402
00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:56.881
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:56.881 --> 00:24:58.381
"Ear"

404
00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:01.581
Make sure to tune in next time too.

405
00:25:01.581 --> 00:25:03.081
You don't have get all hung up on ear, Doc.
