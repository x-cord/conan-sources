1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,270
The body of Yuri Saeki,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,070
the woman who went missing with the Tears of Borgia,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,370
a jewel scheduled to be used as part of a live TV drama broadcast

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,870
40 years ago, was discovered.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,670
Yuri Saeki's granddaughter, Sumire

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,570
hired the Mouri Detective Agency to clear Yuri's name.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,870
But...

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,470
Hey, Mizusawa!

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,870
Didn't you say something about the whatever of Borgia?

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,170
Mizusawa!

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,270
Something's burning.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,770
A fire? Could it be...

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,870
Mizusawa! Hot...

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,470
Hot...

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,970
Mizusawa!

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,870
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

18
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,770
A skeleton emerges across time and space.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,970
The case catches fire, putting the old man in danger!

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,270
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:58,811
"The Cursed Tears of Borgia (Part 2)"

24
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,611
Dad!

25
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,911
Be quiet. We're in a hospital.

26
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,911
I'm glad you're doing okay.

27
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,711
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

28
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:15,411
Be careful.

29
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,311
Inspector Megure, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

30
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:20,511
It's fine.

31
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:24,411
But I couldn't save Mizusawa.

32
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:29,311
Isn't he the one who found Sumire's grandmother?

33
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:32,211
Yeah. He was my drinking buddy.

34
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,311
He said he had something to discuss with me today.

35
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:39,711
Gosh! If only I'd gotten there sooner!

36
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,211
About that, Mouri...

37
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:48,511
The autopsy revealed that he hardly inhaled any smoke at all.

38
00:03:49,411 --> 00:03:53,211
So by the time the fire started, he was already...

39
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,011
That's right.

40
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,311
Come in.

41
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,111
-Excuse us. -Excuse us.

42
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,611
Ran.

43
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,911
What is it?

44
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,911
Forensics just called.

45
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:15,211
They examined the victim's phone that Mouri saved from the fire.

46
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,911
There wasn't a single image saved on it.

47
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,311
What?

48
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,311
It wasn't just the images.

49
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:25,311
Aside from Mouri's,

50
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,211
they didn't find a single fingerprint on the phone.

51
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,811
Which means...

52
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,711
Someone erased all the images on the phone

53
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,611
and wiped their prints off of it.

54
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,011
Right, mister?

55
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,011
Yeah, and it's probably the same person

56
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,911
who murdered Mizusawa and started the fire.

57
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,011
Officer Takagi.

58
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:48,111
What about the erased data?

59
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:51,011
We're having forensics restore it right now.

60
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,111
I see.

61
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:56,511
Mouri, you were supposed to meet the victim at six, right?

62
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:57,511
Yes.

63
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:01,511
Do you remember anything from when the fire started?

64
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,611
Judging by the situation,

65
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:06,611
the fire was started about 30 minutes earlier.

66
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,611
It couldn't have been more than an hour.

67
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,711
Which means Mizusawa was murdered before that,

68
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,311
between 5 and 5:30.

69
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,211
What about his associates' alibis?

70
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:23,811
Nonogaki Real Estate, the site of the fire, was closed today.

71
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,911
We haven't been able to confirm the whereabouts

72
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:29,711
of President Nonogaki or any of his employees.

73
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,111
I see.

74
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:34,511
Also, the victim's friend

75
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:39,211
and client Kanoya Construction President Hiromichi Umeki...

76
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,711
-I've heard that name before. -Yes, sir.

77
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,911
Umeki was with the victim

78
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:48,211
when they discovered the body at the dam.

79
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:50,411
Oh, right.

80
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,311
And? What about him?

81
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:58,011
He saw the news about the fire on a TV at a bar

82
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,511
and came to talk to the police.

83
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:01,811
According to him,

84
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:05,411
he'd been drinking with several friends since around five.

85
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:09,711
So only Umeki has an alibi.

86
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:11,211
Hey, mister.

87
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,611
Don't you want to see photos of the crime scene?

88
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:14,711
What?

89
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:19,811
You might be able to figure something out if you saw it again.

90
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,111
You're right.

91
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,911
What do you think, Inspector?

92
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,111
Very well.

93
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,211
Bring them immediately.

94
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,411
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,811
"From: Kanoya Tatsuma. Subject: No Subject. I found the kine."

96
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:35,211
Kinescope?

97
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:39,011
Isn't that the powdered roasted soy beans you put on mochi?

98
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:41,811
-Before video became widespread, -Oh, silly me.

99
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,311
-they used to convert important images to film... -I was thinking of kinako.

100
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,211
in order to preserve them.

101
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:49,311
Kanoya kept a kine, not kinako,

102
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,211
of the final scene of "I Killed Them".

103
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,211
That's a valuable record,

104
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:00,411
but it's not like it will solve the case.

105
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,111
I already know who killed Mizusawa.

106
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,511
What?

107
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:08,911
We're going for the other case.

108
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,011
This brings back memories.

109
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,211
"I Killed Them", or "Killed 'Em" for short.

110
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,911
"Kanoya Tatsuma (72)" -You remember?

111
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,211
Indeed I do.

112
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:24,611
I think I was in sixth grade at the time.

113
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,311
My, my.

114
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,811
Hey, mister. Was the window open in the final scene?

115
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,911
No, we closed it.

116
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:34,911
We didn't want to distract from Nagisa

117
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,311
in the important final scene.

118
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,311
It'd be ruined if the wind blew the curtains.

119
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,811
Come to think of it, that line was incredibly intense.

120
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:49,011
I see. No, but maybe...

121
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,211
Your grandson is rather strange.

122
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:54,211
Oh, is he?

123
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,111
Yes, Inspector.

124
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:03,311
Yes. Thank you.

125
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:06,911
We've gathered the others,

126
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,111
but where are we headed?

127
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,911
The dam.

128
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:15,011
There's something I want to check at the filming location.

129
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:24,011
According to Kanoya, it should be around here.

130
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,411
Let's see...

131
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,911
I don't see anything.

132
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:35,111
-Not right now. -Huh?

133
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,911
Beika City is...

134
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,311
I knew it.

135
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,911
Knew what?

136
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,611
Hey, Shinichi!

137
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,411
We're leaving already?

138
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,178
Mouri's late.

139
00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:58,778
Yeah.

140
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:03,078
I have someplace to be after this.

141
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,578
Probably a gambling hall.

142
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,578
What?

143
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:10,078
I heard you're being threatened by some suspicious people recently.

144
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,778
Not here.

145
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:17,778
He's here.

146
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:22,278
This way, Mouri.

147
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:24,178
Everyone's waiting for you.

148
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,678
What? Waiting?

149
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,778
Inspector. You're here, too.

150
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,878
What are you talking about?

151
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:35,478
You're the one who asked us to come here to solve the case.

152
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:37,278
What? I did?

153
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,478
What? Already?

154
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,278
Dad?

155
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,978
That was quick.

156
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:47,978
Thank you for coming, everyone.

157
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,678
Have a seat.

158
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:56,178
Now then, I asked you to come here to discuss the two cases

159
00:09:56,178 --> 00:10:01,478
surrounding the jewel known as the Tears of Borgia.

160
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,978
Unbelievable.

161
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,978
I doubt I have anything to do with that, so I'm leaving.

162
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,478
No.

163
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:11,978
Its connection to you will eventually emerge, Umeki.

164
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:17,878
I'm sure some of you have heard that

165
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:20,578
Western history scholar Senju said

166
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,578
the Tears of Borgia didn't actually exist

167
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:26,878
and that the jewel was a fake.

168
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:27,978
What?

169
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:31,378
However, though the jewel itself was fake,

170
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:37,078
Yuri Saeki who was transporting it was indeed found dead.

171
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:42,478
Unfortunately, 40 years is quite the barrier.

172
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,578
People thought it impossible to determine the truth.

173
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:50,878
But a new incident occurred in the present.

174
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:54,478
Its victim was one of the men who discovered Yuri,

175
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:57,278
Sho Mizusawa.

176
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,878
Not only that, but he was killed not by the fire,

177
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:04,178
but by someone who strangled him to death.

178
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,078
The investigation briefly proceeded under the assumption

179
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,278
that the culprit was someone who had no alibi for when the fire started,

180
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:17,278
but the crime scene suggested the existence of another culprit.

181
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,678
Officer Takagi, the photos.

182
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,878
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:22,378
Take a look.

184
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:26,278
The platter that should be on the shelf is on the table,

185
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:28,378
and the bottles are empty.

186
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,078
Why do you suppose that is?

187
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,078
It's because

188
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,678
that's a picture of a timed ignition device

189
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:40,978
made from the materials on hand.

190
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:54,278
This device the culprit made to get away with his crime

191
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:57,878
instead limited who the culprit could be.

192
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:01,178
In other words, whoever has an alibi for the time the fire started

193
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,878
is the culprit.

194
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:05,478
Am I right, Umeki?

195
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:09,378
I have no reason to kill Mizusawa.

196
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:10,778
I see.

197
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:13,678
Officer Takagi, the photos from the phone at the crime scene.

198
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:14,678
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:19,778
These two photos were restored from the phone's deleted data.

200
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,778
They show the glovebox of the car Yuri was riding.

201
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,778
Look at the time these photos were taken.

202
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:32,078
The first was taken at 9:41,

203
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,278
while the second was taken at 9:51.

204
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:39,578
The glovebox that was closed in the first photo

205
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:41,678
is open in the second.

206
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,978
Officer Chiba, what time was the body reported?

207
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,378
9:45 am.

208
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:53,278
In other words, Mizusawa photographed the car at 9:41.

209
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:56,378
Then he switched with you

210
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:59,778
and reported the body at 9:45.

211
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,578
He then returned to the car

212
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:04,478
and photographed it at 9:51.

213
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,178
In other words, Umeki,

214
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,978
while Mizusawa was away from the car for 10 minutes,

215
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:14,578
you're the only one who could've opened the glovebox.

216
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,378
When Mizusawa noticed the open glovebox later,

217
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:23,078
he suspected you took something from the car.

218
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:27,278
He tried to discuss it with me, but you killed him.

219
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,778
This is ridiculous!

220
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:33,178
Are you saying the Tears of Borgia was inside that glovebox?

221
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:38,478
Why would I know about that ancient history?

222
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,678
I'm disappointed, Hiromichi.

223
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,678
I told you about the Tears of Borgia

224
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:45,978
countless times when you were a boy.

225
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,378
Gosh!

226
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,178
For this...

227
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,478
For this fake...

228
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:57,378
Darn it!

229
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,478
No!

230
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:03,678
Even if it's fake, my grandmother risked her life for this.

231
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,578
Darn it.

232
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,178
Darn it!

233
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:23,678
So who stabbed my grandmother?

234
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:30,178
Allow me to take over for Mouri.

235
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:31,978
You?

236
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:36,278
Yes. After all, it happened 40 years ago.

237
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,978
And it's more speculation than anything.

238
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:43,578
I'm better suited for this than Detective Mouri.

239
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:47,778
Kanoya, could you prepare the kine?

240
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,478
Very well.

241
00:14:55,478 --> 00:15:00,178
Kanoya preserved the final scene

242
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:04,778
of the forty-year-old drama "I Killed Them" on 16 mm film.

243
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,778
The maid played by Nagisa

244
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,878
calls over her boyfriend the butler.

245
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,878
This is the scene suggested by Yuri

246
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:17,078
in which she begins peeling apples, right?

247
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:19,178
Yes, but...

248
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,078
"Red Hood has arrived"?

249
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:42,278
Nagisa.

250
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,378
Masao.

251
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:49,578
Huh? Didn't you say only Nagisa went to the filming location?

252
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:51,278
That's right.

253
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,578
But look. The man playing the butler is there with her.

254
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:58,578
The butler's at the studio set.

255
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:00,078
What?

256
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,378
We're switching cameras at set times.

257
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,678
But the maid is in the scene with him.

258
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,778
That's a stand-in.

259
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:15,878
We had a similar-looking actress

260
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:20,978
wear the same costume and stand in for Nagisa.

261
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,178
This shot was done on location.

262
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,678
Then we switched to the studio here.

263
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,178
I see.

264
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:30,578
Could you pause it here?

265
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:36,378
The rest of the scenes are unrelated to the case,

266
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,578
so we'll leave them out.

267
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:43,078
I'd like to present my theory to you now.

268
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:46,678
Sumire, I'd especially like you to hear this.

269
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,678
Go ahead.

270
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,478
While the drama was being filmed at the studio,

271
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,078
Nagisa waited on location for her scene to start

272
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,178
and for Yuri to arrive with the Tears of Borgia.

273
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:04,278
However, she never arrived.

274
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,078
Nagisa must've panicked.

275
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,578
Calm down, Nagisa.

276
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,778
We have three more minutes.

277
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,578
We need to film the real thing.

278
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,678
You're late, Yuri.

279
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,378
She won't make it in time.

280
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:33,478
Yuri! I'm glad you made it.

281
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:35,778
Quickly, the Tears of Borgia.

282
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:40,178
Yuri had been convinced by Professor Senju

283
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,678
not to embarrass the family with a fake.

284
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:44,978
They were both desperate.

285
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:47,178
Yuri had no time to explain,

286
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,978
and Nagisa had a 40 degree fever.

287
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:22,178
Yuri tried to get as far away from the location as she could

288
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,778
so Nagisa wouldn't be blamed,

289
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:30,578
and so the fake Tears of Borgia wouldn't appear in the drama.

290
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:44,278
At the studio, the stand-in maid stabbed Red Hood to death.

291
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,478
All that remained was Nagisa's final shot.

292
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:52,478
Nagisa, the real jewel won't make it in time.

293
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:56,978
I'm sorry, but you'll have to wear the fake ring.

294
00:18:56,978 --> 00:18:58,878
I... I understand.

295
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,678
I...

296
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,378
I...

297
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,578
I killed him!

298
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:24,378
"The End"

299
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:36,178
That's what I imagine happened behind the camera.

300
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:40,278
It's true that your story explains

301
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:44,978
the fallen car and the fruit knife.

302
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:49,678
And Nagisa's current condition, but...

303
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:53,078
It's too bad that it's only speculation.

304
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:54,678
It can't be helped.

305
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:57,778
Hey, didn't you say

306
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:00,478
you had them close the window for the final scene?

307
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:04,278
Yes, it was necessary for the performance.

308
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:07,678
Then if the window was open,

309
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:10,578
doesn't that prove Yuri came?

310
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,078
It wouldn't be conclusive,

311
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,578
but it would be circumstantial evidence.

312
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:19,278
But since the curtains were closed,

313
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,378
we don't know if the window was opened.

314
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:26,678
I saw something shining when you showed us this film

315
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:29,478
on the editor this afternoon.

316
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:36,078
Just before the words "The End" appear onscreen,

317
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:39,978
when Nagisa disappears from the shot...

318
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:42,378
Right here.

319
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:47,278
Can't you see something shining through the lace curtains?

320
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,278
I see. You're right.

321
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:51,178
How embarrassing.

322
00:20:51,178 --> 00:20:55,178
I hadn't noticed in 40 years.

323
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:58,578
That proves Dr. Agasa's story.

324
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:02,378
Yes. Now, I can report the results to my mother.

325
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:06,178
But I wonder what it was.

326
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:08,278
-Could it be a star? -No.

327
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:12,278
It was cloudy that day. There wasn't a single star in the sky.

328
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:15,078
Then was it plane lights?

329
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:17,078
A plane?

330
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:19,478
I see. This is...

331
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,178
That's right. This light was probably

332
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:29,378
the now demolished Beika City aerial lighthouse.

333
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,078
Several days later,

334
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:04,578
we learned Nagisa Asahina kept calling Yuri's name,

335
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:07,978
so we went to Grand Light with Sumire where Nagisa lived.

336
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:09,978
Nagisa.

337
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,878
Yuri, you're okay.

338
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:24,278
Yes. I've been fine this whole time, Nagisa.

339
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,678
I'm so glad.

340
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:29,378
I had such a long and terrible dream.

341
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,978
Nagisa's heart, which had been tormented

342
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:46,778
by the ring's curse for 40 long years,

343
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:51,978
was released by the kindness of one grandmother and her granddaughter.

344
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:57,078
"Next Episode"

345
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:00,778
-Thank you. -It's only once a day,

346
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,878
so enjoy yourselves.

347
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:06,178
The dinosaur bones fell apart!

348
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,978
I don't believe it! My brachiosaurus!

349
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:13,878
Like you, I wanted everyone to enjoy them.

350
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:18,278
But it was only for a few seconds, right?

351
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:24,378
Next Conan, "The Man Crushed by a Dinosaur"

352
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,221
Next Conan's Hint:

353
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,321
"A dinosaur show"

354
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:30,721
Name a dinosaur.

355
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,921
-Arsonosaurus. -Roar...
