1
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:05,693
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:08,853
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,693
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,093
Today's case takes place
in a high-rise building!

5
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,303
These elevators bear a crime!

6
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:18,353
Even when hidden behind double doors,
there's always only one truth!

7
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,515
The Elevator Murder Case.

8
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:08,555
Emergency Exit

9
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,605
Fitting Room

10
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:41,005
Come on, it's a holiday!
Why's there so much traffic?!

11
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,965
Are you sure it wouldn't
have been faster by train?

12
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:50,595
Being a model for Ashiya-san's clothing--
it's like a dream come true!

13
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:54,265
You're sure this is Ashiya Eiko, right?

14
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:55,925
You know that she's...

15
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,435
...One of the top fashion
designers in Japan, right?

16
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:06,985
Wasn't Ashiya Eiko the one whose
fashion show was cancelled recently?

17
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:13,515
A rival company announced
a winter clothing line

18
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:16,995
very similar to the latest line
that she was going to have at her show.

19
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,955
So she had no choice but to cancel it.

20
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,345
You sure know a lot about her!

21
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:25,335
Don't tell me you're actually
an Ashiya Eiko fan!

22
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,305
I had no idea, Dad!

23
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:31,265
Don't be silly! A detective
must always expand his horizons

24
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:35,265
to keep on top of what's going on
in the world around him!

25
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:37,935
Sure...

26
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,675
Here it is!

27
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,155
That's one big building...

28
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:51,095
You're not going to be
a model yourself, you know.

29
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:54,035
I know that! You're really
starting to get on my nerves!

30
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:59,705
Excuse me! My name's Mori Ran...

31
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,535
Ah, we've been expecting you.

32
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,955
The company president will be back soon.
Please wait over there.

33
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:05,965
Sure!

34
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,925
It certainly is quiet!

35
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:15,015
Yes, today's a holiday,
so there's no one else here.

36
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,915
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, Ran-san!

37
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:19,865
No, that's okay!

38
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:22,705
Hey...

39
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:23,705
What?

40
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,485
Are big purses the latest style now?

41
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:33,455
Her life revolves around all
the up-and-coming fashions!

42
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:34,905
I'm sure it'll catch on soon!

43
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,535
I'm really sorry about that.

44
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:42,915
This is my father and Conan Edogawa-kun.

45
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,875
They absolutely
insisted on coming with me...

46
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,745
Mori Kogoro, at your service.

47
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,615
Thank you for giving
my daughter this opportunity--

48
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,175
Mori Kogoro? The famous detective?!

49
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:55,575
Oh, you've heard of me!
What an honor this is!

50
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:58,095
These are a token of my admiration.
Please accept them.

51
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,665
Ashiya-sensei?

52
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,065
Sorry. Thank you.

53
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,065
Good morning.

54
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,495
Morning.

55
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,865
This is my secretary,
Taniguchi Mika-san.

56
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,865
Nice to meet you.

57
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:17,245
This is Mori Ran-san
and her father, Kogoro-san.

58
00:05:17,245 --> 00:05:17,785
And this here is...

59
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,625
Conan Edogawa!

60
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,365
Right! Conan-kun!

61
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,085
Sorry to call you here on a Sunday.

62
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:30,385
That's okay. I'll just quit
as soon as I can.

63
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,845
After all, I am being forced
to work on weekends now.

64
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,915
Fine. Whatever you like.

65
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:45,685
I'll just go put these flowers in
my office and bring back the paperwork.

66
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:51,575
Please have a seat there with
your father and Conan-kun while you wait.

67
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:52,525
Certainly!

68
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:57,995
Mika-san. Go to the 8th floor
fitting room and get ready.

69
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,235
See you shortly.

70
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:07,325
Excuse me, but is
that secretary quitting?

71
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,715
Yes. She's apparently already
turned in her letter of resignation.

72
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,175
They seem on such bad terms,
but she still pushed the button for her.

73
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,645
Direct elevator to the 15th floor

74
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,315
Direct elevator to the 8th floor
(Stops at each floor coming down)

75
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,535
Well, let's wait over here.

76
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,635
But first I need to use the bathroom!

77
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:35,035
Same here!

78
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:36,785
Hurry up and go!

79
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,745
That feels much better!

80
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:42,205
Did you both remember
to wash your hands?

81
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:48,795
Eda-san!

82
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:50,955
What is it?!

83
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:55,995
I called Mika-san's cell phone
from my office, but she won't answer!

84
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,415
Will you come look with me?

85
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,095
Of course!

86
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:02,055
Why's she so worked up about
someone not answering their phone?

87
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:04,415
That's strange.

88
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:08,025
The elevator Taniguchi-san
used is stuck on the 8th floor.

89
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,945
Could something have happened to her?!

90
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:16,525
For now, let's take this elevator up
and see for ourselves.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,255
What's the matter, Eiko-san?

92
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,265
The secretary, Taniguchi Mika-san...

93
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,935
Wait! There are footprints on the floor!

94
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,235
Footprints...

95
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:59,325
It would seem they were made
by dust from the emergency stairs!

96
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,455
A robber must've broke inside!

97
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:03,615
They snuck in, found Mika-san,
and then stabbed her!

98
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:09,215
It's almost like she knew this
would happen to Taniguchi-san...

99
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,375
Eda-san! Could you stop the door?

100
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,175
Right!

101
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:25,925
I can't believe this...

102
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,015
These footprints...

103
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:44,325
Stabbed through the heart.
Died almost instantly.

104
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,325
Inspector!

105
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,245
These footprints are
26 centimeters in length.

106
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,995
26 centimeters, eh...

107
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,375
It must've been a man.

108
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,115
There's a blood stain on her shoulder...

109
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:03,845
And what's this crease doing
on the shoulder of her jacket?

110
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,535
Would someone working in the
overly conscious fashion industry

111
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:11,265
wear something with
a crease like that?

112
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,165
But the strangest thing is that
Taniguchi-san is lying on the ground

113
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:17,735
facing away from the elevator.

114
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,575
If she was stabbed
as she got off the elevator,

115
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,665
she would have collapsed inside it!

116
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:33,165
In which case, the killer must've
purposely pulled her into the hallway.

117
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,505
But why would they need to do that?!

118
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:44,955
You and Taniguchi-san were riding
in different elevators, correct?

119
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,995
Yes. That elevator was the one I took.

120
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,075
The 15th floor?

121
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,065
This goes non-stop to the 15th floor?

122
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,025
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:01,775
And this center elevator is
the one Taniguchi Mika-san took?

124
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:04,415
That one's non-stop to the 8th floor,

125
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,325
and then it can go floor-by-floor,
all the way to the 15th floor.

126
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,325
And then the one we took just
now stops at the 8th floor,

127
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,995
then comes back down
in single-floor increments...

128
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,415
That's correct.

129
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,455
Only two elevators can
go to the 15th floor.

130
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:22,665
How much time passed from when
Ashiya-san first got into the elevator

131
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,175
until she returned here?

132
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:25,995
Two minutes.

133
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,515
No, a little more
than one minute, I think.

134
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,785
A little under two minutes...

135
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:31,475
Inspector.

136
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:39,995
The emergency stairwell exit
on the 1st floor was unlocked.

137
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,275
When did you last do your rounds?

138
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:43,825
About 2 hours before the incident.

139
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,115
I'm certain the door was locked then!

140
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:49,665
Did anyone enter or leave
the building afterwards?

141
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:53,075
Nobody except the company president.

142
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,325
Yes, I needed to check something.

143
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,045
I arrived about an hour ago
and was in my office for half an hour.

144
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,535
After that, I left to get some coffee.

145
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,455
I left through the main entrance,
of course.

146
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:08,505
Inspector! I think Eiko-san is right--

147
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,515
this was the work of a burglar
breaking into the building!

148
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:14,705
The killer unlocked the 1st floor
emergency exit from the outside

149
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:16,225
and took the stairs to the 8th floor.

150
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:20,185
Then, just as he passed
by the elevators...

151
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:22,355
...he ran into Taniguchi-san.

152
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:31,825
He murdered her,
then escaped back down the stairs.

153
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,335
Alright! Search the
nearby vicinity immediately!

154
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,875
Also, I'll need to take
your fingerprints, Ashiya-san.

155
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,835
Are you implying that I'm the murderer?!

156
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:44,785
Nothing of the sort!

157
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:47,665
It's to distinguish between
the killer's fingerprints and yours!

158
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,805
Besides, there's no way you could
possibly have been the murderer!

159
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:54,265
Why not?

160
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,765
Are you stupid or something?!

161
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,495
Pay attention, now.

162
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:03,455
Eiko-san and Taniguchi-san got
in different elevators at the same time.

163
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,705
Taniguchi-san arrived at the 8th floor

164
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:08,415
and was murdered immediately
after the doors opened.

165
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,785
Meanwhile, Eiko-san
was on the 15th floor...

166
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,905
...and there was no elevator
to take her to the 8th floor!

167
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,865
So how could she have
killed Taniguchi-san?

168
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,625
But that doesn't clear her
of all suspicion--

169
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,285
You're just a kid--
don't tell a pro how to do his job!

170
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,415
That's no excuse for hitting him, Dad!

171
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,335
But he just won't learn!

172
00:12:27,365 --> 00:12:29,755
What a lost cause!
Can't depend on him at all!

173
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:30,305
Here goes!

174
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,635
Conan-kun! Where are you going?!

175
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,135
Forget about him!

176
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:47,575
If I'm right, the key to solving
this case should be on the 15th floor!

177
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:54,035
Wow! The company president's floor
sure is nice!

178
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,285
What fancy carpeting!

179
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:03,005
A flower petal?

180
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:10,845
Pollen...

181
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,865
What's this?!

182
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,185
Tape marks!

183
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,395
President's Office

184
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:39,235
It's the same pollen.

185
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,615
Why?

186
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:46,075
Why was there a flower petal
and pollen here?

187
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,255
She wouldn't have passed by here
if she went straight to her office...

188
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,755
Taniguchi-san was killed inside
this elevator on the 8th floor.

189
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,725
Ashiya Eiko-san was all
by herself for just over a minute.

190
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:04,915
Taking the stairs to the 8th floor,
killing her, and then coming back up

191
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,895
would take at least 4 or 5 minutes.

192
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,815
Meaning that the question here
is where exactly she was killed.

193
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,785
The way her body
was lying on the ground...

194
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:20,285
The blood stain and the unnaturally
crumpled part of her jacket...

195
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,525
The flower petal lying on the floor...

196
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:26,995
And the tape marks around
the call button for the elevator

197
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,045
that Taniguchi-san was in...

198
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,205
That's it! Now I get it!

199
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,535
This is an alibi trick
involving elevators!

200
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:39,705
Taniguchi-san's murderer
was indeed Ashiya Eiko!

201
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,555
No fingerprints at all?

202
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:58,975
Nope. There were none on the knife
nor on the 1st floor emergency exit.

203
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:03,435
Excuse me, Inspector.
Would it be all right if I went home?

204
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,655
Of course. That should
be enough for today...

205
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:12,525
Oh no! If she goes,
she'll dispose of the evidence!

206
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,705
I have no other choice!
I'll have to use the old man again!

207
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,325
Ran-san.

208
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,235
Yes?

209
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,035
Sorry, but can we do this another day?

210
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,045
No problem!

211
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,565
Well, I'll just be going now...

212
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,005
Allow me to see you to the door.

213
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:31,305
Not again...

214
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:37,985
...Which is what I would like to say,
but we cannot allow you to leave.

215
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,055
The reason being...

216
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,565
...that you're the one
who murdered Taniguchi Mika-san!

217
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,275
Dad!

218
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,035
What are you talking about, Mori-kun?

219
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:58,245
You were the one who just explained
why she couldn't have done it!

220
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,155
Yes, that I did.

221
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,205
But that was a trick.

222
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:03,665
A trick?!

223
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:09,135
But first, allow me to explain those
footprints in the 8th floor hallway.

224
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,595
Have a seat, if you would.

225
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:17,565
That was a ruse she concocted
to make Taniguchi Mika-san's murder

226
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,975
look like the result of
a burglar breaking in.

227
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,405
Try to remember what
those footprints looked like.

228
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:27,945
Normally, someone would run away
after committing a murder, correct?

229
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,735
This would cause the footprints
to be far apart.

230
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:34,195
However, these footprints
were made by someone walking

231
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,075
on both their way into
and out of the building.

232
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:39,165
I see. Now that you mention it,
you're right...

233
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,865
Eiko-san.

234
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:43,905
You entered the building
an hour before the murder,

235
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,815
made the fake footprints,

236
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:49,965
and then unlocked the 1st floor
emergency exit from the inside.

237
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:56,595
After this, you hid the sneakers
that don't fit you inside your large purse

238
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,895
and then left the building.

239
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:03,655
You came back 30 minutes later,
after you had disposed of the sneakers.

240
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,405
And then as we looked on,

241
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:10,445
you headed for the elevator hall
with Taniguchi Mika-san.

242
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,735
You were the one who
pressed the call button.

243
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:19,155
The reason being that you needed her
to use the center elevator

244
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:23,325
instead of the one
that was nearest to her.

245
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:30,775
Inside the elevator, you started
dialing her number on your cell phone.

246
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:34,615
After getting off on the 15th floor,
you pressed the dial button.

247
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:39,095
It's hard for cell phones to connect
while inside elevators, you see.

248
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:46,475
You told Taniguchi-san to come
to the 15th floor right away.

249
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:54,485
Meanwhile, you taped a coin to
the call button on the 15th floor.

250
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,495
You did this to make sure the
elevator doors wouldn't close

251
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,285
while you were killing her.

252
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:05,745
Hold on!

253
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:09,375
Mori-kun! The victim was
found dead on the 8th floor!

254
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:13,905
Now we come to the
main point of the trick.

255
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:17,845
Didn't you find the direction
she was lying strange?

256
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:22,735
If she had been stabbed by someone
as she was getting off the elevator,

257
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,095
she would have fallen back into it.

258
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:29,065
But she was lying outside of the elevator,
facing away from it.

259
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:32,025
Now that you mention it...

260
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,405
Eiko-san stabbed Taniguchi-san
on the 15th floor,

261
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:41,275
got behind her, and then turned her
in the direction of the hallway.

262
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,195
Then she pressed the button
for the 8th floor

263
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:46,245
and removed the tape
from the call button.

264
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:50,955
She then propped Taniguchi-san up
in a sitting position

265
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:54,755
and sent her down to the 8th floor.

266
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,365
I can't believe she
would do such a thing...

267
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:09,775
There were two keys to unraveling
the mystery behind this alibi trick.

268
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:14,315
The first was the crease on the
shoulder of Taniguchi-san's jacket.

269
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:19,735
It was created when the jacket was
caught between the elevator doors.

270
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:24,155
The second key was in the flower petal
and pollen left on the carpet

271
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,615
when Eiko-san put
the bouquet on the floor

272
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:29,165
so it wouldn't get in the way
of killing Taniguchi-san.

273
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,065
That's an interesting story.

274
00:19:32,065 --> 00:19:34,625
But it's nothing but a theory.

275
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:40,405
Besides, if Taniguchi-san rode
the 8th floor elevator a second time,

276
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:44,635
her fingerprint should have been
on the 8th floor call button.

277
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:46,275
Well, Inspector?

278
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,125
Any fingerprints on the call button?

279
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,555
No. No fingerprints at all.

280
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:56,275
Sorry, Mori-san.
Taniguchi-san didn't go to the 15th floor.

281
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,985
Your theory has been disproved!

282
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:01,825
Indeed. Because you removed
her fingerprint yourself.

283
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,275
Truly stupendous execution, it was.

284
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:08,325
In order to close the elevator doors,
you pressed the call button

285
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,665
and then removed her fingerprint
by wiping it off.

286
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,585
Wait a minute! Does that mean
there's no proof?!

287
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,025
Oh, there's proof all right.

288
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:18,965
Inside Eiko-san's purse!

289
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:23,055
What kind of proof?!

290
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:26,765
The bloody gloves she used
when committing the murder.

291
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:30,735
Time-wise, she shouldn't have
been able to dispose of them.

292
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:34,195
And she couldn't dare hide
them inside the building.

293
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:38,275
You were more than confident
about your elevator alibi trick.

294
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:42,025
In other words, the only possibility
is that the bloodied gloves

295
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,895
are in your possession!

296
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:49,485
The one who stole your design
and sold it to that rival company...

297
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,375
...was Taniguchi Mika-san, wasn't it?

298
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:57,335
You're right. The evidence is here, too.

299
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,795
But I did it because she had betrayed me.

300
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,615
She said she didn't care
if I went to the police

301
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,945
because after canceling my fashion show,

302
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:09,725
doing so would only damage
the Ashiya Eiko brand name even more.

303
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,185
Then she tried to quit the company.
Letter of Resignation

304
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:17,645
I decided to kill her
while she was still with the company.

305
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,485
And that was today...

306
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:26,695
When I heard your father was the
famous detective Mori Kogoro-san,

307
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,445
I didn't know what to do.

308
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:31,455
But I didn't have a change of heart.

309
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:17,715
Ran-san.

310
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:21,295
You may not believe me,

311
00:23:21,295 --> 00:23:24,945
but I was telling the truth when
I told you why I wanted you as a model.

312
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:29,005
I wanted someone with a healthy mind
and body such as yourself

313
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:31,745
to wear Ashiya Eiko clothing.

314
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:39,375
I'm so sorry, Ran-neechan...

315
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,795
You almost had your
chance to be a model...

316
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:44,835
No, that's okay.

317
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:47,255
Huh? Come to think of it, where's Dad?

318
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:50,675
Whoops! I left him there, asleep!

319
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,835
It looks like this case
has taken its toll on him...

320
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:01,965
After all, he's a fan of Ashiya Eiko-san,
and he just exposed her crime!

321
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:09,255
If he found out I was the one who
exposed her crime, he'd murder me!

322
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,335
Mitsuhiko!

323
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:36,095
I've figured it out! You're the ghost!

324
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:38,415
On the next Conan--

325
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:41,215
The Haunted House Murder.

326
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,055
Next Conan's Hint:

327
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:00,056
Next Conan's Hint:
Eerie basement.

328
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:02,106
Eerie basement.
