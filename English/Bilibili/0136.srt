1
00:00:01.382 --> 00:00:04.082
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:06.082
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:07.982
Today's stage is an old castle.

4
00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:09.682
A great adventure for the Youth Detective Squad.

5
00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.182
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:13.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.782
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57.295 --> 00:01:59.195
"Tobuzankei Campsite"

9
00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:09.295
Oh, what fantastic scenery.

10
00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:13.995
Hey, hurry up!

11
00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:16.895
Why do we have to camp in such cold weather?

12
00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:19.195
Children are so energetic, that I envy them.

13
00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:20.395
Hey, there are fish there!

14
00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:21.995
Really? Where? Where?

15
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:24.495
Dr. Agasa, get the tent out, will you?

16
00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.095
The tent...

17
00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:32.195
What's up, Doc?

18
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:35.895
Don't tell me you did something like forget the tent?

19
00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:37.895
Well...

20
00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:41.395
I'm sorry, you see.

21
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.695
Are you serious?

22
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.395
Gosh, talk about dense...

23
00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:49.695
How can you come to camp and forget the tent?

24
00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:52.595
What a bummer.

25
00:02:52.595 --> 00:02:54.795
It seems like he's lost too.

26
00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.495
It's because you guys keep making a fuss on the side!

27
00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.695
I guess we're going to be spending the night in the car...

28
00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:04.895
What? Oh, no.

29
00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.895
I'm sure there's a boarding facility somewhere.

30
00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:08.895
Right!

31
00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:10.695
Maybe some sort of castle by the lake?

32
00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:12.195
Don't be silly.

33
00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.095
Oh, they might be right.

34
00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:15.095
Huh?

35
00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:27.195
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 1)"

36
00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.195
Wow!

37
00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:32.795
It looks just like one of the castles they have abroad!

38
00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.895
Why is there such a building in the forest?

39
00:03:35.895 --> 00:03:39.495
Some rich person probably bought the castle abroad,

40
00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:43.095
took it apart, and reassembled it here.

41
00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:44.195
Okay!

42
00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:47.095
Hey, what are you going to do?

43
00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:50.195
What else? I'm going inside.

44
00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:54.695
Hey! Where the heck are you from, kid?

45
00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:56.495
Who gave you permission to come in here?

46
00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:57.595
"Katsuo Tabata (41), Gardener"

47
00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:01.795
Well, we're not bad people.

48
00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.095
What's with all of you?

49
00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:07.595
We saw this fantastic castle just as we were driving along here.

50
00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:09.295
If it's okay with you, we thought

51
00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.195
we'd like to have a look around the castle.

52
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:14.995
Go home! This is no place for outsiders to come...

53
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.995
Who are those people?

54
00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:19.095
Sir.

55
00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:23.395
I didn't think we'd have any guests today.

56
00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:26.295
That dumb looking old man says he wants to come in.

57
00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:27.895
Dumb looking?

58
00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.495
I'm a scientist, you know!

59
00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:31.995
Scientist?

60
00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:33.195
Indeed!

61
00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:38.395
I'm Hiroshi Agasa, a quite well-known inventor.

62
00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:40.495
Which means that

63
00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:44.895
your brain is way better than ours.

64
00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:47.995
All right then, please come in!

65
00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.995
In fact, why don't you may spend a night here if you like?

66
00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:53.195
Oh, that would really be a great help!

67
00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:54.895
But, sir!

68
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.295
You haven't asked the Mrs. whether it is okay yet.

69
00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:59.795
Just tell her they're my friends.

70
00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:03.395
In Mother-in-law's condition, that explanation will suffice.

71
00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:06.695
-Oh, God... -Hey, Pops.

72
00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:09.095
Let me down, will you?

73
00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:10.995
Wow!

74
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:13.495
What a big yard!

75
00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:17.895
It's a horse!

76
00:05:17.895 --> 00:05:20.395
Oh, yeah! There's a black one here too!

77
00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:22.995
But, why is only the neck here?

78
00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.595
This horse is one of the men of chess.

79
00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:28.195
Men of chess?

80
00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:29.795
Not only the man.

81
00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.895
Look at the grass under it.

82
00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:33.895
It is has a checkered pattern, doesn't it?

83
00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:37.595
It's cut in checkered pattern to serve as a chess board.

84
00:05:37.595 --> 00:05:40.295
Your master likes chess too?

85
00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:41.695
I wonder...

86
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.295
I take care of the yard just like I was ordered to

87
00:05:44.295 --> 00:05:47.095
by my previous master, Sir Sadaaki,

88
00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:50.495
and keep it in this condition.

89
00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:54.595
Something about Sir Sadaaki was told to keep the yard in shape

90
00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.995
by will of his father who passed away 15 year ago.

91
00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:58.895
Your previous master?

92
00:05:58.895 --> 00:06:00.795
Then, that man that we just saw is?

93
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:05.395
Oh, the madam's second husband called Mitsuru.

94
00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:09.395
He came after Sir Sadaaki died 6 years ago of an illness.

95
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.595
But, she also died

96
00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:15.095
because of a fire that broke out 4 years ago.

97
00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:16.695
A big fire?

98
00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:18.595
See, over there.

99
00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:21.095
The burnt tower over there.

100
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:24.695
The madam's bedroom was there.

101
00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:27.595
It was right after she returned to the tower

102
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.595
after celebrating her birthday party.

103
00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:32.595
She arrived at the tower at midnight,

104
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:36.695
and fire occurred before daybreak.

105
00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.495
Not only the madam,

106
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:41.595
the friends she brought,

107
00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:43.695
the people who served her for many years,

108
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.495
as well as the stewards... over 10 people

109
00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:49.295
were swallowed by the flames.

110
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.195
The ones who were not involved

111
00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.395
were those like me, who had just been hired,

112
00:06:55.395 --> 00:06:56.895
and her mother who had been sleeping in another building

113
00:06:56.895 --> 00:06:59.695
because of a cold.

114
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:01.395
Also saved were Sir Mitsuru who came back here

115
00:07:01.395 --> 00:07:03.595
a bit earlier than the madam.

116
00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:05.195
And him, over there.

117
00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:10.395
The only son of the Madam and Sir Sadaaki, Sir Takahito.

118
00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.995
He came back suddenly 2 or 3 days

119
00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:15.195
before the outbreak of the fire.

120
00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:18.895
He seems to have been gone abroad since childhood,

121
00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:22.495
and that was the first time that I ever saw him.

122
00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:26.095
It was also the first time that I had met Sir Mitsuru.

123
00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:28.595
The madam had gotten married abroad

124
00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:32.695
and was living with him all the while.

125
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:35.795
And for some reason, ever since that fire,

126
00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:39.095
Sir Takahito has remained back here.

127
00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:42.595
It is as if he is obsessed by something.

128
00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:46.895
They must have had a hard time getting into the castle.

129
00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:49.395
Since nobody knew what they looked like.

130
00:07:49.395 --> 00:07:52.995
No, the madam sent us the picture of Sir Mitsuru

131
00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:54.895
when she remarried him,

132
00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:57.895
that we all knew what he looked like.

133
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.695
As for Sir Takahito, it was this...

134
00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:05.395
He looked just like his father.

135
00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:10.195
Oh, I guess no one will doubt that he is his son, seeing this.

136
00:08:10.195 --> 00:08:13.095
Who are the portraits on both sides?

137
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:15.595
They are Sir Sadaaki and the Madam.

138
00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.495
Sir Sadaaki who came here as a son-in-law

139
00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:19.895
taken into the family respected the previous master,

140
00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:22.195
who was also a historian, very much.

141
00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:24.295
Jealous of this,

142
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:28.395
Madam used to always complain to Sir Sadaaki saying...

143
00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:32.695
Father is nothing more than an argumentative intellectual.

144
00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:35.395
-Right? -Mrs. Mamiya?

145
00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:40.095
He knew all about it too.

146
00:08:40.095 --> 00:08:45.195
But, rather than being angry about it, he seemed happy.

147
00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:48.695
I'm sorry for bringing back bad memories.

148
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.095
Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:55.195
I've gotten used to the castle without him.

150
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.595
It's like the size of the passport changing

151
00:08:57.595 --> 00:09:00.995
and the picture on the 10,000 yen bill changing.

152
00:09:00.995 --> 00:09:02.795
At first, you're not used to it,

153
00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:07.595
but with time, you get used to it.

154
00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:11.395
The passing of time is frightening.

155
00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:17.495
It erases joy and sadness all at once.

156
00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:18.995
Mrs. Mamiya...

157
00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:22.395
By the way, who are they?

158
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:26.995
Well, he is a friend of Sir Mitsuru and a scientist as well.

159
00:09:26.995 --> 00:09:28.395
A scientist?

160
00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:31.595
Oh, that's very interesting.

161
00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:34.495
I would sure like you to solve

162
00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:38.895
the mystery that he buried within this castle.

163
00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:40.595
Mystery?

164
00:09:40.595 --> 00:09:44.195
Sir Mamiya seems to have remarked on his death bed that

165
00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:46.495
he would give his most precious treasure

166
00:09:46.495 --> 00:09:49.595
to the one who solves the mystery of this castle.

167
00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:54.095
By the way, is my daughter back yet?

168
00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.295
She supposed to be back today

169
00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:59.495
to celebrate my birthday, isn't she?

170
00:09:59.495 --> 00:10:01.495
Madam has...

171
00:10:01.495 --> 00:10:03.895
Send her to my room as soon as she arrives.

172
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.595
Oh, how exciting...

173
00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:09.095
She's been that way, ever since the fire.

174
00:10:09.095 --> 00:10:11.695
She must've been really shocked by it.

175
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.795
Excuse me, sir.

176
00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:14.995
Is there a room where I can get

177
00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.895
an overall view of the chess pieces in the yard?

178
00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:20.595
The chess pieces in the yard?

179
00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:22.695
Wow!

180
00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.695
The chess pieces are nicely lined up in rows!

181
00:10:25.695 --> 00:10:27.795
Hey! Where is it? I can't see it!

182
00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:30.895
Hey, don't push, Genta!

183
00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:33.195
You can see from here too!

184
00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:34.795
Really?

185
00:10:40.195 --> 00:10:41.295
Could there be a meaning as to

186
00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:44.095
the way the pieces are lined up, or...

187
00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:45.895
Aren't you glad?

188
00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:50.995
They're codes, your favorite, aren't they?

189
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:53.895
-Or, aren't they? -Yes, I think they are, but...

190
00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:56.295
Hey, you two over there! What are you doing?

191
00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:58.295
You'll fall over!

192
00:10:58.295 --> 00:10:59.995
Those idiots...

193
00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.195
What the heck are you guys doing?

194
00:11:06.495 --> 00:11:08.695
I almost fell over.

195
00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:10.995
Oh, he fell.

196
00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:12.895
What the...

197
00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:13.995
Huh?

198
00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:16.895
There is a window by the wall.

199
00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:18.895
I'm sure there was

200
00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:21.595
a window by the wall in the other room too.

201
00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:25.195
Then, what is the space in between here?

202
00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:44.495
From the days of old, these things

203
00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:47.295
have a way of working if you match the needle somewhere...

204
00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:53.495
Hey, Conan?

205
00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:54.795
He was here a second ago, wasn't he?

206
00:11:54.795 --> 00:11:56.695
Yeah...

207
00:11:56.695 --> 00:12:00.595
I see. It's not an ordinary castle.

208
00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:04.295
This is getting to be very interesting.

209
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:08.095
Oh, stairs.

210
00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:10.895
Wow, it's pretty deep down.

211
00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:13.895
I wonder how far down these stairs go.

212
00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:19.495
This is...

213
00:12:27.384 --> 00:12:29.884
What? Conan disappeared?

214
00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:32.484
But, he was in that room till a while ago, wasn't he?

215
00:12:32.484 --> 00:12:33.484
How should I know...

216
00:12:33.484 --> 00:12:36.284
We were looking elsewhere, and he suddenly disappeared.

217
00:12:36.284 --> 00:12:37.884
Impossible.

218
00:12:37.884 --> 00:12:40.384
The chair is turned over and the books are scattered.

219
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:42.184
A clock with the lid open.

220
00:12:42.184 --> 00:12:44.184
It's broken too.

221
00:12:54.784 --> 00:12:57.184
-Huh? -Haibara?

222
00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:00.984
Hey!

223
00:13:01.984 --> 00:13:04.384
Cut out your mischief.

224
00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:08.984
Is anything wrong with the children?

225
00:13:08.984 --> 00:13:11.184
Oh, no, they were just up to some mischief.

226
00:13:11.184 --> 00:13:13.184
-Mischief? -No!

227
00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:16.084
We were looking for Conan because he disappeared!

228
00:13:16.084 --> 00:13:17.884
He disappeared?

229
00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:19.984
He probably went to the restroom or something,

230
00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:21.884
because it's right downstairs.

231
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:23.884
Let's go take a look.

232
00:13:24.684 --> 00:13:27.384
He should at least tell us he's going to the restroom.

233
00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:29.584
You can say that again.

234
00:13:31.484 --> 00:13:34.484
How strange.

235
00:13:34.484 --> 00:13:35.984
He's not in here.

236
00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:37.884
Are there any other restrooms?

237
00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:42.084
This is a floor we don't use very much, so this is the only one.

238
00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:46.984
Maybe he's hiding somewhere and is planning to surprise us?

239
00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:51.484
Possible. He's very childish at times very true.

240
00:13:51.484 --> 00:13:52.684
Right!

241
00:13:52.684 --> 00:13:55.084
You're kids too, my goodness.

242
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:58.084
Sir Takahito, dinner is ready.

243
00:13:58.084 --> 00:14:00.884
Oh, it's the late already.

244
00:14:00.884 --> 00:14:03.684
I had them prepare your dinner too,

245
00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:06.184
-but would you like to have dinner? -Really?

246
00:14:06.184 --> 00:14:09.084
But we've got to look for Conan.

247
00:14:09.084 --> 00:14:10.484
He'll be fine.

248
00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:13.784
If he gets hungry enough, he'll come out.

249
00:14:16.184 --> 00:14:19.684
Dig in!

250
00:14:19.684 --> 00:14:22.084
It's nice having a cheerful dinner like this at times.

251
00:14:22.084 --> 00:14:25.384
Yes. Ever since Mother died in that fire,

252
00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:27.884
the number of guests who come here has decreased.

253
00:14:27.884 --> 00:14:31.584
I've heard that you two have been residing here

254
00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:34.284
since the fire broke out, why?

255
00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:36.984
I was planning to live here

256
00:14:36.984 --> 00:14:39.684
after I graduated from university to begin with...

257
00:14:39.684 --> 00:14:43.284
I stayed here for a while because I was concerned about

258
00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:46.184
my Mother-in-law who had lost her daughter.

259
00:14:46.184 --> 00:14:48.984
But, as time passed, I came to take a liking

260
00:14:48.984 --> 00:14:51.784
for this castle in which my wife was born and raised.

261
00:14:51.784 --> 00:14:54.784
I'll bet you took a liking not for the castle,

262
00:14:54.784 --> 00:14:59.384
but the treasure that is hidden here, right?

263
00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:01.884
Grandmother.

264
00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:03.384
True indeed!

265
00:15:03.384 --> 00:15:04.984
I can't say that the will of Father

266
00:15:04.984 --> 00:15:08.284
has nothing to do with us being here.

267
00:15:08.284 --> 00:15:11.484
To think that my daughter was deceived

268
00:15:11.484 --> 00:15:14.684
by a greedy one as you!

269
00:15:14.684 --> 00:15:16.484
I having dinner in my room!

270
00:15:16.484 --> 00:15:18.684
Bring my daughter to my room when she arrives!

271
00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:21.384
I've got to give her a piece of my mind!

272
00:15:21.384 --> 00:15:26.084
Grandmother still thinks that Mother is alive.

273
00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:28.984
It's only natural that her memory isn't clear.

274
00:15:28.984 --> 00:15:30.284
After she hurt her leg,

275
00:15:30.284 --> 00:15:34.584
she's been confined to this castle for more than 10 years.

276
00:15:34.584 --> 00:15:38.484
And? Did you solve the mystery, Dr. Agasa?

277
00:15:38.484 --> 00:15:41.584
Oh? You haven't heard about it yet?

278
00:15:41.584 --> 00:15:43.684
About what Father said at his death bed,

279
00:15:43.684 --> 00:15:45.784
I will give away my most precious treasure

280
00:15:45.784 --> 00:15:49.984
to the one who solves the mystery of this castle.

281
00:15:49.984 --> 00:15:53.984
Oh, the gardener Mr. Tabata told me about it.

282
00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:56.584
But, I don't know where to look for what...

283
00:15:56.584 --> 00:16:00.084
The chess pieces lined out in the yard.

284
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.684
If that chess board in the yard

285
00:16:02.684 --> 00:16:05.584
was made by the same person who hid the treasure,

286
00:16:05.584 --> 00:16:10.084
there's no doubt that the hint to solving the mystery

287
00:16:10.084 --> 00:16:12.384
is hidden in the chess pieces.

288
00:16:13.484 --> 00:16:15.984
Are you sure, Ai?

289
00:16:15.984 --> 00:16:20.084
Have you figured out the meaning of those pieces?

290
00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:23.084
Of course not.

291
00:16:23.084 --> 00:16:26.884
How could I figure out what you people couldn't, even after 4 years?

292
00:16:26.884 --> 00:16:28.584
The only one who can probably solve the mystery

293
00:16:28.584 --> 00:16:30.784
is the super curious, mystery gourmet,

294
00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:35.184
who has disappeared somewhere within this castle.

295
00:16:35.184 --> 00:16:38.184
-Mystery... -Gourmet?

296
00:16:38.184 --> 00:16:40.784
Here's the bag! Will this do?

297
00:16:40.784 --> 00:16:42.484
Thank you!

298
00:16:43.284 --> 00:16:45.584
What are you going to do with the bag?

299
00:16:45.584 --> 00:16:49.584
I'm saving my piece of bread for Conan.

300
00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:52.784
Because I'm sure he'll be hungry.

301
00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:56.884
What happened to the boy with the glasses?

302
00:16:56.884 --> 00:17:00.184
He's been gone for some time now.

303
00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:04.184
We're going to look for him after we finish dinner.

304
00:17:04.184 --> 00:17:07.084
This castle is quite complicated,

305
00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:09.584
so he's probably lost somewhere.

306
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:12.584
I hope he's not lost in that tower, though.

307
00:17:12.584 --> 00:17:13.784
That tower?

308
00:17:13.784 --> 00:17:17.584
See, the one to the left of this castle?

309
00:17:17.584 --> 00:17:21.584
That tower that is burnt black and surrounded by greenery.

310
00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:25.184
The one that my wife burned to death in, 4 years ago...

311
00:17:25.184 --> 00:17:28.184
Yes, it was 2 years ago

312
00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:30.884
that a new servant who was hired here,

313
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:34.184
disappeared in a night.

314
00:17:34.184 --> 00:17:35.584
I have heard that he used to say,

315
00:17:35.584 --> 00:17:37.484
"There is something in that tower".

316
00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:40.184
He used to tell his a fellow servant so.

317
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.484
Therefore, we searched the tower immediately.

318
00:17:42.484 --> 00:17:44.684
Although there were signs of somebody having been there,

319
00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:46.784
he was nowhere in sight,

320
00:17:46.784 --> 00:17:52.184
so the local police searched the entire forest after that.

321
00:17:52.184 --> 00:17:54.684
And, what after that?

322
00:17:55.484 --> 00:18:00.484
He was found 10 days later in the forest,

323
00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:02.484
starved to death.

324
00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:05.184
What happened?

325
00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.984
I wonder.

326
00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:09.884
The police concluded that he got lost in the forest,

327
00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:12.684
and that it was an accident,

328
00:18:12.684 --> 00:18:14.284
but among the servants,

329
00:18:14.284 --> 00:18:18.084
a weird rumor went around for a while.

330
00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:19.784
That the dead souls of my wife

331
00:18:19.784 --> 00:18:24.484
and those who burned to death there, possessed him.

332
00:18:24.484 --> 00:18:28.384
The entrance of that tower has been sealed off since.

333
00:18:28.384 --> 00:18:30.284
Then, we've got to hurry and look for him

334
00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:32.784
or Conan will be hungry and...

335
00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:35.884
I... I'll save my bread for him too.

336
00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:37.384
Me too.

337
00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:41.984
Let's split up and look for him, before daybreak.

338
00:18:41.984 --> 00:18:44.184
Hey, Conan!

339
00:18:44.184 --> 00:18:45.784
Where are you?

340
00:18:45.784 --> 00:18:48.384
Stop hiding and come out!

341
00:18:48.984 --> 00:18:52.284
He doesn't seem to be in the yard!

342
00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:54.784
We looked all over inside the castle too,

343
00:18:54.784 --> 00:18:55.884
but he was nowhere in sight.

344
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:58.184
Maybe he's in that tower after all.

345
00:18:58.184 --> 00:18:59.484
No,

346
00:18:59.484 --> 00:19:04.384
I just went there, but the door was locked.

347
00:19:04.384 --> 00:19:07.584
Which means the only place left is the forest.

348
00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:10.484
But, it's starting to rain harder.

349
00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:13.084
It's dangerous to go into the forest at night.

350
00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:15.784
It'll be better to look for him

351
00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:17.884
after calling the police tomorrow.

352
00:19:17.884 --> 00:19:20.784
So, all of you, go back inside.

353
00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:23.284
-What? -No way.

354
00:19:24.284 --> 00:19:25.484
Ayumi?

355
00:19:25.484 --> 00:19:27.484
Conan!

356
00:19:27.484 --> 00:19:29.784
He'll be fine.

357
00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:32.384
Conan is not a weakling

358
00:19:32.384 --> 00:19:34.284
so you needn't worry yourself over him.

359
00:19:34.284 --> 00:19:38.884
He's capable of finding his own escape route for himself.

360
00:19:38.884 --> 00:19:40.884
If you got time to cry like a baby,

361
00:19:40.884 --> 00:19:43.084
why don't you carry that bag of bread nice and tight

362
00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:45.084
so that it doesn't get soaked in the rain?

363
00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:48.784
-Hey! -You'll catch a cold!

364
00:19:48.784 --> 00:19:51.384
Come on, let's go.

365
00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:55.684
Why do you know so much about Conan?

366
00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:57.984
Well, I wonder why?

367
00:19:57.984 --> 00:19:59.784
Do you by chance...

368
00:19:59.784 --> 00:20:02.684
happen to like Conan?

369
00:20:11.584 --> 00:20:12.884
If so, then what?

370
00:20:12.884 --> 00:20:15.684
What... I wouldn't want it to be that way.

371
00:20:17.184 --> 00:20:22.384
Don't worry. I don't feel for him in that way at all.

372
00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:23.584
Really?

373
00:20:23.584 --> 00:20:25.284
What a relief!

374
00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:28.084
You really, really mean it, right?

375
00:20:29.984 --> 00:20:32.484
I tell you, the kids nowadays...

376
00:20:33.184 --> 00:20:34.984
But, just as you say,

377
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:36.884
Shinichi will take care of himself!

378
00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:40.484
Like they say, no news is good news.

379
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:43.084
Come of it.

380
00:20:43.684 --> 00:20:47.284
Do you think that he'd make you go through needless worry,

381
00:20:47.284 --> 00:20:50.984
by not contacting you for hours?

382
00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:53.284
Something has definitely fell upon him.

383
00:20:53.284 --> 00:20:55.384
He's either been confined by someone in this castle

384
00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:57.484
and can't get out,

385
00:20:57.484 --> 00:21:00.484
or maybe he's already...

386
00:21:00.484 --> 00:21:02.184
been killed.

387
00:21:02.184 --> 00:21:04.184
Hey...

388
00:21:04.184 --> 00:21:06.484
We've got to contact the police without letting

389
00:21:06.484 --> 00:21:08.084
the people of this castle know,

390
00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:10.484
and look into every nit and gritty for him.

391
00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:13.584
We've got to look for him, not in the forest

392
00:21:13.584 --> 00:21:15.484
but in this castle.

393
00:21:15.484 --> 00:21:17.884
I've already got an idea.

394
00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:19.884
Shape up, Doc.

395
00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:23.284
Without him here, you're the only one we can depend on,

396
00:21:23.284 --> 00:21:25.384
being that you're an adult.

397
00:21:32.184 --> 00:21:33.684
Let's see...

398
00:21:33.684 --> 00:21:36.984
The phone...

399
00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:40.284
Oh, there it is!

400
00:21:51.684 --> 00:21:55.184
This is Shinichi's cap...

401
00:21:57.284 --> 00:21:59.184
What's this door?

402
00:22:01.984 --> 00:22:04.084
What is this supposed to be?

403
00:22:10.084 --> 00:22:11.984
Doc? If you're going to call,

404
00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:13.084
you may as well call someone that we know,

405
00:22:13.084 --> 00:22:15.984
like Officer Yokomizo or Inspector Megure...

406
00:22:20.184 --> 00:22:21.284
Doc?

407
00:22:23.584 --> 00:22:25.084
Doc...

408
00:24:05.884 --> 00:24:07.984
Then, Genta is...

409
00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:11.084
There is no doubt that he has fallen into

410
00:24:11.084 --> 00:24:13.284
the hands of someone who tailed him.

411
00:24:13.284 --> 00:24:14.784
No...

412
00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:16.484
It's not Haibara.

413
00:24:18.184 --> 00:24:20.684
Conan's glasses...

414
00:24:20.684 --> 00:24:24.184
The criminal is probably after the treasure in this castle.

415
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:29.384
Next Conan,

416
00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:33.305
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 2)"

417
00:24:33.486 --> 00:24:36.186
Next Conan's Hint:

418
00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:38.786
"The size of the passport"

419
00:24:38.786 --> 00:24:40.486
Next episode, the culprit is an unexpected person!

420
00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:43.386
That's who it is, I've decided that's who it is.
