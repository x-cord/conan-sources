1
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.840
I'm so excited!

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.140
To think that we get to eat the chocolate of Yukihiko Tsujimoto

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.440
that won the silver award at a world contest!

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.140
Ms. Mayuko Sakura who produced the shop

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.040
is young and beautiful, isn't she?

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.740
They say that Mr. Tsujimoto

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.340
couldn't have succeeded without her, you know.

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.840
And, they're getting married too.

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.440
They sure are meant for each other.

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.340
A world renown chocolatier and...

11
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.840
A beautiful shop producer join to create...

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740
A love-romance chocolate.

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.540
If you eat it with the one you love,

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.240
that love will be realized.

15
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.540
How wonderful.

16
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
All out girl-talk.

17
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.140
I would've loved to eat it with Makoto.

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.840
Who cares, anything delicious makes you happy

19
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.940
no matter who you eat it with.

20
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840
Come on, I'll bet you want to eat it

21
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.440
with Shinichi too, don't you?

22
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.140
No, it's not that.

23
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.040
The fact is you're going to be eating it with me.

24
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.640
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.540
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.040
Enveloped in flames of love.

27
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.840
Chocolate ignites the fuse of the case.

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.840
His name is Detective Conan.

31
00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.379
"Hot Chocolate Trap"

32
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.079
Hi, Mayuko, long time no see.

33
00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.279
Thank you for inviting us.

34
00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.679
Welcome to Le Tresor de Fruits,

35
00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.279
we've been waiting for you.

36
00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.179
What a nice shop!

37
00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.379
Thanks to the all out support of the Suzuki Financial Company,

38
00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.679
"Sakura Mayuko (25)" -I was able to get together top class items.

39
00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.179
We're opening tomorrow,

40
00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.579
so you're our very first customers, Sonoko.

41
00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.479
Are we able to eat Mr. Tsujimoto's chocolate at the shop too?

42
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.779
Our concept is to serve freshly made chocolate.

43
00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.279
Um, are those bottles liquor?

44
00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.179
That's called Nahureka.

45
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.379
It's liqueur made by soaking fruit into strong liquor.

46
00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.579
They all look so pretty and delicious.

47
00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.979
Really! So much so, that I want to leave them untouched.

48
00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.179
All the chocolate in our shop

49
00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.379
is made to resemble the shape of a jewel.

50
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.479
The name of this shop means "Treasure Fruits" in French.

51
00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.779
What is this one with the fruit on it?

52
00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.779
The fruit part of the liqueur that on the shelf

53
00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.879
was made into chocolate.

54
00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.879
Well, would you like to taste it?

55
00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.479
But I can't take liquor.

56
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.579
No need to worry.

57
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.979
Because all the alcohol has evaporated.

58
00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.079
Then, let's take a bite of adult taste.

59
00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.079
It's delicious.

60
00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.679
Ran, maybe the love of your dream will come true.

61
00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:34.879
Okay then, I'll try one too.

62
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.779
Delicious.

63
00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:46.379
"Tsujimoto Yukihiko (41)" -Welcome to our atelier Le Tresor de Fruits!

64
00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.379
He's the chocolatier, Yukihiko Tsujimoto.

65
00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.279
Congratulations to your winning the Golden Award!

66
00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.279
It's an honor to see you.

67
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.079
Merci, same here.

68
00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.479
It's perfectly delightful to be told so by such lovely girls like you.

69
00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.879
What a fake.

70
00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.479
Let me introduce you.

71
00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.279
She's Ms. Mouri.

72
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.679
How do you do?

73
00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:12.679
And she's Ms. Suzuki,

74
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.079
daughter of the Suzuki Financial Company.

75
00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.679
How do you do?

76
00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.179
Enchante Madmoiselle.

77
00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.879
Just as expected, you're a noble and refined lady.

78
00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.979
Come, this way.

79
00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.779
I've got to make preparations, so if you'll excuse me.

80
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.379
Please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

81
00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:35.679
Okay, we'll start preparations.

82
00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.779
Because we would like you to taste the masterpiece

83
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:38.979
that won us the Golden Award that will be

84
00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.179
publicized tomorrow to the media at the grand opening of the shop.

85
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:43.379
All right,

86
00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.579
maybe you'll also be announcing your wedding.

87
00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.279
That's a secret.

88
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:51.779
Come on, how lucky.

89
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.379
A rich girl.

90
00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.279
She's just a high school brat.

91
00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:02.879
Well, if I can get that girl to like me,

92
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.279
it should be easy to get the tycoon to dish out money.

93
00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.679
Hey, Sonoko, just what do you think you're doing.

94
00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:13.979
The last picture of me being single.

95
00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.279
I mean, Mr. Tsujimoto's so attractive.

96
00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.779
Oh? He's not quite what I imagined him to be.

97
00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.679
I think Mayuko's way better.

98
00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:25.079
So, let's get started.

99
00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.079
We'd like to commence

100
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:37.979
the opening ceremony of Le Tresor de Fruits.

101
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.379
And here's chocolatier, Mr. Yukihiko Tsujimoto

102
00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.279
who won the honorable Golden Award in the world contest.

103
00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.979
How beautiful.

104
00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.979
This is the chocolate named "dans le space" (To space),

105
00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.079
shown for the first time in Japan.

106
00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.379
The ingredients used are cacao made of premium grade

107
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.379
Criollo seeds and cocoa powder butter.

108
00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.779
Liqueur that is made of fruit that is carefully selected

109
00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.179
bring out the utmost flavor of the chocolate.

110
00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.279
It looks like a sculpture.

111
00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.479
Really, how wonderful!

112
00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.279
But, the show is just starting.

113
00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.079
Let me take you on a journey beyond your dreams,

114
00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.379
to the distant Milky Way.

115
00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:36.179
Is it the flame of love?

116
00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:37.879
This is...

117
00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:47.079
-Run for it! -Sonoko?

118
00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:55.679
Ran, call the fire station!

119
00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:57.279
You run for it too, Conan!

120
00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.479
Yukihiko!

121
00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.279
Everybody, run outside!

122
00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.679
Conan!

123
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.079
Conan.

124
00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:25.379
And, did you figure out what caused the fire?

125
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.279
We're still checking

126
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.179
but it seems that the fire

127
00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:31.679
was ignited by the liqueur inside the bottles that fell off this shelf

128
00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:33.279
that had a high concentrate of alcohol and spread.

129
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.579
Inspector Yuminaga.

130
00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:38.079
She is the joint manager, Ms. Mayuko Sakura.

131
00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:40.779
Could you explain how the fire started?

132
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:43.979
The chocolate fruit liqueur suddenly caught fire.

133
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.279
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised

134
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.579
bumped into the shelf and the bottles fell.

135
00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:50.979
Then... Tsujimoto...

136
00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:53.379
The contents seem liqueur

137
00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:56.379
made by soaking a fruit called Nahureka in spirytus.

138
00:08:56.379 --> 00:09:01.179
Spirytus? You mean vodka with an alcohol concentrate of 96%?

139
00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:03.579
Inspector, we've found that the clothes

140
00:09:03.579 --> 00:09:05.379
that Mr. Tsujimoto was wearing

141
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.679
was made of extremely flammable pile fabric velvet.

142
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.779
It's my fault.

143
00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:14.879
I'm the one who chose the fabric for his new cook's coat.

144
00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.979
I had no idea that something like this would happen.

145
00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:21.379
Mayuko, let's go over there and rest a while, okay?

146
00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:24.379
You don't mind, do you? Inspector Yuminaga.

147
00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:25.879
No.

148
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:29.979
Inspector, is it possible that the fire was ignited by static?

149
00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:33.579
The alcohol of the liqueur that vaporized

150
00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:35.779
ignited from static of the outfit.

151
00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:39.079
Mr. Tsujimoto who was surprised bumped into the shelf,

152
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:43.079
then the bottles fell and the alcohol spread over the floor,

153
00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:45.379
causing an outburst of fire.

154
00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.379
Furthermore, the fire spread over to Mr. Tsujimoto

155
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:52.079
who was wearing a flammable outfit?

156
00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:56.179
Mr. Inspector, don't you think that it's too early to conclude that

157
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.879
it was an accident caused by static electricity,

158
00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.879
just because you can't find anything else?

159
00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.179
Keep your nose out of the investigation, brat!

160
00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:04.179
Hey, brat!

161
00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:06.079
Wrong. Back then,

162
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:07.479
the fire broke out as soon as it touched the liqueur,

163
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:09.979
and a huge blaze went up immediately.

164
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.979
The shells of pistachio nuts?

165
00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:15.979
Why would something like this be here?

166
00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:19.679
Over here too.

167
00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:23.479
Maybe the shells were placed under the bottles of Nahureka

168
00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:26.579
so that they would crack easily.

169
00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:29.479
Brat, don't make me repeat myself.

170
00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:31.879
The crime site's not a park, you know.

171
00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:34.179
Mayuko, does it hurt?

172
00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:36.179
What seems to be the matter?

173
00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:40.879
When the fire spread, it burned Mayuko's sleeve too.

174
00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.179
I'm just fine.

175
00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.579
I put the fire out right away by myself, you see.

176
00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:49.579
Uh, why did Mayuko's clothes burn too?

177
00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:51.979
We're all virtually not burned.

178
00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:53.879
True. Just to be sure,

179
00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:57.279
will you please explain what happened back then?

180
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.879
When the fire spread

181
00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:01.179
and I was about to flee together with Sonoko

182
00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:03.279
and the others, my sleeve suddenly caught fire.

183
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.779
Sparks of fire probably came flying.

184
00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:10.279
Which means that Ms. Sakura, you were not near Mr. Tsujimoto?

185
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.279
No.

186
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.779
I'm sure that after giving the silver pot

187
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:16.479
to Mr. Tsujimoto, she came over to where Sonoko was.

188
00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:19.079
It's true that back then,

189
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.979
Mayuko was near Sonoko right through.

190
00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:25.479
Come to think of it, after Mr. Tsujimoto poured

191
00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:26.979
the water into the container of chocolate,

192
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.979
his facial expression looked strange.

193
00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:33.579
It looked as if something he didn't expect had happened.

194
00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:37.579
Inspector, this was found near the corpse.

195
00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:39.279
What's this?

196
00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.879
It's the burnt remains of steel wool.

197
00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:43.479
Steel wool?

198
00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.279
Why would something like this be here?

199
00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:49.779
A pot scrubber was made of steel wool was found in the kitchen.

200
00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:53.279
Sir, what's this?

201
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.879
-What is it, sonny? -What is it now?

202
00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:58.979
It looks to be a non-woven fabric.

203
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:01.879
This is material that is used to make packaging materials.

204
00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:05.679
It's usually used as bags for deodorants.

205
00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.679
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

206
00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.779
Don't you think it's strange, though?

207
00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.179
Why would something like deodorant be here?

208
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:16.679
Deodorant was also found inside the refrigerator in the kitchen.

209
00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:18.679
It's probably the same thing.

210
00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.879
Nothing's strange about something

211
00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:22.179
that was in the kitchen being here, is there?

212
00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:24.279
So, out you go!

213
00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.279
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:30.479
No, wrong. If that was a deodorant bag.

215
00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:38.279
There's something crystallized in the pot. Is it salt?

216
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.579
I get it. Salt, deodorant, steel wool...

217
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:46.679
Just one more, if that piece is found.

218
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.279
Inspector.

219
00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:51.479
It would be safe to say that the fire was caused by static electricity.

220
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.979
We found that Mr. Tsujimoto's scarf was made of nylon fabric.

221
00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:56.579
I see.

222
00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:58.579
Nylon material when combined with cotton fabric

223
00:12:58.579 --> 00:13:00.879
such as velvet

224
00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:04.279
is prone to cause static electricity.

225
00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.779
So, it's been concluded that this was an accident

226
00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:07.379
caused by static electricity.

227
00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:10.079
I still think it's better that you go to the doctor to be examined.

228
00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:12.079
I'm fine, no big deal.

229
00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.179
-But... -Hey, Inspector,

230
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.479
just how long do you intend to keep people who are hurt go untreated?

231
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.779
Yeah... I guess we now have an idea

232
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:20.979
of the cause of the fire, so I think it's okay to let you go.

233
00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:22.679
No good. If things are left as is,

234
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:25.379
this case will be closed as a simple accident.

235
00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:27.879
Let's go, Mayuko.

236
00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:32.479
If my deduction is correct, I'm sure it's still here.

237
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.779
Oh no! Ants are by the chocolate

238
00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:37.079
that is evidence of the case.

239
00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:39.279
Really?

240
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:41.579
Huh? There aren't any.

241
00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:46.279
Strange. I'm sure I saw a black one moving.

242
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.979
Don't you think that you should take the evidence

243
00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:51.079
and store it before ants get to it?

244
00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:53.379
Maybe so...

245
00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:00.479
No doubt about it, this is not an accident.

246
00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:02.979
It's a carefully schemed homicide.

247
00:14:11.988 --> 00:14:13.988
Come, Mayuko.

248
00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.188
Okay.

249
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.688
Come to think of it, where did that glasses brat go?

250
00:14:26.588 --> 00:14:28.588
Wait a sec!

251
00:14:28.588 --> 00:14:30.088
Sonoko?

252
00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:32.088
I've figured out

253
00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:34.788
the trick that killed Mr. Tsujimoto.

254
00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:37.288
Hey, sis, this is an accident.

255
00:14:37.288 --> 00:14:38.688
There's no mistake to conclude that

256
00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:41.088
static electricity caused the fire.

257
00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:43.088
Inspector, how gullible, too sweet.

258
00:14:43.088 --> 00:14:44.088
Too sweet?

259
00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:46.988
Sweeter than chocolate with a lot of milk in it!

260
00:14:46.988 --> 00:14:50.988
Okay, then tell me of that trick you have in mind.

261
00:14:50.988 --> 00:14:52.988
That's more like it.

262
00:14:52.988 --> 00:14:55.688
First, I'll start with what the real cause of the fire was.

263
00:14:55.688 --> 00:14:58.688
I'll explain the trick of how the fire started.

264
00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:02.088
Of all the evidence that was found on site,

265
00:15:02.088 --> 00:15:04.288
there are three things that served as the key.

266
00:15:04.288 --> 00:15:08.888
The deodorant, the salt crystal and foil.

267
00:15:08.888 --> 00:15:12.888
The salt crystal and foil? Just what're you getting at?

268
00:15:12.888 --> 00:15:15.888
The salt crystal was inside the silver pot.

269
00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:16.988
As for the aluminium foil

270
00:15:16.988 --> 00:15:19.588
you took it a while ago.

271
00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:21.888
Together with the melted chocolate.

272
00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:23.488
Oh, here it is.

273
00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:24.688
True.

274
00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:27.688
I'll entertain you a bit now, then.

275
00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.888
Conan, will you get that for me!

276
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:34.288
Okay. Since Sonoko told me to, I made this.

277
00:15:35.288 --> 00:15:37.488
Ran, will you please pour water in the teapot

278
00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:40.888
into all the aluminium cups except for the one at the very top?

279
00:15:40.888 --> 00:15:41.988
Okay.

280
00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:47.388
Oh, that's enough.

281
00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:00.288
What?

282
00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:01.888
This is a remake of the ignition device

283
00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:04.488
that was used in the incident.

284
00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:07.688
What on earth is going on?

285
00:16:07.688 --> 00:16:10.188
There is steel wool underneath the folded crane.

286
00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:13.888
It's bright red... Is that how the crane burned?

287
00:16:13.888 --> 00:16:18.388
There's activated carbon in the cup below.

288
00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:21.488
And, the water in the pot is salt water.

289
00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:24.588
I see, an air cell.

290
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:27.088
It's a phenomenon in which a chemical reaction occurs

291
00:16:27.088 --> 00:16:29.788
when aluminum is mixed with salt water to produce electricity.

292
00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:32.988
The same resources necessary to make the air cell

293
00:16:32.988 --> 00:16:35.188
has been found at the site, you know!

294
00:16:35.188 --> 00:16:37.488
Now, we know what generated the electricity,

295
00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:39.888
but what caused the fire?

296
00:16:39.888 --> 00:16:44.788
Inspector, when electricity goes through steel wool it ignites, you know.

297
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:48.488
In other words, the cause of the fire wasn't static electricity,

298
00:16:48.488 --> 00:16:51.988
but rather, an ignition device that was made by using all these resources.

299
00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:55.588
Ms. Mayuko, what was supposed to happen

300
00:16:55.588 --> 00:16:57.288
to the swan chocolate after water

301
00:16:57.288 --> 00:16:59.288
was poured inside it to begin with?

302
00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:00.688
Well...

303
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.788
Back then, Mr. Tsujimoto said,

304
00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:06.388
"Let me take you on a journey to the distant Milky Way."

305
00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:08.088
If I'm not mistaken, to start with,

306
00:17:08.088 --> 00:17:10.888
there was dry ice inside it.

307
00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:13.388
When the water was poured in, white fog

308
00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:16.288
was supposed to drift out causing an illusionary Milky Way performance.

309
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.888
But the culprit, in place of the dry ice

310
00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:22.088
set up an ignition device using air cells.

311
00:17:22.088 --> 00:17:24.088
However, Mr. Tsujimoto totally unaware

312
00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:26.088
of this poured the salt water in himself.

313
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.488
The electricity passed through the steel wool and caught fire,

314
00:17:28.488 --> 00:17:31.688
then the fire spread to the fruit liqueur making things worst.

315
00:17:31.688 --> 00:17:33.488
But if Mr. Tsujimoto, wasn't so surprised by the fire,

316
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:36.388
and bump into the shelf, that made the bottles fall,

317
00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:39.688
the fire wouldn't have spread as much as it did.

318
00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:42.588
The bottle was rigged to begin with pistachio nuts

319
00:17:42.588 --> 00:17:45.888
placed under it so that it would crack easily.

320
00:17:45.888 --> 00:17:49.488
It's true that pistachio nut shells were found on the shelf.

321
00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:50.588
What?

322
00:17:50.588 --> 00:17:53.588
But that's not all the trap that the culprit set up.

323
00:17:53.588 --> 00:17:55.888
Something else was set up from the very beginning.

324
00:17:55.888 --> 00:17:57.288
What?

325
00:17:57.288 --> 00:18:00.288
Ran, try hard and remember.

326
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.688
Back then, was Mr. Tsujimoto that surprised

327
00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:05.588
just because the fruit liqueur caught fire?

328
00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:08.988
Hold it... The fruit liqueur caught fire

329
00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:12.188
and Mr. Tsujimoto bumped into the shelf.

330
00:18:12.188 --> 00:18:15.788
That's right. But before that a big blaze went up for an instant.

331
00:18:15.788 --> 00:18:18.088
What? Are you sure about that?

332
00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:22.588
Yes. After that the bottle fell causing a large blaze.

333
00:18:22.588 --> 00:18:25.288
Therefore, I think my memory was a bit mixed up.

334
00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:27.088
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:29.788
Oh, well, at a scene where something like that happened,

336
00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:31.388
it can't be helped.

337
00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:35.088
But, how was that large blazed caused?

338
00:18:35.088 --> 00:18:37.288
The culprit placed a paper container

339
00:18:37.288 --> 00:18:40.088
with spyritus inside it under the table.

340
00:18:40.088 --> 00:18:43.188
That way, alcohol can be made to vaporize in the space

341
00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:46.588
that is covered by the tablecloth and spread throughout.

342
00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:49.788
And just before the show if the tablecloth

343
00:18:49.788 --> 00:18:52.288
is flipped up to release the vaporized alcohol.

344
00:18:52.288 --> 00:18:56.288
It'll ignite to the fire of the fruit liqueur which caused the outbreak.

345
00:18:56.288 --> 00:19:00.288
Ms. Mayuko, you were fixing the tablecloth

346
00:19:00.288 --> 00:19:02.288
before the show began, weren't you?

347
00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.788
Right.

348
00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:07.588
Ms. Mayuko Sakura, the culprit is you!

349
00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:12.488
Oh no... Ms. Mayuko is?

350
00:19:12.488 --> 00:19:15.088
Ms. Sonoko, please cut out your jokes.

351
00:19:15.088 --> 00:19:17.888
I got burnt like this too, didn't I?

352
00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:19.088
No,

353
00:19:19.088 --> 00:19:23.388
that's indeed evidence of you being the culprit.

354
00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:28.088
Your sleeve got burnt when you set the liqueur under the table,

355
00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:30.788
because your sleeve was smeared with alcohol.

356
00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:34.788
I see. That's why only the sleeve of her outfit caught fire.

357
00:19:34.788 --> 00:19:37.488
That's just an assumption!

358
00:19:37.488 --> 00:19:42.088
Ms. Sakura, will you please explain what's going on?

359
00:19:42.088 --> 00:19:45.388
Don't tell me that even you the police suspect me?

360
00:19:45.388 --> 00:19:47.488
Besides, that ignition device or what

361
00:19:47.488 --> 00:19:50.088
that you're talking about was made of items found in the kitchen!

362
00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:52.188
So, it's natural you would find it at the scene of the crime, isn't it?

363
00:19:52.188 --> 00:19:54.988
Of course it's natural, because that's exactly

364
00:19:54.988 --> 00:19:59.088
what you were going for when you made that crafty device.

365
00:19:59.088 --> 00:20:01.188
This shop is scheduled to open tomorrow!

366
00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:03.988
Many people went in out including delivery people,

367
00:20:03.988 --> 00:20:06.188
and facility management personnel!

368
00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:09.388
I'm sure that anyone of them would've been able to commit the crime, no?

369
00:20:09.388 --> 00:20:12.488
No, only you could've done it!

370
00:20:12.488 --> 00:20:13.588
Huh?

371
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.388
Ran, can you get me my cell phone

372
00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:16.788
that is inside my pochette.

373
00:20:16.788 --> 00:20:19.588
-Okay. -Please show Mayuko the picture

374
00:20:19.588 --> 00:20:22.788
I took with my cell phone a while ago.

375
00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.788
The picture. Oh, this.

376
00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:30.488
Just before the show started,

377
00:20:30.488 --> 00:20:33.388
Mr. Tsujimoto drank the water from the pot.

378
00:20:33.388 --> 00:20:37.588
If the water was salt water, he would've naturally noticed.

379
00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:42.588
You're the only person who could've added salt to the pot after that!

380
00:20:47.188 --> 00:20:52.088
I was nothing more than a tool to him.

381
00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:53.588
The time has finally come

382
00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:56.088
for our dream to come true.

383
00:20:56.088 --> 00:21:00.088
Yeah, I'm standing at the pinnacle as a chocolatier of Japan,

384
00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.088
who has a shop in the first class district of Tokyo.

385
00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:07.288
I think it's about time that you think about our wedding too.

386
00:21:07.288 --> 00:21:10.288
Wedding?

387
00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:13.688
Don't tell me you're being manipulated by the media too?

388
00:21:14.988 --> 00:21:17.888
I'm really grateful for all you did.

389
00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:22.088
You dished out a lot of ideas so that I could achieve success.

390
00:21:22.088 --> 00:21:25.388
You're a top-notch drawer.

391
00:21:25.388 --> 00:21:27.288
A drawer?

392
00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:29.888
But, my dream's been realized.

393
00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:33.288
The best position, the best shop.

394
00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.488
I've gotten hold of everything.

395
00:21:35.488 --> 00:21:39.588
I don't need any old drawers anymore.

396
00:21:40.588 --> 00:21:42.088
Oh no.

397
00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:45.388
You're to be disposed of along with the opening of the shop.

398
00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.488
Thank you for everything till now.

399
00:21:52.688 --> 00:21:55.188
I loved him.

400
00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:58.888
I gave him my all and did everything I could do.

401
00:21:58.888 --> 00:22:01.188
And yet, he had the nerve to dispose of me

402
00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:04.988
as if disposing of something that he found no use for anymore.

403
00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:06.688
Ms. Mayuko.

404
00:22:06.688 --> 00:22:09.988
If I was going to lose him anyway, I wanted to burn everything off.

405
00:22:09.988 --> 00:22:13.088
Him as well as the shop.

406
00:22:13.088 --> 00:22:16.988
My love too!

407
00:23:44.788 --> 00:23:48.988
Just as I thought, in the hands of "Deduction Queen Sonoko",

408
00:23:48.988 --> 00:23:51.988
all cases are solved in a jiffy.

409
00:23:53.788 --> 00:23:55.988
The chocolate of the crystallization of love that

410
00:23:55.988 --> 00:23:59.188
I was going to eat with Makoto melted in a jiffy.

411
00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:03.388
Solving cases in too much of a jiffy is not good.

412
00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:06.488
All you did was sleep.

413
00:24:07.888 --> 00:24:09.388
"Next Episode"

414
00:24:09.388 --> 00:24:12.388
Three incidents using the same method?

415
00:24:12.388 --> 00:24:15.788
Entitled, "Red Oil-based Swoosh Case"?

416
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:18.288
Somebody who has a grudge against the police.

417
00:24:19.288 --> 00:24:23.488
Doesn't that woman police officer look familiar?

418
00:24:23.488 --> 00:24:25.288
Masked Buyer.

419
00:24:25.288 --> 00:24:28.288
Officer Chiba's first love!

420
00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:30.688
That is...

421
00:24:32.388 --> 00:24:33.788
Next Conan,

422
00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:37.988
"First Love Joint Investigation (Part 1)"

423
00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:55.988
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:55.988 --> 00:24:57.888
"Air bag"

425
00:24:57.888 --> 00:24:58.988
The next episode involves the love story

426
00:24:58.988 --> 00:25:00.088
of the "you know who" police detective.

427
00:25:00.088 --> 00:25:01.888
Ran, how've you been doing with Shinichi since?

428
00:25:01.888 --> 00:25:02.988
Nothing really.
