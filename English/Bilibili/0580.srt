00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
"Beika Department Store"

2
00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:04.699
It's a phantom.

3
00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:07.099
He can't possibly be alive.

4
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.399
Because I shot Shuichi Akai to death with my very hands.

5
00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.199
Gin, right in front of your very eyes too, right?

6
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.899
It wasn't in front of my eyes.

7
00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.699
I was looking through the monitor.

8
00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.499
Back then, you could've rigged the entire scene.

9
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.099
Am I wrong, Kir?

10
00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.899
Rigged the scene?

11
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.599
Just what could I have done?

12
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:45.199
After all, you're the one who told me

13
00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.399
to summon Akai over to Raiha Pass in the first place.

14
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.099
No. Now, call him over here right now!

15
00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:57.099
Well, I'm finding it hard to stay with the Organization,

16
00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:00.399
I want out, so can you help me make it out.

17
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.899
Of course, I'll provide you the information that the FBI wants.

18
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.899
Could I meet you from now, just the two of us?

19
00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.799
Yes. As long as you're alone too,

20
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.899
I don't mind.

21
00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.899
Will this do?

22
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.499
You're the one who told me to shoot him in the head too.

23
00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.699
His head.

24
00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:27.699
Shoot the bullet right through his head!

25
00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:32.499
That way you can kill him off completely.

26
00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.899
And you watched everything from the time he bled

27
00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.699
from his head to when he fell to the ground

28
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.899
through the camera that you set on me.

29
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.399
After being rescued from the FBI,

30
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.199
I was constantly under the surveillance of the Organization,

31
00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:52.799
I couldn't possibly have made any arrangement with him either.

32
00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.499
Therefore, I couldn't possibly have done anything.

33
00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.899
Plus, if either he or I had a god-like brain

34
00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.799
that could help us see through things in the future,

35
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.899
maybe we could've worked something out.

36
00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.099
Yes, just like Sherlock Holmes.

37
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.799
Why don't you stop being so queerly suspicious

38
00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.899
and just be happy that you arch rival disappeared?

39
00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.299
Yes.

40
00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.099
I'm so overjoyed I can't contain it.

41
00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
Because if he ever happens to be alive,

42
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.799
I could kill him all over again.

43
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.199
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

44
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.399
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

45
00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.799
The time limit closes in.

46
00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.699
Figure out what the bomb man is really after.

47
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.499
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.399
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.399
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

50
00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:28.493
A strange job offer came to the Mouri Detective Agency.

51
00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:32.893
A person calls and asks Kogoro to talk to a person who is troubled

52
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:35.793
by red T-shirts that were being sent him every week.

53
00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:39.693
We went to the Beika Department Store to meet this person

54
00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:41.193
but the person waiting for us there

55
00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:43.893
was a man with a bomb wrapped around his body.

56
00:04:45.793 --> 00:04:48.693
The man says that he was threatened by a masked man

57
00:04:48.693 --> 00:04:51.493
who told him to place bombs in each place on the floor.

58
00:04:51.493 --> 00:04:54.293
We ended up being confined on this floor.

59
00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:58.993
The masked man wants to find the person

60
00:04:58.993 --> 00:05:02.193
who kept sending the red T-shirts to him every week.

61
00:05:02.193 --> 00:05:06.093
He says that the man should be on this floor.

62
00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:08.693
We checked the 13 T-shirts that were carried

63
00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:11.793
by the man with the bomb wrapped around him

64
00:05:11.793 --> 00:05:13.893
and found from the receipts

65
00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:18.493
of the T-shirts that they were all bought

66
00:05:18.493 --> 00:05:21.593
at the fitness section every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

67
00:05:22.893 --> 00:05:25.693
What is the identity of the person sending the T-shirts?

68
00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:28.193
What is his purpose?

69
00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:31.593
And who is the person looking for the sender of the T-shirts

70
00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:34.593
and turned into a bomb threat man?

71
00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:43.193
"Black Time Limit Closes In"

72
00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:44.793
Vodka.

73
00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:47.493
Park the car on the opposite side of the department store!

74
00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:50.093
In a position where the guy called Akai

75
00:05:50.093 --> 00:05:53.693
can be seen in clear view.

76
00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:55.393
What's the matter?

77
00:05:55.393 --> 00:05:56.393
Hurry and move the car.

78
00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:59.193
Well... You see...

79
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:03.093
According to Korn who's on guard at the basement exit,

80
00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:07.093
something seems to be going on in the department store.

81
00:06:07.093 --> 00:06:10.893
Hey, Korn don't you have more information?

82
00:06:10.893 --> 00:06:17.393
No, but, I saw a lot of riot police officers

83
00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:20.393
and bomb disassembling officers go inside.

84
00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:23.893
Riot police officers and bomb disassembling officers?

85
00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:26.393
What's going on?

86
00:06:26.393 --> 00:06:28.893
What on earth?

87
00:06:28.893 --> 00:06:30.893
"Beika Department Store"

88
00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:48.193
Please wait!

89
00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:51.693
The person who received red underwear every week,

90
00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:55.093
wants us to find the sender among these people.

91
00:06:55.093 --> 00:06:58.293
You do understand that the demand of the bomb man, don't you?

92
00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.693
Yes.

93
00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:01.893
The receipts that were found together

94
00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:03.693
with the T-shirts are those of this department store.

95
00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:06.193
And the only section that sells wears on this floor

96
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.893
is the fitness goods section!

97
00:07:08.893 --> 00:07:10.693
Moreover, the time that the wears are bought

98
00:07:10.693 --> 00:07:14.693
are always the same as today, every Sunday at 12:28 pm!

99
00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:18.593
And to top it off, you're the only salesclerk

100
00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:22.093
that's on duty on Sunday at this time, am I right?

101
00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:23.693
Yes...

102
00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:27.093
Then, why don't you remember that customer?

103
00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.793
You'd think he'd leave an impression on you, wouldn't he?

104
00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:31.393
Because he comes to buy the same thing

105
00:07:31.393 --> 00:07:33.993
at the same hour and day each time!

106
00:07:33.993 --> 00:07:37.593
But, I really don't recall such a person.

107
00:07:37.593 --> 00:07:40.893
Darn, no way.

108
00:07:42.093 --> 00:07:46.493
That red underwear has not been sold yet today.

109
00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:48.193
Then, at that time,

110
00:07:48.193 --> 00:07:52.493
did you have someone take your place, or something?

111
00:07:52.493 --> 00:07:55.193
Not for the past 6 months!

112
00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:58.993
Then, is this receipt from some years ago?

113
00:07:58.993 --> 00:08:02.293
No, because we've been using

114
00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:05.493
this type of receipt this year.

115
00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:10.193
All I do is get the items and payment from the customers

116
00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:14.493
and give them to Ms. Seta at the cash register.

117
00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:18.593
Then, I put the receipt and change in the bag together

118
00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:21.393
with the purchased items and give them to the customer.

119
00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:27.493
So if such a queer customer were to come by,

120
00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:31.493
I'm sure I'd never forget.

121
00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:32.993
But...

122
00:08:32.993 --> 00:08:36.693
We have the receipts proving they were here.

123
00:08:36.693 --> 00:08:39.093
Excuse me...

124
00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:41.393
The bomb man!

125
00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:42.993
Stay away from me!

126
00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:47.093
Stop calling me bomb man, please!

127
00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:50.693
I'm not the bomb man but rather,

128
00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:52.893
a sinless ordinary citizen who had a bomb

129
00:08:52.893 --> 00:08:55.793
wrapped around my body.

130
00:08:56.893 --> 00:08:58.293
That's why

131
00:08:58.293 --> 00:09:03.193
I'm telling you to stay away from me until this case is solved, aren't I?

132
00:09:03.193 --> 00:09:04.993
Oh, yes.

133
00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:07.893
But the boy with the glasses

134
00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:12.593
is playing around with the red T-shirt.

135
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.393
Playing around?

136
00:09:23.993 --> 00:09:25.893
What're you doing?

137
00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:28.593
Just like you did a while ago, Ran.

138
00:09:28.593 --> 00:09:32.393
I just tried folding it according to the crease.

139
00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:37.993
But, when they're lined out, they look kind of eerie, right?

140
00:09:37.993 --> 00:09:41.393
Remember? Like in the Holmes novel.

141
00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:42.793
"The Adventure of the Dancing Men"?

142
00:09:42.793 --> 00:09:45.693
Right, just like the code in that novel!

143
00:09:45.693 --> 00:09:48.293
Then, this could be a code too?

144
00:09:48.293 --> 00:09:51.193
If you read it from the right in the order they were sent

145
00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:54.093
maybe there's a sentence?

146
00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.593
-Really, -It hurts...

147
00:09:55.593 --> 00:09:58.493
the minute I take my eyes off of you!

148
00:09:58.493 --> 00:10:01.093
Dad.

149
00:10:01.093 --> 00:10:03.593
I told you to stay still, didn't I?

150
00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:08.793
But, when Conan fold the shirts according to the crease...

151
00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:10.693
He says it could be a code.

152
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.393
A code?

153
00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:15.193
It couldn't be.

154
00:10:15.193 --> 00:10:18.893
We don't even know when the creases were made either!

155
00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:25.693
What?

156
00:10:25.693 --> 00:10:28.293
The sender of red underwear?

157
00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:29.893
Yes, sir!

158
00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:33.693
That seems to be the purpose of the bomb man.

159
00:10:33.693 --> 00:10:36.793
And? How many bombs are there?

160
00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:39.093
According to the image on the surveillance camera

161
00:10:39.093 --> 00:10:42.693
there's one at each of the two elevators and two stairs.

162
00:10:42.693 --> 00:10:44.593
Adding the upward and downward escalators,

163
00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:47.193
we're looking at six places at least.

164
00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:49.193
Six places?

165
00:10:49.193 --> 00:10:51.193
What a hassle.

166
00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:52.493
Strange, right?

167
00:10:52.493 --> 00:10:55.393
Although the floor was sealed because of a bomb threat,

168
00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:57.993
the information's leaking out too fast.

169
00:10:57.993 --> 00:10:59.993
True.

170
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.493
-Besides... -Can't be!

171
00:11:02.493 --> 00:11:04.293
You're on the floor where the bomb is?

172
00:11:04.293 --> 00:11:06.793
Hey... Can you make calls?

173
00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:08.993
The bomb man is here, isn't he?

174
00:11:08.993 --> 00:11:12.593
The cell phones of the customers haven't been taken away.

175
00:11:12.593 --> 00:11:15.593
Maybe the culprit's an amateur?

176
00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:16.893
I sure hope so.

177
00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:19.793
Idiot! You gotta be kidding!

178
00:11:19.793 --> 00:11:21.393
I'm not kidding!

179
00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:23.393
There, take a look for yourself!

180
00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:26.493
TV telephone.

181
00:11:26.493 --> 00:11:31.393
You see the man with a bomb wrapped around his body, don't you?

182
00:11:31.393 --> 00:11:33.293
No joke?

183
00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:36.393
Shu!

184
00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:42.393
Transform!

185
00:11:43.693 --> 00:11:44.893
There!

186
00:11:49.193 --> 00:11:52.393
Hey, what're you doing?

187
00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:55.593
Well...

188
00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:59.293
I tried moving according to the shape of the wear.

189
00:11:59.293 --> 00:12:01.293
But, I'm getting nowhere.

190
00:12:01.293 --> 00:12:02.993
Never mind doing something like that.

191
00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:06.693
Will you just hurry and find the sender of the T-shirts!

192
00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.393
Right...

193
00:12:08.393 --> 00:12:09.693
But...

194
00:12:09.693 --> 00:12:12.193
Don't you think that Dad's movements

195
00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:13.693
just now resembled something?

196
00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:15.193
What?

197
00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.393
Right!

198
00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:19.993
Maybe Conan would be able to figure out what it is.

199
00:12:19.993 --> 00:12:22.393
Gosh, he's gone again!

200
00:12:25.393 --> 00:12:26.793
I see!

201
00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.693
When you get the items from the customers,

202
00:12:29.693 --> 00:12:33.493
you take it to the cashier beyond?

203
00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:34.993
Yes, it is.

204
00:12:34.993 --> 00:12:37.793
After saying, "One moment, please!"

205
00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:41.093
Thanks for telling me!

206
00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.193
See you!

207
00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:48.293
Excuse me!

208
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:51.093
Wait...

209
00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:52.093
Son...

210
00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:55.393
So, this is what the inside of the cash register room!

211
00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:58.293
Excuse me...

212
00:12:58.293 --> 00:13:00.693
I'm going to borrow your computer a bit!

213
00:13:00.693 --> 00:13:02.493
For what?

214
00:13:02.493 --> 00:13:06.793
Pops told me to check something out!

215
00:13:06.793 --> 00:13:12.793
On the accident on the snowy mountain on December 28th, right?

216
00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.193
Yes.

217
00:13:20.293 --> 00:13:23.193
Here it is! I'm sure this is it!

218
00:13:27.893 --> 00:13:30.793
It's an accident that happened 10 years ago.

219
00:13:30.793 --> 00:13:32.793
A veteran mountain climber

220
00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:35.593
seems to have gotten caught in an avalanche and died!

221
00:13:38.893 --> 00:13:40.393
All right!

222
00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:41.593
Is that it?

223
00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:42.993
Yes!

224
00:13:42.993 --> 00:13:46.993
I'll go tell Pops that it was just as he thought!

225
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.293
I see.

226
00:13:51.093 --> 00:13:53.893
Thank you, Ms. Maruoka!

227
00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:01.493
I've figured out what the sender is after.

228
00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:05.893
Next, I've got to figure out the motive of the bomb man.

229
00:14:05.893 --> 00:14:09.093
What is purpose for causing such a commotion?

230
00:14:09.093 --> 00:14:13.593
All I can do is to wait and see what the bomb man's next step.

231
00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:14.893
At any rate, I guess I'm not wrong to think

232
00:14:14.893 --> 00:14:18.193
that the bomb man is very confident.

233
00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.293
He's confident that the crime he committed in the past

234
00:14:22.293 --> 00:14:25.793
will never be disclosed.

235
00:14:27.393 --> 00:14:31.393
Really, where were you?

236
00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:33.193
To the restroom.

237
00:14:33.193 --> 00:14:34.393
Gosh.

238
00:14:34.393 --> 00:14:37.393
Right, it won't be revealed.

239
00:14:37.393 --> 00:14:39.493
My crime is perfect.

240
00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:42.893
There is no proof or eye-witnesses either.

241
00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:45.493
You imbecile that's trying to threaten me!

242
00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:48.593
I'll make sure you won't be able to do something like this again.

243
00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:53.393
And, did anything else come up?

244
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.193
No, not at all.

245
00:14:56.193 --> 00:14:58.093
Thanks to you skittering here and there,

246
00:14:58.093 --> 00:15:01.093
I can't organize anything in my head.

247
00:15:01.093 --> 00:15:04.893
Dad, you blaming it on Conan.

248
00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:09.593
It's all because you used the money from the client on sushi.

249
00:15:09.593 --> 00:15:12.693
Now, you're blaming it on Ran.

250
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:14.093
Shut up!

251
00:15:14.093 --> 00:15:17.293
All I've gotta do is think, right! I'll think!

252
00:15:19.493 --> 00:15:22.193
Please excuse me.

253
00:15:24.593 --> 00:15:27.593
Snow mountain, after all.

254
00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:20.773
Why won't you let me in?

255
00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:22.773
I can't tell you.

256
00:16:28.773 --> 00:16:31.873
So, he's sealed the floor off with bombs.

257
00:16:31.873 --> 00:16:36.073
Yes. It seems that some idiot is doing it.

258
00:16:36.073 --> 00:16:39.573
It seems he demanding for someone to be found.

259
00:16:39.573 --> 00:16:42.173
Since there is no sign of the guy who looks like Akai

260
00:16:42.173 --> 00:16:44.873
coming out of the department store at all.

261
00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:48.373
I take it that the guy is on that floor too.

262
00:16:57.573 --> 00:16:59.773
We've got a problem, don't we?

263
00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:03.573
Even if the bomb man is caught, or if the bomb goes off,

264
00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:06.573
the exit would be crowded with chaos.

265
00:17:06.573 --> 00:17:10.173
I wonder if we'll be able to get the guy in the commotion.

266
00:17:10.173 --> 00:17:13.173
No, it's even better for us.

267
00:17:13.173 --> 00:17:16.773
The murderous intent of the sniper will be erased by the crowd,

268
00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:19.973
and make it hard for him to flee even if he wanted to.

269
00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:23.273
For Chianti who is waiting right above here

270
00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:26.473
and Korn who is waiting at the basement exit,

271
00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:28.973
he's an easy prey to hunt down.

272
00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:32.273
Hey, does he know about this?

273
00:17:32.273 --> 00:17:34.973
He? Just who are you referring to?

274
00:17:34.973 --> 00:17:36.373
Bourbon.

275
00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:39.773
I heard that he went out to look for the scientist Sherry,

276
00:17:39.773 --> 00:17:41.773
who betrayed the Organization.

277
00:17:41.773 --> 00:17:43.373
I wonder...

278
00:17:43.373 --> 00:17:47.273
He's secretive just like Vermouth.

279
00:17:47.273 --> 00:17:50.373
I have no idea where or what they're doing.

280
00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:54.473
Come to think of it, Bourbon didn't like Akai either.

281
00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.773
Even more than you do, Gin.

282
00:17:56.773 --> 00:18:00.073
Well, as for his whereabouts I had no intention of telling

283
00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:02.473
even if I knew where he is.

284
00:18:02.473 --> 00:18:04.773
What? Why not?

285
00:18:04.773 --> 00:18:09.173
He refused to believe that Akai was dead.

286
00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:12.773
He can't help but think he's the only one

287
00:18:12.773 --> 00:18:15.173
who could finish Akai.

288
00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:22.173
If the guy in question is Akai, he would snicker.

289
00:18:22.173 --> 00:18:26.573
I'd rather not see his face again.

290
00:18:34.973 --> 00:18:37.173
Hey, enough already!

291
00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:39.373
Right!

292
00:18:39.373 --> 00:18:42.273
How long is it going to take, anyway?

293
00:18:42.273 --> 00:18:46.073
You're the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

294
00:18:46.073 --> 00:18:48.273
Hurry up and find sender of the red T-shirts

295
00:18:48.273 --> 00:18:51.373
that the bomb man is looking for

296
00:18:51.373 --> 00:18:54.273
and let us go home!

297
00:18:54.273 --> 00:18:56.273
Oh, well...

298
00:18:56.273 --> 00:18:58.973
I still have no idea who the sender of the T-shirts is,

299
00:18:58.973 --> 00:19:02.373
or anything about who the bomb man is either.

300
00:19:06.473 --> 00:19:07.573
Mail?

301
00:19:07.573 --> 00:19:10.373
I've never seen this address before.

302
00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:14.573
What? Can't be...

303
00:19:18.173 --> 00:19:21.673
No...

304
00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:27.673
Wait, dad!

305
00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:29.773
That's right near the bomb.

306
00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:32.573
I'll be fine.

307
00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:35.173
I won't let the bomb go off.

308
00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:40.773
In the name of the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

309
00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:43.173
Then, don't tell me you've figured out

310
00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:46.173
who the sender of the red T-shirts is?

311
00:19:46.173 --> 00:19:49.773
But, you just said a while ago that you had no idea.

312
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:54.973
Yes, the invisible sender and invisible bomb man.

313
00:19:54.973 --> 00:19:58.773
That's where the key to solving this case was!

314
00:20:03.273 --> 00:20:06.773
What? There was movement on the confined floor?

315
00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:09.273
Yes, it just so happened

316
00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:11.873
that Detective Kogoro Mouri was on the floor.

317
00:20:11.873 --> 00:20:15.373
What? The Sleeping Kogoro?

318
00:20:15.373 --> 00:20:18.573
I hope he somehow stops the bomb from exploding.

319
00:20:18.573 --> 00:20:22.673
I know it's a hassle but we're counting on you, Detective Mouri!

320
00:20:22.673 --> 00:20:25.073
Don't you think it's strange?

321
00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:30.573
If you look at the receipts that were sent along with the red underwear,

322
00:20:30.573 --> 00:20:32.973
it's easy to tell that they were purchased

323
00:20:32.973 --> 00:20:37.573
every Sunday at 12:28 pm.

324
00:20:37.573 --> 00:20:40.473
If you want to figure out who the sender is,

325
00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:42.173
just come to that floor where the item is sold

326
00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:47.873
at the time indicated secretly and the sender will eventually appear.

327
00:20:47.873 --> 00:20:50.973
I'm sure that the sender didn't show up.

328
00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:53.673
That's why the culprit knocked that man out in the men's room

329
00:20:53.673 --> 00:20:57.473
and wrapped the bomb, and told him to look for the sender.

330
00:20:57.473 --> 00:20:59.273
That's what's weird.

331
00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:00.773
What?

332
00:21:00.773 --> 00:21:03.773
In order to wrap a bomb around someone's body,

333
00:21:03.773 --> 00:21:06.373
you've got to be somewhere that nobody will see you.

334
00:21:06.373 --> 00:21:11.073
By doing so, you'll have to take your eyes off the fitness section.

335
00:21:11.073 --> 00:21:15.073
Would I, who is desperately looking for the sender

336
00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:19.173
even to the point of using bombs, do something like that?

337
00:21:19.173 --> 00:21:23.073
True, but, if the bomb man had an accomplice

338
00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.073
and that person was watching.

339
00:21:25.073 --> 00:21:28.573
There's none! Take a good look around!

340
00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:36.373
Everybody's using the cell phone all over the place, see?

341
00:21:36.373 --> 00:21:40.373
If someone wanted to take control of the floor had an accomplice,

342
00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:43.473
he would never let them do something like that.

343
00:21:43.473 --> 00:21:44.673
Then...

344
00:21:44.673 --> 00:21:47.373
Maybe he wrapped the bomb around

345
00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:50.973
that man's body before 12:28 pm and got ready?

346
00:21:50.973 --> 00:21:54.573
No, the bomb was actually more like a last resort thing.

347
00:21:54.573 --> 00:21:56.873
As for the bombs on the floor,

348
00:21:56.873 --> 00:22:00.273
it'll be okay if they're retrieved before exploding

349
00:22:00.273 --> 00:22:03.473
but it's too risky to wrap a bomb around someone's body beforehand

350
00:22:03.473 --> 00:22:07.973
under the circumstance that the sender may show up.

351
00:22:10.173 --> 00:22:13.573
But, the bomb man is alone, isn't he?

352
00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:16.673
How could he ever wrap the bomb around the man's body

353
00:22:16.673 --> 00:22:19.473
while keeping an eye on the place where the item is sold?

354
00:22:19.473 --> 00:22:21.973
He didn't wrap it here but rather,

355
00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:24.973
came here with it wrapped around his body.

356
00:22:24.973 --> 00:22:28.673
With it wrapped around... It can't be...

357
00:22:28.673 --> 00:22:30.873
Don't tell me that...

358
00:22:30.873 --> 00:22:33.273
Isn't that right?

359
00:22:33.273 --> 00:22:35.773
Bomb man?

360
00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:41.073
Mr. Ordinary Citizen?

361
00:24:04.473 --> 00:24:07.473
Mail from somebody he doesn't know?

362
00:24:10.273 --> 00:24:13.173
What's up? What's the rush?

363
00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:17.173
Don't tell me you're looking for the same person I am?

364
00:24:18.173 --> 00:24:19.373
No, Shu!

365
00:24:19.373 --> 00:24:21.073
Don't go out.

366
00:24:21.073 --> 00:24:23.173
They're coming after you!

367
00:24:23.173 --> 00:24:25.473
Please stop!

368
00:24:25.473 --> 00:24:28.473
Akai Shuichi.

369
00:24:28.473 --> 00:24:29.973
Next Conan,

370
00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:33.222
"The Target that Sways Red"

371
00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:51.134
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:51.134 --> 00:24:53.034
"Lipstick"

373
00:24:53.034 --> 00:24:54.334
I'm putting on lipstick today.

374
00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:56.434
Don't tell me you're planning to kiss that detective kid?

375
00:24:56.434 --> 00:24:58.163
No, I'm not!
