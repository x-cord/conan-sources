1
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:14,159
Okay, then.

2
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:18,759
Please show me the card of the devil that you all have.

3
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,559
What?

4
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,759
What's the matter, Mummy?

5
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,359
I wonder if I dropped it somewhere?

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,059
You deliberately poked your card with the arrow

7
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,059
and tried to free yourself from being a suspect, right?

8
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,959
You played on the psychology that

9
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,959
nobody would think that the killer himself

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,659
would leave his devil card behind with the victim,

11
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,059
unaware that this card

12
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,859
was a one of a kind in this world,

13
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,059
that Mr. Fukuura had exclusively made!

14
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,359
I was fully aware of that too!

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,759
How'd you know?

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,159
Because...

17
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,259
I was asked by Mr. Fukuura

18
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,259
to sit among the passengers

19
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:07,659
and choose someone with great makeup on.

20
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,659
After all, I'm also a staff member of the movie!

21
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,659
What?

22
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,259
You're a movie staff member?

23
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:19,559
So I would never dream of hurting Mr. Fukuura.

24
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,859
Are you the only movie staff

25
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,459
that is mixed up among the passengers here?

26
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,859
No.

27
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,559
Almost all the other mummies besides me are staff members.

28
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,659
When we find passengers with great makeup,

29
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,659
we contacted Mr. Fukuura by e-mail.

30
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,759
Mr. Fukuura was also the one that gave us this outfit, right?

31
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,059
Yeah.

32
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,259
We received all kinds of instructions from Mr. Fukuura

33
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,759
while he was helping us with the makeup.

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,759
Instructions? What kind of instructions?

35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,659
Like, drink a certain kind of wine, et cetera.

36
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,259
I was told to eat only chicken dishes.

37
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,159
I was told to wear this red wig.

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,159
All his instructions were varied depending on the person

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,259
and the only common instruction he gave us was not to talk.

40
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,059
What kind of instruction is that supposed to be?

41
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,559
How should I know?

42
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,959
It's Mr. Fukuura's instructions!

43
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,359
But...

44
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,059
when we were waiting for the quiz,

45
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:28,959
you disappeared from before us, didn't you?

46
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,959
I went to the toilet!

47
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,259
These two were with me too!

48
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,559
Right?

49
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,059
It's true.

50
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:40,059
That you were with us when we went to the toilet.

51
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:41,559
See!

52
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,059
But...

53
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,559
I didn't see you come out of the toilet.

54
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,259
What? What are you talking about?

55
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:51,059
I passed right behind you when I left!

56
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,959
Why're you saying something like that?

57
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,059
I guess you didn't notice me

58
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,059
because somebody cracked the mirror.

59
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,059
What? You mean that mirror

60
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:05,459
wasn't cracked to begin with in order to give a creepy atmosphere?

61
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,059
Yes.

62
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:11,359
It wasn't cracked until we departed!

63
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,259
Are you sure?

64
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:15,359
Yes!

65
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,759
We, the staff, decorated this ship together.

66
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,959
But we weren't given instructions

67
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,159
to crack the mirror in the toilet.

68
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,659
Then, just before Mr. Fukuura was about to give out the quiz,

69
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,959
where were you?

70
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,659
I was here!

71
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,559
Near Werewolf! Right?

72
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,759
You saw me, didn't you?

73
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,659
I wonder. I don't remember.

74
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,359
Oh, no.

75
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:43,559
I was desperate trying to sell myself

76
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:47,059
because I wanted a part in the movie!

77
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,459
Like this!

78
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,259
Come to think of it,

79
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,359
you were roaring several times.

80
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:06,059
It seems that nobody's seen you around.

81
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:09,959
Which means you don't have an established alibi.

82
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,259
Oh, no.

83
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,659
It... It's a trap!

84
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,759
Somebody's conspired to frame me!

85
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,359
A killer who's cornered barks a lot.

86
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:27,559
Moreover, you don't have an alibi and the devil card.

87
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:30,659
Mummy, you're the only one...

88
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,359
You're the only one that could've committed the murder!

89
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,859
Detective Mouri, you're a little off there.

90
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,559
What?

91
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,259
The truth is still in the dark.

92
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,559
The voice is coming from the speaker the phantom ship captain was using!

93
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,859
Darn it!

94
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:51,159
The deck!

95
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,859
Out of my way!

96
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,259
Who is it?

97
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,959
Where are you?

98
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,959
You've already acquired everything you need

99
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,759
to solve the case and yet...

100
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,059
How disappointing.

101
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,159
Why you!

102
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:21,259
Who are you?

103
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,559
You better shut up or you're going to pay for this!

104
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,259
Have you forgotten me already?

105
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,459
It's me, Detective Mouri.

106
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,159
Invisible man!

107
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,959
Captain of this phantom ship, Captain Gold, that is,

108
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,059
the host of this party

109
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,259
and movie producer, Mr. Senzo Fukuura,

110
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,959
was killed by who?

111
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,859
And...

112
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,459
how was he killed?

113
00:07:58,059 --> 00:07:59,159
Shall we...

114
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,759
begin solving the case then?

115
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,759
That voice.

116
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,859
That tone of voice.

117
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,759
It can't be...

118
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
Under the moonlight...

119
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,759
that shines light upon the dark night.
