1
00:00:01.082 --> 00:00:03.882
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.982
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:07.582
Today's stage is a theatre.

4
00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:09.682
A crime show from projector!

5
00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.782
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.995
All five members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:59.095
came to watch the movies with the movie tickets

10
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.695
that we received from Dr. Agasa.

11
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:03.395
After some argument,

12
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:05.995
we decide to see a three-part "Gomera" movie.

13
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:10.195
However, we find out that this theatre is to be closed down today.

14
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:13.895
We turn out to be the last customers.

15
00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:15.395
But while we are enjoying the movie,

16
00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:18.695
a black shadow appears on the screen.

17
00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:21.195
Moreover,

18
00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:24.095
that corpse turns out to be that of Hatta, the real estate agent

19
00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.095
who had cornered this theatre into closing down!

20
00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:32.195
After investigations,

21
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:35.995
just when this case was about to be closed as suicide...

22
00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:39.695
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

23
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.895
I... I saw it.

24
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.495
What...

25
00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:45.195
Well...

26
00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:48.895
she was in front of the mirror of the ladies room,

27
00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:51.195
holding her eyes down as if she was crying!

28
00:02:54.595 --> 00:03:00.595
"Last Show for Murder (Part 2)"

29
00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.395
What?

30
00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:06.995
Hey, when was that?

31
00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:10.795
Just before the shadow appeared on the screen during the scene.

32
00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.695
Would you like to explain?

33
00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:15.895
Didn't you say you were in that room

34
00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.695
right through after you brought the lunch to the projection room?

35
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.895
Well, it's contact lens.

36
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:23.495
Contact lens?

37
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.695
I went to the restroom while I was boiling the water

38
00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:28.695
because my contact lens slipped out of place.

39
00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.595
Since it took me less than a minute,

40
00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.195
so I didn't mention it.

41
00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.095
Did you know that?

42
00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:42.095
No, because I was in the projection room.

43
00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:44.495
But that's nothing to be concerned over

44
00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:49.095
because she was with me the instant the shadow appeared.

45
00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.395
Inspector!

46
00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:59.295
The late Mr. Hatta, seemed to have a lot of debts due to gambling.

47
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.795
He couldn't possibly pay them all off

48
00:04:00.795 --> 00:04:03.195
even from the profit he was supposed to get

49
00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:05.695
after selling this theatre.

50
00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:07.295
According to the neighbors,

51
00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.995
they say that Mr. Hatta's real estate agency

52
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:12.195
would've gone bankrupt sooner or later.

53
00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:13.595
I see.

54
00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:17.095
So he did have a motive for committing suicide.

55
00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:19.195
He really is a nuisance.

56
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:21.595
Why doesn't he go commit suicide somewhere else?

57
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.295
Hey, stop it!

58
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.895
Suicide?

59
00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:30.095
It's true that he could've used a ladder,

60
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:34.195
put a rope through it and hung himself.

61
00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:39.395
But he didn't look like one who was considering suicide.

62
00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:41.895
Something sure bothers me.

63
00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:44.395
The temperature of the air conditioner was not set as usual,

64
00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:45.895
and that scene...

65
00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:49.895
And her strange action...

66
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.695
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

67
00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.095
What?

68
00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.195
It's a wonder you found us.

69
00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.195
The Inspector contacted me,

70
00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:05.495
so I rushed over to come pick you up.

71
00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.795
What? Where are Conan, Ayumi and Ai?

72
00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:12.795
Oh, those three are in the restroom.

73
00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:17.695
The restroom is located

74
00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:22.695
beyond the corridor on the left facing the screen.

75
00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.995
It's straight down a flight of stairs from the projection room, but...

76
00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:31.195
No matter how I think about it, I still don't understand.

77
00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:34.695
Why did that person go out of the way to here?

78
00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:38.695
Why on earth?

79
00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:40.995
Oh, my.

80
00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:44.395
It doesn't bother you, does it?

81
00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:46.995
I get chills running through my spine

82
00:05:46.995 --> 00:05:50.195
every morning I see myself in it.

83
00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:53.395
"Who are you anyway?", I ask.

84
00:05:56.095 --> 00:06:00.595
Hey! I'm this way thanks to the drug you made.

85
00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:03.995
That's true. I really am sorry.

86
00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:07.995
You, who are pursuing the truth

87
00:06:07.995 --> 00:06:11.295
is deceiving everyone.

88
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:15.095
Even this mirror that reflects everything just like it is,

89
00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:18.895
will not reflect you in your true form.

90
00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:29.195
Thanks, Ai!

91
00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:30.395
What?

92
00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:34.495
What's with Conan?

93
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.595
This is the ladies room!

94
00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:38.995
I see!

95
00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:41.395
I see! That's what it was!

96
00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:43.195
That's why that scene...

97
00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:45.295
If so...

98
00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.595
If my deductions is correct,

99
00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:49.695
that thing should be over there.

100
00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:50.995
Hey, kid?

101
00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.295
Hey!

102
00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:58.595
I got it! The ash from the cigarettes as well as cigarette butts!

103
00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.195
And...

104
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:03.695
the shoes marks on the seat in front!

105
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:05.395
There's no doubt!

106
00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:07.295
The criminal is that person.

107
00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:10.295
That person killed Mr. Hatta

108
00:07:10.295 --> 00:07:14.995
by taking full advantage of the theatre

109
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:17.995
that is a space of darkness and light.

110
00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:20.795
What? You've figured out who the criminal is?

111
00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.095
What...

112
00:07:24.695 --> 00:07:27.395
You say handkerchief?

113
00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:29.295
Are you serious, Shinichi?

114
00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:30.695
Yes.

115
00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:33.395
I also figured out the trick of darkness and light

116
00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:36.395
that the criminal used!

117
00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:39.195
But what do you intend to do?

118
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.395
I just came here,

119
00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:43.795
so I can't play the role of detective, you know?

120
00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:45.195
You'll do fine.

121
00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:49.495
All you have to do is tell them you heard about everything from me!

122
00:07:49.495 --> 00:07:52.095
And to start things off, you...

123
00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:57.695
It's not fair!

124
00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:00.795
You're the only one who ever figure everything out.

125
00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:02.495
You're running out on us again?

126
00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:05.095
You'll lose friends this way!

127
00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:07.095
Don't be angry.

128
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:11.995
I have something I'd like you all to do something this time!

129
00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:13.595
Really?

130
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.395
Inspector!

131
00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:23.795
According to one of the employees at Mr. Hatta's real estate agency,

132
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.995
it seems that he has been quite irritated recently,

133
00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:31.595
and got into a fight with the bank that he had transactions with today.

134
00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:32.995
A fight?

135
00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:33.995
Yes!

136
00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:36.395
Something about they wouldn't lend him the money

137
00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.895
to buy this theatre, that he was short some 1,000,000 yen.

138
00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:43.195
What? Which means that this theatre hasn't been sold yet?

139
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:44.195
No.

140
00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:47.295
As for the formal agreement and cash transactions,

141
00:08:47.295 --> 00:08:49.095
we were supposed to do it tomorrow.

142
00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:52.195
He was probably trying to complain about this place and pay less for it!

143
00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:54.095
What a dirty rat!

144
00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:55.695
I see.

145
00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:58.595
In addition to management difficulties he was having at his company,

146
00:08:58.595 --> 00:09:01.195
he couldn't come up with the cash for buying this place

147
00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:04.495
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

148
00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:07.495
He got sick of everything and committed suicide.

149
00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:10.995
It's not unthinkable.

150
00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:12.195
Excuse me?

151
00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:15.695
May I leave? I have another engagement.

152
00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.595
I guess it's okay, since it looks to be suicide.

153
00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:21.895
I guess so. We'll get back to you at a later date...

154
00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.295
What is it?

155
00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:26.895
Who is it? Who turned off the lights?

156
00:09:28.995 --> 00:09:30.595
Me, it's me!

157
00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.195
Oh, Dr. Agasa?

158
00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:35.095
Hey, what do you think you're doing in the projection room?

159
00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:37.395
What else?

160
00:09:37.395 --> 00:09:40.995
I'm going to do replay the trick that the criminal did!

161
00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:42.195
The criminal's...

162
00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:43.495
Trick?

163
00:09:43.495 --> 00:09:47.695
Yes. You strangled and killed Mr. Hatta in the darkness of the theatre

164
00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:49.795
that was shoving the movie,

165
00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:54.695
then you tried to prove your innocence by using the projector.

166
00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:57.895
Mr. Furuhashi! That was your trick!

167
00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:11.184
You tried to prove your innocence by using the projector.

168
00:10:11.184 --> 00:10:14.984
Mr. Furuhashi! That was your trick!

169
00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:19.484
Wait up, mister!

170
00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:22.584
Mr. Furuhashi was with me

171
00:10:22.584 --> 00:10:24.884
in the projection room when that man hung himself!

172
00:10:24.884 --> 00:10:27.284
How would you know anything about what happened

173
00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:28.284
when you weren't even here at that time?

174
00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:30.884
I more or less have an idea of what happened

175
00:10:30.884 --> 00:10:32.684
because I heard about it from this boy.

176
00:10:32.684 --> 00:10:34.284
Right, Conan?

177
00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:36.184
Yes!

178
00:10:36.184 --> 00:10:39.684
That's why I'm telling you when the shadow appeared on the screen,

179
00:10:39.684 --> 00:10:43.284
Mr. Furuhashi was with me in the projection room, understand?

180
00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:46.884
Oh, do you mean like this?

181
00:10:52.584 --> 00:10:55.284
Genta's head is on the screen!

182
00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:03.584
Gosh! Where's the trick behind all this?

183
00:11:03.584 --> 00:11:06.484
A child just hung himself in the midst of the movie being projected!

184
00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:08.184
No!

185
00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:11.284
Genta was hanging there for a while!

186
00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:13.784
Right? -Yes!

187
00:11:13.784 --> 00:11:16.184
Come on, don't lie.

188
00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:18.384
If he was there from before,

189
00:11:18.384 --> 00:11:21.484
we would've seen him when we looked at the window a while ago.

190
00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:27.584
You didn't see him because the window was covered with this book.

191
00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:31.284
And the light of the projection room was cut off.

192
00:11:31.284 --> 00:11:33.984
In this way, it would've be difficult for anyone to see the corpse

193
00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:35.984
even if it were to be hung beforehand, right?

194
00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:38.184
But, Dr. Agasa...

195
00:11:38.184 --> 00:11:42.284
According to everyone's testimony, the corpse was swaying.

196
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:46.584
A corpse that was hung beforehand couldn't have swung on its own.

197
00:11:46.584 --> 00:11:50.984
All right, Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi, you're on!

198
00:11:50.984 --> 00:11:52.484
Okay!

199
00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:59.084
Hey...

200
00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:02.784
The three of them put together is just about the weight of one adult.

201
00:12:02.784 --> 00:12:05.184
Just what are you trying to do?

202
00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.184
All right, Ai, now!

203
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:09.884
Yes... I'll turn it on now.

204
00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:15.284
The air conditioner...

205
00:12:18.284 --> 00:12:19.884
This is...

206
00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:23.584
It is a large vacuum space inside the theatre.

207
00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:27.484
As long as the direction and strength of the wind is adjusted beforehand,

208
00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:32.984
the corpse sway by circulating the air is possible.

209
00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:34.984
The air coming out of the air conditioner

210
00:12:34.984 --> 00:12:36.884
seems to have been stronger than usual today.

211
00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:38.884
Right, owner?

212
00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.284
Yes.

213
00:12:41.284 --> 00:12:43.584
Hey, old man.

214
00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:45.984
I understand how the corpse can be hung without anyone noticing

215
00:12:45.984 --> 00:12:47.984
and how it was made to sway,

216
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:50.884
but don't you think you're forgetting something very important?

217
00:12:50.884 --> 00:12:53.284
The movie was being projected from the window

218
00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:55.184
that the kids are hanging in front of!

219
00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:56.884
If they were hanging there to begin with,

220
00:12:56.884 --> 00:12:58.184
their shadows would've appeared,

221
00:12:58.184 --> 00:13:00.284
and if you were to cover the window with a book,

222
00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:01.884
the movie wouldn't be projected.

223
00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:05.584
How did I project the movie until that time...

224
00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:07.784
You did it like this, right?

225
00:13:07.784 --> 00:13:10.184
See? Like this!

226
00:13:10.184 --> 00:13:12.584
Here you go!

227
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.584
No way.

228
00:13:14.584 --> 00:13:15.884
How on earth?

229
00:13:15.884 --> 00:13:19.284
Go like this and there!

230
00:13:19.284 --> 00:13:21.584
It can't be, sir...

231
00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:23.284
He cut the film into pieces

232
00:13:23.284 --> 00:13:27.084
and used the two projector alternately.

233
00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:29.284
I won't forgive him!

234
00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.684
They are precious films that we have to return later, and yet!

235
00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:36.884
Hey, that's enough!

236
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.484
Only the projector in the foreground is moving.

237
00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:47.584
No film is set on this projector.

238
00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:50.584
Then, how on earth was it done?

239
00:13:50.584 --> 00:13:53.984
Go around to the front of the projector and take a good look.

240
00:13:56.484 --> 00:13:58.684
This is...

241
00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:00.384
a mirror!

242
00:14:00.384 --> 00:14:01.584
Right.

243
00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:05.484
This is a piece of the cracked mirror that was found in the room next door.

244
00:14:05.484 --> 00:14:09.984
Twist it like so and the picture is reflected.

245
00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.684
By using the reflection of the other piece of cracked mirror

246
00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:15.384
that has been fixed on the window,

247
00:14:15.384 --> 00:14:16.984
you can project the movie from the window

248
00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:19.884
and avoid the corpse showing up.

249
00:14:19.884 --> 00:14:22.684
In this way, you can switch windows

250
00:14:22.684 --> 00:14:27.184
with just one projector without cutting the film into pieces.

251
00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:33.384
Besides, just placed it here,

252
00:14:33.384 --> 00:14:35.384
even if someone were to look through the door,

253
00:14:35.384 --> 00:14:39.184
the mirror would be hidden from view because of the projector!

254
00:14:39.184 --> 00:14:43.984
The cigarette butts that the late Mr. Hatta was smoking during the show

255
00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:47.184
are all on the ground by the seat right before the peep hole window

256
00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:49.884
is proof of that.

257
00:14:49.884 --> 00:14:52.284
I've heard that he always sat in front of the window

258
00:14:52.284 --> 00:14:56.784
where the movie was projected so that he could obstruct business.

259
00:14:58.784 --> 00:15:02.684
Is that right, Mr. Furuhashi?

260
00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:07.484
In other words, this is what you did, Mr. Furuhashi.

261
00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:11.184
After asking Yuri to go out shopping for you,

262
00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:13.484
committing the crime was easier for you

263
00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:15.284
because the snack stand was empty.

264
00:15:15.284 --> 00:15:18.484
You went to the air conditioning room as the movie started,

265
00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.584
and adjusted the strength of air, as well as change the direction of it.

266
00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:24.284
Of course, the picture was projected from the peep hole window,

267
00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:28.084
by using the reflection of the mirror.

268
00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:30.184
Then you went into the theatre

269
00:15:30.184 --> 00:15:31.884
and strangled Mr. Hatta's neck

270
00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:35.084
with the rope that you had ready beforehand.

271
00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:38.984
All you had to do next was hang him in front of the window

272
00:15:38.984 --> 00:15:40.984
where the movie was to be projected from!

273
00:15:40.984 --> 00:15:42.884
Then you returned to the projection room

274
00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:45.184
and waited for Yuri to come back,

275
00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:47.984
removed the object that was blocking the window

276
00:15:47.984 --> 00:15:49.284
where the movie is to be projected,

277
00:15:49.284 --> 00:15:53.784
and remove the mirror from the lens of the projector.

278
00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:57.984
Then, the shadow of the hung corpse would appear on the screen,

279
00:15:57.984 --> 00:16:01.284
and if you see that together with Yuri,

280
00:16:01.284 --> 00:16:05.084
you would have a perfect alibi!

281
00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:08.184
But... but I went shopping

282
00:16:08.184 --> 00:16:11.284
only because I forgot to buy the lunches I was supposed to buy.

283
00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:13.684
Even if you didn't forget the lunches,

284
00:16:13.684 --> 00:16:18.884
he was probably going to ask you to buy some tea leaves anyway.

285
00:16:20.084 --> 00:16:24.284
He suggested the owner watch the movie today

286
00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:28.384
because he wanted his testimony of which scene the shadow appeared.

287
00:16:28.384 --> 00:16:30.784
And he probably chose to hang the corpse,

288
00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:32.584
which requires a lot of strength

289
00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:35.984
so that the owner wouldn't be suspected.

290
00:16:35.984 --> 00:16:40.484
But... but you're only speculating!

291
00:16:40.484 --> 00:16:42.084
Then please take a look

292
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:44.284
at the photos taken by Mr. Ide with his digital camera.

293
00:16:44.284 --> 00:16:45.884
What?

294
00:16:45.884 --> 00:16:47.484
Please show them the photo of the scene

295
00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:50.484
when the shadow appears on the screen.

296
00:16:55.484 --> 00:16:58.484
It... it is off focus.

297
00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:03.584
Yes, the weak point of this trick is once the mirror is removed,

298
00:17:03.584 --> 00:17:06.584
the distance from the projector and the screen changes,

299
00:17:06.584 --> 00:17:09.584
and turns out blurred.

300
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:13.584
The projector now is equipped with lens that are adjusted to this theatre,

301
00:17:13.584 --> 00:17:16.684
so it is correctly focused.

302
00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:20.484
It'll naturally require some time to change the lens,

303
00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:23.484
and while the lens is being changed, the picture will not be clear.

304
00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:27.084
In other words, Mr. Furuhashi couldn't adjust the focus

305
00:17:27.084 --> 00:17:30.184
until the lights went on.

306
00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:37.784
But it is difficult to focus on some moving objects, isn't it?

307
00:17:37.784 --> 00:17:39.984
No matter how much the picture is moving,

308
00:17:39.984 --> 00:17:43.284
the frame of the picture wouldn't be unclear.

309
00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:46.284
The seats are focused all right.

310
00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.484
Oh, right.

311
00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:51.584
When the shadow appeared and I looked through the window,

312
00:17:51.584 --> 00:17:53.584
I touched the projector.

313
00:17:53.584 --> 00:17:55.584
I'm sure that the projector moved at that time

314
00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:56.984
and the picture blurred.

315
00:17:56.984 --> 00:18:02.284
Then, why did you go to the restroom to fix your contact lens?

316
00:18:02.284 --> 00:18:04.584
After taking the lunch to the projection room

317
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.484
and boiling water for tea,

318
00:18:06.484 --> 00:18:09.784
why did you leave the room and go to the restroom?

319
00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:11.784
That's because...

320
00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:19.384
Because there was no mirror in the waiting room, right?

321
00:18:20.884 --> 00:18:23.584
I'm sorry, Yuri.

322
00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:25.884
That I made you worry.

323
00:18:25.884 --> 00:18:28.084
Mr. Furuhashi.

324
00:18:28.084 --> 00:18:32.184
Then, you're the one who did it after all?

325
00:18:32.184 --> 00:18:36.784
Yes, I'm sorry to have troubled you.

326
00:18:36.784 --> 00:18:42.784
But I didn't think you'll do something like this.

327
00:18:42.784 --> 00:18:48.184
I thought you liked this theatre too.

328
00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:55.384
Yes, I tried to keep myself from doing this.

329
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.484
But I just couldn't take it anymore.

330
00:19:01.884 --> 00:19:03.784
Well,

331
00:19:03.784 --> 00:19:08.584
I like looking outside very much from this peep hole.

332
00:19:08.584 --> 00:19:11.284
I love this special seat where I could watch

333
00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:14.984
every little response of the audience as they watched the movies.

334
00:19:18.084 --> 00:19:21.684
But just because of that guy,

335
00:19:21.684 --> 00:19:24.684
our customers started decreasing one after the other.

336
00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:26.884
And despite yesterday being Sunday,

337
00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:30.084
he was the only customer here.

338
00:19:30.084 --> 00:19:34.084
That's why I hung him up here

339
00:19:34.084 --> 00:19:38.184
and gave him a taste of his own medicine.

340
00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:41.884
I wanted him to see this sad sight

341
00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:45.284
and feel this desolate, lonesome feeling.

342
00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:53.384
Well, there's no way he can feel it dead.

343
00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:56.284
We'll hear the rest of the story at the station.

344
00:19:59.584 --> 00:20:02.784
I'm really sorry, owner.

345
00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:05.184
Because of my selfishness,

346
00:20:05.184 --> 00:20:08.884
the last day of the theatre was imperfect.

347
00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:12.584
It may have turned out this way sooner or later anyway.

348
00:20:12.584 --> 00:20:13.784
What?

349
00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:16.084
Even before that guy started coming here,

350
00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:19.384
the number of customers were decreasing anyway.

351
00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:23.084
Theatres like ours who cannot show new popular movies

352
00:20:23.084 --> 00:20:26.484
have no choice but to go bankrupt.

353
00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:30.484
Nowadays, when TVs and videos have become a part of daily life,

354
00:20:30.484 --> 00:20:34.884
it may already be outdated to sell dreams by showing movies.

355
00:20:34.884 --> 00:20:38.284
That's not true!

356
00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:40.484
I love movies!

357
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:44.184
The screen is way bigger than TV too!

358
00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:46.684
It's a dream space where we can share great emotions

359
00:20:46.684 --> 00:20:48.484
with a large number of people!

360
00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:51.384
Yes... the sound echoes throughout the entire theatre

361
00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:54.284
and it feels like you're in the movie!

362
00:20:54.284 --> 00:20:55.984
It's really exciting!

363
00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.984
Yes! -I can watch as long as I like

364
00:20:57.984 --> 00:20:59.984
without being scolded by my mom too!

365
00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:02.684
The realism is different from TV!

366
00:21:02.684 --> 00:21:04.684
Hey, old man.

367
00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:06.984
If you know how to operate the projector,

368
00:21:06.984 --> 00:21:09.184
please show them the show

369
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:12.984
as an apology for having made them feel bad.

370
00:21:12.984 --> 00:21:16.084
Please show these little customers

371
00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:18.884
the continuation of the show.

372
00:23:02.284 --> 00:23:05.284
So, all five of us had the entire theatre to ourselves

373
00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:07.984
and the showing of Gomera began.

374
00:23:07.984 --> 00:23:09.884
Hey, Gomera! You got eyes or what?

375
00:23:09.884 --> 00:23:11.284
Behind you...

376
00:23:11.284 --> 00:23:13.284
Hurry, run!

377
00:23:19.584 --> 00:23:22.784
There the best customers for the last show.

378
00:23:22.784 --> 00:23:24.684
No.

379
00:23:24.684 --> 00:23:26.484
I'm not going to make this the last.

380
00:23:26.484 --> 00:23:29.284
I'm not selling this place.

381
00:23:30.884 --> 00:23:33.684
I've almost forgotten

382
00:23:33.684 --> 00:23:37.884
the overwhelming feeling I felt when I first saw the movies.

383
00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:43.284
The feeling of euphoria that surrounded this space.

384
00:23:43.284 --> 00:23:46.284
If I don't go through with this, I won't be able to die in peace.

385
00:23:47.684 --> 00:23:50.284
I'm going to fill this audience

386
00:23:50.284 --> 00:23:54.084
with children who are smiling like them.

387
00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:56.184
Go for it!

388
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:57.984
Gomera!

389
00:23:57.984 --> 00:24:01.484
But they sure can get worked up.

390
00:24:03.284 --> 00:24:10.084
"Next Episode"

391
00:24:10.084 --> 00:24:12.184
A burglar?

392
00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:15.984
I've got to get the police.

393
00:24:15.984 --> 00:24:18.784
Please call the police, teacher!

394
00:24:18.784 --> 00:24:21.984
Ayumi's life is in danger!

395
00:24:21.984 --> 00:24:23.484
Please be all right!

396
00:24:23.484 --> 00:24:24.784
Ayumi!

397
00:24:28.084 --> 00:24:29.584
Next Conan,

398
00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:33.284
"SOS! Message from Ayumi"

399
00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.386
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:36.386 --> 00:24:38.186
"Clock"
