1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,340
After the strange letter that Pop's received,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,740
we were lead to the Kora Inn in Gunma Prefecture.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,240
We met Mr. Rokuro Tokubi and Mr. Kazuki Araiwa along the way

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,240
and found out that 11 years ago in the river near the inn,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,040
Tatsuhiko Numayama, an elementary school student,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,140
got swept away in a flood and died.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,440
Could this have been the "murder" mentioned in the letter?

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,240
Tatsuhiko's friends had set up a riverside grave stone

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,740
was kicked by Tatsuhiko's father, Banzo, is somewhat strange.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,440
"Kora Inn"

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
The next morning,

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,540
Banzo is found dead in the attic of the inn,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,040
drowned in the water from reservoir where Tatsuhiko's body was found.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Could it have been the work of the water sprite

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,440
that Ran mentioned seeing last night?

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,740
Or...

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Brooding over passing seasons

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,540
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,340
Inspector Yamamura of the Gunma Prefectural Police

20
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,540
discloses the sad identity of the water sprite!

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,340
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

24
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:43,987
"The Water Sprite's Dream (Part 2)"

25
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:48,787
It seems that the journalist was telling the truth.

26
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:52,387
The editor-in-charge confirmed that they were talking on the phone

27
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:54,587
for over an hour without pausing.

28
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:57,987
So, he couldn't have drowned someone while making the call.

29
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:00,387
Inspector Yamamura!

30
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,387
We got alibis from all the employees!

31
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,787
It seems that at the time of the crime,

32
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:06,887
all of them were preparing breakfast...

33
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,987
Come again?

34
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:11,487
You see... At the time of the crime...

35
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,687
-From before that! -What?

36
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,287
The alibis of the employees...

37
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,387
Before that.

38
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,987
Let see... Inspector Yamamura...

39
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,887
That's it...

40
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,487
Did you want to report something to Inspector Yamamura?

41
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,987
Yes... well, sort of...

42
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:32,687
To think that this hack was promoted to inspector.

43
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:33,987
We've also confirmed

44
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:37,487
that the water in question matched the water in the reservoir!

45
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:44,487
Then, was there anyone who snuck out of the inn last night?

46
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:45,887
The only ones who went out last night

47
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,887
were your group and Mr. Nohira.

48
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,987
He said that he wanted to take pictures of this area

49
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,487
and left before you did.

50
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:58,387
It seems that he came back drenched after all of you came back.

51
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:02,087
Why did you all go out of the inn, Mr. Mouri?

52
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,687
Because Ran said that she dropped her cell phone near the river,

53
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,487
so we went out to look for it.

54
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,487
That's when I saw it...

55
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,787
A real water sprite!

56
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,687
A water sprite again?

57
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,987
It is! It's really true!

58
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:20,787
It was standing near the river where I dropped my cell phone.

59
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:23,887
Then, didn't you take any pictures of it as proof?

60
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,987
You had the cell phone with you, didn't you?

61
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,187
I was so scared that it didn't dawn on me to...

62
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:31,787
I could draw it if you like.

63
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:35,087
"Rokuro Tokubi (42)" -I can draw in my wet sketchbook.

64
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:42,787
Yes, the beak was a bit larger!

65
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,087
About this big?

66
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:46,487
Yes... that's right!

67
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,887
Strange. In order to use a water bucket to drown somebody,

68
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,787
at least a liter of water is needed,

69
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:54,887
but why can't the container with the water in it be located?

70
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:57,687
Mr. Tokubi's water ink bottles are filled,

71
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,887
and he's actually drawing with them right now too.

72
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:02,987
Mr. Araiwa's PET bottle was opened

73
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:05,487
but it's still half filled with oolong tea.

74
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:09,087
All the water from his water pillow had been drained.

75
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,787
The most suspicious would be the multitude of film cases

76
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,487
that Mr. Nohira had on him.

77
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:17,787
But, he has an alibi proving that he was on the phone.

78
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:20,387
Besides, to begin with, Tatsuhiko, who was swept away by the river,

79
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,887
was wearing his swimming trunks only.

80
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,987
If he was in fact taking a swim in the cold,

81
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,387
would he be wearing shoes?

82
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,287
Besides, his shoes

83
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,987
were soiled with green stuff here and there.

84
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,587
Amazing!

85
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,287
It looks just like it! It was just like that.

86
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:38,387
What?

87
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:44,387
Hey, Ran! Did you really see this thing?

88
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,987
Yep! It was exactly like this!

89
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,087
Could I take a look at it too?

90
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:01,487
Hey, don't tell me that the water sprite is the murderer?

91
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,387
No... It's...

92
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:05,587
It's not a water sprite...

93
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:07,587
This is indeed...

94
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,287
An alien!

95
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,287
-What? -What? Alien?

96
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:15,487
Yes! This is an age where space travel is possible,

97
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,787
so it's not surprising

98
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:20,387
if a space being from outer space were to come here!

99
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:24,387
If so, where's the spaceship that the guy came on?

100
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:28,387
You shouldn't take their power of science lightly!

101
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,887
It could be a spaceship this small

102
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,087
and yet be carrying millions of space beings

103
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:36,487
that are shrunk and jam packed!

104
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:37,787
No joke!

105
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:39,887
Come on...

106
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,587
I see.

107
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:45,187
So it was tightly put into smaller containers.

108
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,087
At any rate, since Ran witnessed this extraterrestrial life form

109
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:51,387
whose nature remains totally unknown to us,

110
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:55,487
I'm sure the culprit is none other than this alien!

111
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,487
Therefore, this case will be stored in the dark depths

112
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,387
of the Gunma Prefectural Police HQ as classified top secret X-File

113
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,087
where it will never ever see the light of day!

114
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,987
Hey... Are you going to put it away as unsolved?

115
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,087
I mean, there's no such file is there.

116
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,587
But, why would an alien

117
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,787
be interested in the owner of this inn, Banzo?

118
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:16,287
Hey, don't take him seriously.

119
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,487
You heard about the fact, right?

120
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,487
That Banzo was always watching the river banks using binoculars

121
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,687
from the attic, didn't you?

122
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:26,087
I'm sure that Banzo saw them back then!

123
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,987
The multitude of aliens that look like water sprites

124
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,887
that were playing in the river!

125
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:33,687
That's why he was probably you know what...

126
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:43,587
Well, I guess it'll be simpler to work things out

127
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,487
by putting him to sleep this time.

128
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,787
Hey, Yamamura?

129
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:49,387
He looks just like you when you're Sleeping Kogoro, dad.

130
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:52,387
Don't tell me... It's the curse of the water sprite?

131
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,287
-Yes, the water sprite. -What?

132
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,987
Yes, when I called it, "water sprite", it suddenly hit me,

133
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,587
the truth of this case!

134
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:04,187
Even his non sequitur tie-ins are the same.

135
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:07,387
-What? Am I like that? -Yep!

136
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:11,787
Now, please call the remaining two suspects here.

137
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:15,387
I shall disclose the truth of the case to you!

138
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:19,687
Over the name of the inspector of Gunma Prefectural Police!

139
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:24,587
"Chrysanthemum Room" -You've figured who the culprit is?

140
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,287
"Kazuki Araiwa, Bosuke Nohira" -And you gathered us here...

141
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:31,287
Don't tell me that the culprit is among us?

142
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:34,487
I thought all suspicions were cleared a while ago

143
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:37,387
when the Inspector and the others made the rounds through our rooms.

144
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:39,387
Right, Yamamura!

145
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,687
The point of this case

146
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,987
is the water in the reservoir with a foul odor

147
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,787
that is 10 km ahead of here,

148
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:48,087
that drowned Mr. Banzo Numayama!

149
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:51,087
In order to drown him using the water dipper,

150
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,287
about 1 liter of water is necessary.

151
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:56,787
In other words, the one who put 1 liter of the smelly water

152
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,687
in some container and brought it in here is the culprit.

153
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,387
The bottles of color ink that Mr. Tokubi had

154
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,987
were almost all full

155
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:09,587
and he was in fact drawing using the ink.

156
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:13,087
Although Mr. Araiwa had two PET bottles of 500 ml of water

157
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,687
and a water pillow in his bag,

158
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:19,587
the PET bottle was still half filled, and when he entered the inn,

159
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:23,487
the water pillow was flattened out.

160
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:27,087
Neither of them could've brought the water in.

161
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:30,487
As for the journalist, Mr. Norihira, because of his job,

162
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,887
had a lot of film cases,

163
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,887
but at the time the crime was committed from 06:00 am to 07:00 am,

164
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,587
he was on the phone right through

165
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:41,387
with his editor-in-charge, so he has a perfect alibi.

166
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:45,287
So, then, who among the three here is the culprit then?

167
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,887
Don't you think it's strange?

168
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,687
Putting aside Mr. Norihira who has an alibi

169
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:53,387
unless somebody knew of the contents of their belongings,

170
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,087
Mr. Araiwa and Mr. Tokubi

171
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:59,487
wouldn't have been able to avoid suspicion.

172
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,187
He probably brought the water in using a paper pack

173
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,987
or balloon and after committing the crime,

174
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:05,487
he could've torn the container up,

175
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:09,587
flush it down the toilet and act like nothing happened.

176
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,887
True...

177
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,987
But, we were able to verify the contents

178
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:18,087
of your belongings beforehand.

179
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:20,387
Why is that?

180
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,387
Mr. Tokubi!

181
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:27,787
You deliberately slipped and fell into the river,

182
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,487
then, spread out the contents of your bag

183
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,087
and showed it to us saying you wanted to check your belongings!

184
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,987
You did all this to set up the murder trick.

185
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,087
-What? -What?

186
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,887
Then... don't tell me that...

187
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,887
Mr. Tokubi is the culprit?

188
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:56,734
Mr. Tokubi lured Mr. Mouri here by sending him

189
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:59,634
a letter under the suspicious name of Mika Tatezato.

190
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,934
Then you waited for his car to pass by on a road

191
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:06,034
on the way to the inn and got into his car.

192
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:09,034
Saying that you wanted to visit the grave of Tatsuhiko,

193
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:13,034
Banzo's son, which is located on the bank of the river.

194
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,534
Because you had to act out

195
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,734
accidentally falling into the river,

196
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:20,934
you deliberately made Mr. Araiwa who coincidentally visiting the grave,

197
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:25,134
fall along with you to also protect him from being suspected.

198
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:29,834
But, how did you know about the letter?

199
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,234
I told him about it!

200
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,334
I told him that we came to this inn because we got a strange letter,

201
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:39,334
whose name could be morphed into "water sprite".

202
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,934
But...

203
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:45,734
All Mr. Tokubi had were color ink bottles this small!

204
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:49,134
Just where in this bottle can you pour a liter of water?

205
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:51,734
Nine 60 ml bottles.

206
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:54,834
Sixteen 15 ml.

207
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,634
Including a 100 ml squirt bottle,

208
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,834
that makes 880 ml.

209
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:03,334
If water was poured all the way to the top of the bottles,

210
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:06,134
it'll add up close to 1 liter.

211
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:11,234
That's enough water to drown a person using a water bucket.

212
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:16,134
But, Mr. Tokubi was drawing using the color ink, wasn't he?

213
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,234
He was using all kinds of colors,

214
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,734
and even the bottles that he didn't use

215
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:22,934
have the same color ink corresponds to the label, you know?

216
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:26,434
He didn't use the squirt bottle, did he?

217
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:31,134
Look. The empty squirt bottle there on the floor!

218
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:34,534
Color ink is usually diluted when using,

219
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:36,734
because it's too thick if used as is.

220
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:39,834
Despite this, Mr. Tokubi finished drawing that painting

221
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,834
without adding a single drop of water.

222
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:45,034
Why? Because the undiluted color ink

223
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:48,934
was only in the dropper that was attached to the lid of the bottle,

224
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,634
and after the crime was committed, they were diluted using tap water.

225
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,334
Tap water?

226
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:56,934
I see...

227
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:59,834
He sucked the water up beforehand

228
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,834
using the dropper and emptied the bottle.

229
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:05,334
Then he filled up the empty space with water from the reservoir

230
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,634
and drowned Banzo.

231
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,734
After committing the crime,

232
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,334
he poured in the tap water and mixed it

233
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:12,934
with the left over solution in the dropper

234
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:15,134
to keep at least the color intact.

235
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:18,934
So, at a quick glance it would look like color ink.

236
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:24,534
Of course the tips were sealed with tape or something

237
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:28,834
to prevent the ink from mixing with the water from the reservoir.

238
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,434
As proof of this, when he checked his belongings

239
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:33,434
after falling into the water,

240
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:37,234
Mr. Tokubi didn't take the color ink bottles out of the cases.

241
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,434
If he did, it'll reveal the bottles not filled with vivid color ink,

242
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:44,834
but rather, dirty water from the reservoir.

243
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,534
How stupid can he get?

244
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,234
If he didn't draw such a picture, he may have gotten away with it.

245
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,634
He didn't have much of a choice.

246
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,234
After committing the crime, he had to clean out so many bottles

247
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,834
in such a short time is virtually impossible.

248
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,234
I'm sure that there is still some left

249
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:03,834
in the color ink bottles the remains of the substance

250
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,134
of the water from the reservoir.

251
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,934
That's why he went out of his way

252
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,234
and offered to draw of his own initiative.

253
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:11,634
He wanted to give everyone the impression

254
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:15,734
that the contents of the bottles were indeed color ink.

255
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:19,234
Well, if we ask forensics to check the composition of the color inks,

256
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,434
the result should soon be clear.

257
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,534
That can't be!

258
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,934
Mr. Tokubi couldn't possibly be the culprit!

259
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:26,934
Because...

260
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:31,334
Because Mr. Tokubi never failed to come to Tatsuhiko's grave

261
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:33,934
for the past 11 years, you know?

262
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,934
Even after he quit being a teacher, he still kept visiting!

263
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:39,734
How could you even think that Mr. Tokubi would kill Tatsuhiko's father?

264
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,934
It was because of his father!

265
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,234
-What? -What?

266
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:47,634
Because he was Tatsuhiko's father.

267
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:50,734
That's why all the more I couldn't forgive him!

268
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:55,034
Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river because of that guy!

269
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:58,534
It wouldn't be wrong to say he killed Tatsuhiko!

270
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,334
Mr. Tokubi...

271
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:05,534
I found Tatsuhiko in the dimly lit art room after school,

272
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:08,134
the day before he was swept away by the river.

273
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:11,834
Tatsuhiko was desperately rummaging the paint

274
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,834
that somebody had forgotten in the dimly lit room.

275
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,934
I thought that he wanted to draw something

276
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,134
so I gave him some brand new paint.

277
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:24,034
But a few days after Tatsuhiko was swept away by the river,

278
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,734
the guy returned the paint to me.

279
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:29,234
Since none of the colors seemed used,

280
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,534
I thought that he decided not to draw,

281
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:38,434
and kept the paint in memory of Tatshiko without using them.

282
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:42,034
But, a few days ago, I happened to realize.

283
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,234
Only the green color paint

284
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,034
was replaced by one of a different manufacturer!

285
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:51,834
-What? -Why only the color green?

286
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,034
I dug up the grave

287
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,334
after he was swept away by the river,

288
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,234
I checked the shoes that Tatsuhiko was wearing.

289
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,234
I was convinced...

290
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:04,434
There was green paint on the inside of Tatsuhiko's shoes

291
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,434
because on the day that he was swept away by the river,

292
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:10,534
Tatsuhiko had painted his entire body green!

293
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,134
His entire body green?

294
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,034
Hey! Don't tell me that...

295
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,934
Yeah... that's right!

296
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,034
Tatsuhiko's father had made Tatsuhiko go around the inn

297
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:23,334
in the figure of a water sprite

298
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,134
to attract guests to the inn!

299
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:29,734
Moreover, during a cold season like this!

300
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,134
No way...

301
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:34,734
Then, all the eye-witness reports were...

302
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,134
Probably Tatsuhiko acting out the water sprite

303
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,134
because the guy made him do it.

304
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:42,634
The fact that the guy took one shoe off

305
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,534
who he found floating in the reservoir,

306
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,834
hid it closed to his chest.

307
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,234
He returned the paint to me after replacing the green paint

308
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:52,934
were all to get rid of the evidence!

309
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:55,734
That's why that guy was always looking

310
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,234
through his binoculars from the attic!

311
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,134
He wanted to make sure that the other shoe

312
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,434
wouldn't be found!

313
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,034
You were wrong.

314
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:08,334
I think that Tatsuhiko decided to act like a sprite on his own.

315
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,634
And, secretly too, for the sake of his father's inn!

316
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:14,134
What're you talking about, boy?

317
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,834
Because if he were making his son do it in secret,

318
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,634
he'd make his son go and buy the paint!

319
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,334
If anyone were to find him rummaging through the paint,

320
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,734
it would give away the fact

321
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,834
that he were acting out the water sprite.

322
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,234
Besides, paints don't have to be bought in sets either,

323
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:33,234
and it's not strange for a child to be buying ink!

324
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:36,734
Then, why did he take the shoe from the corpse?

325
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,734
For Tatsuhiko's sake, I think.

326
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:43,534
He would be laughed that he died acting out the water sprite,

327
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,434
and moreover, it's his son's memento.

328
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,734
On top of that, he couldn't risk to be found,

329
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,634
I don't think he would carry it around in his pocket,

330
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:52,034
but would've gotten rid of it long time ago.

331
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,334
Don't you think so too, Mr. Araiwa?

332
00:17:55,334 --> 00:18:00,334
Because when you heard Ran say she saw a water sprite,

333
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:02,334
you said that it may be a ghost, right?

334
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,634
You knew that Tatsuhiko was acting out the water sprite,

335
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:06,134
didn't you?

336
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,734
Actually...

337
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:14,434
The day Tatsuhiko got swept away by the river,

338
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,634
I was right near him.

339
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:18,134
-What? -What?

340
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,634
Back then, there was a rumor going around

341
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:25,934
that maybe somebody was acting as the water sprite when it got cold,

342
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,234
the water sprite didn't appear.

343
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:31,434
So, Tatsuhiko said that he's going to put on his act that day.

344
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,134
I told him not to do it because it started raining,

345
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:36,234
but he said it wasn't raining that hard yet so he'd be okay.

346
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:38,334
He then told me to go tell the guests

347
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,734
at the inn that the water sprite appeared.

348
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:44,034
But, it began to pour on my way back to the inn so,

349
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,434
I went back to tell him that we should cancel it.

350
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:50,834
Then, I saw Tatsuhiko's foot stuck between the rocks in the river.

351
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,834
I rushed back to go get Tatsuhiko's father.

352
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,934
But, when I got back, Tatsuhiko was already nowhere in sight.

353
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,834
Later after searching for him together,

354
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,934
you found him downstream floating in the reservoir?

355
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:07,334
Yep. As he was removing Tatsuhiko's shoe,

356
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:09,434
Banzo told me not to tell anybody

357
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:13,834
that Tatsuhiko was acting as a water sprite.

358
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,934
Because if someone were to copy him and end up like Tatsuhiko,

359
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:18,834
it would make Tatsuhiko very sad.

360
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,734
I see...

361
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,334
That's why he was always watching over the river.

362
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:26,334
He wasn't only watching to prevent somebody from being swept away,

363
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,534
but also to stop them from acting as a water sprite.

364
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,134
That can't be...

365
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,434
No way...

366
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:36,934
But, what about the rumor about that old man

367
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:40,134
snooping around the grave night after night, then?

368
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,134
He was probably

369
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:46,834
fixing the grave that he had kicked down in order

370
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,734
to keep Tatsuhiko's friends away from the river.

371
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,634
Although it was a grave made of stones being piled up,

372
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:57,434
it was a precious grave that his son's friends had made.

373
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,834
As if in response to Mr. Tokubi's wailing voice,

374
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,734
as he was taken away.

375
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,434
The surroundings were dyed

376
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:19,734
with the sad color of the sunset.

377
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,934
Well, you impressed me, Yamamura!

378
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:50,134
I guess becoming an inspector rubbed off on you?

379
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,134
I have no idea what he's talking about.

380
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:55,034
Well, since the case has been solved,

381
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:58,334
how about going out and drinking up tonight?

382
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,434
Sounds good!

383
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,234
Hey, hold it!

384
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:05,334
The mystery of the water sprite I saw hasn't been solved yet.

385
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:08,534
What? Are you still talking such nonsense?

386
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:11,234
Come on... Enough already.

387
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:14,034
I'm telling you that I really saw it!

388
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:17,334
So, like everyone's saying,

389
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,134
you were so scared and frightened

390
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,734
so your fear made you see what you saw!

391
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:22,734
What's with you?

392
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:25,234
Talking to me like a grown up trying to reason with a child.

393
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,134
I mean, you're still only a child yourself.

394
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:28,734
Water sprite?

395
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,034
-What? -What?

396
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:34,634
It's appeared!

397
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,934
Hey, Ran, get rid of it using karate!

398
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:38,934
What? No way!

399
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:46,734
So you're the one who was disguised as a water sprite?

400
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,134
I went near the grave last night hoping

401
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:53,234
to get some good pictures.

402
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:55,634
Then, you guys came along and surprised me,

403
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:59,234
so I slipped and fell into the water!

404
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:02,034
Since your daughter made a fuss about a water sprite,

405
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,634
I figured I'd stay quiet since I didn't want to end up

406
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,834
being suspected as the culprit.

407
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,334
But,

408
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,034
this picture shows a thinner body.

409
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,234
The lower stomach part is popped out and there's furry looking stuff

410
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:15,834
showing from under the shell.

411
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,634
His body looks thinner

412
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,834
because he was drenched from falling into the water

413
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:21,834
and his clothes stuck flat against his body.

414
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,934
And, he looked to have a pop belly

415
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,334
because he had something inside there, right?

416
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,634
Yeah. Film cases and all sorts of other things.

417
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:29,534
So then...

418
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:33,634
What's that flurry thing under the shell?

419
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,334
I sometimes do survival games,

420
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:39,934
so I camouflage my entire body with leaves.

421
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,634
What an idiot!

422
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:45,534
Well, the case is closed.

423
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,634
There!

424
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,734
Give it your best shot!

425
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,234
Coach!

426
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,034
This is...

427
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:03,834
The truth of this case has came to me as a flash of inspiration!

428
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,034
Really?

429
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:07,434
Yes! In other words, the culprit is...

430
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,034
You, Ms. Suzuki!

431
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:11,434
What?

432
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,934
Next Conan,

433
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,234
"The Devil that Lurks in the Tennis Court"

434
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,061
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:22,061
"Tennis ball"

436
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,961
The New Year program will start from January 8th.

437
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:27,007
Wishing all of you a good year!
