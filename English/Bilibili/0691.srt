1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,840
Ran, Sonoko and Sera,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,340
on their way to school runs into a certain corpse.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,140
What seems to be the matter?

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,740
Well, you see, we were looking for him

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,740
because he didn't show up at work,

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,640
we found him slumped down in a place like this.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,640
He's bleeding from the mouth too.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
We called the ambulance while we were at it already.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,540
He doesn't need an ambulance.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,740
What?

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,040
Almost about nine hours seems to have passed

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,340
since he died already.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,740
Does he have alcohol dependency?

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,140
Yeah. He used to say that the doctor

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,940
told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,340
But, how'd you know about it?

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,740
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,340
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,040
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,940
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,840
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,240
From the circumstances,

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,440
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,540
So, well, an alcoholic

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,340
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,840
and spit blood.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,340
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,440
he couldn't get help and died.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,140
That's what you'd normally think.

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,140
But, this is not death by illness.

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,940
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,140
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,440
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,140
The word "Death" written in blood that was left near the corpse.

36
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,140
It was similar to the only case ten years ago,

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,340
that my Dad, Yusaku Kudo didn't specify the culprit.

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,040
Wanting to find the similarities between the two cases,

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,240
we called Officer Takagi who was in charge of this case.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

41
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,640
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,740
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,140
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

44
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,540
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,940
Hey, cut out the joke!

46
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,640
What about that case is a robbery?

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,140
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,640
Well, I thought the same thing too.

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,440
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,040
But, Inspector Megure who came along

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,640
after you all left for school,

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,340
saw that word written in blood

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,740
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,840
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,740
It's strange, isn't it?

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm sure that Inspector Megure was also

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,940
in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

58
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,640
It's only natural that he would consider it

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,540
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,740
That's true.

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,940
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,940
seen that word written in blood too.

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,640
And yet... why?

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,840
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,740
who first found the corpse.

66
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,340
Moreover, he was smiling too.

67
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,840
I wonder why.

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,140
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
Why?

70
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,440
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,240
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,940
The cold case mystery that father handled.

73
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,840
What is the mystery behind the common word?

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

75
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,340
His name is Detective Conan!

77
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:13,212
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 2)"

78
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,112
Don't tell me that the police know who the culprit is

79
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:19,312
and are hiding it?

80
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:22,212
You mean like what we see in the movies or dramas.

81
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,412
Because the culprit is from

82
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:24,512
a distinguished family of the police force

83
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:25,612
or the political and business circles?

84
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,712
That although it's frustrating, no one can lay a hand on them!

85
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,512
I mean you're the daughter

86
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:32,412
of the Suzuki Financial Group yourself too, aren't you?

87
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:33,712
But...

88
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:36,012
It's hard to believe that Shinichi's father

89
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:38,712
would pull out of a case for such a reason.

90
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,812
That's true.

91
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:44,712
Then, why not ask for advice?

92
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:48,912
From your deduction loving classmate, Kinichi.

93
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,312
Kinichi?

94
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:53,712
Huh? Oh, yes. I guess so.

95
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,912
Huh? Just what're you talking about?

96
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:57,912
If you're going to ask for advice on the case,

97
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:59,612
it would be Shinichi Kudo, right?

98
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,912
He's a high school detective

99
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,312
as well as your boyfriend, isn't he?

100
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,112
Although it seems that he's pursuing a case right now

101
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,612
and isn't at home!

102
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:15,212
Oh. So, the master of this house is that high school detective.

103
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,812
Don't tell me that you were living here

104
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,412
not even knowing something like that?

105
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,612
No, because Ran told me that the Shinichi who lives here

106
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,112
is a plain, nothing special high school student.

107
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,412
And, besides.

108
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:32,412
Rumor has it that the high school detective Shinichi Kudo

109
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:35,112
passed away when investigating a case

110
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:37,112
and disappeared from the stage of solving mysteries,

111
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,412
from what I heard.

112
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:41,012
Is such a rumor going around?

113
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,512
Yes. That's why I thought that

114
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:45,712
the person, Shinichi that pops frequently in your conversations

115
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:46,812
was a different person.

116
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:49,012
There's no way that he's dead.

117
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:53,312
I've been involved in two cases with him already, you know!

118
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,012
Well, although it was only by phone both times.

119
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,912
Right, Conan?

120
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,912
Yep... right.

121
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:05,412
Then who is Kinichi?

122
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:08,612
Oh, since Shinichi told me

123
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,512
to not tell you too much about himself.

124
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:14,812
I... sort of... I'm sorry.

125
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:19,212
But, I wonder why there's a rumor going around that Shinichi died?

126
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,712
That's probably because

127
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:22,412
he's always telling the people involved in the case

128
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,112
to keep under cover the fact that

129
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,912
he's handling the case, I guess?

130
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,212
It seems to be that he does so

131
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,912
to keep the culprits of the cases off guard.

132
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,012
Does he think he's a ninja or something

133
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,912
that's in hiding on enemy grounds or what?

134
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,712
Ninja?

135
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:42,612
Then, how about calling him now?

136
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,012
I'd like to hear his deduction too.

137
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:48,812
Oh. But I already text mailed him at sundown

138
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,012
on the outline of the case.

139
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,612
But, you haven't told him yet that the police

140
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:55,512
are trying to close the case as a robbery, right?

141
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,312
True.

142
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:00,512
Besides, you should directly talk to him, Ran.

143
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,712
-Huh? -While you're at it,

144
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:05,212
you might well tell him how you feel about him too.

145
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:07,012
What?

146
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:09,112
I got to use the restroom!

147
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,712
Rats. No joke?

148
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,212
Come on, quick.

149
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,312
Oh, if you're going to call him,

150
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,112
can you relay a word to him for me?

151
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:24,012
Huh?

152
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,112
Oh, Shinichi?

153
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:30,712
It's me, Ran.

154
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:33,512
May I talk to you now?

155
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,712
Yeah. What is it?

156
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:38,612
If it's about the case you saw this morning,

157
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:41,612
the glasses boy already texted me about it.

158
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,812
That the police is trying to close it as a robbery case.

159
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,112
Right.

160
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:50,512
And about that other stuff that has nothing to do with the case.

161
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,212
Other stuff?

162
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,412
Go on and tell him that you like him.

163
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:57,312
What is it? What other stuff?

164
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:59,312
Oh. So... you know...

165
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:02,512
I like you so very much. I like...

166
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:07,412
-I super... -I like...

167
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:11,812
Su...

168
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,212
Subaru said!

169
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,612
-Huh? -What?

170
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:20,312
Subaru said that

171
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:24,612
you're just like a ninja! Saizo Kirigakure!

172
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:26,012
Oh, give me a break.

173
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,012
He wanted me to relay this to you.

174
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,112
Saizo Kirigakure?

175
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,012
Oh. Is it because he's in hiding?

176
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,812
Yes! Most probably.

177
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:38,712
But, why are you talking about that at a time like this?

178
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,012
Saizo Kirigakure

179
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:44,512
used to be one of the Sanada Ten Braves, I think?

180
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:47,212
If I remember correctly, legend has it that

181
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,112
he was a fictitious Iga Ninja who served under warlord,

182
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:50,912
Yukimura Sanada.

183
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,912
Wait a sec. Yukimura Sanada.

184
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,812
Sanada maru (Sanada Barbican). Sanada himo (braid).

185
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,012
Sanada...

186
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,712
Sanada!

187
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,512
I see! I got it! The truth of the case!

188
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,612
-Huh? -Go right away to the crime site

189
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:06,612
you saw today!

190
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,612
What? Hey, Shinichi?

191
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:12,212
If it's as my deduction goes, it should fit right in!

192
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:17,912
I see. So, that's the story.

193
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,912
Hey, Shinichi? What's going on?

194
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,412
Shinichi? Shinichi?

195
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,812
No. He hung up.

196
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,012
What?

197
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,212
When you still haven't told him how you feel about him?

198
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,712
And? What did he say, Shinichi?

199
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,612
He said that he figured out the truth of the case

200
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:35,312
so to go right over to the scene of the crime

201
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,412
we went to this morning.

202
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,512
He said if his deduction is correct,

203
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,612
things will fit right in.

204
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:44,912
Then, he probably figured out why his Dad

205
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:49,812
gave up on the case ten year ago too.

206
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:52,712
He didn't give up on the case.

207
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:57,812
Shinichi said that he knew, but didn't tell anybody about it!

208
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,612
Conan?

209
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:01,912
You talked to Shinichi?

210
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,012
I was on the phone with Shinichi till just a while ago, you know?

211
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,412
Oh, so right after that phone call,

212
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,212
really just now, I got text mail.

213
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,512
Then, why didn't he tell Ran about it.

214
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:14,312
Huh? Oh, that's because...

215
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:17,812
Conan, do you have a bow tie attached to your smart phone?

216
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,512
Rats. I forgot to detach the voice changer.

217
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,712
Oh, this is...

218
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:26,612
It's the "in" thing in school right now, you see.

219
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,912
At any rate, if going to the crime site

220
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:33,012
is going to prove whether his deduction is right or wrong,

221
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,812
there's no reason why we shouldn't go there.

222
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:38,912
Don't you think so?

223
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:42,712
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo...

224
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:52,412
After all, is saying so.

225
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,312
Right. Let's go! Ran!

226
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:58,712
Yep!

227
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,512
Come on, Conan, let's go!

228
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:07,112
You got text mail from Kudo about his deduction, right?

229
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:09,612
Oh. Yep.

230
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,663
Just as I thought, there're no police officers here at all.

231
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,163
No joke. I guess they concluded it as a robbery

232
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:36,063
and withdrew from this place all together.

233
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:38,063
But, normally, if somebody is found dead

234
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:39,263
with a word written in blood that

235
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,463
he couldn't possibly have written himself.

236
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:44,063
More so, if a word such as "Death" is left behind like this,

237
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,463
it's only natural they would think of it as a homicide, and yet...

238
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:48,563
Yep.

239
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:51,263
Ran, do you have your coin purse with you?

240
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:52,763
Huh? Yes.

241
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:55,063
Hey, you. Don't tell me that

242
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,563
you're planning to buy beer or something, brat?

243
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,663
No.

244
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,363
It was written in Shinichi's text mail!

245
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,163
If you do this, that is,

246
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,563
line the coins up like this on the blood word...

247
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:10,063
See, it fits right in, right?

248
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:13,663
No joke. How come?

249
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,363
This isn't a word that a person had written,

250
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,563
but blood dripped onto to the scattered coins like this,

251
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:21,663
and coincidentally turned out this way, he said!

252
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:26,763
But... what about that narrow space and all?

253
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:29,763
Are you saying that the blood intentionally avoided that area?

254
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:33,763
No. The cigarette was probably on the ground there.

255
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,363
The cigarette was smeared with blood, you know.

256
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,863
And besides, if the coin purse with the coins inside it,

257
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:41,263
dropped to the ground surrounding the coins then,

258
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:44,263
it's likely that this word "Death" would be made.

259
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:46,063
In other words...

260
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:49,063
The man that we found dead this morning,

261
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:51,463
came to buy sake here last night,

262
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,263
but because his varix burst due to cirrhosis of the liver,

263
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,763
he spit blood, and slumped down.

264
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,863
Back then on top of the coin purse, coins

265
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,063
and cigarette that he dropped,

266
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:01,363
blood dripped from his mouth.

267
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:04,063
After the man passed away,

268
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:07,663
a passerby took his coin purse and coins,

269
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,063
so only this word written in blood was left behind.

270
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,963
So, that's the story.

271
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:14,063
But, isn't there a possibility

272
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:17,063
that the one who took his money killed him?

273
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,363
I don't think so!

274
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:22,963
A blood written word like this wouldn't show up so clearly

275
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,863
unless the coin purse and money were taken

276
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,363
after the blood totally dried.

277
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:29,363
Then, it was a case of robbery, after all!

278
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,763
Yeah!

279
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:36,363
But, Conan! It's amazing how you realized it!

280
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:40,563
I'm not the one who realized it, it's Shinichi who did!

281
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,463
He said that Subaru's words rang a bell!

282
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:47,263
Oh, the phrase that he told me to tell Shinichi,

283
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:52,463
"You're like a ninja, Saizo Kirigakure."

284
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,863
Then, could this be the blood word that

285
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,063
ninjas used to use a lot?

286
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:01,463
No! Saizo Kirigakure was one of the Sanada Ten Braves!

287
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,363
The emblem on the banner of the Sanada family

288
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,063
are the six coins, right?

289
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:06,663
That's how I figured it out.

290
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,863
That this blood word was not written

291
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:12,763
but was made from six round coins, that created the shape.

292
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:13,963
Oh.

293
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:17,863
Of course, Shinichi told me this!

294
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:21,563
But, the case ten years ago was an accident, wasn't it?

295
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,063
The principal of a nursery school

296
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:25,463
tripped over a cobbled road in the park and fell.

297
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,663
And, the fishbowl that he was carrying at that time cracked,

298
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,363
then a shattered piece of debris

299
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,163
poked into his chest killing him.

300
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,663
Was that a case of robbery too?

301
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:38,563
But, in the picture of the site of the crime ten years ago,

302
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,263
the flowers of the park that was offered by the boy,

303
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:43,263
who was the first to find the corpse was shown,

304
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:45,463
but there was no cigarette shown.

305
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:47,763
Besides, Shinichi said nothing about

306
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,663
a coin purse being stolen either.

307
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:52,763
Then, the case ten years ago was a homicide after all?

308
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:56,163
No, that case indeed was due to the six coins!

309
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,163
Huh?

310
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,063
See, the boy called Ryosuke Nishimura

311
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,863
that was the first to find the corpse.

312
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,763
When he found the principal immobile in the park

313
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,163
lying on the ground, he thought that he was dead,

314
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,163
and therefore, put flowers and coins near the body

315
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,063
as offering!

316
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:14,563
The six coins were to be used to cross the Sanzu River!

317
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:16,663
Sanzu River?

318
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,763
He was only five years old kindergartener, you know?

319
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:21,463
But, he was the son of a monk, wasn't he?

320
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:24,463
It's likely that he heard about it from his parents, no?

321
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:27,363
That if the deceased doesn't have the six coins

322
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,663
to cross the Sanzu River,

323
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,463
an old lady near the river

324
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:32,963
will rob him of his clothes

325
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:35,663
and he will plunge into hell!

326
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,863
The boy who probably heard about this,

327
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:42,563
offered six coins near the corpse of the principal

328
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:47,063
and covered it with flowers so that they wouldn't be stolen.

329
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:50,163
But, no matter if he was the son of a temple,

330
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,963
I wonder if he'd be carrying six coins on him all the time.

331
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,163
He didn't have any,

332
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,963
so he used something that looked similar as a substitute!

333
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,463
A substitute?

334
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:02,563
Remember, the thing that the boy was holding in the picture?

335
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:06,763
The candy drops with a whole in the center!

336
00:17:06,763 --> 00:17:10,163
Right! He used them in place of the six coins

337
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,263
and placed them near the left hand of the corpse

338
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,163
and covered them with the flowers

339
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,263
but from the space between the joints of his thumb,

340
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:19,163
the blood that flowed out of the corpse flow in,

341
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,563
and coincidentally shaped that ominous blood word!

342
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:25,263
That's why until the body was moved,

343
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:28,263
nobody noticed the word "Death" formed by blood!

344
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:30,063
Before the body was moved,

345
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:32,863
the blood word was merged with the left hand,

346
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,463
so in the picture there was no blood under the left hand,

347
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,763
but blood was found on the palm of his hand and fingers!

348
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:39,863
I see!

349
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:42,063
The thumb of the corpse served in place of the cigarette

350
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,163
to form a long narrow space!

351
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:48,563
But, there were no candy drops in the picture.

352
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,663
The dog that the boy was taking care of in the park,

353
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:53,663
probably took it away!

354
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,563
It also scattered the flowers too.

355
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:59,463
That dog in the picture wasn't wearing a collar,

356
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:02,663
and three candy drops were found in his dish!

357
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:05,163
Then why didn't Shinichi's father

358
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:08,163
publicize the truth of the case?

359
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:11,063
Because such a fuss was made over the blood word

360
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,063
being the start of bizarre serial killings.

361
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,563
Depending on how you look at it,

362
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:18,763
it may be mistaken for a distasteful mischief of a child.

363
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,563
If that were to be publicized,

364
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:23,263
the boy could be criticized for his act!

365
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:26,963
That's why I think he decided to say nothing.

366
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:29,263
Well, after seeing the blood word this time,

367
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,263
from the fact that Inspector Megure

368
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:34,463
instantly saw through what happened after seeing the round coins,

369
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,563
I'm sure that Yusaku had explained everything to him already.

370
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,063
He not only told the Inspector.

371
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:43,863
Back then, Dad was talking to that boy.

372
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,263
Smiling.

373
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:48,063
That's why back then, Dad probably...

374
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:49,163
Thanks to you,

375
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:52,063
it seems that the principal was able to go to heaven!

376
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,263
Really?

377
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,663
But, next time you make an offering,

378
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:58,263
I think it's better that you tell your parents about it first.

379
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,563
Okay! I understand!

380
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:03,963
And, don't tell anybody about what happened, okay?

381
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:05,863
Because we don't want anybody to find out that

382
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:08,363
you're the one that made the old lady by the Sanzu River get cavities

383
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,763
thanks to your candy drops, do we?

384
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:13,363
Said something to that affect or something.

385
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:15,663
Well, as for me, I was relieved to find

386
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:19,363
that Dad didn't pull out of the case.

387
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:34,363
Co...

388
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:37,763
Conan, right?

389
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:40,363
Yep.

390
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:46,963
Oh, I just happened to read Shinichi's text mail, you see.

391
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:50,063
Really, don't scare me like that.

392
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,463
I mean you guys already look alike too, you know!

393
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:54,763
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,663
But, too bad, don't you think?

395
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,663
We solved the case this time

396
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:03,363
and yet we don't know who stole the money.

397
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,663
If we need a clue,

398
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,363
I found this blood smeared 10 yen coin

399
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:09,463
from under this vending machine!

400
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:11,363
If there's blood on it, it means...

401
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:14,863
Yeah. I'm sure that when the culprit picked up the loose change,

402
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,163
the coin that he failed to pick up went under the vending machine,

403
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:21,763
but if the fingerprints on it are of someone with a record...

404
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,763
I have a record.

405
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:24,863
Assault and battery.

406
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:27,963
-Inflicting bodily injury. -Blackmailing.

407
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:33,063
We have been arrested on three previous convictions.

408
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:37,663
If you include robbery, that'll make four!

409
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:41,263
So, won't you lend us, you know what?

410
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:44,163
10 yen won't hurt, will it?

411
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:49,963
We'll give you three a good time later, so you see...

412
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,663
Okay.

413
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:54,263
Take this!

414
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:56,963
Hey?

415
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,863
Darn! What do you think you're doing?

416
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,463
Darn.

417
00:21:08,463 --> 00:21:10,263
You brats!

418
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,163
How dare you guys, cut out the joke?

419
00:21:30,863 --> 00:21:34,363
Case closed! One down!

420
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:38,063
That ball... Conan?

421
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,663
Yep.

422
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:16,163
Huh? Aren't you going to the police, Sera?

423
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:20,563
No. I'm sorry, but you guys go and get interrogated.

424
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:22,763
I've got urgent business to attend to,

425
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,763
so I've got to go.

426
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,663
Okay.

427
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,363
Hey, Conan?

428
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:36,963
You scraped your elbow!

429
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,163
Oh, I scraped it when I fell a while ago.

430
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:41,463
Come on. Be careful, will you?

431
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,163
What're you going to do if it gets infected?

432
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:45,863
Yep. I'm sorry.

433
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:57,063
I'm a bad person, after all.

434
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,963
Yeah. The Nihonbashi post office, eh?

435
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,363
M is heading down south on Chuo Boulevard.

436
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:16,263
Well, shall we start off then?

437
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:19,063
Well, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

438
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:23,663
The cruiser that M is on board have set off.

439
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:28,563
What's the matter, Ran?

440
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:31,363
No, it's nothing.

441
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,663
Next Conan,

442
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:36,763
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 1)"

443
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:54,763
Next Conan's Hint:

444
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,663
"Surveillance Camera"

445
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,263
I may lose to Sera.

446
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,463
You're stronger.

447
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:01,959
I don't want these two to fight against each other.
