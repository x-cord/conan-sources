1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,510
A racing second hand,
a returning satellite!

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,600
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,100
It's the lively JDL again!
This year's Conan is a little different!

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,870
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,640
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,060
His name?

7
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,729
"The Kidnap Locating Case."

8
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,609
If my opponent goes
for my upper body,

9
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:50,239
I'll smash 'em with a
mid-section to upper body kick!

10
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,119
Scary!

11
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,379
Ran's always tense on
days she has karate matches...

12
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:07,469
Conan-kun!
You better come cheer me on!

13
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,139
Yeah... I'll come
right after school!

14
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:16,019
You better! I absolutely
can't lose to my opponent today!

15
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,979
So, you better come!

16
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,649
If you don't...

17
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,359
Ran's really raring to go!

18
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,649
Oh, it's just construction...

19
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,809
See you, Conan-kun!

20
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:52,849
I'm in a hurry,
so I'm off! 4:00, now!

21
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,559
I gotta hurry to the karate arena

22
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,899
or else I'll meet
that roundhouse again!

23
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:08,359
Hey, Conan!

24
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:10,189
Just the voice
I don't wanna hear...

25
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,809
Yeah?

26
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,699
Crap! I got caught!

27
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,939
Check this out!
It's a wideband reversy!

28
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,609
No, Genta-kun!
It's called a wideband receiver!

29
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,769
Same difference.

30
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,419
What does it do, again?

31
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,019
It's like a powerful radio!

32
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,389
It can even pick up taxi and
cordless phone conversations!

33
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,019
Looks like a toy to me...

34
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,229
Send a fire truck immediately!

35
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,729
Rairaiken? I'd like three
ramens and two dumplings...

36
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,309
That's awesome!

37
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:50,189
But, isn't it wrong to listen in
on people's phone conversations?

38
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,279
That's called "wiretapping"...

39
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,559
We can't bother anybody
if we're just listening!

40
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,149
It's pretty creepy, though...

41
00:03:57,149 --> 00:04:02,249
Whoops, I'm in trouble if
I don't go see Ran's match...

42
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:05,959
I know! Let's listen in on
Namuro Amie, that singer!

43
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:06,869
OK?!

44
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:10,649
Eh? She lives in this area?!

45
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,109
I dunno...

46
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,719
Then we can't.

47
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,189
This receiver only picks up random
signals within a 1 kilometer radius.

48
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:23,139
Random? That's no fun...

49
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,769
So, we can't choose
who to listen to.

50
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,109
Watch. You turn the dial like so...

51
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:33,769
until you find someone
talking, like before.

52
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,269
See! I found one!

53
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,919
I have your daughter.

54
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,829
What?!

55
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,289
What did he say?!

56
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,249
I said, I've kidnapped your daughter.

57
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:48,209
Call the cops and she's dead!

58
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,419
A threatening phone call!

59
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,399
This for reals?!
Where are they talking from?!

60
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
This only listens, so I can't tell!

61
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,349
He kidnapped his daughter!
Conan-kun...

62
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,429
Don't look at me...

63
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,939
What if it really is a kidnapping?!

64
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,269
Even if it was real kidnapping,

65
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:16,669
all we know is that they're
within a 1 kilometer radius!

66
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,869
It's just 1 kilometer.

67
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,189
He might call again!

68
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,959
Let's wait and see!
Okay, Conan-kun?!

69
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,459
OK!

70
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,419
The Junior Detective League
is back in action!

71
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,559
Oh, geez...

72
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,359
Beika Martial Arts Arena
Gyokushinkai Karate Tournament

73
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,389
Beika Martial Arts Arena

74
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,349
Gyokushinkai Karate Tournament

75
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:50,399
In blue, Mori Ran.

76
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,319
Ossu!

77
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,029
Not good. At this rate,
I'll get stuck with them, again...

78
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,919
Where are you going, Conan-kun?

79
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:05,999
Nowhere...

80
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,519
Looks like you
haven't called the cops.

81
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,739
Daddy!

82
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,809
Junko!

83
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:16,339
What are you going to do to her?!
I'll do anything you want!

84
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,299
So, please let her go!

85
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:24,259
For now, take your cordless phone
and step out onto the veranda.

86
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,519
Good. Now stand there.

87
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,359
Your satellite dish is
in the way! Take it down!

88
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,359
Eh?!

89
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,809
Just do what I say!

90
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,189
What's he making him do?!

91
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,479
The kidnapper is watching
him from somewhere!

92
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,909
He probably told him to go onto
the veranda to see him better!

93
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,369
I'd forget about calling
the cops if I were you.

94
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,309
I can see you nice and clear.

95
00:06:54,309 --> 00:07:00,189
Do anything funny and I'll
kill your daughter on the spot!

96
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,689
He's going to kill her!

97
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,759
What do we do?!
Shouldn't we tell the police--

98
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,689
Alright! I'll do whatever you say!

99
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,729
What is it you want?! Money?!
Do you want money?!

100
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,189
That sound...

101
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:22,659
Don't get worked up.
Just wait there for a while.

102
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,669
He hung up!

103
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,519
What now?!

104
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,449
Tell the police?

105
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,649
But would they believe us?

106
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,589
He's right! All we know is that a
Junko-chan might've been kidnapped!

107
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,189
Plus, they hung up...

108
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,429
Let's do it ourselves!

109
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:45,299
Eh?!

110
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,519
We don't have time to go
to the police and sit around!

111
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,649
Okay! We'll catch the kidnapper!

112
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,399
But how? We don't have any clues...

113
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,439
Oh, yeah...

114
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,149
I learned something
from that last call.

115
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,609
Eh?

116
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,109
What did you learn?

117
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,189
What're you getting
your math notebook out for?!

118
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,329
It's not what you think!

119
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:12,289
It's Professor Agasa's
Electronic Map Notebook!

120
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,999
Oh! That inventor relative of yours?

121
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,439
Alright. Here's our school.

122
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,719
That receiver picks up
signals within a 1 kilometer radius.

123
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:29,689
The victim's home
is somewhere in this circle.

124
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,559
And, that faint sound
in the background...

125
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:38,439
It was a train. The victim
probably lives along a train line.

126
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:41,989
There's only one railway
that goes through this area!

127
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,949
The Beika Line!

128
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,019
Ah!

129
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,329
Alright! To the Beika Line!

130
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,689
We made it to the train tracks...

131
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,809
Now what?

132
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,339
These are the only tracks
within the receiver's range!

133
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,849
In other words, the victim is
along this 600-meter length of track!

134
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:14,389
OK! It's only 600 meters!

135
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:18,559
But, isn't there
any other way, Conan?

136
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,769
I have one more hint, but...

137
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,779
What is it?!

138
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:28,859
The kidnapper told him to
take down his satellite dish, right?

139
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,739
Yeah...

140
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:33,939
Satellite dishes
are pointed to the southwest.

141
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:38,209
Which means the victim has
a veranda facing southwest, but...

142
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,629
OK! Then the victim's house...

143
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,479
Has a veranda on the south or west!

144
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,299
Let's go!

145
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,959
Satellite dish?

146
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,259
No question about it! That's it!

147
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,289
Thought so...

148
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:59,009
But, there's tons of 'em!

149
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,189
They're on the opposite buildings, too!

150
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:04,359
Yeah, we don't have enough clues yet!

151
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,149
But...

152
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:12,579
Hello.

153
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,909
The kidnapper called back!

154
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,789
Great! Now give
us some sort of hint!

155
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,959
I'll find a clue this time!

156
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:22,689
No, I will!

157
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,749
Quiet!

158
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,729
Seems you haven't contacted the cops.

159
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,719
Is Junko all right?!

160
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:33,359
That all depends on you.

161
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,769
You mentioned you'd do anything I said.

162
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,069
So first, I want you to get naked.

163
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,119
Eh?!

164
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,649
Naked! Take your clothes off!

165
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,309
Naked?!

166
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,189
I got it! He's making him
go to a public bath nearby!

167
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,609
What?!

168
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
Good! Some high school girls are
about to pass below your apartment!

169
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,409
Wave to them!

170
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:59,869
Or, do you not care what
happens to your daughter?!

171
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,019
Shout, "Hello!" and wave to them!

172
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,089
Alright...

173
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,509
Hello! Hello!

174
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,149
Whoa, look!

175
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,719
Totally lame!

176
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,179
Hello! Hello!

177
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,109
How's it feel to be made fun of
by high school girls in sailor uniforms?

178
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:29,149
Keep doing that for a while.

179
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,109
Sailor uniforms...

180
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:37,689
I could hear quite a few high school
girls over the wideband receiver...

181
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,499
That apartment building is likely
on the way to a girls' school.

182
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,979
The only girls' schools
in that 600 meter area

183
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:48,959
are Seijun Girls' Academy
and Beika Girls' High School...

184
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,189
I bet high school girls always
made fun of the kidnapper.

185
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,269
Yeah, a girls' school teacher!

186
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,479
No teacher would do this!

187
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,899
I've figured out the schools,
but I don't know their uniforms...

188
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:04,939
Seijun uses blazers.
Beika uses sailor uniforms.

189
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,479
Eh? Come again?!

190
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,859
I used to dream about wearing a
sailor outfit when I get to high school,

191
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:17,449
but lately I've been considering
a blazer and loose socks, too.

192
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,829
Which do you think is better?!

193
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:21,689
They're both okay...

194
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:23,609
A blazer would look better!

195
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,169
A sailor outfit!

196
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,609
Beika Girls' High School!

197
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,089
That narrows it down
to a 300 meter radius!

198
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,269
That way!

199
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,509
Hey, wait up!

200
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,379
A man waving from his veranda?

201
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,019
I don't see any...

202
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,899
Maybe we should ask
some high school girls?

203
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,979
Alright!

204
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:55,439
You can quit waving now.
Now, sing a song!

205
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:59,559
Sing loud enough for the
whole neighborhood to hear! Do it!

206
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,249
I don't hear him...

207
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,249
It must not be this neighborhood.

208
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,229
There's some kind of sound!

209
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,609
That sounds like a temple bell!

210
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:20,019
That's it! The victim
lives behind a temple!

211
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:24,729
It sounds like a taiko drum!
The kidnapper must be playing along!

212
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,939
No! That sound...

213
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,339
It sounded just like this!

214
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,739
It's a pile driver!

215
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,939
Pile driver?

216
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,539
Yeah! The machines that pound
piles in at construction sites!

217
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:50,269
But, finding construction
sites around here would--

218
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,789
I got it!

219
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:08,143
If we follow that,
it'll lead us to a construction site!

220
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:19,443
This narrows it down
to a 150 meter radius!

221
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,763
I don't hear him...

222
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:26,413
As close as we are now,
it's still a 150 meter radius!

223
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:30,393
Without anything definitive...

224
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,933
Parents sure are pathetic.

225
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:38,603
They'll do anything for their kids!

226
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:42,213
I know how it feels.
I used to be a parent myself...

227
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,173
"Used to be"?!

228
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:48,093
The little girl who fell
to her death one year ago...

229
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:53,063
I'm sure you remember, as it
was from your apartment building.

230
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:56,013
That was my daughter who died!

231
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,923
Young Girl Falls to Death

232
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:03,623
Tomidokoro-san?!
Is this Tomidokoro-san?!

233
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:07,853
That's right. I'm the one
whose daughter you murdered.

234
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,103
What?! That was an accident!

235
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:15,163
Shut up! The door to your roof
was always off-limits and locked!

236
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:19,033
So, why was it unlocked then?!

237
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:23,363
Someone had picked it,
or it just broke by chance!

238
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:27,583
One whole week earlier! So why
didn't you do anything about it?!

239
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,043
I figured nobody ever went up there...

240
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:33,403
So it was nobody's fault?!
Quit screwing around!

241
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:37,913
I'm gonna let you experience
the same sadness I did!

242
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:40,873
The exact same sadness!

243
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,973
What're you gonna do to Junko?!

244
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,403
This is bad!

245
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,973
We have to do something!

246
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,913
Stupid train crossing!
Now we can't hear!

247
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:53,793
That's it!

248
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:54,853
Gimme that!

249
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,883
Hey, that's...

250
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:56,623
Never mind that!

251
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:11,953
One... Two...

252
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,873
Three... Four...

253
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,833
Five... Six...

254
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,793
Seven... Eight...

255
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,963
There it is! 8.2 seconds!

256
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,123
This way!

257
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,383
How do you know they're this way?!

258
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,293
The sound of the train!

259
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:32,353
It took 8.2 seconds after it passed
until I heard it on the receiver!

260
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:32,873
Beika Line
Speed

261
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:35,953
Trains on the Beika Line go 100 kph!
Beika Line
Speed

262
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,313
That's about 27.8 meters per second!
Beika Line
Speed

263
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:44,533
I heard the train on the receiver 8.2
seconds after it passed the crossing!

264
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:50,493
In other words, the victim's house
is 27.8 meters x 8.2 seconds away!

265
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,453
And that would be...

266
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:54,503
...here!

267
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:58,203
A building around here with
verandas facing south or west!

268
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:01,953
And an apartment with
a naked man on the veranda...

269
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,053
There he is!

270
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:08,013
That's the man whose
daughter was kidnapped!

271
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:09,973
That just leaves
the kidnapper's location...

272
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:13,553
Darn it! Where is he?!

273
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,353
I'll do anything you say!
Just spare my daughter's life!

274
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,583
Anything?

275
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,643
Anything at all!

276
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,413
Good! I was waiting to hear that!

277
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,363
Go get a knife from the kitchen.

278
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:31,423
A knife?! Alright...

279
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:37,623
Now I see! The kidnapper's
going to force him to kill himself

280
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,333
to get revenge without
dirtying his own hands!

281
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,923
I brought it.

282
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:44,883
Alright. This will be my last demand.

283
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:50,753
Thrust the knife into your
throat and I'll let your daughter go.

284
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,753
I can't do that!

285
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,353
Oh?

286
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,313
So, you don't care
what happens to your daughter?

287
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,873
Darn it! If I don't hurry!

288
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,233
Where's the kidnapper?!

289
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,373
Alright... I'll do what you say!

290
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:14,163
Just let me talk
to Junko one last time!

291
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,413
Fine.

292
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:16,713
Daddy!

293
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,833
Junko! Are you all right?!

294
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,483
Just hold on a little longer!

295
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,543
Daddy! I wanna go home!

296
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:26,343
I hate this smell!
It smells like rubber!

297
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,963
Rubber?!

298
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:32,513
The tire factory!

299
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:34,933
Over there!

300
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,063
I can't see the building!

301
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:43,583
Darn! It's not the tire factory?!

302
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,543
Calm down!

303
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:48,413
What buildings near the factory
have a view of the victim's veranda?

304
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,943
There's three of them!

305
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,533
Which one?!
Which apartment building?!

306
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:02,203
The only one downwind from it...
is that building!

307
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:03,793
That's gotta be it!

308
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:07,253
Somewhere in that building are
the kidnapper and Junko-chan!

309
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:12,413
Conan! Do something, quick!
He's really gonna kill himself!

310
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,763
Junko-chan is in danger, too!

311
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:19,043
I'm gonna let you experience
the same sadness I did!

312
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,523
The exact same sadness!

313
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:24,163
The exact same sadness...

314
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,233
The roof!

315
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,663
The kidnapper is on the roof!

316
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:28,233
Eh?!

317
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:29,613
Of that apartment building!

318
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,353
One of you two call the police!

319
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:35,123
Right!

320
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,703
Wait for me, Conan!

321
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,663
That's it! Jab it right in!

322
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:43,963
Don't be rash!

323
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:46,423
That's it! Just thrust it in!

324
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,133
Do it! Thrust it in!

325
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,093
Junko!

326
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:56,763
What're you hesitating for?!
Do it! Jab it in!

327
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,473
Junko!

328
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,273
Who's there?!

329
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:02,983
Who the hell're you?!

330
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:05,693
Edogawa Conan! A detective!

331
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:10,863
Eat this!

332
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:17,913
You did great!

333
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,953
Junko... forgive me!

334
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,873
Junko-chan's dad! She's safe!

335
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,793
I caught the kidnapper!

336
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,753
Daddy! I'm safe now!

337
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:33,823
I was rescued!

338
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:34,723
Junko...

339
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:38,293
You really are safe?!

340
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,683
Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

341
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,653
Here I come, kidnapper!

342
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:51,583
Huh?!

343
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,043
Aw, you beat him up yourself?

344
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:57,573
No, uh, he was so surprised
when I showed up

345
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,173
that he fell and hit his head!

346
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,623
Aw, man...

347
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:40,633
It's broken!

348
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,093
I'm really sorry...

349
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:45,373
Guess that means
good riddance to these things!

350
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:49,433
But, at least it was useful
before it broke, Mitsuhiko-kun!

351
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,893
Yeah...

352
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,853
Oh, geez...

353
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,823
Crap! I forgot!

354
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:59,283
Beika Martial Arts Arena
Gyokushinkai Karate Tournament

355
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:01,243
Yikes!

356
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,203
It's over already?!

357
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:09,163
But, that was one mean roundhouse
that high school girl won with!

358
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:14,133
Yeah! You mean Mori Ran?!
She was awesome!

359
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:17,253
So, the clincher was
Ran's special roundhouse kick?

360
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,923
Conan-kun!

361
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,343
Did you watch?!

362
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:26,303
Of course! Your roundhouse
in the finals was awesome!

363
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,253
I used my roundhouse
to win in the semi-finals!

364
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:32,663
I won the finals by default
because my opponent was hurt!

365
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,273
Conan-kun...

366
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:37,573
You broke your promise, didn't you?!

367
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,793
I'm sorry!

368
00:23:48,203 --> 00:23:51,083
So, the arrow was shot
through this window?

369
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:54,623
What's this?

370
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,253
The shards are all lined up...

371
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,513
Part of the soot is gone...

372
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:07,653
An unburned wood chip...

373
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:12,423
On the next Conan: "The Crane That
Returned a Favor Murder Case."
