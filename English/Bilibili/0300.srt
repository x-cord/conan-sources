1
00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.324
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:05.824
Today's episode is the 300th.

4
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:07.024
We want to show our appreciation to our fans

5
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.024
with a touching solution.

6
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.724
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090
Kogoro, Ran and I travel to the Kanmon Strait

10
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.990
which connects Honshu and Kyushu,

11
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.990
we meet a group of four former high school classmates there.

12
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.590
The next day, another classmate,

13
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.190
Seiji Hario is found dead.

14
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.790
The police suspect the four at first

15
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.890
but their alibis check out

16
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.590
and they are cleared.

17
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.790
But...

18
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.690
I've got it.

19
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.290
I know how to break their alibis now.

20
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.290
"Friendship and Murder at the Kanmon Strait (Part 2)"

21
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.290
"Shimonoseki Central Police Station"

22
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.890
Something's bothering me though.

23
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.490
What is it?

24
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.590
Hey listen, that surveillance camera you mentioned,

25
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.490
is it the ceiling type?

26
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.790
You were made a peace sign.

27
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.990
Why you... Stop butting in...

28
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.190
Ceiling type?

29
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.990
Peace.

30
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.390
"Human Tunnel (Shimonoseki side) Entrance"

31
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.790
What did you say?

32
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.290
Are you telling me you didn't get a clear look at his face?

33
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.990
Yeah, the camera's aimed at an angle.

34
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.090
But I'm sure it was him

35
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.590
because he was wearing the same clothes

36
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.290
in the picture you showed me.

37
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.190
But...

38
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.990
If you didn't see his face,

39
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990
you don't know for sure it was him.

40
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.990
Conan! When'd you sneak in here?

41
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.990
But Mr. Mouri, what if this man wasn't really Mr. Hario?

42
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.290
Yes. He might have been killed way before this

43
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.090
which means, anyone of those four could have committed the murder.

44
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.790
"Karato Pier"

45
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.490
I want to apologize for calling you out like this.

46
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.990
It's alright. But why me?

47
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.090
It's my father's fault.

48
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.190
I think he still suspects you and your friends.

49
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.590
"Eiko Nojima (30)"

50
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.590
I see.

51
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.490
That Seiji Hario was a horrible guy himself, wasn't he?

52
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.590
He was responsible for breaking you and Hondo up

53
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.190
and yet he said he didn't know who Hondo was.

54
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.090
I'm sure Hondo can't rest in peace.

55
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.890
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.590
No need to apologize.

57
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.590
Pitiful, aren't I?

58
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.990
Calling you out to talk about something like this.

59
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.290
You're in love with someone, aren't you, Ran?

60
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.590
No. I mean...

61
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.290
I wonder what those people are doing over there?

62
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.390
That lighthouse is known as "The Lovers' Lighthouse".

63
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.690
The Lovers' Lighthouse?

64
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.590
When lovers place their hands on the lighthouse together and pray,

65
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.590
they'll be able to overcome any obstacle and be married.

66
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.490
Eiko.

67
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.790
Have you been on the ropeway?

68
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.190
The one at Hinoyama.

69
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.090
No.

70
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.790
Why don't we go now?

71
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.290
Okay.

72
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.490
"Karato Marketplace"

73
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.690
Yes. No mistake about it.

74
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.090
Mr. Akitaya got a call right after he got here.

75
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.690
He got here a little before 11 am, I think.

76
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.590
And if I remember right, we were talking for about an hour.

77
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.590
I guess Mr. Akitaya was telling us the truth.

78
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.190
So where's this Kaikyokan?

79
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.790
On the other side of the bridge.

80
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.690
It's about a five minute walk from here.

81
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.390
You mean this marketplace where Mr. Akitaya was

82
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.790
and the ferry landing where Mr. Otsubo was

83
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.290
and Kaikyokan where Ms. Nojima and Ms. Isaka

84
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.490
were are all within walking distance.

85
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.390
Yes, I remember these two very well.

86
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.490
They were both so pretty,

87
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.890
they called someone from that walkway.

88
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.790
Then they went to watch the performing seal act at 11 am.

89
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.090
So that means...

90
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.390
Excuse me, Miss.

91
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.590
That man you were just talking to sent me here

92
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.590
to ask you something he forgot.

93
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.490
What is it, kid?

94
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.090
The employee over there didn't remember Mr. Otsubo either.

95
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.990
I knew it.

96
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.990
But Mr. Mouri,

97
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.490
Akane Isaka and Eiko Nojima saw him get on the 11 o'clock ferry

98
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.290
from over there.

99
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.390
But Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo are engaged to each other.

100
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.890
But Eiko Nojima claims she saw him too.

101
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.490
That's what I don't understand.

102
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.690
Conan! Are you still following us around?

103
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.790
I noticed Ms. Nojima only uses her glasses when she's driving.

104
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.390
Glasses?

105
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.590
When she was leaving the police station yesterday,

106
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.290
she put her glasses on when she got in the car.

107
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.990
What?

108
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.090
When I asked at the aquarium,

109
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.590
they told me she wasn't wearing glasses then.

110
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.890
I guess she only needs them to look at things that are far away.

111
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.590
That's it. They used her.

112
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.290
They used her.

113
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.790
What do you mean?

114
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.790
"Hinoyama Ropeway"

115
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.390
Is that right?

116
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.790
Yes.

117
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.590
Wow, this is fantastic.

118
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.090
Did you and Hondo come here on your dates?

119
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.590
Yes.

120
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.290
He and I didn't like crowded places.

121
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.490
The others,

122
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.990
Akitaya, Otsubo and Akane were always watching over us.

123
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.690
How nice...

124
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.290
You were all very close, weren't you?

125
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.290
I can't understand how father can suspect such nice people like you,

126
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.890
he's awful.

127
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.190
I'm the one that's awful.

128
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.090
What was that?

129
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.590
Are you saying Mr. Akitaya, Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka

130
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.390
worked together and killed Mr. Hario?

131
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.790
That's right.

132
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:16.190
Then they came up with fool proof alibis using Ms. Nojima.

133
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.290
Are you sure?

134
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.590
The Mr. Otsubo that Ms. Nojima says she saw from here was a fake.

135
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.690
He was an imposter.

136
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.190
-An imposter. -An imposter. But...

137
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.290
how do you know only the three of them were in on it?

138
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.790
Wouldn't it be logical to assume

139
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.990
that Ms. Nojima was in on it too?

140
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.190
She and Ms. Isaka met in front of this aquarium.

141
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.790
We know it's true because we have witnesses.

142
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.490
If she was in with them,

143
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.590
she and Ms. Isaka would have come here together.

144
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:56.190
Because that would give them time to work out their plan.

145
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.890
I see what you mean.

146
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.190
Can you get those four together again?

147
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.790
I'll explain everything then.

148
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.190
I'll get right on it.

149
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.290
Yes. Anzai here.

150
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.390
What did you say?

151
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.990
What's wrong?

152
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.090
It seems Ms. Nojima just turned herself in

153
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.990
for the murder of Mr. Hario.

154
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.090
Eiko Nojima?

155
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.290
I don't understand.

156
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.090
This morning, I think it was about 10:00 am.

157
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.290
I went to the hotel Seiji was staying at

158
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.190
and asked to talk to him.

159
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.990
I took him to the area near the Kanmon Bridge.

160
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.290
To the same place Hondo committed suicide 12 years ago

161
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.490
when his dream was taken away by Hario.

162
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.490
At that same place,

163
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.490
I asked him

164
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.490
to apologize to Hondo,

165
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.690
even if it was one just word.

166
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.390
But, he...

167
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.990
just laughed.

168
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.290
He did it to himself, it's all his fault.

169
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.890
Why should I apologize to a piece of trash like him for?

170
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.790
Before I realized what I was doing, I...

171
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:37.190
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

172
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.990
After she hit him, he fell and then stopped moving?

173
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.790
Then I wonder why...

174
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.490
What made you turn yourself in?

175
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.190
I never imagined Akitaya or the others would be involved in this.

176
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.090
I didn't want to drag them into this on my account.

177
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.590
I still want to talk to the other three.

178
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:14.590
Mr. Mouri, you still think those three were in on it too, don't you?

179
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.890
There're too many things that can't be explained clearly.

180
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.790
Then why is Ms. Nojima insisting she did it herself?

181
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.390
To protect them.

182
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.690
They're all former classmates,

183
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.790
she probably thinks friendship means she has to protect them.

184
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.490
That's it. That explains everything.

185
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.990
That means...

186
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.190
So a call came in on their cellular

187
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.290
and all of a sudden they got shocked?

188
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.590
Yes. Then they both ran out of here.

189
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.890
I knew it.

190
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.390
Then that person's the only one who could've done it.

191
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.540
Eiko Nojima has confessed that she alone is responsible

192
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.440
for the death of Seiji Hario, but...

193
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.640
I do not believe her.

194
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.440
Toru Akitaya. Keisuke Otsubo. Akane Isaka.

195
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.140
You three killed him.

196
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.440
Now wait just a minute.

197
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.240
Just sit down.

198
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.440
You'll have a chance to talk later.

199
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.140
Mr. Akitaya, you hated Mr. Hario

200
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.140
because of the unexpected and unfair news of your company's buy out.

201
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.440
That was probably your motive.

202
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.340
And Mr. Otsubo and Ms. Isaka,

203
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.140
went along with your plan out of deep friendship.

204
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.940
Slightly past 10 am,

205
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.840
you three called Mr. Hario out

206
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.540
and killed him by the Kanmon Bridge.

207
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:05.140
Then you worked up very detailed alibis.

208
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.040
Mr. Otsubo dressed himself up as Mr.Hario

209
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.340
and Mr. Akitaya dressed himself up as Mr. Otsubo.

210
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.040
Then Ms. Isaka called Ms. Nojima and asked her to meet her.

211
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.640
At 10:50 am, the two meet in front of Kaikyokan.

212
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.340
Look, it's Otsubo.

213
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.140
Ms. Isaka made Ms. Nojima think

214
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.740
Mr. Otsubo was getting on the 11:00 am ferry.

215
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.640
But, the person on the landing

216
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.440
was actually Mr. Akitaya wearing Mr. Otsubo's clothes.

217
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.140
They used the fact that she had poor eyesight.

218
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.140
Of course Mr. Akitaya never got on that ferry.

219
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.940
He hid Mr. Otsubo's clothes somewhere

220
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.540
then went to the Karato Marketplace for his meeting.

221
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.940
Then at the 11:00 am, the appointed time.

222
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.540
Mr. Otsubo, disguised as Mr. Hario,

223
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.540
makes the call to Mr. Akitaya.

224
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.240
What do you mean his ghost?

225
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.140
I've heard enough nonsense.

226
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.640
They made it look like Mr. Hario was killed after 11 am

227
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.140
so that they could all have alibis.

228
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.440
Mr. Otsubo disguised himself as Mr. Hario who was already dead

229
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.440
and Mr. Akitaya disguised himself as Mr. Otsubo giving him his alibi.

230
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.340
Ms. Isaka used Ms. Nojima's poor eyesight

231
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.140
to backup Mr. Otsubo's alibi.

232
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.540
And that's how they worked it.

233
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.640
He's wrong.

234
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.040
That's awful. You're all friends,

235
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.340
how could you use Eiko like that?

236
00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.940
No, Ran, you're mistaken.

237
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.540
Mr. Mouri, you're wrong.

238
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.640
I killed Hario.

239
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.940
But Ms. Nojima...

240
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.940
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

241
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.140
Is this the Sleeping Kogoro pose I've heard so much about?

242
00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.740
But the case's already solved...

243
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.440
90 percent of what I just said is true

244
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.540
but I need to make a few corrections.

245
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.440
Are you trying to say Mr. Akitaya and his friends

246
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.040
weren't in it together?

247
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.840
I thought they were at first

248
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.440
but that turned out to be a mistake.

249
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.240
-A mistake. -Conan!

250
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.240
A little past 10 this morning,

251
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.640
Ms. Isaka and Mr. Otsubo were shopping in Moji

252
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.940
when Ms. Isaka got a call on her cellular.

253
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.440
The two of them got very shocked and they ran out of the store.

254
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.140
Mr. Otsubo, Ms. Isaka.

255
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.940
That call was from Mr. Akitaya, wasn't it?

256
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.640
He told you Ms. Nojima had killed Mr. Hario, right?

257
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.040
Mr. Akitaya probably went to see Mr. Hario

258
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.240
about his company's buy out.

259
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.940
When he got there,

260
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.740
he saw Ms. Nojima has gotten there first

261
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.340
and was taking him somewhere.

262
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.040
He was worried about her

263
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.740
so he followed them,

264
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.540
that's when he witnessed it.

265
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.840
Mr. Akitaya called you and told you what happened

266
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.140
and when you two found out, you rushed over there.

267
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.140
The three of you then thought you had to do something

268
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.040
to protect Ms. Nojima,

269
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.040
that's when you thought of what I explained earlier.

270
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.040
They did it for me.

271
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.840
Of course. After all, we're all friends, aren't we?

272
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.340
Then who is the murderer?

273
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.140
Like I've been saying from the start, I did it.

274
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.040
Did you hit him twice?

275
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040
Twice?

276
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.540
There are indications

277
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.940
the victim was struck twice in the back of the head.

278
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.440
That can't be.

279
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.240
I only hit him once.

280
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.740
Ms. Nojima, I have no doubt you struck Mr. Hario.

281
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.940
But that blow didn't kill him.

282
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.240
You ran away thinking that you'd killed him.

283
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.440
But he later regained consciousness.

284
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.940
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

285
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.440
Mr. Hario was really killed

286
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.440
by the fatal blow delivered

287
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.040
after he regained consciousness.

288
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.840
And person who could have done it

289
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.840
is the one who stayed behind after Ms. Nojima had left,

290
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.540
Mr. Akitaya, it was you.

291
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.140
Darn, that Eiko...

292
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.240
You'll pay for this.

293
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.440
Yes, you're right.

294
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.240
It was me, I killed Hario.

295
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.540
But... how...

296
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.240
how did you know he regained consciousness?

297
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.640
There was a lot of dirt and grass on the tips of his fingernails

298
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.340
and there were scratches on his fingertips

299
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.840
like they'd clutched the ground.

300
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.040
But according to Ms Nojima's statement...

301
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.740
He fell slowly then stopped moving.

302
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.840
If that were the case though,

303
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.840
his fingers wouldn't be in the condition they were.

304
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.040
And that's what told me,

305
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.140
Mr. Hario had regained consciousness after Ms. Nojima had left,

306
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.140
he clutched his head with his left hand

307
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.740
and put all his strength into his right hand

308
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.240
to pull himself up, he made several attempts...

309
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.540
and that's when the fatal blow was delivered.

310
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.840
The company...

311
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.540
I couldn't stand the thought of him buying it,

312
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.840
that's why I did it.

313
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.040
Are you sure...

314
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.340
that was your only reason?

315
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.540
If you hadn't done what you did,

316
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.140
I'm sure he would have gone to the police

317
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.240
and told them what Ms. Nojima had done.

318
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.040
You wanted to protect her.

319
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.940
Isn't that right, Mr. Akitaya?

320
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.440
Akitaya...

321
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.940
Still, it doesn't matter what the motive was

322
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.840
or what kind of person he was,

323
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.340
no human being should take another's life,

324
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.640
it's unforgivable.

325
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.340
Shinichi?

326
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.340
Shin...

327
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.240
