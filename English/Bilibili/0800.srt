1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,340
Please wait, Detective!

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,940
I'm still not convinced.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,240
Ms. Tanaka.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,440
But don't you agree?

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,340
The abductor said, "Don't contact the police.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,840
Because if you do, the child is dead."

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,540
If the abductor finds out

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,040
that there is a GP whatever in the bag and on the car,

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,640
God knows what he will do with the child!

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,140
Don't you think so too, Mrs. Saeki?

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,940
Yes, but...

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,340
Ms. Tanaka, I perfectly understand how you feel.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,840
We, as much as you do,

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,540
are intent on getting Reina back safely.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,540
We ask for your cooperation in order to stay ahead of the perp.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,840
Suzuko, please do as the police say.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,940
I understand.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,040
Listen. This cash is to be exchanged for Reina, understand?

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,240
If they say, "We'll return the hostage later,"

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,640
don't give them anything!

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,240
No way!

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,640
If I refuse, who knows what the perp will do to Reina.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,240
You don't have to refuse.

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Just give it to him without resisting.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,140
Hey, Detective!

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,540
You remark so simply because it's not your money,

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,940
but it's 100 million, you know? 100 million!

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,340
I can't afford the cash being taken

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,140
and not getting my daughter back either.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,840
But the perp is also human.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,140
I'm sure he'll understand our sincerity and give her back to us.

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,140
But is the house maid going to do okay

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,440
as the transporter of the ransom?

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,740
I hope she doesn't go along

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,940
all the way with the perp and then be thrown out.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,240
Okay. I'll be on my way, then.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,640
We're counting on you!

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
Madam.

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
There's dust on your sleeve.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,340
Thank you.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,740
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

42
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,940
Love and cases come from the same origin.

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,740
The ransom for an abduction.

44
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Ends up in an unexpected place.

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:01,734
"Chase the Hundred Million Yen"

49
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:10,334
I have your daughter Reina.

50
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:14,534
If you want her back, one hour from now at 10 am,

51
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,434
have Ms. Suzuko Tanaka bring 100 million yen

52
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:21,434
and come by herself to Beika Central Park.

53
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:26,234
If you contact the police, your child is dead.

54
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,634
The car is moving smoothly.

55
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,234
It'll arrive there in five minutes.

56
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,834
Copy.

57
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:37,734
There are currently no suspicious movements or characters for now.

58
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:41,334
Okay! I want to confirm one more time.

59
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:45,634
If the perp appears together with the hostage,

60
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:49,234
rescue the hostage and arrest the perp.

61
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:53,134
If the perp appears alone, make no move.

62
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,834
Let him go and go after...

63
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,534
Let him go?

64
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,134
Detective, what's going to happen to my 100 million yen?

65
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:02,534
Please calm down, Mr. Saeki.

66
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,234
Let the specialists handle it.

67
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,834
We've already taken all the measures necessary.

68
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,234
Please leave it to us.

69
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:13,734
A transmitter is inside the bag that the 100 million yen is in

70
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,834
and it's set up on the car, too.

71
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:20,334
There's one set up in the broche that Suzuko is wearing, too.

72
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,734
So we are aware of the movements of the perp

73
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,034
no matter what it may be.

74
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,134
Yes, this is Tanaka.

75
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:30,434
Yes, I've just arrived at the park.

76
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,234
The money is ready.

77
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,934
Is Reina okay?

78
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:39,634
What? The name of Reina's ballet teacher and her birthday?

79
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,934
Why does the perp want to know something like that for?

80
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,834
He's confirming whether Suzuko is really who she is.

81
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:51,534
Her teacher's name is Miyuki Ishikawa.

82
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,434
And I think I've heard in the past

83
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:56,534
that her birthday was on Valentine's Day.

84
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,434
The sandbox?

85
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:05,234
Yes. Dig the west corner of the sandbox?

86
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,734
The sandbox?

87
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,534
I found it.

88
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,834
I found it!

89
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,234
Yes, I have the map.

90
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,934
The open lot in Haido-cho?

91
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:41,334
It seems that the perp has a station wagon

92
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,834
and new bag waiting at the open lot in Haido-cho.

93
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,934
He's going to make her switch the bag

94
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:47,934
with the ransom inside and the car here.

95
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:52,034
The perp probably knows that the police had been contacted

96
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,234
and therefore, is on the look out for transmitters.

97
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:57,434
Darn it! What a smart guy.

98
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:02,334
Everyone, rush over to the open lot and put on the transmitter

99
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,334
where the station wagon and the bag is.

100
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:08,734
You've got to complete the job before Suzuko arrives there.

101
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:26,034
The open lot is over there.

102
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:29,534
That's...

103
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,634
Inspector! It's dangerous for the investigators to go near the car!

104
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:35,234
Dangerous? Just what do you mean?

105
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:36,434
Please take a look!

106
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:41,834
There are no covers around the car in question!

107
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,134
The movements of the investigators

108
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:44,834
are in clear view from the surroundings.

109
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,434
Got you!

110
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,534
Everybody, stay away from the car.

111
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,534
Wait until further orders!

112
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:54,934
So we cannot use the transmitters in the bag and on the car now.

113
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,834
Pops.

114
00:07:56,834 --> 00:08:00,834
I wonder how the perp plans to transport the ransom?

115
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,734
100 million yen is pretty heavy, isn't it?

116
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,534
It's only about 10 kilograms, right?

117
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,834
With a car prepared, it's no big deal.

118
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:14,234
But if he's the type of perp who's concerned about transmitters,

119
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:15,934
I'm sure that he'll come up with the idea

120
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,534
of the police taking down the numbers of the bill.

121
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,634
Well...

122
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,934
There are security cameras everywhere now.

123
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:28,134
So if such bills are used, it'll be exposed immediately, right?

124
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,934
Inspector! This is Takagi!

125
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,734
Suzuko has finished moving the ransom into the new bag

126
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,534
and will start off in the station wagon.

127
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,234
Hello?

128
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:55,234
You know the Matsubara Jewelry Store in Kuin-cho, don't you?

129
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,534
The Matsubara Jewelry Store in Kuin-cho?

130
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,334
Yes, I do.

131
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:05,834
Then use the ransom to buy diamonds.

132
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,534
Worth 100 million yen.

133
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:11,134
What? You want me to buy 100 million yen worth of diamonds?

134
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,334
I see.

135
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,434
He's planning to exchange the cash for diamonds.

136
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,434
But can I just go there suddenly

137
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,934
and buy 100 million yen worth of diamonds?

138
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,634
Don't worry.

139
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:28,734
I've ordered 10 pieces of diamonds under President Saeki's name.

140
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,534
Don't be ridiculous! I haven't order it!

141
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:34,934
I'll contact you again then.

142
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:40,734
That perp really thought it out.

143
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:43,934
With 10 pieces of diamonds, he can easily hide it in his pocket

144
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,334
or exchange it for cash.

145
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:50,234
And moreover, he can change it to cash with unrecorded numbers.

146
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,034
Let's contact the jewelry store

147
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:54,434
and ask them not to sell the diamonds.

148
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,434
No can do.

149
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,034
We shouldn't go against what the perp says.

150
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,734
I tell you that idiot Matsubara.

151
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,834
I mean it's not like I just got to know him.

152
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,434
It's 100 million, you know? 100 million!

153
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,934
I'm trying to make good business with him all the time.

154
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,134
The least he could do was confirm it with me.

155
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,934
Be careful, please.

156
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:22,334
Because it's not cheap, you see.

157
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,434
Yes.

158
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:28,134
Please give my regards to President Saeki.

159
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,134
Thank you very much.

160
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,934
Hello?

161
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,834
Did you buy the diamonds?

162
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:45,534
Yes. 10 diamonds about the size of the tip of my little finger.

163
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,434
What should I do now?

164
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:52,634
Go slowly down Sakura Blvd.

165
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:55,434
And turn left at the first light.

166
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:58,434
Turn left on the first light, right?

167
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,934
Okay.

168
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,434
What's up ahead?

169
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,334
The Tohto Central Station.

170
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,034
Private Railway TR

171
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,634
is a terminal station where they have subways and such.

172
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:13,634
There are more than enough escape routes here.

173
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:15,834
He could also take the long distance bus.

174
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,634
All officers head for Tohto Central Station on the double!

175
00:11:21,634 --> 00:11:26,134
At this point, the info that Suzuko is giving us is all we can go on.

176
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:32,734
What? I'm not going to Tohto Central Station?

177
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,434
Where to, then?

178
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,034
Please tell me.

179
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:40,234
What's the matter? What are you so flustered about?

180
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,034
No, it's nothing.

181
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,434
I just want to see Reina as soon as possible.

182
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:47,934
I see.

183
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:52,634
I'd like to release Reina as soon as possible, too.

184
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,134
However...

185
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:58,134
Ms. Tanaka, you're wearing a microphone on you, aren't you?

186
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,434
I already know about it.

187
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,934
You keep repeating everything I tell you.

188
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,734
At first, I thought you were repeating what I was saying to confirm

189
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:12,534
but it seems unlikely now.

190
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:19,134
You're giving the police a detailed account of everything, correct?

191
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,034
No, I would never.

192
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:25,034
I haven't told the police, just as I've promised.

193
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,034
I think a microphone is embedded in the broche

194
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,634
you are wearing on your chest.

195
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:36,434
I've been watching you with my binoculars from the start

196
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,534
and have been concerned about it.

197
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,634
If you want me to return Reina to you,

198
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,634
please throw it out of the car window.

199
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,934
In order for the transaction between you and I to go smoothly,

200
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,834
the police are a bother.

201
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,734
I understand.

202
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,034
Suzuko!

203
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,634
Darn it! She broke it!

204
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:05,434
She's not answering her cell phone either.

205
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,239
Inspector Megure!

206
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:23,139
What? You lost track of her?

207
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,939
Yes. The perp seems to have had a bike prepared beforehand

208
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,639
and Suzuko rode it and went from alley to alley.

209
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,939
What I feared has happened.

210
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,039
It seems that I've lost sensible judgment

211
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,039
for being too intent on wanting to rescue the hostage.

212
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
100 million yen worth of jewels.

213
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,039
I wonder where she took it?

214
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,639
Of course. Where else but to the abductor.

215
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,739
What if the abductor and Suzuko are in this together?

216
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,239
What?

217
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:59,139
Then, she could've fled along with the 100 million yen worth of jewels.

218
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,939
Which means that we've been deceived since yesterday's abduction?

219
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:04,939
It can't be.

220
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,339
Madam!

221
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,039
Sonny. What brings you here?

222
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,439
The diamonds.

223
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:42,739
Where are the diamonds?

224
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,339
What?

225
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,239
I was told to put them in a bottle with a red ribbon around it

226
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:51,139
and throw it in the river.

227
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,739
Is that what the perp told you to do?

228
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:57,939
Yes. He told me to come to this wharf, so I came.

229
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,239
A bottle with a red ribbon around it was here.

230
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,339
So I did as I was told.

231
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,039
And did you notice anything else different?

232
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,739
Now that you mentioned it. For some reason,

233
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:15,239
there were many ants on that bottle that was washed clean.

234
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,739
-Ants? -Right, a lot of ants.

235
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,039
Madam, I think you should contact the police quickly

236
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,939
because they're worried about you.

237
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,439
That's right.

238
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,739
I see.

239
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,639
So that's the story.

240
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:00,939
Reina! Reina!

241
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:18,539
Champagne.

242
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,439
You're in a good mood, sir.

243
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,739
Did something good happen?

244
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,839
What do you want, sonny?

245
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,939
What are you doing here?

246
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:37,239
Sir. Do you know that there was a kidnapping case today?

247
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:41,039
No. Maybe that news was on TV?

248
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:47,539
Nope. I don't think any station is airing it yet.

249
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,539
Put jewels in a bottle and drop it in the river.

250
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,739
Yes, that's right.

251
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,939
And? Was Reina rescued?

252
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,939
Yes, she was released by sundown.

253
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,639
That's good to hear.

254
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,239
If the ransom money was taken

255
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,939
and Reina didn't come back either...

256
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,139
Well, it's not that great though.

257
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,639
What?

258
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,039
Well, you see.

259
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,139
I brought the bottle with the jewels inside with me.

260
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,839
Inside...

261
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,039
there are 10 diamonds, too.

262
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,239
But it's strange, isn't it?

263
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:32,839
I wonder why the perp let Reina go

264
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,939
despite not getting hold of the diamonds yet?

265
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:37,639
Beats me. I wonder why?

266
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,839
There's one other thing that's strange.

267
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,239
You couldn't possibly buy 10 diamonds this big

268
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,739
for 100 million yen, could you?

269
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:49,239
I'm sure these diamonds are fake.

270
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,639
I see.

271
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,839
That housemaid called Suzuko

272
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,539
must've switched the diamonds for fake ones.

273
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,139
I'm sure Suzuko is in this with the perp.

274
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,439
That's why Reina was released.

275
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,739
-Wrong. -What?

276
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,939
If Suzuko was in this together with the perp,

277
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:10,439
she wouldn't have to prepare all this fake stuff.

278
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,139
"I handed the diamonds over to the perp."

279
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,539
That's all she has to say.

280
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,939
That's true.

281
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,839
Then, who on earth?

282
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,639
Come on, you're playing dumb.

283
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,939
You're the one who sold her these glass balls

284
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:27,339
for 100 million yen, right?

285
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,039
Owner of the Matsubara Jewelry Store,

286
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,439
Mr. Akira Matsubara.

287
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,639
Don't be ridiculous.

288
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,839
It's true that I gave the 100 million yen diamonds

289
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,339
to that housemaid called Suzuko...

290
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,239
There were two reasons why you chose Suzuko

291
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:48,239
to transport the ransom for you.

292
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:55,239
One reason was because Reina was the apple of her eye.

293
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,939
So you thought that she'd do anything,

294
00:18:56,939 --> 00:19:00,739
and you told her to do it for Reina.

295
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,839
And the other reason was,

296
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:07,239
in case you chose the rich Mr. Saeki or his wife as the transporters,

297
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,139
they would readily find out that the diamonds are fake.

298
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:14,039
As to that housemaid Suzuko,

299
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,139
she rarely has a chance to see big diamonds,

300
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:20,639
so you knew the odds of her knowing that they were fake would be slim.

301
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,639
Then, after you sold her the fake diamonds,

302
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:28,039
you instructed Suzuko to put those fake diamonds into this bottle

303
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,639
and told her to throw it in the river.

304
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,539
If in case somebody finds out that the diamonds are fake,

305
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,339
you're the one who would be suspected.

306
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,139
Seems like Suzuko was flustered

307
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,039
and didn't notice anything about this bottle,

308
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,139
but it's really light compared to ordinary ones.

309
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,739
Even if an ordinary bottle were to be thrown in,

310
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:51,039
the chances of it being retrieved would probably be slim.

311
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,539
However, to make the possibility of retrieval even closer to zero,

312
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,839
you used this bottle.

313
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,439
You used this bottle made of candy glass that is usually used

314
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:03,639
as little props when shooting movies and TV dramas.

315
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,339
If this bottle is thrown into the river,

316
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,539
it would eventually melt,

317
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,639
bump into something and shatter to pieces and disappear.

318
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,139
The fake diamonds would sink to the bottom of the river

319
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,339
and retrieval would be impossible.

320
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,639
Then you can use the 100 million yen that you got a hold of legally.

321
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:25,139
After all, you got hold of it through a legal transaction.

322
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:28,139
You really thought it out well.

323
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,739
Exchanging ransom for the hostage

324
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:34,439
is usually done at the very end.

325
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:38,439
But you did that in front of the eyes of the police

326
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:41,739
while transporting the ransom.

327
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,939
Where's the proof? Do you have proof?

328
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,139
The proof is that bottle.

329
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:52,739
Candy glass type bottles have limited use

330
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,739
and cannot be preserved for a long period of time.

331
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,739
So they have to be made one-by-one by hand.

332
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,239
So if we trace the route of where you got the bottle,

333
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:04,039
your name should emerge.

334
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,939
And you probably didn't take care when handling the bottles,

335
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:11,639
because you planned to sink them to the bottom of the river.

336
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,239
I'll bet your fingerprints are on the fake diamonds?

337
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,939
I'll just crack all these bottles!

338
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,839
Then they won't serve as evidence!

339
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:32,839
Here they come.

340
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,739
What? Did you catch a cold?

341
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:07,739
Yes.

342
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:10,139
I'm starting to get the chills.

343
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:13,139
Then drink medicine and keep warm.

344
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:15,639
Yes, I'll do that.

345
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,639
Come to think of it, Ran said that

346
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,639
when she was about to wash your clothes this morning,

347
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,539
she found little fish in the pocket.

348
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,739
I hope you weren't swimming in the river or something like that?

349
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,239
No way.

350
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,839
I thought so. You may be a kid,

351
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,839
but you'd never do something like that in this cold.

352
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:41,439
I did exactly that, you see.

353
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,039
"Next Episode"

354
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,739
Help!

355
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:50,339
The incense burner is missing?

356
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:52,539
The precious family treasure is gone.

357
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,139
