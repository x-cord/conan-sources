1
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.710
Waves.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.310
When I see the rear view of Sera running off,

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.110
I always hear it in the back of my mind.

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.610
The sound of the waves.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.910
As if a spell has been cast over me.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.610
I got homesick for Japan and returned.

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.710
In order to meet again with the magician.

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.910
Postscript?

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.810
"P.S. Have you already meet your magician?"

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.710
I guess.

11
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.010
Magician?

12
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.710
The magician is not me.

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.810
What?

14
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.010
You're the magician.

15
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.810
Listen.

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.310
Sera, have you by chance met me before?

17
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.710
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

18
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.210
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210
Including the mysterious Sera,

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.310
the high school girls trio show off their swimsuits.

21
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.110
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.110
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.610
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:17.867
"Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 1)"

25
00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.067
How is it?

26
00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.367
Well...

27
00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:48.767
Looks good, right?

28
00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:52.767
It'll melt Shinichi's heart, Mrs. Kudo.

29
00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.467
I already have.

30
00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:59.767
We didn't invite Shinichi to the pool.

31
00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.067
Then, it's your turn next, Sonoko!

32
00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:11.767
How about it?

33
00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:14.167
It's sexy and looks good, right?

34
00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.167
It does, doesn't it?

35
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:19.767
But maybe if Kyogoku sees it, he may nags at you.

36
00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:24.467
"Sonoko. Women should keep their hips warm."

37
00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:25.467
like so!

38
00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:27.867
You're right.

39
00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.167
Because he's a typical Japanese man!

40
00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.667
Then, it's my turn next!

41
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:37.467
Watch closely now.

42
00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:42.667
What was that about?

43
00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:49.567
Good, good!

44
00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.467
It's sporty and cute!

45
00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:57.267
When I was little, I used to wear swimsuits like these a lot.

46
00:04:57.267 --> 00:05:03.067
I was actually attracted by the ones called micro bikinis too but...

47
00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:05.167
-I don't think you should get that. -I don't think you should get that.

48
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:06.667
You think?

49
00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:12.467
If you wear something like that with your physique...

50
00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:14.067
How rude.

51
00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:15.267
I'm going to bloom into an attractive sexy woman soon.

52
00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:18.067
That swimsuit looks familiar.

53
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.867
If she was wearing a swimsuits,

54
00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:21.467
it means I've seen it at a pool or the beach.

55
00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:29.367
I'm scared.

56
00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:31.867
It's like I'm possessed by something.

57
00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.467
Who are you?

58
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:40.567
One possessed by Death.

59
00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.267
You're a magician!

60
00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:56.867
So, next, next!

61
00:05:56.867 --> 00:05:58.667
Let's get with it!

62
00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:01.467
What? You're still going to keep trying on?

63
00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:07.267
How is this?

64
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.667
I sort of feel like...

65
00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:38.867
I don't belong here.

66
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.767
Hey!

67
00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:45.267
May I go to the toy floor?

68
00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:46.967
Sorry.

69
00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.267
Conan, you're bored, aren't you?

70
00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:50.467
Yeah.

71
00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:53.967
You may but don't talk to strangers!

72
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:55.267
Okay.

73
00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.767
I'll go pick you up after we buy our swimsuits,

74
00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.167
so let's go eat at a restaurant, okay?

75
00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.267
You must be starved, kid.

76
00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:04.667
No, I'm already had my fill.

77
00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:21.667
But I wonder what was that?

78
00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.867
The memory I recalled a while ago.

79
00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:25.967
You're a magician!

80
00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:29.267
If that double tooth girl was Sera,

81
00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:31.967
then that man wearing the sunglasses was...

82
00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.167
Who are you?

83
00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:37.567
He was really young but maybe he was Mr. Akai?

84
00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:41.867
If so, who was that young boy and woman?

85
00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:45.767
I feel like I've met them somewhere.

86
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.767
But, where was it?

87
00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:51.267
Don't you remember?

88
00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:53.567
It's me! Nitsuka!

89
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:55.567
I see...

90
00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.667
I fainted in the fitting of this shop last week

91
00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:01.367
"Tomoyo Nitsuka (43)" -and was taken to the medical office. Nitsuka!

92
00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:03.167
Nitsuka.

93
00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:05.467
"Reia Nanbu (24)" -I remember!

94
00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:07.967
You're the one who fainted from anemia.

95
00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:09.867
It wasn't anemia!

96
00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.667
I'm allergic to dogs!

97
00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:14.367
That woman who was covered with dog hair

98
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:17.767
was using the fitting room before me

99
00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:21.167
so my body had allergic reaction, that's why I fainted.

100
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.567
I see.

101
00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:26.467
That's why I'm asking you whether that woman is here today or not!

102
00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:31.367
I have no idea what woman you are talking about.

103
00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:36.267
Remember, the snobbish one with evil looking eyes and super flashy nails?

104
00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:38.467
Gosh.

105
00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:42.267
The woman that you're referring to as snobbish with evil looking eyes

106
00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:46.967
and super flashy nails, could that by chance be me?

107
00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:51.667
"Ritsuko Sashihara (41)" -Ms. Nitsuka, was it?

108
00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:54.367
If you hate dog hair so much,

109
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.867
why don't you try on the clothes while holding your breath?

110
00:08:57.867 --> 00:08:59.367
Right, Ms. Yamaki?

111
00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:01.667
Don't you think so too?

112
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.567
Oh, but president.

113
00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:04.967
"Ayami Yamaki (35)" -Dog allergy is a symptom that occurs

114
00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:07.567
not only by inhaling dog hair

115
00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:12.067
but also by touching dog hair, dandruff or saliva.

116
00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:13.767
Is that so?

117
00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:17.767
Which means that I can't try clothes on

118
00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.767
unless I wear socks and wet suits.

119
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:22.167
Hey, you!

120
00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:23.567
President.

121
00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:25.867
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

122
00:09:25.867 --> 00:09:29.367
What? How dare you voice your opinion at me?

123
00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:30.467
What?

124
00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:33.067
Have you forgotten that I took on your debts,

125
00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:36.967
and even hired you to work at my company?

126
00:09:38.067 --> 00:09:41.667
No. I haven't.

127
00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:44.967
Well... there are three fitting rooms

128
00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:46.267
so I think we can work things out

129
00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:48.067
if you can agree on which room you'd like to use?

130
00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:51.667
That sounds good.

131
00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.567
Ms. Nanbu.

132
00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:56.067
I don't recognize you.

133
00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:57.267
Are you new here?

134
00:09:57.267 --> 00:10:01.967
Yes! I was just assigned to this shop last month.

135
00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:04.267
I know the owner.

136
00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.867
I'll be sure to tell him about you.

137
00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:09.267
Thank you!

138
00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:13.567
That there's an eyesore at his shop who dared to tell me what to do,

139
00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:16.367
so fire her immediately!

140
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:17.867
But...

141
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:21.667
Come on now, show me the clothes you recommend!

142
00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.867
Because I've to attend a party overseas next week!

143
00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:31.367
Come on! Hurry!

144
00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:35.167
Unlike you, I don't have all the time in the world!

145
00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.467
I don't know what's going on,

146
00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:38.467
but I guess I'll let sleeping dogs lie.

147
00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:45.667
You mean there are obnoxious women like her among the customers?

148
00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:46.767
Yes.

149
00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:52.267
That type of woman is the first to fall victim in mystery stories.

150
00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:54.067
Come off it, Sera!

151
00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:57.667
That's not nice!

152
00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:59.567
What's the name of the shop?

153
00:10:59.567 --> 00:11:02.767
It was a shop called Simusa on the fourth floor.

154
00:11:02.767 --> 00:11:04.767
Hey, why don't we go there now?

155
00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:05.767
What?

156
00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:08.267
I want to take a look at that woman!

157
00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:09.567
Forget it!

158
00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:13.067
We all bought cute swimsuits and are in a good mood.

159
00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:14.367
Swimsuits.

160
00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:17.167
Sera.

161
00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:20.167
You know the first swimsuit that you tried on today...

162
00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.267
That's right!

163
00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:24.967
That swimsuit. Didn't you wear it somewhere else before?

164
00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:27.467
It kind of looked familiar.

165
00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:29.167
Really?

166
00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:32.367
Come to think of it, maybe it was back then.

167
00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:33.367
So, Ran saw it too.

168
00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:37.867
Hey, look...

169
00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:41.867
What's wrong, Sonoko?

170
00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:46.367
The shop that the kid was talking about is near here.

171
00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:47.667
Let's go see.

172
00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:49.467
I said, forget it.

173
00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:00.467
Hey, Conan!

174
00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:02.167
A person's dead!

175
00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:05.367
-Somebody call the police! -Somebody help!

176
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:07.867
That's the shop I just went to.

177
00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:37.734
Hey, Conan!

178
00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:39.534
A person's dead!

179
00:12:39.534 --> 00:12:42.434
-Somebody call the police! -Somebody help!

180
00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:45.334
That's the shop I just went to.

181
00:12:56.134 --> 00:12:57.934
Did you call the police?

182
00:12:57.934 --> 00:13:02.234
-Just now. -And don't let anyone who is at the shop leave!

183
00:13:02.234 --> 00:13:04.234
Okay!

184
00:13:04.234 --> 00:13:06.134
There is a Yoshikawa Line on her neck.

185
00:13:06.134 --> 00:13:08.534
So, I'm pretty sure it's death by strangulation.

186
00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:14.934
Her left hand is in her pocket.

187
00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:16.034
Why?

188
00:13:23.734 --> 00:13:25.734
She's pointing to the next room?

189
00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:28.334
Who was in the fitting room left of her?

190
00:13:28.334 --> 00:13:30.434
Me.

191
00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:33.034
Don't tell me that you're the one who did it?

192
00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:35.834
Stop joking, of course not!

193
00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:37.634
Then, who was in the room to the right?

194
00:13:37.634 --> 00:13:41.334
Me. Is there any problem with that?

195
00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:44.834
Who was the first to find this?

196
00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:47.234
That salesclerk.

197
00:13:47.234 --> 00:13:51.134
Yes, the customer died in the fitting room.

198
00:13:57.434 --> 00:13:59.734
She is holding something in her right hand too.

199
00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.134
Lipstick?

200
00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:06.934
Come to think of it,

201
00:14:06.934 --> 00:14:10.134
there's a trace of lipstick being wiped off with a finger.

202
00:14:10.134 --> 00:14:11.834
Before she was killed,

203
00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:15.134
she put lipstick on her thumb and then grabbed it.

204
00:14:15.134 --> 00:14:17.734
But, why?

205
00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:19.234
What on earth was it for?

206
00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:30.734
No way.

207
00:14:30.734 --> 00:14:34.934
The one who died was the woman that Conan was just talking about?

208
00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:39.034
Yes. The snobbish and obnoxious woman.

209
00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:42.434
It's because Sera said that she would be the type to first victim

210
00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:45.434
in mystery stories.

211
00:14:45.434 --> 00:14:50.334
No, I think it's that kid who's summoning death.

212
00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:54.134
And who's the victim?

213
00:14:54.134 --> 00:14:55.634
Yes, sir.

214
00:14:55.634 --> 00:14:58.734
She's Ms. Ritsuko Sashihara, 41 years old.

215
00:14:58.734 --> 00:15:01.634
It seems like she's a president of a cosmetic company.

216
00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:05.534
The cause of death was suffocation due to strangulation.

217
00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:07.534
According to the forensic,

218
00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:12.034
the perp wrapped the rope around the victim's neck from behind

219
00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:14.734
and pulled it by carrying her on the perp's back.

220
00:15:14.734 --> 00:15:16.234
I see.

221
00:15:16.234 --> 00:15:18.434
And who first discovered the body?

222
00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:20.134
The first person to discover the body was...

223
00:15:20.134 --> 00:15:22.534
Me!

224
00:15:22.534 --> 00:15:25.534
And you are?

225
00:15:25.534 --> 00:15:27.334
I'm a salesclerk here.

226
00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:29.734
My name's Reia Nanbu.

227
00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:34.234
Since Ms. Sashihara didn't come out of the fitting room for a while,

228
00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:37.034
so I called out to her but got no answer,

229
00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:39.834
when I opened the curtain and looked inside,

230
00:15:39.834 --> 00:15:41.334
I found her like this.

231
00:15:41.334 --> 00:15:45.934
And back then, who was using the fitting room on both sides?

232
00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:49.434
I was in the room to the left.

233
00:15:49.434 --> 00:15:54.034
Oh, I work for President Sashihara and my name is Yamaki.

234
00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:57.834
When the president goes shopping, I usually accompany her.

235
00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:01.434
I'll tell you because I know you're going to ask anyway.

236
00:16:01.434 --> 00:16:04.934
I was in the fitting room to the right.

237
00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:07.234
I'm Tomoyo Nitsuka!

238
00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:10.434
Well, I'm just a customer

239
00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:14.134
who has nothing to do with that woman who was killed, though!

240
00:16:14.134 --> 00:16:17.134
Besides, it seems that this fitting room to the right

241
00:16:17.134 --> 00:16:20.634
was being used by someone else before me.

242
00:16:20.634 --> 00:16:23.934
Somebody? Did you see the person's face?

243
00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:27.334
No. All I saw was the white sandals

244
00:16:27.334 --> 00:16:29.234
that were in front of the fitting room!

245
00:16:29.234 --> 00:16:31.734
I saw those sandals too!

246
00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:34.234
I saw them too!

247
00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:39.034
About how many customers were in the shop back then?

248
00:16:39.034 --> 00:16:43.034
I think there were about four to five customers.

249
00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:44.834
After hearing that someone was murdered,

250
00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:48.634
they all left not wanting to be involved.

251
00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:54.034
Although that boy told me not to let anyone leave.

252
00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:56.134
Why are you here, Conan?

253
00:16:56.134 --> 00:16:59.534
It's because I heard that salesclerk scream.

254
00:16:59.534 --> 00:17:03.534
I was by the escalator near this shop back then.

255
00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:05.834
Right, Sera?

256
00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:09.434
Yeah. I heard about it from Conan that

257
00:17:09.434 --> 00:17:11.834
the woman who was killed

258
00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:14.134
and the three others here were having a bit of trouble

259
00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:17.334
before the incident occurred.

260
00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:25.034
But it's not good that the customers who were in the shop left.

261
00:17:25.034 --> 00:17:30.034
Yes. The customer who was wearing those white sandals is of concern too.

262
00:17:30.034 --> 00:17:32.034
Is there a security camera in the shop?

263
00:17:32.034 --> 00:17:34.234
Yes, there is.

264
00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:37.734
But I don't think there were any cameras around the fitting rooms.

265
00:17:37.734 --> 00:17:39.934
I see.

266
00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:44.234
That leaves us with the only clue being the two hands of the victim?

267
00:17:44.234 --> 00:17:47.834
The thumb and the index finger of the left hand were erect.

268
00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:49.334
She seems to have been holding her thumb

269
00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:52.734
that she had lipstick on under the other fingers of her right hand.

270
00:17:52.734 --> 00:17:54.334
What on earth is this?

271
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:55.834
Can't you figure it out?

272
00:17:57.634 --> 00:18:00.234
That's a dying message!

273
00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:02.334
A message from the dead!

274
00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:04.534
Well, it could be,

275
00:18:04.534 --> 00:18:07.034
but it also could be that the perp left it behind deliberately.

276
00:18:07.034 --> 00:18:09.934
See, take a good look at it again!

277
00:18:09.934 --> 00:18:11.634
Both of her palms!

278
00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:13.634
Both of her palms?

279
00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.634
She's still got clear nail marks on both her hands, right?

280
00:18:17.634 --> 00:18:23.234
If it was the perp who made her grab a fist,

281
00:18:23.234 --> 00:18:26.134
these marks wouldn't have been left behind like this.

282
00:18:26.134 --> 00:18:29.734
The victim grabbed a fist with all her might as she was being strangled,

283
00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:32.934
In order to tell everyone who killed her!

284
00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:34.034
I see.

285
00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:35.534
If so, in which direction was her left hand facing

286
00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:38.534
at the time her body was found?

287
00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.234
Her hand was inside the right pocket,

288
00:18:41.234 --> 00:18:43.634
so her finger was pointed to the left.

289
00:18:43.634 --> 00:18:44.834
Left?

290
00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:48.434
In other words, the person who was in the fitting room to the left...

291
00:18:48.434 --> 00:18:51.734
I didn't do it!

292
00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:55.134
If the person that I killed had her hand in her pocket,

293
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.434
I would take it out and confirm!

294
00:18:58.434 --> 00:19:02.434
Because she may be holding some evidence!

295
00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.834
Besides, the perp may have

296
00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:08.134
changed the direction of the corpse after killing her?

297
00:19:08.134 --> 00:19:11.134
You're right.

298
00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:15.334
Hey! Maybe this is a number?

299
00:19:15.334 --> 00:19:16.434
What?

300
00:19:18.634 --> 00:19:21.134
Number? This?

301
00:19:21.134 --> 00:19:26.034
The victim used to go a lot overseas, right?

302
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:29.234
She said that she was going to a party overseas next week too.

303
00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:33.434
Yes. She used to travel the world every week.

304
00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:35.234
In order to expand the market.

305
00:19:35.234 --> 00:19:38.334
Then, she must've gone a lot to Europe too?

306
00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:39.334
Yes.

307
00:19:40.434 --> 00:19:43.034
When they gesture using their fingers to represent numbers,

308
00:19:43.034 --> 00:19:46.334
in Europe, the thumb means one,

309
00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:48.134
the index finger is erected for two

310
00:19:48.134 --> 00:19:51.234
and the middle finger for three.

311
00:19:51.234 --> 00:19:54.634
In other words, this shape means two.

312
00:19:54.634 --> 00:19:57.734
It's indicating you, Ms. Nitsuka!

313
00:19:57.734 --> 00:19:59.934
Hey, you gotta be joking?

314
00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:04.834
Why would I have to kill that woman who has nothing to do with me?

315
00:20:04.834 --> 00:20:07.434
No, well...

316
00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:09.334
Hey, Conan.

317
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.834
Is it really like that in Europe?

318
00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:16.134
I saw on TV that they do so in Germany and France.

319
00:20:16.134 --> 00:20:19.634
But at the place where I went to study abroad,

320
00:20:19.634 --> 00:20:21.734
when indicating numbers to someone,

321
00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:23.334
it was the same as in Japan.

322
00:20:23.334 --> 00:20:24.734
First the index finger,

323
00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:25.834
then the middle finger

324
00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:29.234
and the ring finger were erected in that order.

325
00:20:29.234 --> 00:20:32.434
You went to America, didn't you, Sera?

326
00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:35.734
American counts in the same way as Japan!

327
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.934
That's right!

328
00:20:38.934 --> 00:20:40.534
Come to think of it,

329
00:20:40.534 --> 00:20:43.334
that shape of the hands resembles something, doesn't it?

330
00:20:45.934 --> 00:20:48.134
A gun?

331
00:20:49.534 --> 00:20:54.134
The guns that the Japanese police use are...

332
00:20:54.134 --> 00:20:56.134
New Nanbus!

333
00:20:56.134 --> 00:20:57.634
That's it!

334
00:20:57.634 --> 00:21:00.934
If so, that makes you the perp, Ms. Nanbu.

335
00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:02.234
What?

336
00:21:02.234 --> 00:21:05.134
I'm not the perp!

337
00:21:06.234 --> 00:21:08.134
In other words,

338
00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:10.434
if only the shape of the left hand,

339
00:21:10.434 --> 00:21:13.934
it can be interpreted in many ways.

340
00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:19.134
If so, the problem is her right hand that had lipstick on

341
00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:20.934
and was grabbing a fist.

342
00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:23.534
I have no idea what it means.

343
00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:28.534
And it's a mystery that no one heard the victim's scream too.

344
00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:29.734
Yeah.

345
00:21:29.734 --> 00:21:32.734
Usually if someone comes into the fitting room,

346
00:21:32.734 --> 00:21:36.334
anyone would scream at that point.

347
00:21:36.334 --> 00:21:40.534
At any rate, I'll have to hear you three out individually

348
00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:43.234
in a separate room.

349
00:21:44.334 --> 00:21:47.134
Then, may I go to the room too?

350
00:21:47.134 --> 00:21:49.734
What? Why?

351
00:21:49.734 --> 00:21:51.634
He said a while ago, didn't he?

352
00:21:51.634 --> 00:21:56.634
That he saw the victim and those three arguing with each other.

353
00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:03.634
I guess I don't have a choice.

354
00:22:03.634 --> 00:22:05.334
Okay then, Conan.

355
00:22:05.334 --> 00:22:09.234
Then I'll go along as Conan's guardian.

356
00:22:09.234 --> 00:22:10.334
What?

357
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.934
"Next Episode" -All three drew similar pictures.

358
00:23:56.934 --> 00:24:02.334
The thing is how did the perp make it into the fitting room?

359
00:24:02.334 --> 00:24:03.534
Yeah.

360
00:24:03.534 --> 00:24:07.834
The perp's reflection should've been seen on this mirror.

361
00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:09.434
I see.

362
00:24:09.434 --> 00:24:11.534
So, that's what happened.

363
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:14.834
But what would anyone use something like this for?

364
00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:18.334
We're going to make the other customer!

365
00:24:19.034 --> 00:24:24.334
Next Conan, "Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 2)"

366
00:24:24.577 --> 00:24:26.977
Next Conan's Hint:

367
00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:29.277
"Sandals"

368
00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:30.677
-Have you solved the mystery? -Yep.

369
00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:33.477
But I've yet to solve the mystery about you, Masumi Sera.
