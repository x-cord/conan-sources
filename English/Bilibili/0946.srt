1
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,570
Hey, Mizusawa.

2
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,270
Well, Umeki?

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,370
Did you get in touch with the police?

4
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,370
"Umeki Hiromichi (45), Company President" -Sorry. My signal's weak,

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,070
so I couldn't reach them.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,270
"Sho Mizusawa (25), Employee" -Could you try yours?

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,770
Got it.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,770
Be careful. It's slippery.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,170
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,370
The worst drought in 50 years.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,970
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,670
A skeleton is discovered at the bottom of a dam.

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,770
A drama spanning time and space begins.

15
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,270
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,970
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:56,931
"The Cursed Tears of Borgia (Part 1)"

19
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:03,531
Do you remember the case of the Cursed Tears of Borgia?

20
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,531
40 years ago, while Beika City-based Yamato TV was

21
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:10,531
"Old Yamato TV (Approx. 1975)" -filming a show

22
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,131
to commemorate their fifth anniversary,

23
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:18,031
the leading lady went missing while wearing a prop ring set

24
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,731
with the jewel known as the Tears of Borgia.

25
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:29,331
However, suspect Yuri Saeki has been discovered after 40 years

26
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:34,431
as a skeleton at the bottom of a dried up dam.

27
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,431
"I Killed Them."

28
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,231
What?

29
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:43,531
"Sumire Saeki (20)" -It was the title of the drama they were filming

30
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:46,031
when my grandmother allegedly ran off

31
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,931
with the ring that was discovered.

32
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,631
I see.

33
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,931
At the time, my grandmother was living here in Beika City,

34
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:58,231
but after the case, the family fled under cover of night

35
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:02,931
because of the abuse they suffered from the media.

36
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:11,031
But the ring wasn't in the car my grandmother was found in.

37
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,931
On top of that, she...

38
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,431
Died after being stabbed in the stomach with a fruit knife.

39
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,231
What? Really?

40
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:21,131
They didn't mention that on the news.

41
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:22,431
Yeah.

42
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,431
Mizusawa, the man who found the body,

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,831
is one of my drinking buddies.

44
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,331
My grandmother is a victim!

45
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:33,731
Someone must've stolen the ring from her and killed her!

46
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:40,431
Of course, it's a 40-year-old case.

47
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:43,031
I know it will be difficult.

48
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:46,231
But if you could at least clear my grandmother's name...

49
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,531
Very well.

50
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:55,331
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes...

51
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,031
I thought so.

52
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,931
I understand.

53
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,831
Thank you, Inspector.

54
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:03,131
Goodbye.

55
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,531
What did the police say?

56
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:10,731
Like you said, it's a 40-year-old case.

57
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,131
Not only that, but during that time, it was underwater.

58
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,731
There's very little evidence.

59
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:23,531
As it stands, they're unable to conclude that

60
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,931
your grandmother Yuri Saeki was murdered.

61
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,631
But the knife...

62
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:35,431
That knife undoubtedly took Yuri Saeki's life.

63
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:39,031
But it's possible that, for example,

64
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:43,331
she regretted running off with the ring and committed suicide.

65
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,631
No...

66
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:46,231
It's a shame.

67
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:55,731
I'm sorry we couldn't help, Sumire.

68
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,931
It's okay. I understand what Mouri said.

69
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,231
But when I think of how disappointed my mother will be...

70
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,831
Hey, Sumire.

71
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:12,231
Why was your grandmother suspected of running off with the ring?

72
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,431
Hey, Conan.

73
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:19,331
It was my grandmother's job to transport the ring

74
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:20,931
from the Yamato TV studio in Beika City

75
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,631
to the dam where they were filming.

76
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,331
She went missing after she left the studio.

77
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:31,631
Yamato TV was inside the aerial lighthouse building

78
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:35,231
that's being demolished right now, right?

79
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,031
Why don't we head there now?

80
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,031
"Beika Tower Building Redevelopment Construction"

81
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,131
There's no trace of it left.

82
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,331
Yeah.

83
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:52,231
My mother would be sad if she found out.

84
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,131
Excuse me.

85
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:58,631
Yuri!

86
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:02,631
Excuse me. You looked like an old acquaintance.

87
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,631
By Yuri, did you mean Yuri Saeki?

88
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:11,331
Yuri Saeki was my grandmother.

89
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,131
"Kanoya Tatsuma (72), Kanoya Construction Advisor"

90
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:18,131
What a coincidence.

91
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:22,331
I can't believe we ran into an acquaintance of your grandmother.

92
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,631
I know.

93
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,931
Yuri's...

94
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:29,131
Rather, your grandmother's body

95
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:32,731
was discovered by my nephew Umeki.

96
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:35,331
I thought it might be fate,

97
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:39,831
so I came to see the Yamato TV building being demolished.

98
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,531
How did you know my grandmother?

99
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:46,131
I actually used to work for Yamato TV.

100
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,431
So that's how.

101
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:51,031
Yuri was a great assistant.

102
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,931
Hey.

103
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,231
Do you remember the drama "I Killed Them"?

104
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,631
Hey, Conan.

105
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:06,631
But doesn't Sumire want to know if her grandmother was innocent?

106
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,331
Yeah, but...

107
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,631
It's all right.

108
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:17,331
None of the staff believed that Yuri took the ring.

109
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,431
What?

110
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,931
I was part of the main staff.

111
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,631
I know it was so.

112
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,131
What? It was broadcast live?

113
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:33,831
How can a drama be broadcast live?

114
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,931
At the time, small stations like Yamato TV

115
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:42,231
didn't know much about video recording.

116
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,931
So they turned that lack of knowledge on its head

117
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:51,531
by calling "Killed 'Em" a "five year anniversary special live drama."

118
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,331
"Killed 'Em"?

119
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,731
That must be short for "I Killed Them".

120
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,031
You figured it out.

121
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:02,631
This industry has a habit of abbreviating everything.

122
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,531
This is how we shot it.

123
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,131
I was the one behind the camera.

124
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:11,231
Everyone's so young.

125
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,931
That's her! That's my grandmother!

126
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:17,531
She looks just like you.

127
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:25,431
Yuri and Nagisa Asahina were like sisters.

128
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:30,631
How long did the actress Nagisa Asahina appear on TV?

129
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,831
She disappeared right after "Killed 'Em".

130
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:39,131
She only debuted because she was a sponsor's daughter.

131
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:42,831
Nagisa wasn't a bad girl,

132
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,931
but she had terrible stage fright.

133
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:49,931
"I Killed Them" -I...

134
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:53,531
"Nagisa Asahina (22), Actress" -I killed them...

135
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,431
Here, Nagisa.

136
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,331
"Yuri Saeki (30), Nagisa's Assistant"

137
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,231
What about apples?

138
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:06,931
She always had her peel them to help her calm down.

139
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,831
Short strokes meant she was still anxious.

140
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:13,731
Long strokes meant she'd managed to calm down.

141
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,331
My grandmother was a good assistant.

142
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:22,831
But on that day, she traveled separately from Nagisa

143
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,531
because she had to transport the ring.

144
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,031
How did that happen?

145
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:33,431
Because there were rumors the Asahina family had purchased

146
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,931
counterfeit Tears of Borgia.

147
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,631
The Asahina family requested that

148
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:47,331
Western history Professor Senju proclaim

149
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:50,431
it was genuine before the drama.

150
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,631
The jewel had to be left at the studio

151
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,531
to accommodate the professor's schedule.

152
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,531
Yuri would bring it to the filming location

153
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,831
once he gave his testimony.

154
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,931
They could've rescheduled filming.

155
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,431
They can't do that, Ran.

156
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,931
That's right, because it was broadcast live.

157
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,931
I was at the filming location as a cameraman.

158
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:20,231
Nagisa was the only actress there.

159
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:24,731
As long as the Tears of Borgia arrived by 20:20,

160
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,931
it would be in time for the broadcast.

161
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:29,331
It must've been an important prop.

162
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:33,331
It was. It needed to arrive in time

163
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,631
for its close-up during the climax.

164
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:40,331
"Kanoya Tatsuma (32)" -Switching from studio to filming location

165
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:43,031
in three, two, one.

166
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,131
We did it with one camera.

167
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:04,631
It was a chance to show off my skills,

168
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,331
until she started slowly peeling apples.

169
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,331
She peeled apples in the drama?

170
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:16,331
Yeah. It was Yuri's idea to help her calm down.

171
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,131
Being an assistant sounds like hard work.

172
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:24,331
Some actors even had her make cheat sheets.

173
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,131
For their lines?

174
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:28,531
Why would they...

175
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,131
Because it was live.

176
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,631
We didn't have time to rehearse,

177
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:37,631
so memorizing lines was quite the job.

178
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,631
But ultimately, the ring never arrived, right?

179
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:48,131
Just in case, we brought the prop ring with us.

180
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:50,131
It was a cheap one, though.

181
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,331
Oh, right.

182
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,431
But my grandmother went missing ever since.

183
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:58,131
We were so distracted by the commotion after filming

184
00:12:58,131 --> 00:13:02,431
that we put off worrying about Yuri.

185
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,031
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,731
Did something happen?

187
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,831
Nagisa collapsed right when we finished.

188
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,831
What? Why?

189
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,431
She actually had a 40 degree Celsius fever.

190
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,731
What? She filmed in that condition?

191
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:21,031
You can't cancel a live broadcast for an illness.

192
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:24,231
She knew that when she was cast.

193
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,931
It wasn't uncommon back then.

194
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,931
Does Nagisa still live in Beika City?

195
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:34,431
In a nursing facility.

196
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,731
It's called "Grand Light".

197
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:41,031
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,931
Asahina is out right now.

199
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:47,931
We haven't been told when she'll be back.

200
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:50,731
Excuse me.

201
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,831
Yes, front desk.

202
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,131
What? You got separated?

203
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,431
Someone's here to see her right now.

204
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:00,331
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,831
"Asahina" -You looked away for a minute,

206
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,531
and she disappeared?

207
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,631
You've already told her doctor, right?

208
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:16,831
I see.

209
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:27,431
She sometimes becomes panicked because of an old trauma.

210
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,331
You have to be careful.

211
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:33,031
She mixes up her memories of the present and the past.

212
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,531
In any case, I'm glad they found her.

213
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,231
"Asahina"

214
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,831
"Nagisa Asahina (62), Former Actress"

215
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,531
Ran!

216
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,931
Conan's over there. He's on the third floor.

217
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,531
Say, "ah".

218
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,631
Let's peel some more.

219
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,331
Asahina, you have guests.

220
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,731
Two young ladies.

221
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,831
Yuri...

222
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,331
Yuri, I'm sorry!

223
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,431
Forgive me!

224
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,231
Forgive me!

225
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:03,198
Yuri, I'm sorry!

226
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,898
Forgive me!

227
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,198
Well, I...

228
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,598
No!

229
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:17,498
She was supposed to be friends with my grandmother.

230
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,498
Why did she scream like that?

231
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:26,098
Something happened between the two of them that traumatized her.

232
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,798
That's probably what Shinichi would say.

233
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,998
If only he were here.

234
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:38,298
He might know where the Tears of Borgia went.

235
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:44,798
Sumire, do you know what "I Killed Them" was about?

236
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:48,998
Yes. There was once an old family

237
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:52,598
that kept the historically significant Tears of Borgia.

238
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:59,998
Back then, there was a notorious thief known as "Red Hood".

239
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:05,298
Red Hood declared that he would steal the Tears of Borgia.

240
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:09,098
The police were powerless against him,

241
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:12,498
and no one knew what he looked like beneath his hood.

242
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,298
That's the story.

243
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:21,498
What happens to the Tears of Borgia?

244
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,398
A maid comes up with an idea.

245
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:27,398
She was played by Nagisa Asahina.

246
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:30,698
He'll find it if it's hidden,

247
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:34,198
so it should be kept in plain sight.

248
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:38,298
A fake jewel is locked inside the mansion's safe,

249
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:41,698
while the real one is kept on the maid's finger.

250
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:45,698
But Red Hood's true identity

251
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:50,298
is actually her boyfriend, the butler.

252
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,498
A common story.

253
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:55,098
While the thief waits for an opportunity to strike,

254
00:17:55,098 --> 00:18:00,598
the maid is sent to some distant mountains by the master.

255
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,798
Excuse me.

256
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,098
Thank you for waiting.

257
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:07,998
About your meeting with Asahina...

258
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,098
Yes?

259
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:13,898
I'm sorry, but Asahina isn't doing well.

260
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:16,298
Could you come back another day?

261
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,498
They're worried her symptoms might get worse.

262
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:27,198
When you put it that way, we don't have a choice.

263
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,298
Hey, you!

264
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,698
Yes, you!

265
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,798
You're Yuri Saeki!

266
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,498
Yuri was my grandmother.

267
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:37,498
What a coincidence.

268
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:41,698
I'm first-rate Western history professor Senju.

269
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,898
You can't say that yourself.

270
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:45,298
Huh? Senju?

271
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,298
Wasn't he on TV?

272
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:48,698
You're right.

273
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:51,598
He must know about your grandmother.

274
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,998
"Senju Hideo (88)" -You were exactly my type.

275
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:59,198
I'm delighted to see you again, Yuri.

276
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,998
That's my grandmother.

277
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,498
You were the only saving grace

278
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:09,698
of that incredibly unpleasant program.

279
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:13,698
You truly were my ideal woman.

280
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,498
That wasn't me.

281
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:18,098
Don't be shy, Yuri.

282
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,498
Shall we get going, Sumire?

283
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,798
Indeed, how rude!

284
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:30,698
Don't you agree, boy?

285
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:31,898
What?

286
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:35,798
Don't you remember, Yuri?

287
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,098
What did Yamato TV say about that program?

288
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:41,098
I don't know.

289
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,198
That's right! I told you because you didn't know!

290
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:47,198
The Tears of Borgia was fake!

291
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:49,798
It never actually existed!

292
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:55,098
But Yamato TV didn't care about the truth.

293
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:58,398
They asked me to say it was real.

294
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,998
A sponsor's request?

295
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,398
What do they think history is?

296
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:08,198
What did you say on the broadcast?

297
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:12,098
That I'd overlook it since it was a legend,

298
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,598
but that the owners embarrass themselves

299
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:16,698
if they insisted it was real.

300
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,498
Really?

301
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,898
The TV station was displeased

302
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,698
no matter how much I denied its existence.

303
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:26,798
You're the only one who listened to me, Yuri.

304
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,698
That's why I fell in love with you.

305
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:30,798
What?

306
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,298
What?

307
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:38,298
"Nonogaki Real Estate"

308
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:45,298
I'm here on time.

309
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,598
Mizusawa, hey!

310
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,898
Shut up, you idiot!

311
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,298
Mizusawa!

312
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:54,498
Hey, Mizusawa!

313
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,598
Didn't you want to talk to me?

314
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:01,498
Open up. Hey!

315
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:02,598
It's open.

316
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:07,398
Hey, Mizusawa.

317
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,798
Didn't you say something about the whatever of Borgia?

318
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,098
Mizusawa.

319
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:17,898
Something's burning.

320
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:24,898
What is that?

321
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,498
It's Mizusawa's phone.

322
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,098
A fire? Could it be...

323
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,098
Mizusawa! Hot...

324
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,698
Hot...

325
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:40,298
Mizusawa!

326
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,898
I warned the Asahina family that employed you

327
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:49,698
not to embarrass themselves.

328
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:53,198
Don't put this counterfeit on TV.

329
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:57,298
You looked at me with your cute round eyes and nodded.

330
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,398
My heart was pounding.

331
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,398
Excuse me, professor.

332
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,798
Boorish machine.

333
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,598
Inspector Megure?

334
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:08,898
Hello? Yes.

335
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:11,398
What? My father's caught in a fire?

336
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,198
How is he?

337
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,898
Is he all right?

00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:54,998
So, where are we headed?

341
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,798
The dam.

342
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,398
There's something I want to check at the filming location.

343
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:04,698
I don't see anything.

344
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:06,898
-Not right now. -Huh?

345
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,298
I knew it.

346
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:09,798
Knew what?

00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,598
