1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,840
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,040
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Another travel mystery for our fans.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,940
The puzzle is hidden in the beautiful scenery.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,853
Goodness. Dad, it's still morning and you're already drinking.

9
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,653
What's wrong with that?

10
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:15,953
After all, I did win our trip ticket at the shopping arcade lottery.

11
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,953
I know, "We were able to go on a trip because I won the lottery."

12
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,153
Isn't that what you want to say?

13
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,453
We've heard it so many times already.

14
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,653
Isn't that right, Conan?

15
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:23,653
That's right.

16
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,853
Pops, you're a real genius at lotteries.

17
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:29,953
Not just at lotteries, at everything!

18
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,453
You think it'll go all right?

19
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:40,753
I mean he's the one who made all the arrangements.

20
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:44,053
Don't worry, Conan is very mature for his age.

21
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:46,353
As for you, dad, you're drinking too much.

22
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,953
All right...

23
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:57,053
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 1)"

24
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:10,653
This Matsue City is famous for its castle.

25
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:12,253
And for Lake Shinji.

26
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:16,553
I hear the Lake Shinji Shitchin's are worth trying.

27
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,653
"Jouzan Inari Shrine" -What is Shitchin?

28
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:21,153
It refers to the sea bass,

29
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:23,353
Japanese ice fish, pond smelt, fresh water clam,

30
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,253
moroge shrimp, carp and eel,

31
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,253
the seven delicacies caught in this lake.

32
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,553
Collectively, they're called Shitchin.

33
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:33,353
Matsue City also boasts Lafcadio Hearn known as Yakumo Koizumi.

34
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:36,453
Yakumo Koizumi, you mean the author of "Kwaidan"?

35
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,453
Yes, most people are familiar with "Mimi nashi Yoichi" (Earless Yoichi)

36
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,953
and "Yuki Onna" (Snow Woman).

37
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:45,953
And there's a spooky story based in Matsue City.

38
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,653
Do you want to hear it, Ran?

39
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,553
-Well, maybe another time. -You're scared.

40
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,753
"Matsue Lake Hotel"

41
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,653
Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

42
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,453
One of our staff will show you to your room,

43
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,353
please wait over there for a while.

44
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,953
We serve all our guest green tea and sweets.

45
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,453
Oh, thanks.

46
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,453
It's the lake!

47
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,753
How wonderful, they have such a great view of the lake from here.

48
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,053
We'll be able to see them digging for clams tomorrow morning.

49
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,553
Speaking of clam digging,

50
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:22,353
I believe Basho composed a poem about it.

51
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:24,653
Parting at Futami, dividing like Shijimi,

52
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,153
we go along with the autumn.

53
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,353
Or something like that.

54
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,653
Mr. Shiina, that's rude.

55
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,953
But, Ms. Reiko...

56
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:33,453
I hate to correct you.

57
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:36,753
But I believe it was clam and shells, not Shijimi.

58
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:37,853
Clam and shells?

59
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:39,653
Yes. Actually, the poem reads,

60
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,053
Parting at Futami, dividing like clam and shells,

61
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,053
we go along with the autumn.

62
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,253
In this connection, there's a lot of shops at Hasamichi

63
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,253
are called "Ogaki".

64
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:52,553
You do know your literature.

65
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,853
Matsue ranks high alongside Kyoto and Kanazawa

66
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:58,253
for its Japanese sweets.

67
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:01,453
Our hometown Osaka got to work harder at it.

68
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,853
He's Takumi Yagisawa.

69
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,953
He runs a Japanese confectionery shop in Osaka.

70
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,353
"Takumi Yagisawa (32)" -Oh, it's no big deal.

71
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,653
I just took over the business from my father.

72
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,453
So, you're a young master.

73
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:16,553
They sure look good.

74
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:17,953
I'm helping myself!

75
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,653
Me, too.

76
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,553
But don't forget...

77
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,753
to brush your teeth after you eat them.

78
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,453
Yes, of course...

79
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:28,153
He's Ryosuke Shiina.

80
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,153
"Ryosuke Shiina (38)" -A superb dentist.

81
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,753
Nice to meet you.

82
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:33,353
And over there is...

83
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:35,353
"Mizuki Kawaguchi (27)" -Mizuki Kawaguchi

84
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:38,453
one of my students, she also works in the library.

85
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,553
Hello.

86
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,153
Did you say student? Then, you must be...

87
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,653
Forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself.

88
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,953
"Reiko Ando (43)" -My name is Reiko Ando.

89
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,953
I do research at a junior college

90
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:51,053
in Osaka in the Japanese Literature Department.

91
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:53,953
For goodness sakes, you're an expert!

92
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,453
We're members of a linked verses group from Osaka,

93
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,553
we came to Matsue on a poetry composing trip.

94
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:02,353
You don t say...

95
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:06,453
Our other member is over there talking.

96
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,353
That's Gozo Ushikubo, he's an investor.

97
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:10,753
"Gozo Ushikubo (51)" -Which means the price of this stock...

98
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,253
will keep rising.

99
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,053
My name is Kogoro Mouri,

100
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,053
I'm a private investigator from Tokyo.

101
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:21,553
Kogoro Mouri?

102
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:25,653
Kogoro Mouri, you mean you're that...

103
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,253
Famous private detective?

104
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,053
Oh, yes.

105
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,353
Does that mean

106
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:32,053
that famous private detectives make a lot of money?

107
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,753
Well, not exactly.

108
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,453
Anyway, you...

109
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,953
Excuse me, my name is Tomonaga.

110
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:41,853
I work for Naniwa Securities at their Okayama branch.

111
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,553
Previously on another job, Mr. Ushikubo and...

112
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,853
Hey, you.

113
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:48,953
Isn't it time for you to leave?

114
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,653
You're right.

115
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,353
I enjoy poetry and I sometimes compose my own poetry.

116
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,753
I'd like to join you one day.

117
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:57,453
Mr. Mouri, I hope you have a nice visit.

118
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,153
Excuse me, Ms. Reiko, what is that big book?

119
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,253
Oh, you mean this?

120
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:10,153
This is called "Dictionary of What Things are Called".

121
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,453
We use it when we're composing poetry.

122
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,653
Would you like to look through it?

123
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,153
Yes!

124
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,553
It looks very interesting.

125
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,553
Hey, look at these shoes!

126
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,353
See, they look just like Mr. Shiina's shoes.

127
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:26,853
They're trekking shoes.

128
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,753
But then, those are for professionals,

129
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:31,953
while mine's are just an imitation.

130
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:37,153
Those shoes of yours are so fancy, they look pretty expensive.

131
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:39,253
Even though you're broke.

132
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,853
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

133
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:47,053
why don't you join us for dinner?

134
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,353
That's a great idea!

135
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:51,053
We'll get to hear stories from Japan's greatest detective,

136
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,053
what a rare opportunity!

137
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:55,053
Japan's greatest?

138
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:59,453
I'll accept your invitation, then.

139
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,353
Don't you just love these hot springs?

140
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,453
Yes.

141
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,953
Me, too.

142
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,653
It feels so good,

143
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:20,353
my body feels like it's turning into melted chocolate.

144
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:21,553
Exactly.

145
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,253
Excuse me, Mr. Yagisawa.

146
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,253
Yes?

147
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,953
What is that linked verses you were talking about back there?

148
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:28,653
How can I explain...

149
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:29,753
Simply put,

150
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,453
it's a kind of game where several people compose poems

151
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,753
and link them together.

152
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:37,453
For example, Conan, you compose a 57-5 haiku.

153
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:40,953
The next person would add another 7-7 poem to it.

154
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:45,553
Then another person would add another 5-7-5 poem to it.

155
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:49,053
And so forth, linking one poem to the other.

156
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:51,553
Is it different from haiku?

157
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:55,753
The first 5-7-5 is called hokku.

158
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:58,353
I suppose you could consider it haiku.

159
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:00,153
After all, It would contain the season word.

160
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,453
I see.

161
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,753
What kind of poem do you like, Mr. Yagisawa?

162
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,453
I like poems that are humorous.

163
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,453
What about you, Mr. Shiina?

164
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,953
Huh? Me?

165
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,353
Let's see...

166
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,453
My favorite poems are those with feelings,

167
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:20,353
like how a father feels for his daughter.

168
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,953
Pardon me for asking but do you have children, Mr. Shiina?

169
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:26,853
I have a daughter,

170
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:30,253
but my wife took her when she left me.

171
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,653
Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.

172
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:36,053
I don't blame her though, it was all my fault.

173
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,953
I was over my head in debt.

174
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,553
Thank you for listening.

175
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,453
That was wonderful, Mr. Yagisawa!

176
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:01,353
Here you go Mr. Mouri, drink up.

177
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,153
Well, that's nice of you.

178
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:07,953
By the way, have you made plans for tomorrow?

179
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,453
Oh, that's right.

180
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,153
I was meaning to ask.

181
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,853
Conan, have you ever heard of Yaegaki Shrine?

182
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:17,753
Ms. Reiko told me about it while we were in the bath,

183
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,953
why don't we go there tomorrow?

184
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,553
We're going to the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art tomorrow morning.

185
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:24,953
Then in the afternoon...

186
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,053
Yaegaki Shrine...

187
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:30,053
I believe it houses the God of marriage.

188
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,653
It's famous for it's Mirror Lake fortune telling, right?

189
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:34,953
Yes.

190
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:37,353
Well then, we'll have to go there.

191
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:41,353
All of four of us except Mr. Ushikubo are all single.

192
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,853
But Ran already has someone special.

193
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,353
Isn't that right?

194
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:52,153
I'm sure there's a bus that goes to Yaegaki Shrine

195
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:55,253
from the Matsue Onsen station in the morning.

196
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,553
You can go to the art museum in the afternoon.

197
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:01,553
All right, then. That's what we'll do.

198
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:05,153
Good grief. Look at those two, acting like you're in love.

199
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,453
Now, now.

200
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:08,353
Ms. Reiko, listen.

201
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,453
Yes?

202
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,053
Don't you think it's about time we picked the location

203
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,753
where we're going to compose our first poem?

204
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,153
You're right.

205
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,153
On that note, Mr. Shiina.

206
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:17,353
Yes.

207
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,053
The first place for the poem composition?

208
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,753
We're going to pick

209
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,353
where we're to go to compose the hokku portion of the poem.

210
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:33,353
I remember hokku is the 5-7-5 haiku that starts the linked poem.

211
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,353
Yes, the rule is to compose the poem

212
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:37,253
by describing the scene in front of you.

213
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,653
Oh, I nearly forgot.

214
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:43,353
This is for you, Mr. Mouri.

215
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,553
It's an introduction to linked poetry that I wrote.

216
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:49,353
There's a picture of us inside, too.

217
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,953
I see, you're all here.

218
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,853
There, I'm finished.

219
00:11:56,853 --> 00:12:00,153
Mizuki, can you get me my hat over there?

220
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,453
Okay.

221
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:10,853
Here you are.

222
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,253
Thank you.

223
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,253
All right. Mr. Ushikubo, you first.

224
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:17,453
Okay.

225
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,153
Since we're taking turns according to age,

226
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:22,153
so the next one is me.

227
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,053
Let's see...

228
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,753
The closest one is...

229
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:28,053
Which one is it?

230
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:31,353
All right, please open it.

231
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,953
Matsue Castle.

232
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,653
Mine is Gessho Temple.

233
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,753
Shiominawate.

234
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,153
Which means...

235
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:41,553
I'm at the art museum.

236
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,853
All right, then. We'll leave the hotel at 9 tomorrow morning.

237
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:48,053
And return by 11:30.

238
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:50,553
When everyone gets back, we'll move to Tamatsukuri Spa

239
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,253
and link the poems...

240
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,453
Is something the matter?

241
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,653
No, it's just that I wear contact lenses

242
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,453
and my eyes dry very easily.

243
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,653
So I always need my prescription eye drops.

244
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:04,953
Oh, here they are.

245
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,753
I'm such a scatter brain,

246
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,253
I forget where I leave it all the time.

247
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,853
If it's so important,

248
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:15,553
you should always carry a spare!

249
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:18,353
I always carry an extra one in my bag...

250
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:21,553
Oh, that's right. I have to make a phone call!

251
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,453
Isn't he a busy fellow?

252
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,153
He's probably just found another victim.

253
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:39,053
His motive for joining our group

254
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:43,253
was partially to get our money.

255
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,653
He's really a louse!

256
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,553
Listen up, Yagisawa!

257
00:13:59,553 --> 00:14:02,953
You're the one who can't afford to lose your business!

258
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,353
That...

259
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:10,153
Get it all ready by next week

260
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,853
or else you'll lose your business, understand?

261
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,253
Yes, I know.

262
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,261
"Yaegaki Shrine"

263
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,361
"Mirror Lake"

264
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,461
It says that if the paper doesn't sink within fifteen minutes,

265
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,361
you'll find the love of your life.

266
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,761
And if it sinks close to you,

267
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,961
it means that the person you're looking for is close by.

268
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,961
Let's try it.

269
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,461
That's why I didn't want to bring her here.

270
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,261
Ran.

271
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:40,061
I don't know how it's going to turn out,

272
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:41,261
but...

273
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,161
Sorry to keep you waiting, Conan!

274
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,461
What a cute puppy.

275
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,361
Ran.

276
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,461
Shall we go?

277
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,761
Hello.

278
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,661
Oh, dad.

279
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,861
What?

280
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:14,261
What? Mr. Ushikubo's dead?

281
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:15,561
What?

282
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:20,161
"Karamete Park"

283
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,661
It's Mr. Ushikubo.

284
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:30,261
I'm certain of it.

285
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,961
I see, so it is.

286
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:35,661
By the looks of it, he's been beaten to death.

287
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,661
He was hit on the back of the head several times

288
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,261
with a hard, blunt object.

289
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:42,261
"Officer Hirose"

290
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,861
Are you by any chance...

291
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:45,861
My name's Mouri, I'm a private detective.

292
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,361
It looks like Mr. Ushikubo tried to protect his head

293
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:51,261
with his left hand when he was attacked.

294
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,261
That's how his watch was cracked.

295
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:56,561
10:05 am.

296
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,961
I'm pretty sure we can assume that's the time of the attack.

297
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,961
Yes. And about the victim's right hand...

298
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,961
His index finger is extended Iike he was pointing to something.

299
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,461
Bamboo...

300
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,061
It could be a dying message.

301
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:20,661
There's blood on the tip of his finger.

302
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,561
And it looks like he touched something with it.

303
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,461
There's no blood here.

304
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,261
One of the pages has been ripped out!

305
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:41,861
"Autumn surges, there's no sorrow in my life."

306
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,361
-You little... -That hurts!

307
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,861
Don't touch the evidence!

308
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:58,261
"Matsue Police Station"

309
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,961
Sorry to keep you waiting.

310
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:10,061
"Officer Yasugi" -I'm Yasugi from Shimane Prefectural Police.

311
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,261
"Officer Tsubaki" -And this is my assistant, Officer Tsubaki.

312
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:15,061
-Hey, where's that kid? -And beside him is Officer Hirose...

313
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,161
of the Matsue Police Station.

314
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,261
Well, he was asking everybody questions

315
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:21,761
and then he ran off somewhere.

316
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:24,561
Good grief.

317
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,761
The reason I asked all of you to come here

318
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,761
is I need to know where you were when Mr. Ushikubo was killed,

319
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,661
which is approximately 10:05.

320
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,761
What are you insinuating?

321
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:36,961
From what Mr. Mouri tells me,

322
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:41,461
you all had a motive for killing Mr. Ushikubo.

323
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,361
Everything's bound to come out sooner or later,

324
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,761
so I think it's better for everyone to just tell the truth.

325
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:52,461
I was at the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art.

326
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,761
I went there to write a poem.

327
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:59,661
"Tiffany Garden Museum of Art" -There's a piece called Deer's Window.

328
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,461
I wrote a poem while I was looking at it.

329
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:06,261
Even Gods will gather and gaze upon Deer's Window.

330
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,161
Yes, I do remember him.

331
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:19,461
He dropped some coins and leaned over the pond

332
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,761
near the fountain in the English Garden over there.

333
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,461
Do you remember the time?

334
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:28,161
I'm sure it was a little past 11.

335
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:29,461
Thank you!

336
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,061
What are these marks?

337
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:44,861
I was at Gessho Temple at that time.

338
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,761
You probably know there's huge statue of a turtle there, right?

339
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:48,761
Yes.

340
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,961
"Gessho Temple" -I spotted a praying mantis by that statue.

341
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,261
To the huge turtle, a mantis does raise its ax in reverence forsooth,

342
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,861
is what I wrote.

343
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,961
The time was almost 10:05 am.

344
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,161
Yes, I remember.

345
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,861
He stood in front of that statue for a long time thinking.

346
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:08,761
Do you remember what time it was?

347
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,761
I'm sure it was 11:00 am.

348
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,461
11:00 am.

349
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,561
I was looking at the samurai residences at Shiominawate.

350
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,161
I was there from about 10 am until 11 am.

351
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:24,261
"Samurai residences at Shiominawate" -I don't have any witnesses,

352
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:27,761
but I sat in the rest area thinking up a poem.

353
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,561
And did you come up with something?

354
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,861
Yes.

355
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:33,861
Soft and gently where the sun shines upon

356
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,361
the dancing autumn leaves.

357
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:38,661
This is it.

358
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:39,861
Huh?

359
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,361
From the rest area,

360
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:52,861
these plants would hide the autumn leaves from view.

361
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:56,761
I went for a stroll along the lake

362
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:59,361
and then went to the Prefectural Art Museum.

363
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,061
But I didn't write a poem.

364
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,361
Why not?

365
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,561
Because on this outing,

366
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,661
I had each of them write a poem

367
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,261
I was going to select which one to use

368
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:12,061
for the start of the linked poem.

369
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:16,261
No one remembers seeing Ms. Reiko.

370
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:18,861
That's right, that memo pad...

371
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,061
There was stock information written in it.

372
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:25,461
The page that was torn out,

373
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:26,861
something must've been written on it

374
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,861
while that person was talking to that person.

375
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:32,561
"Hisatoshi Tomonaga" -Yes, Mr. Ushikubo seemed quite happy.

376
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,561
He jotted it down in his notebook.

377
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,061
I see, thank you very much!

378
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:40,061
All right. Now, I have all the information!

379
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:46,561
It seems like none of you has a solid alibi.

380
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:49,161
By the way, have you found the murder weapon?

381
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,661
We're still searching the area.

382
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:54,861
And we'll also search the places you all went to,

383
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:58,261
so please don't leave Matsue until I say you can.

384
00:21:58,261 --> 00:21:59,761
All right.

385
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:04,261
I'd like to continue our linked poem session

386
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:07,961
as a tribute to the late Mr. Ushikubo.

387
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,461
That's a good idea. Let's do it.

388
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,061
The linked poetry session...

389
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:18,061
What? You want me to join their group?

390
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,661
Yes! You're sharp,

391
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,961
So you'd be able to figure out who the killer is

392
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:23,061
just by watching them.

393
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:24,961
Well, sure. But...

394
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,461
That's a great idea!

395
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,161
Please do it!

396
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:35,261
I'm absolutely positive one of those four killed him

397
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:37,761
and we're going to find out at that poetry session!

398
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,861
"Next Episode" -Here goes!

399
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:11,361
Catching the killer will prove to all that I am a great detective.

400
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,861
All right, I'm next.

401
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:20,161
What the future holds for us

402
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,461
is what God alone knows for certain.

403
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,361
Huh?

404
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,761
Mr. Yagisawa.

405
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,161
Here.

406
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:27,561
I found it in the lobby just now.

407
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,061
Next Conan,

408
00:24:31,061 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Linked Poetry Incident At Tamatsukuri In Matsue (Part 2)"

409
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,879
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,079
"Hokku"
