1
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:04,791
Summer shines but only yesterday.

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:06,391
After you cry, there is a cheesecake waiting for you.

3
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:07,891
A keyword to find the criminal,

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:10,391
is it Japanese, English or German?

5
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,891
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,291
A child in appearance with the IQ of an adult.

7
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,591
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,843
We were at a soccer stadium,

9
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,743
watching a Tokyo Spirits game.

10
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,643
But the Tokyo Spirits lost.

11
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:20,343
We were so depressed so we headed to a department store.

12
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,343
There, we met a guy named Rutger from Germany.

13
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:29,343
"Rutger Heinen (42)" -But he happened to be attacked by somebody!

14
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:31,343
While half unconscious,

15
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:34,643
he pointed at a person as the criminal.

16
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,843
It was Genta.

17
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:39,243
What? Is it me?

18
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,843
But, don't worry!

19
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:44,643
Mr. Rutger left us a hint.

20
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,043
A hint?

21
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:48,143
Before he fainted,

22
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:49,843
Mr. Rutger pointed his finger at Genta.

23
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:52,543
Saying criminal.

24
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:54,243
He said that to you?

25
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:59,843
Yes. Was it me?

26
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:03,843
And he grabbed my shoulder and said El.

27
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:09,443
E...

28
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:13,643
El...

29
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:14,943
So, the criminal

30
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,943
is someone that has something in common with Genta,

31
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:22,243
and someone who has something to do with the word El.

32
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:30,843
"Genta's Knockout Shoot (Part 2)"

33
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,843
"Parking Entrance"

34
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:32,843
What?

35
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,243
Why am I here?

36
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:36,643
What the heck is this?

37
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:40,943
Why do I have to tell you people about it?

38
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:42,943
What is going on?

39
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,243
Here he is, Inspector.

40
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:48,043
Hey, I really don't have time.

41
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,143
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -I'm sorry,

42
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,943
"Hiromasa Inagaki (35)" -but an assault case has happened,

43
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,843
and you guys were the only ones

44
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,243
"Tatsuzo Genda (44)" -who were here at the moment of the crime.

45
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,343
So we need your cooperation.

46
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,643
"Kanji Kojima (28)" -What the heck! Are you kidding me?

47
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,243
You are saying that we are the suspects?

48
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,543
Well, you could refuse to cooperate with us here,

49
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:08,643
but it's gonna end up with us visiting your house sometime later.

50
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:11,243
Darn.

51
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:14,343
Alright! I'll tell you what I was doing!

52
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:17,843
I was just listening to the radio relay of a horse race!

53
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,543
This department store is close to an outside betting booth,

54
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:23,743
and also I was hoping to do some shopping

55
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:27,243
if I won a long shot on the track.

56
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:30,843
I see. Your name, sir?

57
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:32,743
Kanji Kojima.

58
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,743
Ko... Kojima?

59
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,043
You are the criminal, aren't you?

60
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,043
What?

61
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:41,743
You have the same last name as Genta!

62
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:42,743
Genta?

63
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:45,543
The number on your back is solid evidence too!

64
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:49,843
11 is the number Hide in Tokyo Spirits wears!

65
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:54,043
Genta is wearing a polo shirt of that team!

66
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:55,843
Are you stupid?

67
00:04:55,843 --> 00:05:00,143
There's a scoring leader named Naoki in Tokyo Spirits.

68
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,143
Yeah, that's right but...

69
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,543
In fact, we called him Genta

70
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:08,643
but never called him Kojima before Mr. Rutger, right?

71
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:12,643
Right. Without knowing Mr Kojima's name,

72
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,943
it seems impossible for Mr. Rutger to call him Genta, right?

73
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,343
That seems right.

74
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:19,643
Okay, next.

75
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:21,943
Why were you here?

76
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:25,043
I was here to buy this bag that my girl asked me for,

77
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:26,743
but there was none here.

78
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,643
So I decided to go to another department store

79
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,543
but the gate at the parking exit was broken.

80
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,143
Man, what a bad day.

81
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:36,443
Your name, sir?

82
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:37,843
What? Yes.

83
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:41,343
-My name is Genda... -Genta?

84
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:42,643
You must be the one!

85
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,043
It's Genda! Tatsuzo Genda!

86
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:48,043
I don't know what's going on, but I am not Genta!

87
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,343
No, Mr. Rutger must have heard it wrong!

88
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:55,243
You are fat just like Genta too!

89
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:56,443
Oh, please.

90
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,943
How many fat people do you think are out there in this world?

91
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,343
You know, Doc and Inspector Megure are fat too.

92
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,343
Right.

93
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:08,843
Mr. Rutger would not leave such a vague hint

94
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:12,743
if he didn't know that these three people were the suspects.

95
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:17,643
Also, after Mr Rutger saying criminal to Genta,

96
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,343
he mentioned El.

97
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:23,443
If he knew Genta's name, he would've said his name, right?

98
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:25,443
Right...

99
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,043
Okay, last. You.

100
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,943
Why were you here?

101
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:32,343
My name is Hiromasa Itagaki and I came here to see a new idol,

102
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:38,343
Ai Sakaguchi's photo session on the 6th floor of this building.

103
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,243
I'm just her groupy.

104
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:42,743
Wait a second!

105
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,043
According to your driving license,

106
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:47,143
your name "Hiromasa" is written "Taisho" in kanji, right?

107
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,943
Yeah. That's right, but...

108
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:54,243
"Inagaki Hiromasa" -If I take the first character of your name...

109
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,843
Gakidaisho!

110
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:59,343
It means pesky kid! It's Genta!

111
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:00,843
Didn't you hear me?

112
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,843
Mr. Rutger didn't know the criminal's name.

113
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,043
But it matches too well to Genta.

114
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,143
And look at his hat too!

115
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:13,243
-What? -You see the big letter L on it?

116
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,543
This is...

117
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:19,643
This is one of Ai Sakaguchi's original goods.

118
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,643
It has nothing to do with that El, I think.

119
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:22,643
What?

120
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,043
If Mr. Rutger wanted to mention hat,

121
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:28,243
he would've said "Love" rather than "El".

122
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:29,443
But...

123
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:32,143
Maybe he couldn't read it because he is German.

124
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:33,443
Did you forget?

125
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,543
His ex-wife is English.

126
00:07:35,543 --> 00:07:38,443
And because of her, he can speak English.

127
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:39,743
There's no way that

128
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,243
he would read the word "love" "L" "O" "V" "E"

129
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:45,843
It's not like Japanese words, such as "hot" and "tough",

130
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,543
And also "bill" and "talisman" which you write in the same

131
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:48,943
but pronounce differently.

132
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:53,643
I see. I get it.

133
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:55,143
What?

134
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:58,543
Actually there are some words in German and English

135
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:01,643
that have same spelling with different meanings as well.

136
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:06,143
Are you talking about the message Mr. Rutger left?

137
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,343
Yes.

138
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,843
What he was trying to tell us in the message

139
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:12,243
was that the criminal was like Genta or in other word a pesky kid.

140
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,743
Hey, Inspector.

141
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,743
You gotta let us go now.

142
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:19,743
You can't keep us here anymore

143
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,643
just because we happened to be here at the moment of the crime.

144
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,043
I have to go too, otherwise the photo session is gonna be over...

145
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:29,743
But you need to give us more details about what happened here.

146
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,843
Shut up! I did not notice

147
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:35,643
any assault case or whatever you guys are talking about, okay?

148
00:08:35,643 --> 00:08:39,043
I was listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume.

149
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:41,043
I just couldn't leave this parking lot

150
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:43,243
because the gate was broken.

151
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:47,243
Otherwise, I would be at home already with the bag I had to buy.

152
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:52,243
I was in a hurry because I wanted to get to the photo session early.

153
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:54,043
So I can get a nice shooting location.

154
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:55,443
I see.

155
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:59,043
So, you all were here at the moment of the crime

156
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:01,243
but did not notice anything,

157
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:04,643
or did not even see a suspicious person, am I correct?

158
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,643
Yeah, that's right!

159
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:10,243
You are getting suspicious toward the wrong people.

160
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:13,143
I don't know what's going on

161
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:14,243
but the guy who was attacked

162
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:16,943
pointed at this fat kid and said,

163
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:19,343
"Criminal", right?

164
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:23,043
Then, he is the one who did it, isn't he?

165
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,243
That's right.

166
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:27,243
He was all alone kicking the soccer ball.

167
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:32,643
Maybe he missed kicking the ball and the ball hit someone...

168
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:33,943
He didn't!

169
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:36,043
Genta did not do it!

170
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,743
Ayumi...

171
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,443
What do you think about it, man?

172
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:43,143
What... I think...

173
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:46,543
Mr. Rutger didn't mean that Genta was the one who did it.

174
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:49,243
Mr. Rutger pointed at Genta because he wanted to say

175
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,843
that Genta had similar features with the man

176
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:56,343
who attacked him with the steel pipe.

177
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:59,443
In other words, he's just like Genta.

178
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:02,243
He's like a pesky kid.

179
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,743
What?

180
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:06,143
A pesky kid?

181
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:09,343
I don't get it... really...

182
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,343
Hey, Mr. Agasa.

183
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:14,643
This is a case of assault, not mischief.

184
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:18,043
No, what I'm talking about is the image.

185
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,643
-Oh! I get it! -What?

186
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,343
The person who attacked Mr. Rutger

187
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:25,443
is Mr. Hiromasa Inagaki! It was you!

188
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:26,443
What?

189
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:28,043
You came here for an idol's photo session,

190
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,643
so you must have a camera!

191
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,243
So, you are a camera kid.

192
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,443
Which could be interpreted that you are a pesky kid!

193
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,643
No way.

194
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,043
Camera kid and pesky kid are different, right?

195
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,443
But they are kinda similar, aren't they?

196
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:40,643
Hey, you know what?

197
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:43,043
I think Mr. Kojima is the criminal!

198
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,443
What?

199
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:48,143
Because he looks like he'd done a lot of mischief!

200
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:51,043
What?

201
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,143
What are you, kidding me?

202
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,643
You can't just make me a criminal because of that!

203
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:59,743
He does look like he was, as Ayumi said

204
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:05,243
but I don't think Mr. Rutger knew about Mr. Kojima's childhood.

205
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,343
Then, we got...

206
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:09,643
That man named Genda,

207
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:13,043
but he's more a cool and wild middle-aged man

208
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,143
rather than a pesky kid.

209
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:17,643
He just looks evil to me.

210
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,243
Wait a second. What I'm saying is not that.

211
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:24,343
-What? -I don't see what is going on.

212
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,543
I'm saying that it was an English word, not a Japanese word...

213
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,243
It was elf.

214
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,443
Elf?

215
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:34,143
It's the pixies that you hear in fantasy stories.

216
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:35,843
Pixies?

217
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:39,043
Haibara...

218
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:49,752
Elf.

219
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,952
It means small pixie in English.

220
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,552
But at the same time,

221
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:58,852
it also means little kid or pesky kid.

222
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,952
I got it!

223
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,352
Mr. Rutger said El after he pointed at Genta!

224
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,952
But he actually wanted to say elf!

225
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:09,852
But why does it have to be Genta?

226
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:13,652
Sure, Genta looks more like a pesky kid among you all

227
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,452
but it could be Ayumi

228
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,552
if the word elf means small pixie or a little kid, right?

229
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:22,052
The soccer ball Genta kicked hit Mr. Rutger's car.

230
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:23,152
Really?

231
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:27,952
And then he looked at Genta and said,

232
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,452
"A pesky kid", precisely.

233
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:33,152
I think Mr. Rutger wanted to say that the criminal

234
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,052
was someone like Genta or elf.

235
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,552
The criminal is an elf?

236
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:39,852
I see.

237
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:44,852
The word elf is the hint to find out who the criminal is.

238
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:49,852
And the victim told us that by pointing his finger at Genta.

239
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,452
It still doesn't make sense though.

240
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:56,752
One of these three men is the pesky kid or a small pixie

241
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,652
but they don't seem to be.

242
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,352
What do you think, Mr. Agasa?

243
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,152
I forgot to tell you.

244
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:06,452
Mr. Rutger is German, so he can speak German, of course.

245
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,852
But in addition, he can also speaks English and Japanese as well!

246
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,152
Is that true?

247
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:15,352
Do you know how to count numbers in Mr. Rutger's mother tongue,

248
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,552
or German?

249
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:18,052
Number?

250
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,152
You know, Takagi?

251
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:21,752
I think...

252
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,352
Un, deux, trios...

253
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,952
That's French.

254
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:29,152
In German, 1 is eins.

255
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:31,152
2 is zwei,

256
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:32,752
3 is drei,

257
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,452
4 is vier,

258
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,052
5 is funf,

259
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,752
6 is sechs,

260
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,552
7 is sieben,

261
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,452
8 is acht,

262
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,352
9 is neun,

263
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:45,352
10 is zehn,

264
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,752
and 11

265
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,052
is elf...

266
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,452
What?

267
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,752
-Mr. Kanji Kojima. -What?

268
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:59,152
It's the number on your back!

269
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:05,052
I see.

270
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,752
Mr. Rutger meant both 11 in German and elf in English

271
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:10,852
when he pointed at Kojima.

272
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,952
Yes. He thought Conan knew a lot about German and England,

273
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,352
and thus trusted him.

274
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,752
Yeah, and you, Doc.

275
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:21,452
He thought we would figure out the meaning of elf!

276
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:24,052
Well, he can speak Japanese.

277
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:27,052
He could've said 11 in Japanese. It would be so much easier.

278
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,452
Maybe he thought that the criminal was walking around,

279
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,052
and therefore made it more complicated on purpose.

280
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,452
So that we won't be attacked by the criminal.

281
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,152
I see.

282
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:44,452
Now Mr. Kojima, you need to come to the station, please?

283
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,452
Are you kidding me, Inspector?

284
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,752
You all are talking about elf or whatever,

285
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,152
and I had 11 on my back,

286
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:56,352
but you can't make me a criminal just because of that.

287
00:14:56,352 --> 00:15:00,152
Did that German guy say elf clearly?

288
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,552
I'm asking, old man!

289
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:05,952
If you keep trusting that old man's random deduction,

290
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:07,552
you'll look like a fool.

291
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:10,452
It seems like a pretty reasonable deduction though.

292
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,152
-It's nothing. -Hey, old man!

293
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,952
You've been standing on you soapbox for long.

294
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,252
No. I...

295
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,852
I am Japanese!

296
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,852
I don't care about elf or whatever it is!

297
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,352
Stop it, please!

298
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,652
If you say so,

299
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,152
why don't you show me evidence?

300
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:27,552
-What? -You are saying I'm the criminal, right?

301
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,952
Then show me solid evidence.

302
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:32,952
Is there any?

303
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:39,152
Is there anybody who saw me hitting the foreigner and running away?

304
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:42,852
You treat me like a criminal without solid evidence.

305
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:47,452
I don't think I can stand this, Inspector.

306
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,552
I can't cooperate with you people anymore!

307
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:50,952
I'm gonna go home.

308
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,852
Wait, Mr. Kojima.

309
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,952
I saw it.

310
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:00,552
I saw Mr. Kojima

311
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,952
hit Mr. Rutger and run away.

312
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,552
I actually saw it.

313
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:05,852
What?

314
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:08,352
Is that true, Conan?

315
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:11,852
Yeah! When we found Mr. Rutger on the ground,

316
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:15,652
I also saw this person running away in a hurry!

317
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,952
Hey, kid!

318
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:19,052
Right, guys? You guys saw it too!

319
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:20,752
You saw him, right?

320
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,052
Conan?

321
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,152
You rascal!

322
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,952
Say that again, I'm gonna...

323
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,552
Can you really prove it?

324
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:32,652
Yeah!

325
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,652
Hey, why do you trust him?

326
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:37,052
I don't understand. Don't you see it's strange?

327
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:40,152
How come he didn't say it from the beginning if he really saw me?

328
00:16:40,152 --> 00:16:43,152
That old man is the reason!

329
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:46,652
He's saying complete nonsense and this kid is going along with that!

330
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:48,152
They're all lying!

331
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,652
Anyway,

332
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,352
we need you to come to the station with Conan, please.

333
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:53,352
We'll talk there...

334
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:54,952
No. I won't go there!

335
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,152
I don't have time to deal with a kid's lie!

336
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,552
It's not a lie!

337
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,952
I remember the number on your back clearly!

338
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:05,152
You little prick! I'm gonna make you shut up!

339
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:06,652
-Stop! -It's true!

340
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,752
I saw it...

341
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:11,652
Because I was the one who found Mr. Rutger first!

342
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,252
What?

343
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,652
Conan?

344
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,052
Did you hear that? Did you hear that, man?

345
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:24,352
This kid just gave himself away!

346
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:27,652
Look! You did not find the foreigner first!

347
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,952
That fat kid found him first!

348
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,552
What?

349
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,652
How did you know?

350
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:42,452
How did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger first?

351
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:43,452
Oh!

352
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,852
Takagi, did you tell him about it?

353
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:48,852
No, sir. I haven't told him yet.

354
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:51,652
No.

355
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:53,552
No! I didn't do it!

356
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,252
Yeah! It was the voice!

357
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,952
It was that kid's voice!

358
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,652
I heard that kid's scream!

359
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:02,152
-You could not hear that. -What?

360
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:04,952
Remember you said you were listening to the horse race

361
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,052
on the radio at top volume inside your car,

362
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,352
so you couldn't notice anything outside?

363
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,652
If that so, then you could not have been able to hear Genta's scream.

364
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:16,852
But you said you know that he found Mr. Rutger first?

365
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,852
I told you, I saw it!

366
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,252
I saw this kid kicking the ball alone.

367
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,252
So you know,

368
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,652
maybe I was unable to hear,

369
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,052
but I could see what was happening outside the car, right?

370
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:30,752
Right, Inspector?

371
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,252
Sure, that's true.

372
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:36,652
But how did you know that Genta found Mr. Rutger?

373
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:39,652
Genta was just kicking the ball, right?

374
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,952
Sure I know!

375
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,052
Because at that time...

376
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:45,052
-At that time, you said? -Well...

377
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,252
It was this, wasn't it?

378
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:56,552
At that time, when you hit Mr. Rutger with a steel pipe.

379
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,752
You saw this soccer ball come, right?

380
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,152
That's why you knew Genta was kicking the ball

381
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,752
and would be coming to get the ball.

382
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,452
No, I was...

383
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,452
I was listening to the horse race on the radio...

384
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,852
Then tell me.

385
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,652
Tell me the name of the horse that won the main race today.

386
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,752
-What? -You must know it if you were staying here

387
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,052
and listening to the radio relay of the horse race!

388
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:26,052
The main race was on

389
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:29,052
at the time we came back here.

390
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,752
Well, that's...

391
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:34,352
I understand that you don't remember

392
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:38,752
because you didn't have time to listen to the horse race on the radio.

393
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,952
You wanted to leave this parking lot as soon as possible,

394
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:45,552
and so headed to the exit with your car.

395
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,852
But guess what?

396
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,052
Mr. Genda was stranded at the gate

397
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:53,852
and somebody could not leave this parking lot.

398
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,752
You went back to where you were

399
00:19:56,752 --> 00:20:02,352
and started listening to the horse race on the radio at top volume,

400
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:06,352
so you can pretend that you didn't notice anything about the case.

401
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:12,252
I suppose you were totally panicked at that time.

402
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,152
No.

403
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,052
No...

404
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:25,252
I didn't do it...

405
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,552
Hey! Wait.

406
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:34,252
I got stuck here all because of you.

407
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:36,352
No. You can't do that.

408
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,452
Mr. Genda!

409
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,252
Mr. Genda.

410
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,852
What have you done?

411
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:46,752
You don't have to thank me.

412
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:49,652
I just wanted to do it.

413
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,452
"Cafe Poirot"

414
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,752
Really?

415
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:23,752
So that guy committed the crime for the money.

416
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,752
Yeah.

417
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:29,952
Detective Takagi called Doc and told him about that, I heard.

418
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,952
He's been running away from debt collectors.

419
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,952
Opportunity made him a criminal, he said.

420
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:40,652
Japanese crimes are becoming Americanized, right?

421
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:44,252
Anyway, I'm happy because Genta wasn't the criminal!

422
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:45,752
Yeah.

423
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:49,652
It felt like a living eel on a cooking board.

424
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,552
What was this foreigner thinking though anyway?

425
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:55,752
He pointed at a child and said "criminal"...

426
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:57,552
Yeah, I know.

427
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:00,452
Hi there!

428
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:04,652
What if Genta happened to be the criminal...

429
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,452
I trusted them.

430
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,452
What?

431
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,952
I trusted these little detectives.

432
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:11,552
Mr. Rutger!

433
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:14,752
Is your head okay?

434
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:15,952
Yeah, kind of.

435
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,452
Thank god!

436
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,952
Is he the German guy?

437
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:22,252
Looks like it.

438
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,952
I'm sorry, sonny.

439
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:25,052
Yeah.

440
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:27,852
As a token of my appreciation, I brought this today.

441
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:31,452
It's that cheesecake!

442
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,752
Wow, that looks nice!

443
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,352
I really wanted to eat this!

444
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:38,652
You know, I happened to miss it at that time, right?

445
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:41,052
I bought it because I thought so.

446
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,252
He already knew, Genta.

447
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:44,752
Thank you.

448
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,452
Oh, please.

449
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:50,252
How come such a dark horse won the race?

450
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:52,852
This was supposed to be an easy bet!

451
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,852
-Hey. -What?

452
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,152
The strong one doesn't win.

453
00:23:57,152 --> 00:24:00,552
The one who wins is strong!

454
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:01,952
What?

455
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,952
"Next Episode"

456
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:10,252
The criminal may be in this building still.

457
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,852
I have to go down these stairs.

458
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:18,852
The other stairs are blocked.

459
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,252
The target is probably...

460
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:34,052
Next Conan, "Real 30 Minutes"

461
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,552
Next Conan's Hint:

462
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:54,952
"A Live TV Show"

463
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,352
Next episode is a live!

464
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,552
It's the first attempt in Japanese Anime history, right?

465
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:58,852
Just kidding.
