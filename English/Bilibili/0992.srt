1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,650
Anyway, their donuts are made with soy pulp,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,990
so they're low sugar.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,710
Not only that, but they look amazing.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,360
But aren't they fried in oil?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,750
Won't it make us fat?

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,980
They've got holes in the
middle. We'll be fine.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,760
They said they're low calorie
since they're low sugar.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,260
Eat too much of anything,
and you'll still get fat.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,260
We've arrived.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,890
Well? Pretty tasteful, right?

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,850
Find the question that solves the mystery!

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,980
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,800
A fashionable café known for its donuts!

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,410
What shocking truth will the
high school detective reveal?

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,740
Always determining the one truth

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,760
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,200
his name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:34,698
Murder at the Townhouse Café

19
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,088
"Murder at the Townhouse Café!"
Murder at the Townhouse Café

20
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,968
Murder at the Townhouse Café

21
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:43,598
Wow.

22
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,618
What a pretty yard.

23
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,858
Seriously.

24
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:50,398
It's beautiful.

25
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:51,868
Yeah.

26
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:56,738
A place like this is sure to look amazing!

27
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,038
I know, right?

28
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,658
Our staff member Sakai takes
great care of our yard.

29
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,998
Tomita Satoshi (37)
Manager
Our staff member Sakai takes
great care of our yard.

30
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:06,078
It's truly impressive. I'm proud of it.
Tomita Satoshi (37)
Manager

31
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:09,038
It's truly impressive. I'm proud of it.

32
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:12,568
Yes, it really is wonderful.

33
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,108
Thank you.

34
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:15,048
Excuse me.

35
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,428
Mister, do you work here?

36
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:19,498
Ah, my apologies.

37
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,608
I'm Tomita, the manager.

38
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:25,638
I'll show you to your seats.

39
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,988
This way, please.

40
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,938
What should we get?

41
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,698
Didn't we come here to eat donuts?

42
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:36,608
Of course we'll eat donuts as well.

43
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,628
What can I get you?

44
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:44,048
What do you recommend?

45
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:48,118
Our soy pulp donuts are our number one item.

46
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:54,128
They're low sugar and made to order,
so you can enjoy them fresh.

47
00:03:55,218 --> 00:04:02,628
But judging by the state of things, this
place's popularity suddenly spiked and waned.

48
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:03,768
Sir.

49
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,478
I brought the soy pulp
out of the storage room.

50
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,708

Sakai Chitose (19)
Part-time Employee

53
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,688
All right. I've decided.

54
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,828
I'd like a hot Darjeeling tea.

55
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:21,078
Also, one shibazuke and cream
donut, two matcha and mayo donuts,

56
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:26,398
two chocolate dream donuts, one plain
donut, and one molasses crepe parfait.

57
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:27,428
How about you, Ran?

58
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,288
I'll have the same thing.

59
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,528
What? The same thing?

60
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:35,348
Conan-kun, you'll have orange juice, right?

61
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,708
Uh, yeah.

62
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,078
Thank you for waiting.

63
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,088
Wow, they're beautiful!

64
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,858
They look delicious.

65
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,228
Don't you agree, Ran?

66
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:49,888
Yeah, but we may have ordered too much.

67
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:53,858
Let's dig in!

68
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,488
Sakai, I'm counting on you.

69
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:57,148
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,778
Thanks.

71
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:00,198
Understood.

72
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,418
Conan-kun?

73
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,798
Is something wrong?

74
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:07,658
No. I'm not sure which to eat.

75
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,138
Then how about this one?

76
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:12,578
I had a bite, but it's good.

77
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:16,918
Isn't that the donut you just ate?

78
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,018
Say, "Ah."

79
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,928
An indirect kiss...

80
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,558
Right? Good, isn't it?

81
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:29,808
Yeah.

82
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,268
These are lighter than
expected, don't you think?

83
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,568
Yeah. I could eat these forever.

84
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,988
There's sourness and saltiness
behind the sweetness, too.

85
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:48,658
Yeah.

86
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,088
The sound of frying donuts really
whets the appetite, doesn't it?

87
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,318
Hey.

88
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,498
What is it, Sonoko?

89
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:06,598
Ran, doesn't he seem kind of suspicious?

90
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:10,898
You're right.

91
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:14,048
He keeps looking around
everywhere. He seems restless.

92
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,938
And doesn't that customer seem odd, too?

93
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:23,698
It's more like he's observing
donuts, not eating them.

94
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:28,068
There isn't a single decent
customer in this place.

95
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,658
What was that beeping sound?

96
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,708
I heard it, too.

97
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,838
I'll take your empty plates.

98
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:45,218
I'm stuffed.

99
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,118
I can't eat anymore.

100
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,978
You ate too much, Sonoko.

101
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,718
Speaking of eating too much,
it looks like he did, too.

102
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:54,378
He's having a pretty rough time.

103
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:56,738
I wonder if he'll make it to the bathroom.

104
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,548
Anyway, those were pretty good.

105
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:08,358
They seemed pretty high-level
for low sugar donuts.

106
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,148
But they're still fried.

107
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:12,578
Should we have eaten that much?

108
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:16,268
We'll be fine. That's why
they're low sugar, right?

109
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,128
What was that?

110
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,498
Conan-kun?

111
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:26,948
What's wrong?

112
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,718
I-It's an emergency.

113
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,338
The manager...

114
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,198
Are you all right?

115
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,098
Sir?

116
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,648
Kid, what's going on?

117
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:40,098
The manager collapsed in the bathroom.

118
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,148
What?

119
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:42,898
Was he struck?

120
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:46,528
The weapon was probably that mop.

121
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:51,528
The culprit used those gloves on the ground
to avoiding leaving fingerprints behind.

122
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:53,838
Or could it be...?

123
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:57,138
In any case, let's call an
ambulance and the police.

124
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:58,038
You're right.

125
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:05,168
The victim is Tomita Satoshi-san,
the owner of this café.

126
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:10,698
He was struck on the back of the head with
a blunt object while in the café's bathroom.

127
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:15,878
At that time, these people
were inside the café.

128
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,428
You girls again?

129
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:18,808
Sorry.

130
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:22,568
Could you tell us your names?

131
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,318
Yes.

132
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:27,468
My name is Sakai Chitose. I'm a student.

133
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:30,198
As you can see, I work here part-time.

134
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:30,788
Furukawa Yoshihisa (34)
Customer

135
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:33,338
My name is Furukawa Yoshihisa.
Furukawa Yoshihisa (34)

136
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,158
I happened to be having tea here.
Furukawa Yoshihisa (34)
Customer

137
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,568
I happened to be having tea here.

138
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,828
There's nothing suspicious about me.

139
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:40,188
Nonaka Kenji (42)
Café Manager

140
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,268
My name is Nonaka Kenji.
Nonaka Kenji (42)

00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,538
I operate a café in this neighborhood.

142
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,318
I operate a café in this neighborhood.

143
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:48,308
That's right. Come to think of it,

144
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:53,528
you always come to scout out our café
and steal our recipes, don't you?

145
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,878
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:55,878 --> 00:09:00,188
My recipes are the product
of my own creativity.

147
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,248
No one cares about that.

148
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:07,358
You gathered us here because you think
one of us is the culprit, don't you?

149
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,488
We haven't said that yet.

150
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:12,858
We just thought we'd ask you some questions.

151
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:17,058
For someone to attack the
manager in the bathroom,

152
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:21,508
they would've had to pass through this café
where you could have seen them, correct?

153
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,878
Yes.

154
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:27,288
The only person who left this room while
the manager was in the bathroom was...

155
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:29,408
Nonaka-san, I think.

156
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:32,088
H-Hold on.

157
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,428
I didn't do it.

158
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:37,228
But you're the only one who left his seat.

159
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,808
I just happened to go the bathroom then.

160
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:45,358
More importantly, Furukawa is
way more suspicious than me.

161
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:48,418
He seemed nervous and had been behaving
oddly since he entered the café.

162
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:53,078
I-I'm not nervous.

163
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,838
Now, now. Calm down.

164
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:58,108
Tell us one at a time.

165
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:01,998
What you did after the manager
went to the bathroom.

166
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:05,738
I was frying donuts in the kitchen.

167
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:09,258
I never visited the tables during that time.

168
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:14,258
Come to think of it, we
heard the donuts frying.

169
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:18,958
I-I was at my table the whole time.

170
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:22,768
Everyone here should've seen me.

171
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,208
Is that true?

172
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,788
Yes, we saw him.

173
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:30,778
Nonaka-san, how about you?

174
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,268
Me?

175
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,448
I certainly went to the bathroom,

176
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:40,288
but by the time I entered, the
manager was already on the ground.

177
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:45,088
In other words, you're the
only one who left his seat

178
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,168
to go to the bathroom when
the crime took place.

179
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:51,838
So, what? That doesn't mean I did it.

180
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,718
But aren't you the manager of a rival café?

181
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:56,998
No.

182
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:58,638
This place sells donuts.

183
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,358
I sell waffles.

184
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,348
They're totally different genres of food.

185
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,518
Are they?

186
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,418
I guess they are.

187
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,488
Excuse me.

188
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:08,988
What is it?

189
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,028
Got it.

190
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:16,778
I'm sorry, but we'd like
you to wait elsewhere.

191
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,778
We appreciate your understanding.

192
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:21,288
Based on the circumstances
and testimony so far,

193
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,708
Nonaka-san seems suspicious.

194
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:29,318
But should we trust that?

195
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:37,418
Inspector Megure, we finished
questioning the suspects.

196
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:45,428
First, sales have declined at the
café Nonaka-san operates recently.

197
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:46,938
At this rate, he's not sure if his café
will survive beyond a few more months.

Finally, the part-time employee Sakai-san
didn't get along with the manager very well.

220
00:12:11,048 --> 00:12:13,318
According to part-time employee Sakai-san,

221
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:18,258
the gloves left at the crime
scene belong to Nonaka-san.

222
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:19,218

229
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:31,508
The gloves of the only man without
an alibi were at the crime scene.

230
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:33,118
Does that settle it?

231
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:37,488
As long as Nonaka-san doesn't come
up with an alibi, it must be him.

232
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,668
I see.

233
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,828
So that's how it is.

234
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:52,134
Nonaka-san, allow me to be direct.

235
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,844
These gloves are yours, aren't they?

236
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,094
Are they?

237
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:02,594
Th-They're certainly mine,
but I lost them a while ago.

238
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,114
So they're yours, then?

239
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:09,024
You don't have an alibi, you do have a
motive, and then there's this material evidence.

240
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:12,094
Do you have any explanation for this?

241
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:13,144
Detective Chiba.

242
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:13,864
Huh?

243
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,024
What is it?

244
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,034
Listen...

245
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:20,784
Nonaka-san, could you
accompany us to the station?

246
00:13:21,014 --> 00:13:24,004
B-But... you have to believe me.

247
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,244
I really didn't do it.

248
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,294
You can tell us about it at the station.

249
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,004
Please come with us.

250
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,154
But I don't have anything to tell you.

251
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:37,334
Sonoko?

252
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:44,054
Are you okay?

253
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:49,184
Inspector Megure, could you
wait to escort him away?

254
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:50,634
What?

255
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,444
Did you figure out who did it?

256
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,374
At first glance,

257
00:13:55,374 --> 00:14:01,444
all the evidence in this case seems to
indicate that Nonaka-san is the culprit.

258
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:07,054
In other words, if Nonaka-san
really did do it,

259
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,554
don't you think it was a bit too sloppy?

260
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:10,814
That's right!

261
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:14,464
If it were me, I wouldn't
have left the gloves behind.

262
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:16,364
And Furukawa-san.

263
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:20,884
Like us, you didn't go near the bathroom.

264
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:24,594
Considering that, your alibi seems perfect,

265
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,674
but is it really?

266
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:29,184
Isn't it a perfect alibi?

267
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,474
You could at least let me go early.

268
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:35,154
And finally, the part-timer Sakai-san.

269
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,784
You said you were in the
kitchen the whole time,

270
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:40,984
but we didn't see you.

271
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,324
I was frying donuts in the
kitchen the whole time.

272
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,574
If anything, the fact that you didn't see me

273
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:49,494
proves I was in the kitchen the whole time.

274
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:54,554
Considering their testimony,
it sounds like the culprit is...

275
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:58,754
Wh-What? You still think I did it?

276
00:14:58,754 --> 00:14:59,924
Well, listen.

277
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:00,334

00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:00,504

281
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,334
who was already in the
bathroom, with a nearby mop.

282
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,134
It's a very natural and
plausible series of events.

283
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:15,844
Next, let's recreate Furukawa-san's actions.

284
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,484

285
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:19,124
Yeah.

286
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:25,364
Let's see. Furukawa-san was
in his seat the whole time.

287
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,244

him to do it without us noticing.

293
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,874
Finally, let's recreate Sakai-san's actions.

294
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,884
Okay, Detective Takagi.

295
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,454
Could you follow Sonoko-neechan's
instructions?

296
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:44,384
Got it.

297
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,954
There's only one route Sakai-san,
who was in the kitchen,

298
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:50,794
could have taken to reach the
crime scene in the bathroom

299
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:51,894
without passing by the tables.

307
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:03,774
He followed the same route
to return to the kitchen.

308
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,654
That's the route you want
me to recreate, right?

309
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,534
Yeah. Are you ready?

00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,414
Anytime.

00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,534
Okay... Ready, go.

312
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,724
How was that?

313
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,984
It's been 90 seconds so far.

Excuse me.

320

What does all of this mean?

321
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,644
It means you don't have an alibi anymore.

322
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:19,594
What?

323
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:25,404
You said you were in the kitchen frying
donuts when the crime took place,

324
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:29,404
but you could have gone anywhere
during the three minutes

325
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,904
after you put the donuts in the fryer.

326
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:38,414
But, why were Nonaka-san's
gloves in the bathroom?

327
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:43,514
If you assume Sakai-san set everything
up, doesn't that explain it?

328
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:50,244
Your leading statements made me
suspicious of you from the start.

329
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:51,804
Hold on.

330
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,974
I understand that I could've gone to
the bathroom and back in three minutes.

331
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:59,824
But isn't there a big hole in your reasoning?

332
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:01,814
A hole?

333
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,964
That's right. Allow me to explain.

334
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:07,064
Think about it.

335
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,154
What is it?

336
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,194
It's this.

337
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:15,824
While you were having tea in here,

338
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:18,954
how did I cross this section of the yard?

339
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:23,204
No one could pass through
here without being seen.

340
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,394
You're right.

341
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,134
That's not true.

342
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,134
What?

343
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:33,634
You're able to pass through
this area without being seen.

344
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,394
What are you talking about?

345
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,294
I meant exactly what I said.

346
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:43,634
You did in fact pass through this
yard and return to the kitchen

347
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:45,774
without being noticed by anyone.

348
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,014
You didn't even see me.

349
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:50,244
Show me the evidence, then!

350
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:53,994
Oh, the evidence has been standing
in front of us this whole time.

351
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:54,784
What?

352
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,664
Look closely at the yard.

353
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:00,584
Look very closely.

354
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:09,044
Apparently you took care of that yard.

355
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:13,424
Making it the same color as your uniform
must've required a lot of patience.

356
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,554
He blends in completely with the background.

357
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,774
He's perfectly camouflaged.

358
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:21,684
I borrowed the uniform in the changing room.

359
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:25,034
But even with the camouflage,

360
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:28,764
wouldn't someone notice if
he passed through the yard?

361
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:30,944
It takes only a moment to cross.

362
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:34,124
It's one thing if you're staring at the yard,

363
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:36,664
but since everyone was focused
on their tea and donuts,

364
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,584
it was unlikely that anyone would notice.

365
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,744
He probably even planned where

366
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:43,834
and how he could cross the yard
unnoticed when he set it up.

367
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,834
No. That's just speculation.

368
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,084
You need more proof?

369
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:52,594
Then what's that scratch on your thigh?

370
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:59,314
You got caught on the nail sticking out
of the wall on your way back, didn't you?

371
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,474
Detective Takagi.

372
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,124
Conan-kun?

373
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:08,214
Detective Chiba said this cloth
was stuck to a nail outside.

374
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,104
What's this?

375
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:14,114
It's the same color cloth
as Sakai-san's uniform.

376
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,764
If the police examine that cloth,

377
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:20,114
I'm sure they'll find that
it came from your uniform.

378
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:23,554
There's even more evidence.

379
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:27,834
Apparently forensics reported that they
found the laxatives you gave Nonaka-san

380
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:35,254
so he'd go to the bathroom
in the water on his table.

381
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,264
How did you know it was me?

382
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,304
My plan was perfect.

383
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,664
It was the donuts.

384
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:44,764
The donuts?

385
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:48,864
This café's donuts are made to order.

386
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:52,524
You began frying new ones when
no new customers had entered.

387
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,284
I considered what that might mean.

388
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:02,034
It's all his fault!

389
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:07,874
I came up with the menu, the
concept, and the eye-catching yard.

390
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,274
But he kept me working part-time.

391
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:13,044
He didn't give me anything.

392
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:15,384
So I...

393
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,754
Apparently the manager's all right.

394
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:27,824
I guess this case is closed.

395
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,124
You experienced your own share of misfortune.

396
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,814
I suppose.

397
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,344
Well, I should get going.

398
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:36,444
Hold on, Furukawa-san.

399
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,944
You haven't paid yet.

400
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:42,304
What? Which means...

401
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:46,584
What? Furukawa-san, you were
going to dine and dash?

402
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:47,754
That's right.

403
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:51,074
Because Furukawa-san unconsciously
touched his wallet in his back pocket

404
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:55,284
when Nonaka-san accused him,

405
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,344
Sonoko-neechan said it might be him.

406
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:01,474
Furukawa-san, could you
tell us more about that?

407
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:04,594
That's why he was acting
nervous the whole time.

408
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,604
Yeah, apparently.

409
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:09,144
Huh?

410
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:35,604
Solving that case made me hungry.

411
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:38,334
I'm hungry, too.

412
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,524
What?

413
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,544
There's always room for sweets.

414
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:45,344
And after eating sweets,
you need something salty.

415
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:48,104
You're right. There's always room for more.

416
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:52,204
What about low sugar and
low—well, whatever.
