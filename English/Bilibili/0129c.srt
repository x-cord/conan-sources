1
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:04,567
Why you...

2
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,167
What did you do to him?

3
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:14,167
Will you be in trouble if he isn't around, after all?

4
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,267
That phone.

5
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,667
The super kick shoe.

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,167
They are all things that the doctor made for you, aren't they?

7
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,067
With the cooperation of the doctor,

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,367
you can be playing your role as youth detective with that body of yours.

9
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:31,267
In other words, Dr. Agasa is the lifeline

10
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,367
for the present Shinichi Kudo.

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,867
Is that why you killed him?

12
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,867
Well, I wonder?

13
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:39,867
If it bothers you,

14
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,167
why don't you go over to his house and see for yourself?

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,267
Darn!

16
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,367
Dr. Agasa, please be okay.

17
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:20,067
Maybe the men in black are still inside.

18
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,867
Nothing seems to be different from the usual.

19
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,967
It doesn't seem like the men in black are here.

20
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,967
Doctor!

21
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,267
Dr. Agasa!

22
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:32,067
I thought I heard Shinichi's voice?

23
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,967
Shinichi, what is it?

24
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,267
Do you need anything?

25
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,067
Dr. Agasa. So, you're okay?

26
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,867
Okay? What's up?

27
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,767
Oh, I'm really sorry, truly I am!

28
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,767
I've been into working with the computer recently,

29
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:57,867
that I guess the telephone line was busy.

30
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,767
I'm home.

31
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,767
Welcome back, Ai.

32
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,067
How was school?

33
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,067
It was quite fun.

34
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,967
That brat, she deceived me.

35
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,467
Well, you can't blame her

36
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,167
for the fact that you didn't know my address.

37
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:25,267
How should I know? I never sent anything to your house.

38
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,667
I even brought the New Year's greeting card over in person.

39
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,567
Never mind that. Who on earth is she?

40
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,567
What? Didn't she tell you?

41
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,567
That she is a member of the black organization,

42
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,467
drank the same poison as you and became small.

43
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,167
Strange.

44
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:45,067
She told me she'd tell you herself, so not to say anything to you.

45
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,467
Wait, Dr. Agasa.

46
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,867
Oh, I thought up the name Ai Haibara with her.

47
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:54,567
We took it from the name of a woman detective.

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,967
The "Hai" of her name meaning "gray" in Japanese,

49
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,267
was taken from Cordelia Gray.

50
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,867
"Ai" was taken from the "I" in Vioshosky.

51
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,567
I advised her that the Japanese character for love "Ai"

52
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,567
would be cuter than the "Ai" of the character for sadness.

53
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,667
That's not my question!

54
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,067
Why is a woman involved with the men in black living in your house?

55
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,767
I was collapsed...

56
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:22,067
outside your house in the rain,

57
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,267
when he...

58
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,967
Dr. Agasa found me.

59
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,667
In front of my house?

60
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,167
Did you know?

61
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:36,767
The organization had sent investigators to your house about twice.

62
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,667
Out of the people who drank that poison,

63
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:43,167
only your death wasn't verified.

64
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:47,367
I, the inventor of the poison, naturally came along on the investigation.

65
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,667
But, the house was dusty

66
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,867
and there didn't seem to be anyone living there,

67
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,767
so the first time, we left right away.

68
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:00,067
We went on our second investigation a month later.

69
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,667
It was a dusty as usual,

70
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,567
and it didn't seem different from what we saw before.

71
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,967
I was starting to think that you had died after all.

72
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:12,667
I got chicken skin when I saw the strange thing in your clothes drawer.

73
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,167
Your childhood days clothes that were in the drawer a month ago was gone.

74
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,967
A whole lot of it, too.

75
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,767
During the stage of animal experiment,

76
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,667
only one mouse regressed to childhood without dying,

77
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,967
so it was easy to establish the following hypothesis.

78
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:33,467
The possibility that Shinichi Kudo was given APTX 4869,

79
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:37,267
and regressed, becoming a child!

80
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:41,867
The guys of the organization know of my having become a child, then?

81
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:46,167
Thank me. I rewrote "Confirmed dead" on your data.

82
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,867
I decided to let you live

83
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,667
because you're a very interesting research material.

84
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,467
If I report you to the organization,

85
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:56,267
the chances of you being killed before getting to me are greater.

86
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,467
Well, if they find out that the one who rewrote your data

87
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,767
is me, the one who betrayed them,

88
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,667
they may start getting suspicious again.

89
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,567
Betrayed?

90
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,667
Yes.

91
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,167
One of the reasons why I gave that poison

92
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,467
that was still in the testing stage, to a human on my own accord,

93
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,667
was because I was getting sick of them.

94
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,167
But, an even greater reason, was my older sister.

95
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,767
Older sister?

96
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,767
She was killed.

97
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,667
She was killed by the hands of the men of the organization.

98
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,367
No matter how much I asked them,

99
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,167
they wouldn't tell me why they killed her.

100
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,367
And, I went against them saying that I was going to postpone my research

101
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:42,367
until they gave me a formal explanation.

102
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,367
Naturally, since I went against the organization,

103
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,667
they confined me to a certain room in the lab.

104
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,667
I was to wait until the higher-ups decided what to do with me.

105
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,467
Thinking that I may as well drink the poison

106
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,867
if I was going to be killed anyway,

107
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,867
I drank the APTX 4869 that I had hidden on me.

108
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:01,767
Fortunately, the poison I took in an attempt to kill myself...

109
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,967
transformed my body to that of a children's body,

110
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:12,367
and freed me from the handcuffs that were on me.

111
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,767
And, I escaped from the tiny dust Shute.

112
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,667
Having no place to go,

113
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,867
the only person I could think of going to

114
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:26,567
was you, Shinichi Kudo.

115
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,267
I figured since we were in the same boat,

116
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:36,167
you'd be able to understand my predicament.

117
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,567
You've got to be kidding!

118
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,667
Just how am I supposed to understand

119
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,167
somebody who made poison to kill people?

120
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,767
Hey, Shinichi.

121
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,667
Do you know what you did?

122
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,567
Are you aware of just how many people died

123
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,767
because of the poison you invented?

124
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,267
I couldn't help it.

125
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:55,367
I had no intention of making poison.

126
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,467
-What? -Well, come now.

127
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,667
She left the organization already.

128
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,967
Since she's the one who made the poison,

129
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:06,267
she could come up with an antidote without difficulty too, right?

130
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,867
The data for the poison is all in the research lab.

131
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,167
I couldn't possibly remember such a massive amount of data!

132
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,467
Darn.

133
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:16,567
Tell me where that research lab is, then.

134
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:17,767
No use.

135
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,367
Look at the evening paper three days ago.

136
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,667
This is about the mysterious fire

137
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,767
that burned down the pharmaceutical company.

138
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,067
So, there would be nothing left even if we go there.

139
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,167
My God.

140
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,567
The organization got rid of it

141
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,367
fearing that I would talk about it to someone.

142
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,867
At this rate, every facility that I was involved in would be closed down.

143
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,867
Which means that those guys are after you?

144
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:48,667
Yes, they're probably going berserk looking for me.

145
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:52,267
Without even knowing that I've transformed this way.

146
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:56,967
But, if they keep using this poison to kill people,

147
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,067
there is no guarantee that people

148
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:01,167
who will regress like us will eventually appear.

149
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,567
Then, the organization who has a picture of my childhood days

150
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,767
will definitely find me.

151
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:08,767
What will you do about it?

152
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:12,167
Will you chase me out of here because I pose a threat to all of you?

153
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,267
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

154
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,045
What will you do about it?

155
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,445
Will you chase me out of here because I pose a threat to all of you?

156
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:29,445
High school detective, Shinichi Kudo?

157
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,245
Yes. I made the poison and am an accomplice to murder.

158
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:36,145
The organization is also after me.

159
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:40,245
I am an extremely dangerous person to have around.

160
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:44,345
There's no reason why you should keep me near you.

161
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,445
Don't be silly. If they find out about you,

162
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,445
it'll be a matter of time before they find out about me,

163
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,145
I hate to impose on Dr. Agasa,

164
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,745
but I'll have you stay here as a grade schooled

165
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:54,445
whether you like it or not.

166
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:57,545
It's more bothersome to have you hanging around outside.

167
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,845
Oh my, how nice of you.

168
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:03,845
How about the safety of your parents?

169
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:07,445
No need for worry, they are also members of the organization.

170
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,445
I was told they died of an accident soon after I was born.

171
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,345
Which means your family is?

172
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:18,945
Me and my older sister who I didn't get to see too often.

173
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,145
Unlike me, who was studying the States

174
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:23,745
through orders of the organization.

175
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:26,545
My sister was constantly under surveillance

176
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,045
because she was living in Japan.

177
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,245
Yes, until my sister started working for the organization,

178
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,745
in an attempt to set me free of them,

179
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,745
she was going to an ordinary school,

180
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:41,945
had ordinary friends, went on ordinary trips.

181
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,545
Wait.

182
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,545
Come to think of it, several years before she was killed.

183
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:51,545
She sent me 2 or 3 floppies with pictures

184
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:54,245
of when she went on a trip.

185
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,845
I looked through them at the research lab

186
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,245
and sent it back to her right away,

187
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:01,045
but the floppy that I had the data of the poison in,

188
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,045
got lost after that.

189
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,845
I looked all over for it but couldn't find it.

190
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:08,245
I see.

191
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:10,845
So, the floppy with the data of the poison

192
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:15,245
may be mixed up among the floppies that you sent back to your sister.

193
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,545
So, if we search the place where your sister used to live.

194
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,245
No use. The condo that my sister was living in

195
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,745
was gotten rid of by the organization right after her death,

196
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:27,145
and everything was cleared out.

197
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,445
But she said that the person who put the pictures into the floppies,

198
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:34,145
was the professor that went on the trip together with her.

199
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:35,345
So, maybe...

200
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,345
You don't know who that professor is?

201
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:42,145
Masami Hirota of Nanyo University.

202
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,445
Masami Hirota?

203
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,145
But, I don't know where he lives.

204
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:52,145
All we have to do is ask at the university.

205
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,845
All right!

206
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,045
Let's get with it right away.

207
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:01,945
Hello.

208
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:05,345
Could you look up the phone number to Nanyo University, please?

209
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,345
What? The floppy with the picture of the trip in it?

210
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,145
Who are you?

211
00:12:11,145 --> 00:12:13,345
Oh, well, you see, I'm...

212
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:15,245
What's your sister's name?

213
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,745
Akemi.

214
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,245
Akemi Miyano.

215
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,545
I'm an acquaintance of Akemi.

216
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:22,845
If it's the floppies with the pictures of the trip

217
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,045
that I went with them, she gave them back to me.

218
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,045
A strange floppy seems to have been mixed up among them, though.

219
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,745
A strange floppy?

220
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:33,245
No doubt about it! That's the one!

221
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:37,045
Is it all right for us to go and pick up that floppy from now?

222
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,745
Yes, I don't mind.

223
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:41,445
I'm expecting a few guests soon,

224
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,145
but if you don't mind coming after them.

225
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,945
Then, we'll be there in three hours.

226
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,945
What? You're going to stay over at Dr. Agasa's?

227
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,545
What on earth are you doing?

228
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:54,645
Dinner's ready, and we've been waiting for you to come home, Conan.

229
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:57,745
Dr. Agasa says that he made an interesting game

230
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:00,145
and wants me to play it with him!

231
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:02,445
I'll be home by tomorrow morning.

232
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,245
I'm sorry, Ran.

233
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,245
Wait.

234
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,945
You're sure good at acting like a child.

235
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:15,745
Yeah. But, I'm not as good as you who can fake crying like a baby.

236
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:22,945
It's 150 kilometers to Shizuoka.

237
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,045
I wonder if we can get there in three hours.

238
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:30,845
Hey, Dr. Agasa, be on your guard with that chick.

239
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,145
That chick? You mean Ai?

240
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:38,745
Yeah, although she's saying she fled from the organization,

241
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:41,945
she's not telling us her real name or age,

242
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:45,145
and even if we ask her what the organization is after,

243
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,945
she insists on not knowing a thing.

244
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:51,145
What she said a while ago

245
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:54,745
could be a lie to lure us into a trap.

246
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:57,545
She doesn't look that way, though.

247
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,445
And, another thing that bothers me is, Masami Hirota.

248
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,045
I've heard this name somewhere before.

249
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,745
Good evening.

250
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:13,845
Oh, Mr. Agasa.

251
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:17,645
My husband told me about you. Please come in.

252
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,545
Have your guests already left?

253
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:24,545
Yes, it seems that my husband's student was here just before you.

254
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,445
Dear!

255
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,145
Dear.

256
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:36,345
Strange, I wonder what he's doing inside with the door locked?

257
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,045
Darn, it won't open.

258
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,845
Do you have a spare key to this room?

259
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:55,445
No, I haven't.

260
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,045
Then, help me break this door open, Dr. Agasa!

261
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,045
What?

262
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,545
Quick.

263
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:03,245
Here goes!

264
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,745
One more time!

265
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,845
-Wait. -One, two, go.

266
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:10,845
One, two, go...

267
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,359
An accident you say?

268
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,559
Yes, we can't be 100 percent sure yet,

269
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,859
but it is very likely to be an accident.

270
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,359
Officer Yokomizo.

271
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,459
The cause of death seems to have been this object.

272
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,959
It may have hit him when he fell.

273
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,059
Just as I thought.

274
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:53,259
He fell?

275
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,959
In other words,

276
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,159
Mr. Masami Hirota wanted to take something that was on the bookshelf,

277
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,459
and placed his foot on the shelf.

278
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,659
He lost his balance and fell, bookshelf and all.

279
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,659
Then, he bumped the back of his head onto that object

280
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,559
that had already fallen to the floor,

281
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,359
and it killed him.

282
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:13,759
As proof of that, the door of this room,

283
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,959
and the windows located above the door were all locked securely.

284
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,359
Besides, the only key there is to this room,

285
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:26,259
was scattered over the floor with the books, under the notebook.

286
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,359
Professor Hirota, locked the door himself,

287
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:34,359
and died because of the accident, right after that?

288
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,259
Yes, no matter how you look at it...

289
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,759
He could've been killed by someone.

290
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,059
It was just made to look like an accident.

291
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,059
You're the boy that's staying with Mr. Mouri, right?

292
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,659
Oh, yes. That's right.

293
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:49,559
He's the son of a relative of mine.

294
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,359
See, look at this phone, it's toppled on the floor, right?

295
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,159
That's because the phone book fell together with the bookshelf.

296
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,659
Then, why is the receiver not off the hook?

297
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
Although the phone is upside down

298
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,159
and is camouflaged with the book on top of it,

299
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,059
someone has deliberately messed this room up.

300
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,759
Then, is this homicide?

301
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,759
Wait. If so, this would be...

302
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,559
a murder behind locked doors.

303
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,759
Murder behind...

304
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,059
Locked doors?

305
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:32,159
Right, the doors were all locked,

306
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,459
and the key to this room was found here.

307
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:39,259
Then who... who killed my husband?

308
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,559
Please calm down, Mrs. Hirota.

309
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,159
Were there any suspicious people who came to see him tonight?

310
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:50,359
He seems to have had 3 or 4 guests including Mr. Agasa.

311
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,759
Me?

312
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,459
An acquaintance of mine

313
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:57,059
told me that she had mistakenly given Professor Hirota her floppy,

314
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,759
I came to get it back.

315
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,259
So, I'm sure that it is besides that computer.

316
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,259
All the floppies are gone. A whole bunch of them.

317
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,259
What?

318
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,959
At this rate, maybe all the data in this computer is also erased.

319
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,059
What's with that girl?

320
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,959
She's also the child of my relative.

321
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:21,059
Hey, Ai, don't touch!

322
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,259
At any rate, I have nothing to do with this murder.

323
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,659
No one would be stupid enough to bring children along

324
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:28,659
when thinking of committing murder, right?

325
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,859
That's true.

326
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,559
Listen, little lady, I don't want you touching anything in this room.

327
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,559
Go to the room next door and wait there quietly with your grandpa.

328
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,859
Understand?

329
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,059
I'm still 52, too young to be called grandpa, don't you think?

330
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,959
Hey, don't tell me they took the floppies?

331
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,959
Very likely.

332
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,759
Because the lost record of the data of the poison,

333
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,059
as well as the record of the parcel

334
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,059
that I sent back to my sister about the same time,

335
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,959
are all left behind at the organization.

336
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,159
I see.

337
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,059
So, they could've predicted that since you fled from the organization,

338
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,159
you would stop by here to come get the data.

339
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,559
The organization came here to look for the data and suck in here,

340
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,659
but was seen by Professor Hirota, so they killed him.

341
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,059
Not good.

342
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,859
No, let's not jump to conclusions too fast.

343
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:25,859
First, let's ask about the people who came here tonight.

344
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:27,559
We'll think about everything else later.

345
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:32,659
You were at a community meeting?

346
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:34,659
Yes, together with a neighbor of mine,

347
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:37,559
from 20:00 to 23:00, for three hours.

348
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,559
Which means that you haven't met the guests

349
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,159
who have come to see your husband tonight?

350
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,759
No, all except the first person who came,

351
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,159
who came just when I was ready to leave?

352
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:50,559
My husband said it was one of his students.

353
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,759
I think he said the person's name was Hosoya.

354
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,959
Okay! Bring that person called Hosoya

355
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,559
who is a student of Professor Hirota, and was here tonight!

356
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,959
Yes, sir!

357
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:05,059
Do you know the names of the other people who came here?

358
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,259
I wonder.

359
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:08,159
I have no idea, except for Dr. Agasa who called

360
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,559
just before I was ready to leave.

361
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,859
Although, my husband did say 2-3 of his students were coming.

362
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,059
Which means that we have no choice

363
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,359
but to check on all of his students who were here.

364
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,759
Hey, blinking on this phone here.

365
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,659
This is an answer phone, isn't it?

366
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,859
We could find something out if we listen to this, right?

367
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,859
Yes.

368
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,059
You have thirteen messages.

369
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,359
Thirteen? There sure are a lot of before the phone messages.

370
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,759
Hello, this is Shirokura...

371
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,759
Professor Hirota, the promise was for tonight?

372
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,759
Who is this Mr. Shirokura?

373
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,759
I've met Mr. Shirokura before. He's still a young man.

374
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,959
Strange, why is the tape cut off here and there?

375
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,459
This is Morioka. What time am I supposed to go there tonight?

376
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:06,659
Who is he?

377
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,659
I know Mr. Morioka, too.

378
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,159
He is my husband's first student

379
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,959
and comes over a lot.

380
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,459
Do you have the address and phone number

381
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,259
of Mr. Shirokura and Mr. Morioka?

382
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:21,959
-Yes. -I'm Shirokura.

383
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:24,459
What's the matter? What's all this commotion about?

384
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,559
Did something happen here?

385
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,559
Professor Hirota has been murdered by someone.

386
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,059
What?

387
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,959
Hello, this is Shirokura...

388
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,959
I've got other matters to attend to tomorrow,

389
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:40,959
so I'll head on over there now.

390
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:45,259
You placed 10 messages in here and Mr. Morioka placed two messages.

391
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:49,859
Mr. Shirokura, you sure left a lot of messages, didn't you?

392
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:53,659
Like I'm telling you. I came here directly

393
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:56,359
because he wouldn't answer, no matter how many times I called.

394
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,459
All right.

395
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:02,259
But, why did something like this happen to him?

396
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,759
This is the 13th, and the last message.

397
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,459
This is black... life.

398
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:11,859
I'd like to come over to explain our new insurance plan.

399
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:14,959
What time should I over?

400
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,759
I will call again later.

401
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,259
An insurance agent?

402
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:24,559
No! Although the voice is a bit changed using a machine,

403
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,959
his way of talking is...

404
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,459
This voice is...

405
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,459
Vodka.

406
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,059
Now.

407
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,059
Hey, then this case involves those guys, after all?

408
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:46,959
No, the possibility of them having done anything have decreased.

409
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,559
If they had come here to get the floppy,

410
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,159
they wouldn't have done something as stupid

411
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,759
as to leave their voices on tape at the scene of a crime.

412
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,359
True, it would be a cinch for them to pick up the floppy

413
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,959
without even creating such a locked-in-room situation.

414
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,859
They left the message on the answer phone,

415
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,759
so that in case Professor Hirota was home,

416
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,659
it would ease his suspicion of them,

417
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,059
and make it easier for them to carry out their purpose.

418
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,959
I'll bet they're all panicky now

419
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,959
because they can't come to get the floppy.

420
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,259
Then, if so, then they'll be here soon.

421
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,959
Yeah. We were right to move your Volkswagen elsewhere.

422
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:28,159
They may be somewhere near here already.

423
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:38,373
What? Professor Hirota was killed?

424
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:41,073
That's ridiculous.

425
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,873
He was fine till just a while ago.

426
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:49,273
Mr. Hosoya, you came here just as Mrs. Hirota was going out, didn't you?

427
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:50,673
Yes.

428
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:54,073
My daughter is going to apply for Nanyo University,

429
00:23:54,073 --> 00:23:58,073
so I came to have Professor Hirota write out a recommendation for her.

430
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:03,473
But the professor was so drunk, that I decided to leave for today.

431
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:06,173
Is it true that the was drinking?

432
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:08,473
Yes, from the evening.

433
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:13,973
Mr. Morioka, according to the message in the answer phone,

434
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:17,273
you were also supposed to meet Professor Hirota.

435
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,473
Yes.

436
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:21,973
To play chess. Professor Hirota and I play chess together.

437
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,473
He asked me to come over and play tonight, too.

438
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:29,473
See, chess pieces are scattered all over the floor.

439
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:32,073
We used to always play in this room.

440
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:35,873
I phoned twice because we didn't decide what time to start,

441
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:38,073
but the answer phone was set.

442
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:39,573
I came to check out what was happening because

443
00:24:39,573 --> 00:24:42,173
he wouldn't answer the phone despite having called me from his side.

444
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:44,773
You came here tonight?

445
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:47,873
Yes, I came around 9:30 pm.

446
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:51,573
Although the front door was open, nobody answered the doorbell.

447
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,773
So, I thought he had forgotten about the game and went to sleep.

448
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:55,673
I went into the house.

449
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:58,673
But, when I knocked on the door of the study, nobody answered,

450
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,173
and on top of that, the door was locked.

451
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,673
So, I gave up and left.

452
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:06,373
I see. And Mr. Agasa arrived an hour later,

453
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,973
realized that something was wrong, broke the door open

454
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,973
and found the corpse?

455
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:13,273
Yes, that's right.

456
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:17,673
By the way, Mr. Shirokura, you came right after we got here, right?

457
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:21,773
I haven't asked you what you came here for yet tonight.

458
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:24,873
Yes, the fact is, I am working as a model.

459
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,573
I'm supposed be doing a column in a magazine entitled,

460
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:30,373
"The Unexpected Plain Face of a Model".

461
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:33,273
I took a picture of me dressed in woman's clothes

462
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:35,773
during a university festival, together with Professor Hirota,

463
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:41,573
and I came to get the floppy with the data of the picture from him.

464
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,773
He saved the data of the picture in a floppy?

465
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:47,873
Yes, my husband used to input all the pictures that he liked

466
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,873
into the computer.

467
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:51,873
He not only saved pictures.

468
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:53,773
He also saved the entrance exams of universities,

469
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:55,773
the grades of his students,

470
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,773
and even saved the process and results of the chess games

471
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:00,573
that he played with Mr. Morioka.

472
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:01,873
I see.

473
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:04,473
So, the killer stole all of those floppies

474
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:07,673
after killing Professor Hirota.

475
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,673
Which means that the criminal killed to get a hold of them.

476
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:14,773
Your daughter's going to be applying for Nanyo University, isn't she?

477
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,473
Yes.

478
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,273
If you got a hold of the floppies it with the entrance exams in them,

479
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,773
she would definitely get in, wouldn't she?

480
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:26,573
No, it never even crossed my mind.

481
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:30,573
Somebody else would've been here besides us, right?

482
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:35,673
Moreover, the professor was also using the computer at the university.

483
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:40,473
The professor himself could've taken all the floppies to the university.

484
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,773
It's possible.

485
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,273
He never writes anything on the label,

486
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:45,173
so he may've taken all the floppies to write the labels.

487
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:48,373
Besides, this room was locked from the inside, wasn't it?

488
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,473
Moreover, wasn't the key to this room

489
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:54,473
found here under the notebook that was on the floor?

490
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,773
Officer, no matter how you look at it...

491
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,973
Exactly.

492
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:05,273
All the possible places of entry were locked

493
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:06,573
and the only possible space

494
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,173
if any was between the door and the floor,

495
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:11,173
which only a key would slide through.

496
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:15,373
If a rubber band or a fishing string were used,

497
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:16,473
it may've been possible to kill Professor Hirota,

498
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:18,373
take the fishing string away,

499
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:21,273
lock the door from the outside and from the space beneath the door,

500
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,373
move the key to the center of the room.

501
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,673
It would be close to impossible to slide the key nicely

502
00:27:27,673 --> 00:27:30,373
under the notebook.

503
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:31,773
What bothers me is

504
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:34,373
why despite all the books that were scattered around the room,

505
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:37,373
was there only the notebook in question on the floor

506
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:40,373
which was lined in a row from the door to the phone?

507
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:44,673
The tape of the answering phone is a bit out of shape

508
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,773
but this couldn't have possibly been used

509
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,573
to push the key under the notebook.

510
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,473
Conan Edogawa?

511
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:55,673
Remember, the boy in glasses I told you about last time.

512
00:27:55,673 --> 00:28:01,373
You also said that you went to somebody's house at Beika Town?

513
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:04,573
You mean Shinichi Kudo?

514
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:08,173
Right, he's the boy of the Detective Office there.

515
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,373
He seems a bit different.

516
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:14,673
He's unusual cool-headed and very adultish for a child.

517
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,173
How about you, Akemi? Are you all right?

518
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:20,073
I heard that you were in hot water or something.

519
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,073
Don't worry, I'm doing fine.

520
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:26,073
I'm more worried about you, Shiho.

521
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:28,473
Cut out making poison

522
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,873
and go find yourself a lover or two.

523
00:28:31,873 --> 00:28:34,273
I'm really okay.

524
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,973
I'm really okay.

525
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:41,873
I'm really okay.

526
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:58,873
Impossible to lock the door from the outside,

527
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:00,073
and slide the key to the center of the room,

528
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,673
much less to slide it under the notebook.

529
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:04,573
It would be impossible

530
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:08,773
even if the tape of the answer phone were to be used.

531
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:10,973
Although there are many queer points,

532
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,573
if the late Professor Hirota were wasted,

533
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:18,073
it's not all that strange if he fell together with the bookshelf,

534
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,873
and hit the back of his head.

535
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:23,473
Besides, it's too dangerous to stay here any longer,

536
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:25,073
as well as useless.

537
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:29,073
Forget it, Shinichi. Forget this case.

538
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:32,873
It's checkmate.

539
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,673
Checkmate?

540
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,373
Hurry, let's get out of here from the back door.

541
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:46,173
Hold it.

542
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:52,473
Don't you care to know the truth of this case?

543
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:55,773
Like I said. No matter how you look at it...

544
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:58,373
This is no accident. It's homicide!

545
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,473
After the killer murdered Professor Hirota,

546
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:02,973
he used a trick and locked this room up from the inside

547
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:05,273
to make it look like an accident.

548
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:08,773
I'll show you what the truth is, starting right this minute.

549
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:13,673
I'll show you that there is no case that can't be solved in this world.
