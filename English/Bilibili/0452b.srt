1
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:04,294
What did you just say?

2
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:06,794
Tamanosuke was arrested?

3
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:07,894
Yes.

4
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:10,694
Conan, please save my brother...

5
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:11,894
Calm down, Megumi!

6
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:13,794
What on earth is going on?

7
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:16,494
He's being charged for killing Mr. Nabeshima

8
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,294
who is in charge of stage settings.

9
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:24,994
Tamanosuke would never do a thing like that!

10
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:27,094
But, they say he was found lying on the ground

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,394
holding a knife, right beside Mr. Nabeshima.

12
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:31,794
You mean he was passed out?

13
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,494
Moreover, he seems to have been wearing

14
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:36,294
a blood smeared mask of the phantom.

15
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:38,594
So, they say that this phantom fuss up to now

16
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,494
was all the doings of the leader.

17
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:43,394
No way. Dad, let's go to the police station now.

18
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,194
Okay.

19
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,294
"Interrogation Room 1" -You were called out by a letter?

20
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,494
Yes.

21
00:00:55,394 --> 00:00:57,094
"Be gone!"

22
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:00,494
"I want to put flowers to the small dying village."

23
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,194
"Stone monument's morning, at the base I will wait."

24
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:04,494
"Rausu."

25
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:05,994
This is also a code where the "sa" in the sentences

26
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,794
must be removed to read, right?

27
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,394
Just like the other blackmails

28
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:11,694
received from the phantom of the Konpira or what-nots.

29
00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:12,994
That's right.

30
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:16,194
And if you redo it to make a normal sentence...

31
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:20,394
"I want to talk to you about Renge".

32
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:23,894
"I'll be waiting for you at the open lot by the monument".

33
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:26,394
And, when you got to the site...

34
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:37,994
Exactly!

35
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,894
But why would somebody do something like that?

36
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:45,194
That's because that person is indeed the phantom of the Konpira.

37
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,594
He's the one who sent letters

38
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:49,294
demanding that the heroine be changed,

39
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:51,994
dropped the big lantern on top of Romi

40
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,794
and switched her mouthwash to something else.

41
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:56,094
That's the only thing thinkable!

42
00:01:56,094 --> 00:02:00,494
About that, Mr. Rausu was saying the same thing.

43
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:02,494
He said though, that he was called by you.

44
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:03,794
What?

45
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:07,994
No, no, I'm not saying that Tamanosuke is the phantom.

46
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,394
But, it's true that he asked me to come meet him.

47
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,694
So, this is the letter.

48
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:16,994
Tamanosuke says that he received a letter exactly like this.

49
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:19,294
However, "park" had been changed to "monument"

50
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:22,494
and your name is written as the sender.

51
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,194
And did you go there?

52
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:27,694
I did, but Tamanosuke didn't come.

53
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,194
Most naturally,

54
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:32,294
because at that time he was at the scene of the crime.

55
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:36,494
Then, did you meet or see anyone at the park?

56
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,994
Yeah, I did.

57
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,794
Romi?

58
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,794
So, although you didn't notice that Mr. Rausu was there,

59
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,394
you were in the vacant lot of the park.

60
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:52,894
What did you go there for?

61
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:57,994
"I was practicing my voice in secret."

62
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,494
I see.

63
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,794
I'm honored

64
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,894
to be able to conduct investigation together with you, Mr. Mouri.

65
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,294
The evidence that you have deeming Tamanosuke Ito to be the suspect

66
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:12,794
is the murder weapon knife that he was holding, was it?

67
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:13,794
Yes!

68
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:17,294
But Tamanosuke was passed out, wasn't he?

69
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:20,994
It could be that someone else made him hold the knife, right?

70
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:21,994
That's right.

71
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,194
I'm sure that's what happened.

72
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,294
And, what do you have to say about that?

73
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:28,294
He did have a wound on the back of his head.

74
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:31,094
But it could be that he fought with the victim but slipped,

75
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:35,194
and hit his head on the corner of the pedestal or something.

76
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,294
Corner of the pedestal?

77
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:39,894
Please explain.

78
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,094
All right.

79
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:44,994
Behind the victim that was lying on the ground, is a memorial monument

80
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:47,994
and there is a pedestal.

81
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,294
And what is his motive for killing the man?

82
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,194
Most likely, money problems.

83
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:55,894
It seems that the victim used to demand advance payments

84
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:57,594
and other things quite impossible to do,

85
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,694
being that he was a staff member from the time of the former leader.

86
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,694
Therefore, Tamanosuke finally...

87
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:03,694
That can't be...

88
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:04,694
You're not serious, are you?

89
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,994
Another thing! The most serious point is...

90
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:11,294
that he tried to frame Mr. Rausu up as the phantom of the Konpira,

91
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:15,794
place the blame on him and win Renge's heart over.

92
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:19,194
That just can't be because those two are already...

93
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:20,494
In love with each other to begin with.

94
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,294
Although it's vexing to think so.

95
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,494
So, he wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.

96
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:29,594
That's why! It's all probably because Mr. Rausu appeared.

97
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,894
You can never tell what goes on between a man and a woman

98
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,794
just by looking on the outside, you see.

99
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,394
No.

100
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,694
I guess they won't be showing the play today.

101
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,694
Not with the leader taken to the police as a suspect.

102
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:44,594
How disappointing. Renge Kataoka's acting was pretty good.

103
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:52,094
You believe Tamanosuke, don't you?

104
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:54,594
And I know he believes in me too.

105
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,894
That's why he let me substitute for Romi.

106
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:59,094
You were fantastic.

107
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,494
But, I was scared.

108
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:03,494
I was so sure I couldn't do it.

109
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,494
But the angel of music,

110
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:08,294
the phantom encouraged me.

111
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,494
What?

112
00:05:09,494 --> 00:05:11,794
You're not the one, are you?

113
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,694
You're not suspecting me, are you?

114
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:18,594
I don't know what or who I should believe.

115
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,594
If you're going through so much suffering,

116
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,994
drop this acting bit all together!

117
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:26,394
Renge, I want you to spend your life together with me.

118
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,994
Is he serious?

119
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,994
I'm sorry. I'm worried about the troupe leader right now

120
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:34,094
and can't think of anything else...

121
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:37,594
Okay, then please relay this to the leader.

122
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,794
The damage I have incurred as a sponsor is great.

123
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,194
I hate to say this, but if things go on as is,

124
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:43,594
I have no choice but to pull out.

125
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,794
Oh no!

126
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,794
However, when it comes to you, it's a different story.

127
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:49,594
I will not give up, no matter what.

128
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:54,294
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,794
I didn't mean to eavesdrop but...

130
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:58,594
Hey, hey, is it true

131
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,994
that you were encouraged by the phantom?

132
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,594
But, I couldn't jump up for joy.

133
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,694
When I heard the applause, I kind of got carried away for an instant...

134
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:09,094
Don't worry, you've got talent!

135
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:12,994
But the new heroine being encouraged by the phantom,

136
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:16,094
that's how it goes in the Phantom of the Opera too.

137
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,594
Yes, that scares me too.

138
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,694
I wonder who on earth it is.

139
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:24,194
If it's not Tamanosuke, could it be Mr. Rausu after all?

140
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:26,294
Or, could it really be the phantom?

141
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,894
A ghost or a monster?

142
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:31,494
No, that's impossible.

143
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:41,294
Here it is!

144
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,294
What is it, Conan?

145
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:46,994
What's that?

146
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,094
A speaker?

147
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:52,094
Yes, a wireless. It probably goes from here to...

148
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:56,694
In fact, I heard the voice of the phantom that day too.

149
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:58,294
Really, Conan?

150
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,794
Which means, in other words...

151
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:05,194
The phantom of the Konpira is neither a ghost nor a monster.

152
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,494
I'll go ask dad one more time!

153
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,894
I'm going with you!

154
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,694
I've got to rush too!

155
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:17,394
There's something that's been bothering me from the beginning.

156
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,894
The letters that are read by removing the letter "sa" and the blackmails.

157
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:21,794
The phantom of the Konpira moving around

158
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:24,394
just like the phantom in the Phantom of the Opera.

159
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,094
Everything that is happening seems to be unscrupulous

160
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:30,494
and deliberately attract the attention of others.

161
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:32,794
But the killing itself gives me a totally different impression.

162
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,994
That could be a clue to something.

163
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,994
So, this is the corner of the pedestal.

164
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:47,094
It's a great place for the killer to hide.

165
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,994
Dad! Please do something!

166
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,694
We've come this far...

167
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,794
At this rate, Tamanosuke's stage will be forever gone!

168
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:14,594
Don't worry about that!

169
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,894
I just got word from Officer Ohnishi a while ago.

170
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:20,294
Tamanosuke Ito has been acquitted.

171
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:21,994
But, on the other hand, Tatsuhiko Rausu

172
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:25,494
is being interrogated as a prime suspect.

173
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:27,494
I'm sure that they're on the right track this time.

174
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:31,594
At the scene of the crime, the fingerprints of the victim

175
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,794
as well as that of Mr. Tatsuhiko Rausu were detected

176
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:36,194
on the cane used to climb up the stone steps.

177
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:37,794
They say that the fingerprints probably rubbed off

178
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:40,494
when he struggled with the victim.

179
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,894
Moreover, in his car, they found...

180
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,994
You gotta be kidding. I don't know of that cane!

181
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:53,894
I don't remember putting something like that inside the trunk!

182
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:56,894
It seems that the phantom in question appeared at the showing yesterday

183
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,194
and that there was somewhat of a commotion.

184
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,194
Although it seemed as if most of the audience

185
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:02,494
thought it was just a part of the show.

186
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:05,594
Isn't it then that you used the projector?

187
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,894
I see! So, that's how it was done...

188
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:16,094
You gotta be kidding!

189
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,994
Are you saying that I did that?

190
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:20,994
If you use a remote controller, you could've operated the projector

191
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,894
even from the audience where you were seated.

192
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:24,894
Absurd.

193
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:27,594
And for the tape recorder and transmitter.

194
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:32,994
Was it Renge? You used these to make her hear the voice of the phantom.

195
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:36,294
And from the room backstage we confiscated the speaker.

196
00:09:36,294 --> 00:09:39,294
You did all this to grasp her heart.

197
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,894
You wanted to set Tamanosuke up so that you could make her yours.

198
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,494
Isn't that right?

199
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:44,694
You gotta be joking!

200
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,794
Brother! Brother!

201
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,994
Sorry to have worried you.

202
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,294
Where's everybody?

203
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,594
They're at the hotel.

204
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,094
Let's go, we've got to decide what we're going to do about today's show.

205
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:58,194
Yep.

206
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,294
Conan, thank you.

207
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:04,294
The problem is the pedestal.

208
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:07,994
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from up there...

209
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:18,614
That's right!

210
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:21,114
An alibi. I've got an alibi!

211
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:23,814
Too bad, but that also...

212
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:27,614
So you lied about practicing your voice at the vacant lot of the park?

213
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:30,614
"I was afraid that they would take my role away from me".

214
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:36,714
"I thought that maybe if I testified in Mr. Rausu's favor..."

215
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,914
So, that's what she said.

216
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,314
What?

217
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,414
Why would she say something like that?

218
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:45,214
Huh, what's the matter?

219
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:48,314
I'm sorry, may I go to the restroom?

220
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,814
One more thing. The projector used to project the phantom.

221
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:54,614
If it's possible to move it using a remote controller from the audience,

222
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:55,814
the same could be done from elsewhere.

223
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:58,714
That's right! Like from above the stage!

224
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:01,414
Officer.

225
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:02,914
You're Mr. Mouri's...

226
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:06,414
Pops Mouri told me to ask you.

227
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,614
Mr. Mouri has a question?

228
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,714
Where were Mr. Rausu's fingerprints on the cane?

229
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,214
On the tape.

230
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,214
Tape?

231
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:16,914
Right, although the color and the way the tape

232
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:18,614
is wrapped around the cane differs depending on the shop.

233
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,214
Well, it's sort of like a guide.

234
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,014
Which shop did that cane belong to?

235
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:26,214
As to that, we haven't found a shop that carries that cane yet.

236
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,414
We thought we'd find it right away

237
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,214
because it's unusual to wrap the cane with luminous tape.

238
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,814
Luminous tape!

239
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:40,714
I got it! I know who's the real killer!

240
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:43,114
Tatsuhiko Rausu has fled!

241
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,514
What?

242
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:47,214
I'm sorry, it was just for a split second when I was off my guard.

243
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,214
After him right this minute, on the double!

244
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:04,114
You don't love me! You don't love me! You don't love me!

245
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,314
Let me go! Let me go!

246
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:10,114
But, you are destined to be with me forever.

247
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:11,914
You can never part from me!

248
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,614
The unscrupulousness is the same.

249
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,414
Why would the culprit go out of the way to let their whereabouts be known?

250
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:33,114
I've no choice but to go!

251
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,714
Conan!

252
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,314
Have you seen Renge?

253
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,814
Tamanosuke.

254
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:39,114
This is...

255
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,714
Don't tell me that Rausu got her...

256
00:12:40,714 --> 00:12:44,314
There he is! I looked all over for you, Conan.

257
00:12:44,314 --> 00:12:46,314
What's up, you two?

258
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,214
Renge, where are you?

259
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:53,414
Renge!

260
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:54,414
Over there!

261
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,414
Rausu! Where's Renge?

262
00:12:58,414 --> 00:12:59,814
Hold it, Rausu!

263
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,414
Let's die together, my beloved child!

264
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,514
Let's fall to the pit of darkness together!

265
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:09,214
Let me go! Let me go!

266
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,614
Hold it, Phantom!

267
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:15,814
Let her go!

268
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:28,714
Renge!

269
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,814
Stop it!

270
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,914
Sonoko?

271
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,914
Phantom of the Konpira!

272
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:41,414
I already know that you are not Mr. Rausu!

273
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:46,314
I also know that your original purpose was not murder.

274
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:47,414
Isn't that right?

275
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:49,814
Stop all this, Romi!

276
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,014
-What? -No.

277
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:57,014
That's right. You were acting strange to begin with.

278
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:07,314
All of this was what you created and what you acted out.

279
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,514
You mean all that was an act? Why'd she do something like that?

280
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:14,214
Of course is to frame Mr. Rausu.

281
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:24,314
Romi, why?

282
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:27,314
To take revenge on his father.

283
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:30,514
You mean the former owner of Rausu Concieron who passed away.

284
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:34,014
That former owner overtook my father's business,

285
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:36,114
which lead to my father's illness that eventually killed him.

286
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:38,314
My mother died soon after as if to go after him.

287
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:39,714
What?

288
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:44,014
Being alone, the only thing I could do was to act!

289
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,714
Taking revenge didn't even cross my mind.

290
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:49,014
That's when I got this offer.

291
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:53,814
I felt as if my father and mother were shouting "now's the time".

292
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,214
That's why you accepted my offer.

293
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:59,514
But, I wasn't planning to kill anyone to begin with.

294
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,714
I was satisfied if I could spoil this show

295
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:06,214
and taint the name of the sponsor, Rausu Concieron.

296
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:09,414
That's why I pressured Renge.

297
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,614
I thought that she would never make it,

298
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:14,614
that she would spoil the entire show.

299
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,914
But, I made a big mistake.

300
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:23,214
It had slipped my mind, that Renge was also an actress.

301
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,214
If I were her,

302
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,914
I would've used the pressure to give me a boost.

303
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:29,014
Romi.

304
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:32,614
On top of that, the guy found out.

305
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,114
Now all my debts are gone.

306
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,614
Could this be a windfall from heaven?

307
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:46,814
An incomplete avenging of my parents' death would not be forgiven.

308
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,314
I felt as if I heard them say, "Kill this guy and frame the other guy

309
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,614
to make it look as if he did the killing"!

310
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:54,714
So, you called Mr. Nabeshima out to the vacant lot,

311
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:57,814
hid behind the monument and waited.

312
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:02,314
If the killer stabbed Mr. Nabeshima from on top the pedestal,

313
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,914
it had to be someone short.

314
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,614
So, I figured that if it were a woman,

315
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:10,014
it's possible that the knife would come right about

316
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:12,314
where Mr. Nabeshima's neck is.

317
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,514
The luminous tape that was on the cane

318
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:19,014
was the one that Mr. Rausu had accidentally touched.

319
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:27,114
The police would most naturally think that Tamanosuke

320
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:32,314
was put unconscious by Mr. Rausu who tried to take Renge away.

321
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:37,614
You then deliberately appeared before Mr. Rausu,

322
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:40,214
and schemed to change your testimony about him later

323
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,714
just so that you could give him a bad image.

324
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:46,414
Moreover, while he was waiting in the park for Tamanosuke,

325
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:49,414
you put the projector into the trunk of his car.

326
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:52,914
But, he found out after all.

327
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:03,214
Come on out! I know you did it!

328
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:11,114
I thought that I had no choice but to carry out what I did to the end.

329
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:15,514
Rausu, who flees from the police, kills himself as well as Renge.

330
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:20,614
But, even that young lady over there saw through everything.

331
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:33,414
No, Romi!

332
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,914
What a pitiful, unhappy person.

333
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:54,914
Shoots!

334
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,414
Tamanosuke!

335
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:57,614
Conan!

336
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:26,014
Romi, you took somebody else's life away,

337
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:28,214
and now you try to take your own life away.

338
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:31,014
Do you intend to blame what you just did on your parents too?

339
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,414
No matter what reason there may be,

340
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,714
you did what humans should never do.

341
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:40,814
You must make amends for what you did.

342
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:42,914
You aren't allowed to die!

343
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,214
Besides, you deliberately left the pamphlet of this place

344
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:48,214
in a conspicuous place like that

345
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,714
because you wanted someone to stop you,

346
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,214
from what you were about to do.

347
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,214
I'm glad, it's all thanks to you, Sonoko.

348
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:12,614
Did I do it again?

349
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:14,414
While you were sleeping, yes.

350
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:18,514
I'm sorry, I'm going to continue acting,

351
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,414
together with the troupe leader, all my life.

352
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:21,814
Renge.

353
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:23,114
Okay.

354
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:18,114
It's a lot of fun!
