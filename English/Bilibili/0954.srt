1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.270
We went to meet Pops client

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.170
at a bunny girl club called the Black Rabbit Restaurant.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.570
But once we're there...

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.470
"Yuri Asakura (25), Employee"

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.970
-What? -What?

6
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.170
You found arsenic in Ms. Yuri's drink?

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.070
-Yeah. -It was me.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.870
"Gunzo Morooka (50), Rich Man" -Someone was trying to poison me

9
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.470
but Yuri drank it instead.

10
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.770
You're saying Mr. Morooka was worried about something?

11
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
Yes. That's what his bodyguards in the parking lot told me.

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.870
"Atsufumi Fukamachi, Sana Murakami" -Lately he has been acting strange.

13
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.770
He'd suddenly lose and gain weight,

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.970
and was frequently tripping and injuring himself.

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.470
-But, Mouri... -An injury?

16
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.970
"Miyano Clinic"

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.770
Well, I'm leaving now.

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.470
Can I come back if I get hurt again?

19
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.170
No. We don't treat boys who fight.

20
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.270
What?

21
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.070
But if it's an honorable injury suffered

22
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.970
while making up with the friend you fought with,

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.270
then I'll at least put a bandage on you.

24
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.770
I see.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.370
So that's how it is.

26
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.070
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

27
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

28
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.870
Amuro's memory and a poisoned glass.

29
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.870
The trick is one both telling and surprising.

30
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.270
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.270
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.869
"The Unsolved Cocktail Case (Part 3)"

34
00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.669
Excuse me, Officer Takagi.

35
00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.669
Yes?

36
00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.169
I found a fake nail.

37
00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.369
I thought it might be Ms. Yuri's.

38
00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:18.569
It has lilies on it.

39
00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.169
Oh, yeah.

40
00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.669
That's one of Yuri's fake nails.

41
00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.469
Where did you find it?

42
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:29.069
The thing is I seem to have stepped on it somewhere.

43
00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.269
It was stuck to the bottom of my boot.

44
00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:34.469
That's why it's so damaged. Sorry.

45
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.669
It must've come off when Ms. Yuri collapsed.

46
00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.069
It couldn't be helped.

47
00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.869
Hey, miss.

48
00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:44.069
Does Ms. Yuri always wear those fake nails?

49
00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.669
Yeah, she does.

50
00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.069
I suggested she wear some different ones sometimes

51
00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.769
but she insisted it was her trademark.

52
00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:54.769
Really?

53
00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:57.069
Today has been an awful day.

54
00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.569
Awful how?

55
00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.569
I unfortunately stepped on Ms. Yuri's fake nail

56
00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.069
and I dropped my wallet at some point.

57
00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.469
Your wallet?

58
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.969
Yeah but apparently Amuro found it

59
00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.869
in front of the bathroom.

60
00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:13.769
Amuro did?

61
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:15.569
What about me?

62
00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.769
Nothing.

63
00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.569
Well, you couldn't help stepping on a fake nail

64
00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.769
that fell on the floor.

65
00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.169
It's not like we're walking around

66
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.569
with magnifying glasses like Sherlock Holmes-style.

67
00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.669
That's it.

68
00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.569
They could've used that.

69
00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.469
That's why the culprit was able to poison Ms. Yuri's glass.

70
00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:44.269
They used her fake nails as a target.

71
00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:49.069
How many times do I have to tell you, Inspector?

72
00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.669
It's true that I passed by Yuri

73
00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.969
while she was holding her glass...

74
00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.169
Excuse me, coming through.

75
00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:00.669
But it was only for a moment,

76
00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.169
I couldn't have poisoned her glass.

77
00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.169
I couldn't have poisoned it either.

78
00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.169
I just bumped into her

79
00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.269
and spilled wine on her.

80
00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.269
Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:18.069
I didn't have time to poison her glass.

82
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.269
I wasn't wearing my glasses

83
00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.769
when she set her glass on the table.

84
00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.769
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:30.769
It suddenly starting ringing

86
00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.569
while I was checking my messages.

87
00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.869
Even if I wanted to poison her glass,

88
00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:40.469
I didn't know which one was hers.

89
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.469
So why don't you let us go

90
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.969
so we can visit her in the hospital?

91
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.569
I'm worried about her.

92
00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.669
I understand your concern but you're just a customer.

93
00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.669
Why are you so worried?

94
00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.169
Because...

95
00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.269
I'm a regular of hers.

96
00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:02.569
That's what you say

97
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:05.469
but maybe she was actually pushing for marriage

98
00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:13.269
and you want to watch the girl you poisoned out of desperation die?

99
00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:14.869
I...

100
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.769
Maybe he wants to go to finish her off.

101
00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:21.169
Are you talking about yourself?

102
00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.869
If she dies, you'll become the restaurant's top earner.

103
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:29.269
Then the restaurant will pay you a big bonus, right?

104
00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:30.769
So, what?

105
00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:34.969
Are you saying I poisoned Yuri for that?

106
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:38.069
I heard from Yuri.

107
00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:39.569
I heard you're struggling

108
00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:43.169
to pay for your seriously ill father's surgery!

109
00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:44.669
Didn't I tell you?

110
00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.469
Don't worry about the money.

111
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:50.169
Just focus on getting better.

112
00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.269
I'll do something about the money for the surgery.

113
00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:56.469
What? At least I'm not an old man who was trying to pay her

114
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:58.169
to stop contacting him!

115
00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:00.969
Pay her? What are you talking about?

116
00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.169
Don't play dumb.

117
00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:07.669
Some of the girls saw your butler over there

118
00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.569
trying to pay off Yuri.

119
00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:14.269
Sounds like she turned him down, though.

120
00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:17.269
What's she talking about, Fukamachi?

121
00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:19.869
I, uh...

122
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:21.769
In any case...

123
00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:23.669
The three of you will remain here

124
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:27.669
for questioning for a while.

125
00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:31.469
After all, you're the only ones

126
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.969
who could have poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass.

127
00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:37.369
But, Inspector Megure.

128
00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:40.269
I don't think the rich man did it.

129
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.269
Rich man? You mean Mr. Morooka?

130
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:44.269
Yeah.

131
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:46.369
Why do you think that?

132
00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:47.569
He passed by Ms. Yuri

133
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:54.269
while heading to his car parked outside the restaurant

134
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:56.569
to get his butler's glasses, right?

135
00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.669
Yeah.

136
00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:02.869
When we talked to the bodyguards by his car earlier,

137
00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:07.969
they said the rich man just came with Pops to get the glasses.

138
00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:11.469
They didn't notice anything strange at all.

139
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:12.969
Anything strange?

140
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:17.069
If I poisoned Ms. Yuri's glass,

141
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:18.869
I would definitely be checking the time

142
00:09:18.869 --> 00:09:21.969
or glancing at the restaurant,

143
00:09:21.969 --> 00:09:25.169
thinking she must've drunk the poison by now

144
00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:29.169
and there must be a huge commotion inside the restaurant.

145
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:31.869
You're right.

146
00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:36.669
The same thing goes for that bunny girl.

147
00:09:36.669 --> 00:09:39.269
Even if she poisoned Ms. Yuri

148
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:41.369
when she spilled wine on her,

149
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:45.569
when Ms. Yuri covered her glass with a coaster

150
00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:47.769
and went to the changing room

151
00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:49.869
to change her stained cuffs,

152
00:09:49.869 --> 00:09:55.069
she wandered off somewhere to answer a call from a customer.

153
00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:00.969
Hello, Mr. Adachi?

154
00:10:00.969 --> 00:10:02.969
Hello again.

155
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.869
I'm sorry but we're full right now.

156
00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:08.269
A table should open up in about an hour.

157
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:12.469
If it were me, I wouldn't leave no matter what.

158
00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:16.969
After all, someone else might accidentally drink

159
00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:19.169
from the poisoned glass.

160
00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:21.069
I see.

161
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:22.169
Right?

162
00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:24.469
Don't you agree?

163
00:10:24.469 --> 00:10:26.969
Uh, yeah.

164
00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:28.169
Which leaves...

165
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:33.469
the man sitting by Ms. Yuri's glass the whole time.

166
00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:41.069
It could only have been you,

167
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:43.969
Mr. Atsufumi Fukamachi the butler.

168
00:10:57.536 --> 00:11:02.036
Weren't you listening to what Fukamachi said?

169
00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.736
He wasn't wearing his glasses

170
00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:07.736
when she set her glass on the table.

171
00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:13.336
How was he able to identify her glass and poison it?

172
00:11:13.336 --> 00:11:16.336
Mr. Fukamachi had something on him

173
00:11:16.336 --> 00:11:18.136
that could substitute for glasses.

174
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:21.736
What? Substitute for glasses?

175
00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:23.136
Is that true?

176
00:11:23.136 --> 00:11:24.736
No.

177
00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:28.736
I was just checking my messages on my phone then.

178
00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:29.836
Hear that?

179
00:11:29.836 --> 00:11:33.736
He says the only thing he had was his phone.

180
00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:35.736
Yes, so...

181
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:36.836
Wow!

182
00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:38.736
Phones are amazing!

183
00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:43.436
Hold on. Conan, they're in the middle of an important conversation.

184
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:49.036
Yeah but if I use the camera on the phone and zoom in

185
00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:52.136
I can clearly see you all the way down to your fingertips.

186
00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:54.436
It's like a magnifying glass.

187
00:11:54.436 --> 00:11:55.536
What?

188
00:11:59.536 --> 00:12:02.836
He's right. If you use a phone like this...

189
00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:05.536
You might be able to see without glasses.

190
00:12:05.536 --> 00:12:06.636
Come to think of it,

191
00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:11.136
Ms. Yuri always wore fake nails with lilies.

192
00:12:11.136 --> 00:12:16.136
You could use those to identify her glass.

193
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:21.836
But Fukamachi wasn't wearing his glasses

194
00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:25.336
because I happened to step on them and break them.

195
00:12:25.336 --> 00:12:28.736
That wasn't a coincidence. He planned it.

196
00:12:28.736 --> 00:12:29.836
What?

197
00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:34.036
If he knew you put sauce on your rolled omelets,

198
00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:36.736
he could've placed the sauce far enough away from you

199
00:12:36.736 --> 00:12:40.636
that you'd have to take a step to reach it.

200
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:43.236
By dropping his glasses by your feet...

201
00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:47.036
he could make it look like

202
00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:50.036
they were coincidentally stepped on.

203
00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:52.536
He had you step on his glasses

204
00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:55.236
in order to use that trick,

205
00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:59.336
but probably also to distance you from the crime scene

206
00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:02.836
so suspicion wouldn't fall on you.

207
00:13:04.136 --> 00:13:05.936
However, it didn't pay off.

208
00:13:05.936 --> 00:13:08.636
You passed by Ms. Yuri while she was holding her glass

209
00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:11.636
when you went to get the glasses

210
00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:14.836
and suspicion fell on you anyway.

211
00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.136
Is that true, Fukamachi?

212
00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:20.436
And after you left the restaurant,

213
00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:23.436
he deliberately triggered his phone's alarm.

214
00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:27.636
He made Ms. Yuri set her glass on the table

215
00:13:27.636 --> 00:13:30.336
to check for an earthquake report.

216
00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.436
Then he used his phone's camera's zoom function

217
00:13:33.436 --> 00:13:36.436
to identify her glass,

218
00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:39.136
and poisoned it.

219
00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:46.736
It's likely he used two separate phones to sound the alarm

220
00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:49.636
and use the camera's zoom function.

221
00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:52.836
So if you search Mr. Fukamachi,

222
00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:57.136
you'll probably find two phones on him.

223
00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:00.336
I'm sorry, Mr. Fukamachi,

224
00:14:00.336 --> 00:14:01.736
but we'll need to search...

225
00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:04.536
There's no need.

226
00:14:04.536 --> 00:14:07.236
I do have two.

227
00:14:07.236 --> 00:14:09.036
I bought a second one

228
00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:11.936
and practiced countless times

229
00:14:11.936 --> 00:14:14.736
for your late wife.

230
00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:19.036
You poisoned Yuri for my wife?

231
00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:24.036
Yes, so you'd finally open your eyes.

232
00:14:24.036 --> 00:14:26.236
Open my eyes?

233
00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:31.136
If more time had passed since she passed away,

234
00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.636
I wouldn't say anything.

235
00:14:33.636 --> 00:14:36.736
But it hasn't even been six months,

236
00:14:36.736 --> 00:14:41.936
and you're already infatuated with that young girl.

237
00:14:41.936 --> 00:14:47.236
I served your wife since she was a child.

238
00:14:47.236 --> 00:14:50.136
I felt so sorry for her.

239
00:14:50.136 --> 00:14:57.536
I selfishly offered her money to stay away from you

240
00:14:57.536 --> 00:14:58.836
but she refused.

241
00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:01.436
With no other choice, I sent that threatening letter.

242
00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:06.336
But it had absolutely no effect,

243
00:15:06.336 --> 00:15:09.636
so I decided to use force.

244
00:15:09.636 --> 00:15:13.336
I thought if the girl you were chasing were harmed,

245
00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:18.636
you would stop visiting the club.

246
00:15:19.936 --> 00:15:21.536
Sir.

247
00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:25.236
This is my final request to you.

248
00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:29.536
Please don't make your wife sad anymore.

249
00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:32.936
Fukamachi, you've got it all wrong.

250
00:15:32.936 --> 00:15:34.636
That girl...

251
00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:38.236
Yuri isn't just some girl I'm chasing.

252
00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:40.836
She's your daughter.

253
00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:41.936
Right?

254
00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:43.936
-His daughter? -His daughter?

255
00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:48.836
Don't be ridiculous!

256
00:15:48.836 --> 00:15:49.836
Don't tell me

257
00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:55.136
it's because they both put sauce on their rolled omelets.

258
00:15:55.136 --> 00:15:56.236
No.

259
00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:58.436
That's just their taste.

260
00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:03.036
It's unusual but coincidences do happen.

261
00:16:03.036 --> 00:16:06.536
But the unique way they hold their chopsticks.

262
00:16:06.536 --> 00:16:11.236
It can't be a coincidence that they both hold

263
00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:14.236
their pointer finger away from their chopsticks.

264
00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:21.036
When you were young and eloped,

265
00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:23.836
the daughter you had while living in Tottori for four years

266
00:16:23.836 --> 00:16:25.536
was Ms. Yuri.

267
00:16:25.536 --> 00:16:28.236
If she learned to hold her chopsticks

268
00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:31.236
by copying you as a child,

269
00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:34.336
then it all makes sense.

270
00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:38.336
You lost and gained weight

271
00:16:38.336 --> 00:16:41.836
so you'd have to get your suits tailored.

272
00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.636
You began tripping frequently

273
00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:47.236
so you'd tear your suits and have to buy new ones.

274
00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:50.936
It was all to create a reason

275
00:16:50.936 --> 00:16:53.736
to go to the clothing store next door

276
00:16:53.736 --> 00:16:55.836
so you could come here

277
00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:59.336
and see your daughter, wasn't it?

278
00:16:59.336 --> 00:17:00.836
Yeah.

279
00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:03.336
I didn't have to see how she held her chopsticks to know instantly

280
00:17:03.336 --> 00:17:05.636
that she was my daughter.

281
00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:09.536
She looked just like her mother I eloped with.

282
00:17:09.536 --> 00:17:13.636
And I'm the one who named her Yuri.

283
00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:15.936
I see.

284
00:17:15.936 --> 00:17:17.936
So that's why...

285
00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.736
Are you okay, Yuri?

286
00:17:19.736 --> 00:17:21.836
Yuri!

287
00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:24.436
He called her informally.

288
00:17:24.436 --> 00:17:29.036
Sir, you could've told me.

289
00:17:29.036 --> 00:17:31.236
I couldn't tell you

290
00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:35.336
I wanted to see the daughter I had when I eloped.

291
00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:38.836
Not to you, who was so devoted to my wife.

292
00:17:38.836 --> 00:17:40.936
But...

293
00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:46.336
Besides, my wife and I never had children,

294
00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:47.936
which made it all the more difficult.

295
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:53.836
Although I may not have known,

296
00:17:53.836 --> 00:17:58.036
but she was your daughter...

297
00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:01.936
What have I done?

298
00:18:03.636 --> 00:18:04.936
I see.

299
00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:07.936
Thank you for calling.

300
00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:09.536
Goodbye.

301
00:18:09.536 --> 00:18:10.636
What was that?

302
00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:13.636
The hospital called just now.

303
00:18:13.636 --> 00:18:15.736
Ms. Yuri has regained consciousness

304
00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:20.036
and her condition is improving steadily.

305
00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:21.636
That's great!

306
00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:25.736
I'm glad.

307
00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:27.736
I'm so glad.

308
00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:28.936
Fukamachi.

309
00:18:30.336 --> 00:18:31.836
In a little while,

310
00:18:31.836 --> 00:18:35.036
let's go see Yuri together and apologize.

311
00:18:35.036 --> 00:18:36.536
No, sir.

312
00:18:36.536 --> 00:18:40.736
I couldn't face her.

313
00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.036
It's all right.

314
00:18:42.036 --> 00:18:45.236
She'll forgive you if you explain why.

315
00:18:45.236 --> 00:18:47.636
After all, she's my daughter.

316
00:18:47.636 --> 00:18:49.236
Sir...

317
00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:52.436
Thank you.

318
00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:58.736
Anyway, I'm surprised you knew

319
00:18:58.736 --> 00:19:02.736
I was losing and gaining weight to see my daughter.

320
00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:05.436
I suppose.

321
00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.336
I understand.

322
00:19:07.336 --> 00:19:11.236
When I was a kid, there was a doctor I wanted to see.

323
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:21.936
I'd get injured on purpose

324
00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:25.736
so I could go to her clinic.

325
00:19:25.736 --> 00:19:27.536
Excuse me, Amuro.

326
00:19:27.536 --> 00:19:30.036
-Yes? -Thank you.

327
00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:32.236
I heard you found my wallet.

328
00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:35.336
Oh, that was yours?

329
00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:36.336
Yes.

330
00:19:36.336 --> 00:19:39.036
Was everything still inside?

331
00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:40.336
Yes.

332
00:19:40.336 --> 00:19:44.036
My cash, my house keys and everything else was still inside.

333
00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:45.636
I see.

334
00:19:45.636 --> 00:19:47.436
That's good to hear.

335
00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:15.636
You let your guard down, Shuichi Akai.

336
00:22:16.736 --> 00:22:20.836
I could say the same thing to you.

337
00:22:22.636 --> 00:22:24.036
Bourbon.

338
00:22:25.536 --> 00:22:26.936
Don't be ridiculous.

339
00:22:26.936 --> 00:22:29.936
You lost the moment I saw through your disguise

340
00:22:29.936 --> 00:22:31.736
as Subaru Okiya.

341
00:22:31.736 --> 00:22:37.636
What if I knew you'd try to sneak in here today?

342
00:22:39.136 --> 00:22:41.636
That you'd make a spare key

343
00:22:41.636 --> 00:22:46.436
and receive orders to investigate Shinichi Kudo?

344
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:58.836
Looks like I'll have to pull the trigger

345
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.436
to keep your mouth shut.

346
00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:20.636
You...

347
00:23:20.636 --> 00:23:24.836
Hello. I'm Yusaku Kudo, owner of the house.

348
00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:26.736
I'm Yukiko.

349
00:23:30.236 --> 00:23:32.536
Unlike last time,

350
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:36.436
you don't seem to have brought anyone with you.

351
00:23:38.236 --> 00:23:42.936
Why don't you enjoy a cup of tea prepared by my wife?

352
00:23:42.936 --> 00:23:45.936
Would you like lemon or milk?

353

00:23:55.636 --> 00:23:59.836

Well...

"Welcome to the Village Operated Insect Man Ranch!"

357
00:24:03.136 --> 00:24:05.936
Insect man ranch?

358
00:24:05.936 --> 00:24:07.236
Welcome!

359
00:24:07.236 --> 00:24:08.636
Seriously?

Conan's off next week.

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:32.579
-Would you like some tea? -Delicious.
