1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.540
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.840
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.640
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.440
The words "red", "white", and "yellow" written in the diary.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.640
They are important hints to solving the case.

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.845
"Red, White, Yellow, and Youth Detective Squad"

10
00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.145
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

11
00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:12.945
"Submit your problems here!"

12
00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.645
"Youth Detective Squad, 1st Grade Class B"

13
00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:18.945
There's nothing inside.

14
00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:21.245
We received no requests for jobs today, too.

15
00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:22.745
It's boring.

16
00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:26.445
Well, it just goes to show that it's peaceful, right?

17
00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.845
Right, right.

18
00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:34.245
Who could it be? At this hour of the day...

19
00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.545
What a bummer.

20
00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.445
This is weird.

21
00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:38.445
Hello.

22
00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:41.045
Hi, cool kid.

23
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.445
Did you just finish your class?

24
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:46.145
Jodie?

25
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.645
What's up?

26
00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:50.845
I tried calling your number several times but couldn't get through.

27
00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:52.745
After the "Shiranpuri" case,

28
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.745
my phone went dead, so I bought a new one.

29
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:56.945
A lot of things happened,

30
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.345
so I got myself a new number to start anew.

31
00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.645
Of course, I also managed to give my new number

32
00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.145
to her who snuck into the Organization.

33
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:07.945
"Her"? You mean Rena Mizunashi?

34
00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.645
Yes. She gave me a call shortly after that.

35
00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:13.745
She must've somehow called me in a hurry,

36
00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:16.345
so it was a very short one,

37
00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.845
but she clearly said...

38
00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.945
A new member of the Organization has started making his move.

39
00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:24.445
He's a hunter who is immensely skilled in gathering information,

40
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:27.545
has fantastic observation ability and keen foresight.

41
00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:30.045
His code name is Bourbon.

42
00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:31.145
Beware of him.

43
00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.045
It was short call containing only that information.

44
00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:39.645
Judging from her harsh tone of voice,

45
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:42.345
that hunter is probably outstandingly brilliant.

46
00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:45.245
And his target is most probably

47
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.845
the brown-haired girl that was called Sherry by the organization.

48
00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.145
Let us wait and see.

49
00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:54.045
-I guess so. -There's no one in the classroom.

50
00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:58.345
As for the FBI, we wish we could guard her tightly.

51
00:03:58.345 --> 00:03:59.645
But if we do so right now,

52
00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:03.445
we'll be exposing her whereabout to those people.

53
00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:05.145
So, we're going to avoid seeing her for a while

54
00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:07.945
and leave things up to you to handle.

55
00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:09.245
Keep on your guard

56
00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:11.045
and protect her the best you can.

57
00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:12.345
Okay.

58
00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:15.945
All right. If something comes up, contact me through this number.

59
00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:23.745
Code name...

60
00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:24.845
Bourbon.

61
00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:28.645
By the way, what are we going to do after this?

62
00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:30.845
The rain is pouring heavily.

63
00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:34.245
Then, let's go to Doc's house and play games.

64
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:35.645
Okay. Let's go!

65
00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:40.045
So? What do you plan to discuss with Doc,

66
00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:41.845
renowned detective?

67
00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:46.745
That phone call just now was from Jodie of the FBI, right?

68
00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.045
Well...

69
00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:50.945
Everything will be fine.

70
00:04:50.945 --> 00:04:53.445
You've got nothing to worry about.

71
00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:54.845
"You"?

72
00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.045
You're hiding something from me again, aren't you?

73
00:04:57.045 --> 00:04:59.445
I mean, it's not like anything has happened yet.

74
00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:01.245
We have a case.

75
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:04.445
Are Conan and Ai the case?

76
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:06.845
No, behind you.

77
00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:17.945
I see.

78
00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:19.845
So, let me organise

79
00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.745
the story told by you, Kaito Sugiura from 1st Grade Class A.

80
00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:26.345
Your father is the landlord of a small apartment,

81
00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:28.745
and there are three residents living there.

82
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:33.245
One of the three residents is making suspicious moves every night,

83
00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:36.145
so you want the members of Youth Detective Squad

84
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:38.145
to find out what he's doing, right?

85
00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:39.745
Yes.

86
00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:42.445
Okay. Why don't we all spend the night at his house tonight

87
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:45.245
and stake out the resident?

88
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.345
That sounds good!

89
00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.945
Tomorrow is a Saturday, so there's no school either.

90
00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:50.745
You're right.

91
00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:53.245
Not today!

92
00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:57.845
I'll be playing Othello with my dad tonight.

93
00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:01.245
Is that why you tried to put the request letter

94
00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:04.745
into our shoes cabinet after we left school?

95
00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:07.845
Because you didn't want to pass up playing Othello with your father tonight.

96
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.045
Yes.

97
00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:14.245
But then, we would've only seen your letter on next Monday.

98
00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:15.345
I see.

99
00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:19.345
So, what kind of suspicious thing does that person do at night?

100
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.845
I think it'd be better if you come and spend the night tomorrow

101
00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:26.345
and see for yourselves, Kuroshi...

102
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:28.345
I mean Edogawa.

103
00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:29.345
Okay.

104
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:32.045
Oh, right. You can come in the afternoon if you like.

105
00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:35.045
I'd like you to see my room and visit the apartment too.

106
00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:37.545
Okay then. How about we go together tomorrow afternoon?

107
00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:38.545
Sure.

108
00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:41.745
The address is 2-23, Beika-cho,

109
00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:44.045
and the name of the apartment is called Mokubaso.

110
00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:47.445
See you again tomorrow, Kuroshi...

111
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:48.945
Edogawa.

112
00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:50.645
Bye!

113
00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:53.145
Okay.

114
00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.645
Why did he only call out to Conan?

115
00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:58.045
Besides, why did he keep saying "kuroshi"?

116
00:06:58.045 --> 00:07:01.445
Maybe he was trying to say "yoroshiku".

117
00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:07.545
2-23, Beika-cho, Mokubaso...

118
00:07:07.545 --> 00:07:10.045
Do you know that apartment?

119
00:07:10.045 --> 00:07:14.045
No. I think it is near Doc's house.

120
00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:15.245
Yes.

121
00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:19.145
I always pass by that apartment on my way home from school.

122
00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:23.045
It's a small and old apartment, but it seems pretty nice.

123
00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:41.245
Beika-cho...

124
00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:44.045
Block number 2...

125
00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:50.445
The street number is 23.

126
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:54.845
Mokubaso...

127
00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.145
It's right here, isn't it?

128
00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:01.845
No... no way.

129
00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:04.045
It's completely burned down by fire!

130
00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:05.445
Oh, no.

131
00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:08.945
Come to think of it, I heard sirens in the middle of the night.

132
00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:11.245
Then, what about the boy?

133
00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:15.345
What happened to Kaito?

134
00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:17.945
Could he be trapped in the fire and...

135
00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:19.145
No way.

136
00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:22.745
No. The boy named Kaito is fine.

137
00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:24.945
He suffered slight burns

138
00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:27.045
"Inspector Yuminaga" -but was rescued by the firefighters,

139
00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:29.145
and is asleep at the hospital now.

140
00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:30.945
Really?

141
00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.845
What a relief!

142
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.345
Inspector Yuminaga.

143
00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:37.145
Aren't you the kid staying at Mouri's place?

144
00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:39.745
I haven't seen you since the Akauma arson case.

145
00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:41.045
Right.

146
00:08:41.045 --> 00:08:44.545
Inspector Yuminaga is the one who was in charge

147
00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.245
of the arson case in the past that we encountered

148
00:08:47.245 --> 00:08:49.245
when Heiji Hattori was here in Tokyo.

149
00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:54.545
So, did anybody die in this fire?

150
00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:56.845
Fortunately, there are no casualties.

151
00:08:56.845 --> 00:08:59.745
But the father of the boy named Kaito, who is the landlord here

152
00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.245
is in the Intensive Care Unit right now.

153
00:09:02.245 --> 00:09:05.345
So during the fire, the other members of the boy's family

154
00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:09.045
and the residents of the apartment got away safely?

155
00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:12.145
His mother happened to be on a trip.

156
00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:14.745
I called the hotel where she stayed at a while ago.

157
00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:17.945
She was really shocked and said she'd be right back.

158
00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:20.345
There are three other residents,

159
00:09:20.345 --> 00:09:24.045
but all three of them happened to be away when the fire occurred

160
00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:26.445
and came back in the morning.

161
00:09:26.445 --> 00:09:27.745
They went out?

162
00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:29.545
But the fire occurred at night, didn't it?

163
00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:33.045
Yes, at around 2.30 in the morning.

164
00:09:33.045 --> 00:09:35.345
Well, all three of them are adults,

165
00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:37.645
so there's nothing strange about them going out late at night

166
00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.345
and coming home in the morning.

167
00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:43.145
I bet the one who set the fire is one of the three people!

168
00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:44.245
What?

169
00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:46.645
Kaito told us yesterday that one of the three residents

170
00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:50.045
is doing something suspicious at night!

171
00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:54.045
We came to confirm that and ended up seeing this!

172
00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:56.145
I see.

173
00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:57.945
Inspector Yuminaga.

174
00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.945
This was found among the burnt remains.

175
00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:02.545
What is this?

176
00:10:04.045 --> 00:10:08.145
This is... It's Kaito's diary.

177
00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:14.145
The last page is dated July 4th.

178
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:15.745
That was yesterday.

179
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:18.045
"The weather was bad this morning.

180
00:10:18.045 --> 00:10:20.745
I had to hurry and go to school

181
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.045
while the Red Person could sleep in."

182
00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:27.245
What does he mean by "the Red Person"?

183
00:10:28.745 --> 00:10:32.545
"I fell at the front door after coming home from school,

184
00:10:32.545 --> 00:10:36.445
but I was glad the White Person was going out.

185
00:10:36.445 --> 00:10:39.845
The Red Person, the White Person and the Yellow Person

186
00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:41.145
are all out tonight.

187
00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.745
It's just daddy and me tonight.

188
00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.345
I wish I could play for longer,

189
00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:47.745
but the members of the Detective Squad will be coming tomorrow,

190
00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:49.845
so I guess I'll go to bed early.

191
00:10:49.845 --> 00:10:50.945
I wonder who it is?

192
00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:53.945
Somebody came home in the middle of the night

193
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.745
and is arguing with daddy.

194
00:10:56.745 --> 00:10:58.345
It's the Yellow Person.

195
00:10:58.345 --> 00:10:59.745
I wonder if daddy found out

196
00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:02.345
about the suspicious things he was doing?

197
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.945
I'm scared. Let's just cover my ears and sleep.

198
00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:08.245
I've got to tell Conan about this after I get up."

199
00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:12.145
So the one who set the fire is the yellow guy.

200
00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:13.745
Inspector Yuminaga.

201
00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:16.545
What are the three residents like?

202
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:21.645
Hey, can you bring the three of them here?

203
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:22.845
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:40.945 --> 00:11:42.645
This feeling...

205
00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:46.345
Eyes that glare a prey down.

206
00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:50.245
This pressure is almost as if my guts are being hollowed out.

207
00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:52.945
What's the matter?

208
00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:56.045
They're here.

209
00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:58.345
They're nearby.

210
00:11:58.345 --> 00:12:00.545
The members of the organization!

211
00:12:21.756 --> 00:12:23.156
They're here.

212
00:12:23.156 --> 00:12:25.256
There's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:28.356
Why would members of the organization come here?

214
00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:30.156
What could possibly bring them here?

215
00:12:30.956 --> 00:12:33.956
No, I've got no time to waste on thinking about it.

216
00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:35.556
I've got to run.

217
00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:37.956
I've got to hurry and get out of here,

218
00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:39.356
or everyone else would...

219
00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:44.756
It disappeared.

220
00:12:44.756 --> 00:12:48.056
-Hey, are you okay? -Yes...

221
00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:49.556
Are you feeling sick?

222
00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:51.556
Are you all right?

223
00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:53.156
Please cooperate a while longer

224
00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:55.356
and answer the questions the officer asks you.

225
00:12:55.356 --> 00:12:57.056
Please come this way.

226
00:12:59.656 --> 00:13:04.356
So, who's the suspicious one among the three?

227
00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:05.856
How would we know?

228
00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:08.856
That's what we came to find out from Kaito.

229
00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:12.256
Why didn't you say so from the beginning?

230
00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:16.256
What do those three people do?

231
00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:17.956
Starting from the right...

232
00:13:17.956 --> 00:13:19.756
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25)" -the man with the band aid

233
00:13:19.756 --> 00:13:22.256
is a carpenter, Mr. Ryuhei Hosoi.

234
00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:23.856
"Subaru Okiya (27)" -The one with glasses

235
00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:27.356
is a post-graduate student, Mr. Subaru Okiya.

236
00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:29.056
"Ginya Makabe (29)" -And the plump one

237
00:13:29.056 --> 00:13:32.356
is a freelancer, Mr. Ginya Makabe.

238
00:13:32.356 --> 00:13:36.056
I wonder which one among them is the Yellow Person.

239
00:13:36.056 --> 00:13:39.956
Inspector, what's this "yellow person" all about?

240
00:13:39.956 --> 00:13:43.056
Oh, right. Take a look at this.

241
00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:45.656
It's a diary written by the son of the landlord.

242
00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:49.756
And it seems like Kaito asked these kids

243
00:13:49.756 --> 00:13:53.356
the day before the incident

244
00:13:53.356 --> 00:13:56.056
to check on a resident who was acting suspicious.

245
00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.456
We're not ordinary kids!

246
00:13:57.456 --> 00:13:59.356
We have an official name.

247
00:13:59.356 --> 00:14:01.656
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

248
00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:05.056
Right, it is written in the diary.

249
00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:07.556
What bothers me is that the residents of this apartment

250
00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:10.256
are referred to as colours.

251
00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:13.656
From what is written here, it seems like this Yellow Person

252
00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:16.056
is unmistakably the culprit.

253
00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:18.756
Even so, we can't tell

254
00:14:18.756 --> 00:14:22.056
which one of them is the Yellow Person.

255
00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:25.456
None of the three has a name that relates to colours.

256
00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:28.456
No one's wearing yellow clothes either.

257
00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:29.656
They work as a carpenter,

258
00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:31.956
a post-graduate student and a freelancer respectively.

259
00:14:31.956 --> 00:14:34.956
None of those jobs reminds us of colours.

260
00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:37.756
Red, white and yellow.

261
00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:39.756
They sound like colours of flowers.

262
00:14:40.856 --> 00:14:44.356
There's a black one.

263
00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:46.056
-The Black Person? -See.

264
00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:48.656
That tanned man.

265
00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:50.656
If it refers to skin colour, the one with glasses

266
00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.256
is the White Person.

267
00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:57.256
Anyway, let's delve deeper and look for

268
00:14:57.256 --> 00:14:59.656
the culprit who is the Yellow Person

269
00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:02.056
and find out what he did.

270
00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:07.256
Gosh. How many times do I have to repeat myself?

271
00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:08.956
During the night of the fire,

272
00:15:08.956 --> 00:15:12.956
I was drinking with my boss and other fellow carpenters.

273
00:15:12.956 --> 00:15:15.356
But we've just confirmed

274
00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:19.656
that you disappeared not long after 1 am.

275
00:15:19.656 --> 00:15:22.556
Yes. I was totally wasted

276
00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:25.656
because I hadn't drunk in a long time.

277
00:15:25.656 --> 00:15:27.256
I was trying to clear some alcohol out of my body,

278
00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:30.156
so I lay down on a bench and fell asleep.

279
00:15:30.156 --> 00:15:32.956
When I woke up, it was already morning.

280
00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:36.456
So, that means nobody was with you at around 2.30 am

281
00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:40.056
when the fire occurred?

282
00:15:40.056 --> 00:15:41.656
No, there wasn't.

283
00:15:41.656 --> 00:15:43.156
What happened?

284
00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:45.156
There's a band aid on your face.

285
00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:46.756
Did you get into a fight or something?

286
00:15:46.756 --> 00:15:48.956
Who's that kid?

287
00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:50.656
Just answer him.

288
00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:54.156
I accidentally hit my face with a block of wood at work.

289
00:15:54.156 --> 00:15:56.256
I'm still a newbie at it.

290
00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:58.556
See. I have wounds everywhere.

291
00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:01.556
By the way, what's your favourite colour?

292
00:16:01.556 --> 00:16:03.156
Colour?

293
00:16:03.156 --> 00:16:05.056
The blue colour of the sea.

294
00:16:05.056 --> 00:16:07.856
I like to go surfing occasionally.

295
00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:11.756
No, I went driving alone that night.

296
00:16:11.756 --> 00:16:15.056
Whenever I get stuck writing the thesis I have to hand in to my professor,

297
00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:17.556
I go driving for a change of mood.

298
00:16:17.556 --> 00:16:19.756
Where did you drive to?

299
00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:22.656
The tree-lined street along Teimusu River.

300
00:16:22.656 --> 00:16:24.156
I always go there

301
00:16:24.156 --> 00:16:27.656
because the greenery makes me relaxed.

302
00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:30.356
I'm also the one who waters the plants

303
00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:33.456
in the yard of this apartment every day.

304
00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:34.956
It seems like the landlord isn't all that interested

305
00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:37.556
in taking care of the yard.

306
00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:41.356
If so, do you like the colour green?

307
00:16:41.356 --> 00:16:42.956
Not really.

308
00:16:42.956 --> 00:16:45.456
If I have to pick a colour,

309
00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:47.956
I'd say my favourite is black.

310
00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:50.356
It hides the part inside of me

311
00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:52.456
that I don't want anyone to know about.

312
00:16:52.456 --> 00:16:54.556
But then, I also dislike the colour black

313
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.456
for the same reason.

314
00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:02.456
I went to a theater in Haido-cho last night to watch movies.

315
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:05.756
It was an all-night movie from 10 pm to 5 am.

316
00:17:05.756 --> 00:17:07.256
It was a continuous showing

317
00:17:07.256 --> 00:17:08.756
of three movies of the "Monster Gomera" series.

318
00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:10.856
-Did you go alone? -Yes.

319
00:17:10.856 --> 00:17:13.456
An online friend who was supposed to go with me

320
00:17:13.456 --> 00:17:15.556
suddenly couldn't make it.

321
00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:17.956
An online friend?

322
00:17:17.956 --> 00:17:20.456
My hobby is day-trading,

323
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:24.956
so I have friends who exchange information about it with me online.

324
00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:28.756
Day-trading? Do you mean stock exchange?

325
00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.956
Well, it's just a hobby,

326
00:17:30.956 --> 00:17:33.856
so I make very little money out of it.

327
00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:36.256
I heard you're a freelancer.

328
00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.556
Are you able to make a living from it?

329
00:17:38.556 --> 00:17:40.056
I'm registered as a temporary staff

330
00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:41.356
and get paid on a day-to-day basis.

331
00:17:41.356 --> 00:17:43.256
Is your job...

332
00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:45.656
related to construction?

333
00:17:46.756 --> 00:17:50.556
Because there's a lot of dirt in your fingernails.

334
00:17:50.556 --> 00:17:52.956
No. It's...

335
00:17:52.956 --> 00:17:56.256
from a survival game that I played the other day.

336
00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:59.256
I ran around in the mountains.

337
00:17:59.256 --> 00:18:01.056
I was beaten so bad that I ruined my clothes

338
00:18:01.056 --> 00:18:03.856
because the paint wouldn't come off.

339
00:18:03.856 --> 00:18:05.656
Then, is your favourite colour

340
00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:08.056
the colour frequently used on camouflage outfits?

341
00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:11.056
-Navy... -Yes.

342
00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.256
Navy green.

343
00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:17.156
Officer, do our favourite colours

344
00:18:17.156 --> 00:18:19.256
have anything to do with the fire?

345
00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:22.356
Well, there are a lot of things involved.

346
00:18:23.256 --> 00:18:25.056
Mitsuhiko.

347
00:18:25.056 --> 00:18:27.356
Will you help me?

348
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:28.356
Sure.

349
00:18:28.356 --> 00:18:30.956
Stay still and walk backwards from here.

350
00:18:30.956 --> 00:18:33.156
That's all I need you to do.

351
00:18:33.156 --> 00:18:34.656
You want me to step backwards?

352
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:37.556
-Is there anything behind? -Don't look elsewhere.

353
00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:40.756
Just keep looking at me.

354
00:18:40.756 --> 00:18:43.356
-Can you do that? -Yes.

355
00:18:45.456 --> 00:18:47.356
He's here.

356
00:18:47.356 --> 00:18:49.656
He must be somewhere around here.

357
00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:52.056
The member of the Organization

358
00:18:52.056 --> 00:18:53.956
who made me feel the pressure.

359
00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:57.856
I've got to hurry and figure out who it is.

360
00:18:57.856 --> 00:18:59.756
If I don't do something quickly,

361
00:18:59.756 --> 00:19:01.556
I'll end up getting these children involved.

362
00:19:01.556 --> 00:19:03.756
Ai, it hurts.

363
00:19:06.756 --> 00:19:08.856
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

364
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.256
Yes! I'm fine!

365
00:19:11.256 --> 00:19:14.956
I just scrapped my elbow a bit.

366
00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:16.856
Here.

367
00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:19.356
Use this, it's a band aid.

368
00:19:19.356 --> 00:19:22.456
Thank you! Isn't this yours?

369
00:19:22.456 --> 00:19:23.756
Don't worry about it.

370
00:19:23.756 --> 00:19:26.256
I have it on me all the time because people tell me to keep it handy

371
00:19:26.256 --> 00:19:29.156
since I hurt my head a lot.

372
00:19:32.356 --> 00:19:34.656
If it has nothing to do with their favourite colour,

373
00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:37.756
what on earth does he mean by the Yellow Person?

374
00:19:37.756 --> 00:19:39.256
Inspector.

375
00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:41.856
Don't you think it's a bit risky to believe everything

376
00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:43.756
the boy has written in his diary?

377
00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:46.056
He might have made them up.

378
00:19:46.056 --> 00:19:47.656
I don't think so!

379
00:19:47.656 --> 00:19:49.256
He told us

380
00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:52.256
that somebody was doing suspicious things at night!

381
00:19:52.256 --> 00:19:55.656
It didn't sound like he was making up a story!

382
00:19:55.656 --> 00:19:59.356
Right. Besides, if officers find children who did something bad,

383
00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:04.756
you start by asking adults around them to get an idea

384
00:20:04.756 --> 00:20:07.956
on how the child's character is, right?

385
00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:11.956
So, it's possible if it's the other way around, isn't it?

386
00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.356
Although Kaito's a child,

387
00:20:13.356 --> 00:20:16.156
he observed the residents very closely

388
00:20:16.156 --> 00:20:18.656
and gave them nicknames.

389
00:20:18.656 --> 00:20:21.956
It's like Copper Beeches.

390
00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:23.756
This is a dialogue that Holmes said to Dr. Watson

391
00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:26.856
in "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches".

392
00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:28.356
"Dr. Watson.

393
00:20:28.356 --> 00:20:32.056
In order to grasp the character of a child,

394
00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:37.056
you always start by checking his parents, don't you?

395
00:20:37.056 --> 00:20:41.356
Don't you think it can also work the other way around?"

396
00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:43.856
Was that how he said it?

397
00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:46.156
So you like Holmes too.

398
00:20:46.156 --> 00:20:49.456
Yes, I had every one of the books,

399
00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:52.156
but they're all burnt now.

400
00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:54.356
Let's not talk about Holmes for now.

401
00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.156
We can't ignore this diary all together.

402
00:20:57.156 --> 00:20:58.756
Sir.

403
00:20:58.756 --> 00:21:01.656
May I have a look at the diary?

404
00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.556
Sure, here you go.

405
00:21:03.556 --> 00:21:05.056
Thank you.

406
00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.756
-Inspector! -Yes?

407
00:21:06.756 --> 00:21:08.456
Did you find something else?

408
00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:09.756
Yes.

409
00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.756
Many toy cars were found

410
00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:13.956
from the area around Kaito's room.

411
00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:15.956
Toy cars?

412
00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:18.256
It's not surprising that toy cars can be found

413
00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:19.656
in a child's room, is it?

414
00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:22.456
But there are too many of them.

415
00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:24.756
I think there are over 100 of them.

416
00:21:24.756 --> 00:21:26.356
What is this?

417
00:21:26.356 --> 00:21:27.656
What do you mean?

418
00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:28.756
What is it?

419
00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:31.556
Look at this. The word "edogawa"

420
00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.456
has been erased and re-written repeatedly.

421
00:21:33.456 --> 00:21:34.856
It's a little black here.

422
00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:37.456
Maybe he tried to write it in Kanji.

423
00:21:37.456 --> 00:21:41.856
No. Isn't the faded writing below it Katakana?

424
00:21:41.856 --> 00:21:44.256
Could it be "kuroshi"?

425
00:21:44.256 --> 00:21:47.756
-Kuroshi? -It's Kuroshiro.

426
00:21:47.756 --> 00:21:49.856
When I called the hospital a while ago,

427
00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:52.256
Kaito's mother told me something.

428
00:21:52.256 --> 00:21:53.756
Kaito called her,

429
00:21:53.756 --> 00:21:55.356
saying that a very smart boy

430
00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.456
who rapidly solves the cases in his school

431
00:21:57.456 --> 00:21:59.056
would be coming over the next day

432
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.956
and he was so happy about it.

433
00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:03.756
She said that the nickname Kaito gave that boy

434
00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:06.156
was Kuroshiro.

435
00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:09.456
Then, the "kuroshi" Kaito kept saying yesterday...

436
00:22:09.456 --> 00:22:11.756
it referred to Conan!

437
00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:15.056
But why did he call him Kuroshiro?

438
00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:16.156
Well.

439
00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:18.856
I guess we'll have to wait for Kaito to recover

440
00:22:18.856 --> 00:22:21.156
and ask him then.

441
00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:22.856
No.

442
00:22:22.856 --> 00:22:25.456
There's no need to do so.

443
00:22:28.256 --> 00:22:31.356
I, Kuroshiro,

444
00:22:31.356 --> 00:22:35.456
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

445
00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:37.456
As well as which one among them

446
00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:41.256
is the yellow arsonist.

447
00:24:10.056 --> 00:24:11.656
The night the fire broke out,

448
00:24:11.656 --> 00:24:13.956
the three of you went out

449
00:24:13.956 --> 00:24:16.756
and came home in the morning, right?

450
00:24:16.756 --> 00:24:20.356
That means someone's lying!

451
00:24:20.356 --> 00:24:24.256
I already know which one among the three

452
00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:26.356
is the yellow arsonist.

453
00:24:26.356 --> 00:24:27.656
What?

454
00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:29.856
Oh, no! Over there right now...

455
00:24:29.856 --> 00:24:31.856
Shinichi?

456
00:24:31.856 --> 00:24:34.056
Shinichi's back.

457
00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:39.156
Next Conan, "Conan VS Double Code Mystery"

458
00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:55.756
Like this!

459
00:24:55.756 --> 00:24:57.956
Next Conan's Hint:

460
00:24:57.956 --> 00:24:59.656
"Toy car"

461
00:24:59.656 --> 00:25:01.456
Is that a dish with pig ears?

462
00:25:01.456 --> 00:25:02.656
That's a snail.

463
00:25:02.656 --> 00:25:04.656
Are you his parent?
