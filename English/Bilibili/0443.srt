1
00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:03.624
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:05.524
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:06.824
The Youth Detective Squad goes clam digging.

4
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:09.824
The "younger brother" (Yokomizo) makes his appearance!

5
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:11.124
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:12.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.924
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:03.992
Not yet?

9
00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:05.492
Just a little bit more.

10
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.292
That's why we should've left the house earlier!

11
00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.492
It can't be helped because the roads were jammed with traffic.

12
00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:50.792
We did it!

13
00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:52.792
Finished!

14
00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.192
How about it, Doc? Don't you think it's really something?

15
00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:56.692
Wow!

16
00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:59.592
What a magnificent sand castle!

17
00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:03.892
Yes! I think we did a good job.

18
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.092
I worked on it too!

19
00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:08.092
Although I didn't do much, I helped too!

20
00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:12.792
I see. You all cooperated.

21
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.192
Hey, you guys.

22
00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.992
I thought we came here to dig clams?

23
00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:19.392
Come on, you guys!

24
00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.192
But...

25
00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:24.192
To be honest, I'm bored!

26
00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:27.392
No matter how much I dig, all I get is sand, sand, sand!

27
00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:30.592
Well, no big deal.

28
00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:32.792
No need to get desperate looking for clams here

29
00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:35.292
because there doesn't seem to be many here.

30
00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:36.992
Oh?

31
00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:38.892
I don't think so.

32
00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:45.892
Wow! There are so many clams!

33
00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.292
A lot.

34
00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.392
There are at least 20 to 30 of them.

35
00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.392
I hope you didn't go buy them at the fish shop.

36
00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:55.992
There are a lot of guys like you around.

37
00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:57.492
Idiot!

38
00:03:57.492 --> 00:03:58.992
Why would I do something like that?

39
00:03:58.992 --> 00:04:01.492
You need technique, a knack for digging them!

40
00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:03.792
A knack for it?

41
00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.392
Tell me how, then.

42
00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:10.992
Listen, scrape the water's edge with the rake and make the sand soft.

43
00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.192
Then, after a while when the waves come...

44
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.092
See?

45
00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.692
Clams that are lighter than sand come floating.

46
00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:25.092
Wow!

47
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:26.492
You're pretty good, Conan!

48
00:04:26.492 --> 00:04:28.192
Where did you learn something like that?

49
00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:30.492
It's like magic!

50
00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:33.892
Which means that you can find clams only at the water's edge?

51
00:04:33.892 --> 00:04:35.592
No, that's not it.

52
00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:37.792
When clams stick out their siphons,

53
00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:41.292
the clams make little holes called "eye of the clam".

54
00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.092
Moreover, clams are most times huddled together, so...

55
00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.592
Where there are a lot of those holes...

56
00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:50.092
If you dig gently about 10 to 15cm below

57
00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:53.592
without hurting the shell of the clams...

58
00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:55.992
See?

59
00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:58.092
There are quite a lot of them!

60
00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:06.692
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 1)"

61
00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:10.192
See? Huh?

62
00:05:10.192 --> 00:05:13.192
Where'd they...

63
00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:14.892
If you're wondering where they are...

64
00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:16.792
They're over there.

65
00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:21.692
Wow, super! They're coming out one after the other!

66
00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:24.192
Talk about great catch! Genta!

67
00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.192
I found the "eye of the clam"!

68
00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:30.792
If we had a bigger rake, we could probably pick enough to sell.

69
00:05:33.192 --> 00:05:35.592
We could open a fish shop!

70
00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:38.892
We could make big cash! Good idea!

71
00:05:38.892 --> 00:05:39.892
Yes!

72
00:05:39.892 --> 00:05:41.592
No!

73
00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:45.292
It's manners to use a rake that is within 15cm in width

74
00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:50.292
and only up to about 2kg per person.

75
00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:53.192
I mean they're short-necked clams, so it's better to be "short"!

76
00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:57.992
But, is everybody following the rule?

77
00:05:57.992 --> 00:06:01.992
The important thing is that each one of us keep that in mind!

78
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.392
Do you understand?

79
00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:06.692
Genta, you wouldn't like it either if too many eels are caught

80
00:06:06.692 --> 00:06:10.092
and wouldn't be able to eat eels over rice anymore, would you?

81
00:06:13.692 --> 00:06:14.892
That would be a problem!

82
00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:17.192
I don't ever want that to happen!

83
00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:18.692
Genta.

84
00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:23.192
See, nobody else is in a rush to take a whole lot for himself, right?

85
00:06:23.192 --> 00:06:25.992
The real purpose of clam digging

86
00:06:25.992 --> 00:06:29.392
is to enjoy looking for the shells that are buried under the sand.

87
00:06:29.392 --> 00:06:30.592
I see!

88
00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:33.592
Yes! I understand, yes!

89
00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:39.792
It seems that there are people who aren't enjoying themselves here too.

90
00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.092
See.

91
00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.892
I'll bet he can't find any clams.

92
00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:46.492
Should we tell him how to look for clams?

93
00:06:46.492 --> 00:06:47.892
Yeah!

94
00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:48.892
Hey, hey!

95
00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:51.292
Do you know about the "eye of the clam"?

96
00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:52.592
Yeah.

97
00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:54.792
If you dig below that hole...

98
00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:57.392
There'll be a lot of clams.

99
00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:00.092
"Tsuguo Ushigome (21)" -I dug up a lot of clams already.

100
00:07:00.092 --> 00:07:01.392
"College Student" -See.

101
00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.892
Then what are you sighing for?

102
00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:09.992
Why, why?

103
00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:13.792
I've got a lot of things on my mind.

104
00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:16.592
Hey, Ushigome!

105
00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:18.392
We bought lunches.

106
00:07:18.392 --> 00:07:19.892
And snacks too!

107
00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:24.992
Who're these kids?

108
00:07:24.992 --> 00:07:26.292
Do you know them?

109
00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.592
I just happened to meet them now.

110
00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:30.592
Who're you guys?

111
00:07:30.592 --> 00:07:32.792
We're...

112
00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:35.692
Members of the same university circle, called...

113
00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:37.992
Aiko-kai!

114
00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:40.692
So, what are you all devotees of?

115
00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:43.692
All four of you are wearing matching parkers.

116
00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:47.992
Are you guys planning to be comedians?

117
00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:53.392
No, it's written on the back of the parker, isn't it?

118
00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:55.092
"Clam Devotees Club!"

119
00:07:55.092 --> 00:07:57.792
Clam Devotees Club?

120
00:07:57.792 --> 00:08:01.392
In others words, we love to dig for and eat clams.

121
00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:02.992
All four of us!

122
00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:05.292
Well, this parker was made only today,

123
00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:07.792
and this is the first time we're wearing it!

124
00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:09.892
I see, the name of their club

125
00:08:09.892 --> 00:08:12.192
uses a play on words with the word clam.

126
00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:16.592
Well, let's start eating, Ushigome!

127
00:08:16.592 --> 00:08:19.292
Yeah, let's do that.

128
00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:23.792
See!

129
00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:28.092
I bought your favorite, Ushigome.

130
00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:31.992
Hey, Ushigome!

131
00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:33.092
Huh?

132
00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:35.292
Green tea!

133
00:08:36.892 --> 00:08:38.092
Here!

134
00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:40.892
Oh, thanks.

135
00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:42.192
Well...

136
00:08:42.892 --> 00:08:44.392
This one?

137
00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:47.892
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

138
00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:51.892
Thank you!

139
00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.292
And...

140
00:08:55.392 --> 00:08:57.192
Potato chips as a snack.

141
00:08:57.192 --> 00:08:58.592
Here you go!

142
00:08:58.592 --> 00:09:00.992
Oh, thank you, thank you!

143
00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:03.792
And? How're you doing digging clams?

144
00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:06.492
Oh, I got quite a lot!

145
00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.492
Wow, fantastic!

146
00:09:08.492 --> 00:09:09.492
Let me see.

147
00:09:09.492 --> 00:09:11.592
Just as expected of you, Ushigome!

148
00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.392
I'm getting kind of hungry.

149
00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:19.892
Here he goes again!

150
00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.992
We already ate a while ago, Genta.

151
00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:25.192
Let's go to the convenience store then.

152
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.592
Shall we go get some snacks?

153
00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.492
Yes! I'll go buy some then!

154
00:09:32.992 --> 00:09:34.192
Mitsuhiko,

155
00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:36.892
I'll bet you're planning to buy Yaiba chocolate in secret.

156
00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.392
Come on, Genta...

157
00:09:38.392 --> 00:09:40.492
I'll go too!

158
00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:41.692
Here.

159
00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:47.492
Then, why don't all three of you go together?

160
00:09:47.492 --> 00:09:50.592
Don't buy too many things you don't need now!

161
00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:51.792
Okay?

162
00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:57.192
And, be careful of cars!

163
00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:58.592
Okay!

164
00:09:58.592 --> 00:10:02.292
There seems to have been a hit-and-run accident near here the other day.

165
00:10:02.292 --> 00:10:05.092
So, be really careful!

166
00:10:07.592 --> 00:10:08.692
Okay!

167
00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:10.292
Yes, sir!

168
00:10:11.692 --> 00:10:13.892
I wonder if they'll be okay.

169
00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:16.992
Shall we start heading home?

170
00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:18.892
I guess so.

171
00:10:18.892 --> 00:10:21.192
We got a lot of clams too.

172
00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:23.992
Let's have a clam party and Ushigome's house!

173
00:10:23.992 --> 00:10:25.492
Okay then, Ushigome.

174
00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:27.992
We'll clean this place up

175
00:10:27.992 --> 00:10:31.792
so will you load the clams and make them spit out the sand?

176
00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:33.292
Hey, Ushigome?

177
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:37.992
Oh, that's right!

178
00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:41.692
I found this restaurant that serves good clam dishes the other day.

179
00:10:41.692 --> 00:10:43.692
So why don't we all go there?

180
00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:45.092
Oh, sounds great!

181
00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:46.292
Let's go! Let's go!

182
00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:49.492
Then let's have a drink at that restaurant tonight.

183
00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:51.792
And spend the night at Ushigome's house.

184
00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.492
We can put the clams that we got today in miso soup,

185
00:10:54.492 --> 00:10:55.792
for breakfast tomorrow.

186
00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:57.792
Right? What do you think?

187
00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:00.092
Ushigome?

188
00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:03.992
Ushigome?

189
00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:08.092
Yeah.

190
00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:09.892
Let's do that.

191
00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:28.692
Is something wrong with him?

192
00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:31.192
He seems a little depressed.

193
00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.492
-Not really. -It's nothing much.

194
00:11:34.492 --> 00:11:36.192
Clean up time, clean up time.

195
00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:37.292
Right.

196
00:11:41.092 --> 00:11:42.892
So...

197
00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:45.692
Make sure you separate the trash.

198
00:11:45.692 --> 00:11:46.692
Yes, yes.

199
00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:49.692
This bag is for the plastic bottles.

200
00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:51.492
Say...

201
00:11:51.492 --> 00:11:52.492
Yes?

202
00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:54.692
Just a while ago...

203
00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.092
There seemed to be a change in atmosphere.

204
00:11:58.092 --> 00:11:59.292
Yeah.

205
00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:04.792
Yaiba chocolates.

206
00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.492
Yaiba gummies.

207
00:12:10.092 --> 00:12:12.392
And, Yaiba snacks!

208
00:12:12.992 --> 00:12:14.892
What's this?

209
00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:18.392
They're all snacks that involve freebies for Masked Yaiba.

210
00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:19.792
So what?

211
00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:22.192
Genta insisted, so...

212
00:12:22.192 --> 00:12:24.792
No fair, Mitsuhiko!

213
00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:27.092
But, they're all good.

214
00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:29.892
By the way, the four people who were here a while ago...

215
00:12:29.892 --> 00:12:30.992
did they go home?

216
00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:33.492
Yeah. Just a while ago.

217
00:12:33.492 --> 00:12:37.292
They cleaned up all their trash nicely and left.

218
00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:41.092
They're pretty well-mannered for young people nowadays!

219
00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:42.292
No.

220
00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:45.792
It seems they forgot something important.

221
00:12:46.592 --> 00:12:51.192
-The rake? -But, how do you know it's theirs?

222
00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:53.992
There is no name on it.

223
00:12:53.992 --> 00:12:58.792
See, there's a brand new blackish stain on the wooden handle.

224
00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.492
This is probably a bloodstain.

225
00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:01.692
Blood?

226
00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:03.692
I see.

227
00:13:03.692 --> 00:13:05.892
The man that sighed.

228
00:13:05.892 --> 00:13:09.792
When we first met him, he had his index finger in his mouth.

229
00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:11.292
He may have cut his finger

230
00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:13.792
when he was trying to dig out a clam or something.

231
00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:17.292
You want to say that the handle of the rake go stained then, right?

232
00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:19.192
Well, sort of.

233
00:13:19.192 --> 00:13:21.392
Then, they could be looking for it now.

234
00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:24.692
Hey, Doc! When did the four leave?

235
00:13:24.692 --> 00:13:26.592
Like I said, just a while ago!

236
00:13:26.592 --> 00:13:29.992
They might still be at the parking lot then!

237
00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:31.692
Let's take it to them then!

238
00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:33.192
Yeah.

239
00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:34.892
Let's all go.

240
00:13:34.892 --> 00:13:36.092
Yeah!

241
00:13:36.092 --> 00:13:37.692
Give it to me, Conan!

242
00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:42.392
Hey! It may have been just a while ago, but it was 4 or 5 minutes ago.

243
00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:44.692
I'm sure they already left!

244
00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:47.092
The parking lot is huge.

245
00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.492
I'm sure they're still here!

246
00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:51.292
Where are they? Where?

247
00:13:53.892 --> 00:13:54.992
There they are!

248
00:13:54.992 --> 00:13:56.192
There!

249
00:13:56.192 --> 00:13:58.192
You forgot something.

250
00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:00.892
Hey!

251
00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:33.684
Clam digging?

252
00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:35.584
Which means that...

253
00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.884
After finishing digging clams,

254
00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:41.784
while you three were cleaning up the trash, he...

255
00:14:41.784 --> 00:14:43.784
Mr. Ushigome, came back to the car before all of you

256
00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:47.884
with the buckets of clams that you took.

257
00:14:47.884 --> 00:14:52.084
And when you all came back to the car, you found him like this.

258
00:14:54.384 --> 00:14:55.984
Yes, that's right.

259
00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:59.084
The mouth of the victim smells of almond

260
00:14:59.084 --> 00:15:02.084
and judging from this bottle of green tea

261
00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:05.484
that was found on the ground beside him...

262
00:15:07.184 --> 00:15:11.284
It seems that Mr. Ushigome died of poisoning by cyanic acid

263
00:15:11.284 --> 00:15:14.484
that was mixed into his green tea.

264
00:15:14.484 --> 00:15:15.884
Which means...

265
00:15:15.884 --> 00:15:17.084
Just as I thought...

266
00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.484
Is it suicide?

267
00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:21.484
Oh! What do you mean by just as I thought?

268
00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:23.184
Do you have something in mind?

269
00:15:23.184 --> 00:15:26.084
It's not that.

270
00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:29.384
He seems to have been troubled over something lately.

271
00:15:29.384 --> 00:15:31.984
He wasn't all that cheerful.

272
00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:34.984
I don't know what he was troubled over though.

273
00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:36.584
Shoko, do you have any idea?

274
00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:38.384
No, I don't.

275
00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:42.084
But, judging from the way he was acting...

276
00:15:42.084 --> 00:15:44.384
Suicide is possible.

277
00:15:44.384 --> 00:15:46.984
I guess so.

278
00:15:46.984 --> 00:15:52.084
Or taking advantage of Mr. Ushigome acting as he was,

279
00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.484
someone poisoned his green tea.

280
00:15:54.484 --> 00:15:57.784
Someone among you inserted poison.

281
00:15:57.784 --> 00:15:59.684
It's one or the other!

282
00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:01.884
What are you insinuating?

283
00:16:01.884 --> 00:16:04.584
We didn't do such a thing.

284
00:16:04.584 --> 00:16:05.884
And?

285
00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:08.784
Who's the one that bought this tea?

286
00:16:08.784 --> 00:16:11.284
All three of us bought it at the convenience store.

287
00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:14.584
He said that he hadn't eaten anything for breakfast so...

288
00:16:14.584 --> 00:16:16.684
We bought rice balls and snacks along with it too.

289
00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:20.884
Then, did Mr. Ushigome take the green tea out of the plastic bag himself?

290
00:16:20.884 --> 00:16:22.684
-No. -Huh?

291
00:16:22.684 --> 00:16:26.084
I handed it over to him.

292
00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:30.584
But, he looked just fine for a while and was gulping down the tea.

293
00:16:30.584 --> 00:16:31.984
What about that?

294
00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:36.084
Did anybody touch the PET bottle while he was drinking from it?

295
00:16:36.084 --> 00:16:38.484
The only time we touched it is when we bought it.

296
00:16:38.484 --> 00:16:41.184
Ushigome had it with him right through.

297
00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:43.184
I don't think anybody touched it.

298
00:16:43.184 --> 00:16:47.284
All I did was throw the rice balls at him and give it to him.

299
00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:49.984
A salmon, codfish roe and pickled apricot rice ball!

300
00:16:52.784 --> 00:16:53.884
Thank you!

301
00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:58.284
I opened a bag of potato chips and put it near him.

302
00:16:58.284 --> 00:17:00.184
But, didn't touch the green tea even once.

303
00:17:00.184 --> 00:17:01.584
Here! For you!

304
00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:04.084
Oh, thanks!

305
00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:07.284
But somebody could've done something in a really short span of time.

306
00:17:07.284 --> 00:17:08.684
Oh, no.

307
00:17:08.684 --> 00:17:12.684
They're telling the truth!

308
00:17:12.684 --> 00:17:14.684
I was watching all the time.

309
00:17:14.684 --> 00:17:17.184
After Mr. Ushigome opened the bottle,

310
00:17:17.184 --> 00:17:20.584
nobody besides Mr. Ushigome touched it!

311
00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:26.184
Brat. You're the one that's with Smokey Kogoro all the time.

312
00:17:26.184 --> 00:17:29.584
Smokey? It's Sleeping!

313
00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:32.784
Then, don't tell me that the detective with the flimsy mustache

314
00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:34.484
is also here?

315
00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:36.484
-Where is he? -He's not here!

316
00:17:37.584 --> 00:17:38.884
Really?

317
00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:42.584
But, my friends are here with me today!

318
00:17:42.584 --> 00:17:44.384
Conan!

319
00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:46.984
I brought Doc!

320
00:17:49.184 --> 00:17:50.784
Please tell him too, Doc,

321
00:17:50.784 --> 00:17:54.484
that Mr. Ushigome was holding his bottle of green tea all the while.

322
00:17:54.484 --> 00:17:57.884
Oh, okay.

323
00:17:59.084 --> 00:18:04.384
He didn't give the bottle of tea to anyone while he was drinking it.

324
00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:07.984
Are you sure you were watching closely?

325
00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:09.284
I'm sure.

326
00:18:09.284 --> 00:18:10.984
I met him together with the children

327
00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:13.384
for the first time today at the beach.

328
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:17.884
But, since he was sighing all the while, I was a bit worried.

329
00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:19.284
Sighing?

330
00:18:19.284 --> 00:18:21.184
Inspector!

331
00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:24.884
This bottle was found by the feet of the body!

332
00:18:28.784 --> 00:18:30.184
Is that so?

333
00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:31.684
Let me see.

334
00:18:33.084 --> 00:18:36.684
Not pills but powder seems to have been inside.

335
00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:40.284
There seems have cyanic poisoning in the bottle.

336
00:18:40.284 --> 00:18:41.284
That's...

337
00:18:41.284 --> 00:18:45.584
That bottle is what Ushigome used to put supplement capsules inside.

338
00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:48.184
I hope you're telling the truth.

339
00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:49.684
No mistake about it.

340
00:18:49.684 --> 00:18:51.984
I used to see him use it all the time.

341
00:18:51.984 --> 00:18:53.284
I see.

342
00:18:53.284 --> 00:18:56.084
-Forensic officer! -Yes, sir!

343
00:18:56.084 --> 00:18:59.284
Please check this bottle together with the PET bottle and the cap!

344
00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:00.984
Yes, sir!

345
00:19:00.984 --> 00:19:02.884
Then, I'm counting on you.

346
00:19:02.884 --> 00:19:04.484
But at that time...

347
00:19:04.484 --> 00:19:06.084
What is it, brats?

348
00:19:06.084 --> 00:19:08.184
Did you recall something that bothers you?

349
00:19:08.184 --> 00:19:10.484
Oh, no. It's just...

350
00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:13.584
Will you try smiling a bit?

351
00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:17.684
What did you just say?

352
00:19:17.684 --> 00:19:19.984
Because you look so much like him.

353
00:19:19.984 --> 00:19:23.584
The coral headed police officer that we know!

354
00:19:23.584 --> 00:19:24.884
Hi!

355
00:19:24.884 --> 00:19:26.684
Hope you're all well!

356
00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:30.184
Of course they look alike!

357
00:19:30.184 --> 00:19:33.684
He's Officer Yokomizo's younger brother.

358
00:19:34.984 --> 00:19:37.484
For real?

359
00:19:37.484 --> 00:19:39.784
Come to think of it, my older brother told me that.

360
00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:41.784
The boy staying with Smokey Kogoro.

361
00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:43.284
It's Sleeping.

362
00:19:43.284 --> 00:19:44.784
The one wearing glasses...

363
00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:46.284
One wearing glasses?

364
00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:49.784
...is hanging around some kids who think they're detectives!

365
00:19:49.784 --> 00:19:52.484
What? We don't think!

366
00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.584
We are the Youth Detective Squad!

367
00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.084
Right!

368
00:19:56.084 --> 00:19:58.484
His face and voice resemble his brother

369
00:19:58.484 --> 00:19:59.584
but the way he talks and his personality

370
00:19:59.584 --> 00:20:01.584
seems to be the opposite of his brother's.

371
00:20:01.584 --> 00:20:03.884
Yeah. It seems so.

372
00:20:03.884 --> 00:20:06.984
Unfortunately, I guess you, the Detective Squad's

373
00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:08.684
not needed for this case.

374
00:20:08.684 --> 00:20:09.984
Huh?

375
00:20:09.984 --> 00:20:11.284
What do you mean?

376
00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:14.584
The situation is, that no one has touched the PET bottle,

377
00:20:14.584 --> 00:20:17.384
and a container which seems to have had poison in it

378
00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.184
was found in the car.

379
00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:22.984
Moreover, the victim was troubled enough to let out a sigh.

380
00:20:22.984 --> 00:20:25.084
So, this is undoubtedly suicide!

381
00:20:27.084 --> 00:20:29.884
So, go! You kids go on home!

382
00:20:29.884 --> 00:20:32.284
You're getting in the way!

383
00:20:32.284 --> 00:20:34.084
What's the big deal, younger brother of Yokomizo?

384
00:20:34.084 --> 00:20:35.884
Let's not get stingy!

385
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:39.484
Is this cap really the cap for that PET bottle?

386
00:20:39.484 --> 00:20:40.784
Yeah.

387
00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:43.284
This was the only cap found in the car.

388
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:47.184
Moreover, the tea on the inside of the cap is not dried yet.

389
00:20:47.984 --> 00:20:50.184
And the brand is a match.

390
00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.984
But, isn't that strange?

391
00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:54.984
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

392
00:20:54.984 --> 00:20:57.384
but there's nothing on the cap.

393
00:20:58.284 --> 00:20:59.884
True.

394
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.284
What? Hey, hey, how come there was blood on it?

395
00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:04.684
I wonder.

396
00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:06.784
Oh, that's probably because...

397
00:21:06.784 --> 00:21:08.784
Ushigome...

398
00:21:08.784 --> 00:21:12.184
Ushigome hurt his finger.

399
00:21:12.184 --> 00:21:13.484
Hurt?

400
00:21:13.484 --> 00:21:16.284
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

401
00:21:16.284 --> 00:21:18.084
when he was digging clams.

402
00:21:18.084 --> 00:21:21.584
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

403
00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:24.684
It's probably true that he was hurt.

404
00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:28.884
When we first met him, Mr. Ushigome had his finger in his mouth.

405
00:21:28.884 --> 00:21:31.284
That's how we figured out the blood-stained rake

406
00:21:31.284 --> 00:21:35.284
that was left behind on the beach belonged to that chubby mister.

407
00:21:35.284 --> 00:21:37.584
And, came to return it to him.

408
00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:40.284
And, ended up seeing this!

409
00:21:45.084 --> 00:21:46.684
I see.

410
00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:50.884
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

411
00:21:50.884 --> 00:21:53.784
Although the blood looks dry.

412
00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:56.684
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

413
00:21:56.684 --> 00:22:00.384
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

414
00:22:00.384 --> 00:22:03.784
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

415
00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:05.784
he noticed the blood on it

416
00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:09.184
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

417
00:22:09.984 --> 00:22:14.584
But would a person who is about to commit suicide do such a thing?

418
00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.584
I think he wanted to leave without leaving any bad traces behind.

419
00:22:16.584 --> 00:22:18.984
He might want to die nice and clean.

420
00:22:18.984 --> 00:22:21.184
At any rate, let's wait from results from the forensic officer.

421
00:22:21.184 --> 00:22:24.584
Until then, I'll have to have you all wait.

422
00:22:24.584 --> 00:22:26.084
Yeah, okay.

423
00:22:26.084 --> 00:22:27.484
I guess we have no choice.

424
00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:28.584
Yeah.

425
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:06.384
This is suicide, suicide!

426
00:24:06.384 --> 00:24:07.584
It bothers me.

427
00:24:07.584 --> 00:24:09.684
The remark that the person made.

428
00:24:10.184 --> 00:24:12.484
I wonder if it's really suicide.

429
00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:17.384
I admire your deduction is what I'd like to say to you but...

430
00:24:17.384 --> 00:24:21.884
Just when and how could somebody have inserted the poison?

431
00:24:21.884 --> 00:24:24.584
This will bring everything to light.

432
00:24:24.584 --> 00:24:27.484
And, just who made the one who did it do it!

433
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:29.384
Next Conan,

434
00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:33.384
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 2)"

435
00:24:49.084 --> 00:24:50.984
Next Conan's Hint:

436
00:24:50.984 --> 00:24:53.184
"The cap of the PET bottle"

437
00:24:53.184 --> 00:24:55.384
Say "clam digging-sigh" three times.

438
00:24:55.384 --> 00:24:58.288
Clam dig in sigh.
