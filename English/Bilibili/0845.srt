1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,670
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,770
Thanks to all of you,

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,970
Detective Conan will be going on air for the 22nd year.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,470
No fair, Conan.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,870
Let us greet the viewers too!

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,970
Last year,

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,970
you greeted the viewers together with Mr. Ebizo, just the two of you!

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,070
Well, the bottom line is

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,170
I think it's best we all do the New Year's greeting together, right?

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,670
Okay.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,670
Here we go once more.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,070
Happy New Year!

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,370
Detective Conan and the Detective Squad

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,070
ask for your continued support in the year 2017 too!

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,370
Thank you very much!

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,470
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,670
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,470
Conan will give it his all this year too!

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,070
But where is this? Trouble occurs!

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,670
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,270
His name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,628
What on earth?

24
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:13,228
Why am I in a place like this?

25
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:22,328
"Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 1)"

26
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:28,828
I see.

27
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:31,228
It's obviously been cracked opened.

28
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:34,228
"Asada Law Firm" -You realized this morning?

29
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,228
"Kimihiko Asada (55)" -Yes.

30
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:40,928
"Lawyer" -But I was up all night last night working here,

31
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,528
so I think it was broken into

32
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:47,828
during the 1 to 2 hours that I went home to take a short nap.

33
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,228
I see.

34
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,028
And, what was in the safe?

35
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:55,028
I don't think it was money

36
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,328
because instead of calling the police,

37
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:01,228
you went out of your way to call me.

38
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:03,328
Fantastic, Mr. Mouri.

39
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,328
Yes, it wasn't money.

40
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,328
It was the will.

41
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,628
I see.

42
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:13,028
-I know who the perp is. -What?

43
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:17,128
But we don't want to report it to the police.

44
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,128
I see.

45
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,628
Okay.

46
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,428
My eyes are getting used to the dark.

47
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,928
This is...

48
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:28,828
in a box?

49
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:32,828
But why would I be in a place like this?

50
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,028
My cell phone!

51
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,628
There it is!

52
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,128
It's by my feet, my cell phone.

53
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,928
Just a bit more.

54
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:52,828
Conan's not answering.

55
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:54,928
His phone won't connect either.

56
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,928
Maybe he went to eat something on his own?

57
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,728
I'm hungry.

58
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:04,028
Conan's not like you, Genta.

59
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:07,228
But the sale's already begun.

60
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,828
What shall we do?

61
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,428
Don't hang up. Don't hang up, guys.

62
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:17,328
Darn!

63
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,328
Just what do you mean?

64
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,428
You say you know who the perp is,

65
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:24,128
but you don't want to notify the police?

66
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:28,928
That's because we want to avoid a scandal no matter what.

67
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,328
For the sake of the late chairman too.

68
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:33,028
The late chairman?

69
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:38,528
You're referring to the leader of the Karahashi group

70
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,728
that you serve as a legal advisor for, Mr. Gotaro Karahashi?

71
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:44,528
Didn't he die of an illness three days ago?

72
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:47,828
Yes. So after the funeral today,

73
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:54,528
we were supposed to publicize the contents of the will.

74
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,828
And, that was stolen.

75
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,028
Which means that

76
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:03,028
something that didn't favor the perp was written there?

77
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:06,528
It was 10 days before he died.

78
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:07,728
I was called by the chairman

79
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:10,128
to come to the hospital where he was hospitalized.

80
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,828
He said that he wanted to re-write the will.

81
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:14,928
I see.

82
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:17,328
I got the new game!

83
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:19,228
I wonder if Conan's not here yet.

84
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,628
I feel sorry for him if he can't buy the game.

85
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,528
-Yeah. -Don't worry,

86
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,328
because there were still a lot stacked up.

87
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:30,128
I can't take it anymore. This is it!

88
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,328
I'm going to get something to eat!

89
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:35,328
That's right. It's them.

90
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,228
I went out with them this morning.

91
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,428
Try to remember from the start.

92
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,528
Good morning, Conan!

93
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,728
Good morning.

94
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,928
This morning we met each other

95
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:50,928
to go buy a new game software.

96
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,928
On the way there, I...

97
00:06:54,928 --> 00:07:00,628
And what was written in the will before?

98
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:04,028
Since his wife died 10 years ago...

99
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,228
"Karahashi group"

100
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:06,528
His oldest son,

101
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:10,528
"Kozo" -Kozo Karahashi was to receive 50% of his assets.

102
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,428
The remaining assets were to be divided between

103
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:14,328
"Mitsuyo" -his oldest daughter Mitsuyo

104
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:17,128
"Eisuke" -and his second son Eisuke.

105
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,028
And how was he planning to change it?

106
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,528
The thing is,

107
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:24,628
the chairman had a secretary who served him for 50 years.

108
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:28,028
He wanted to give his entire inheritance over to her.

109
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:32,828
So probably that woman must be...

110
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,128
Yes.

111
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:37,528
She was also privately intimate with the chairman.

112
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,428
As they usually say...

113
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:42,628
She was his lover?

114
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,528
Yes. Well...

115
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,028
she's fallen ill

116
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:51,628
and is resting in a hospital in her hometown now.

117
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,628
I see.

118
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:57,628
And... Right, I think it was over there.

119
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,628
Hurry up, hurry up.

120
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,628
That's...

121
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,728
What's the matter, Conan?

122
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:12,428
We'd better hurry or the sale will start.

123
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:16,628
Let's hurry and buy it so we can eat!

124
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,228
You guys go on ahead.

125
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,428
Conan?

126
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,028
Where are you going?

127
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,228
What's with you anyway?

128
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,728
I thought so.

129
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:37,528
What? You mean Conan's not here yet?

130
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,628
Nope.

131
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,428
No.

132
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:44,528
I'm sure he went to eat lunch by himself after all.

133
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:47,828
There are still two hours to go before lunch.

134
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,728
But really, I wonder what happened to him?

135
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:55,328
I'm worried, so I'll have Ai check on him after all.

136
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,828
Edogawa?

137
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,228
Okay. I'll try tracking his cell phone GPS.

138
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,728
No signal?

139
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:05,828
If so...

140
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,728
Oh, no.

141
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:14,228
The spare glasses are out for a tune-up with Doc.

142
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,128
"Mouri"

143
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:19,028
Yes, Mouri Detective Agency.

144
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,528
Oh, Ai?

145
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,928
What? Conan? He's not home yet.

146
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:26,828
Isn't he with you?

147
00:09:26,828 --> 00:09:31,328
No, because I'm not interested in the games they have nowadays.

148
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:34,328
Then if Edogawa calls you,

149
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:36,228
please tell him to call me.

150
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:38,528
What? What do you mean?

151
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:40,828
Oh, wait, Ai.

152
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:43,628
Right. That's right.

153
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:44,828
I remember now!

154
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,328
"Asada Law Firm"

155
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,428
"Integrity"

156
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,628
A safecracker?

157
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:03,128
I'm being transported somewhere.

158
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,828
Where...

159
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,028
What's this smell?

160
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:13,228
Maybe incense?

161
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,728
Dry ice?

162
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:24,428
Don't tell me this is inside a coffin.

163
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:28,428
Was I buried?

164
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,295
Ai!

165
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:41,995
You came.

166
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:44,795
I had no choice since the cell phone didn't connect.

167
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:48,195
But I think we should contact the police too.

168
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:52,195
But all the members of the Detective Squad are here.

169
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:55,195
Why don't we try a search for him ourselves to start?

170
00:11:55,195 --> 00:12:00,395
He could've just gone to eat lunch by himself too, that Conan!

171
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:05,295
And where did you all leave him?

172
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:06,795
This way!

173
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:12,695
Is this draft?

174
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,995
Which means I'm not buried.

175
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,095
If so...

176
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:24,495
Somebody! Is anybody around?

177
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,795
No good.

178
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,295
Then...

179
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,395
It's that!

180
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:38,795
Just a little bit more.

181
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:41,895
Just a bit more!

182
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,995
I'm sure it was here, Ai.

183
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,095
Yes!

184
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:49,195
It was here that Conan suddenly said,

185
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:52,495
"You guys go on ahead."

186
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:56,395
There are no eel or hamburger shops here.

187
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:58,095
You know.

188
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:01,795
Maybe he saw or found something.

189
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,095
What?

190
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:04,695
That's what we're going to look for.

191
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,095
Let's split up. We're going to search

192
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:10,095
on this side and that side by moving on slowly.

193
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:13,495
The Detective Squad is on the go!

194
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,095
-Aye! -Aye!

195
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,095
I'm starved.

196
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:24,495
-Come on, let's go, Genta. -Sorry about that.

197
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:30,495
"Gotaro Karahashi Funeral"

198
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,495
"Kozo Karahashi (38)" -Kogoro Mouri?

199
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,995
"Eldest Son of the Karahashi Family" -You mean that famed detective?

200
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:45,795
Since this is quite a serious matter

201
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,995
and we don't have time to spare,

202
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,495
I insisted on him to take the job.

203
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:54,695
So as he introduced me,

204
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:58,495
I am the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

205
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,095
Nice to meet you.

206
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,395
"Mitsuyo Karahashi (32)" -A detective?

207
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,095
"Eldest Daughter of the Karahashi Family" -What is the meaning of this?

208
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:09,995
It's like you're saying that the perp that stole the will is among us.

209
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,095
"Eisuke Karahashi (28)" -Stop playing dumb.

210
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:15,295
"Second Son of the Karahashi Family" -Of course,

211
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,695
the perp's among us.

212
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:22,395
So, who's the perp?

213
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,195
You know who it is already, don't you? Famed detective?

214
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:29,395
No, well...

215
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:32,095
What's that look, Eisuke?

216
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,195
You're the one who's playing dumb, aren't you?

217
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:36,895
What the hell are you talking about?

218
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:37,995
Cut out your attitude!

219
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,295
You want to fight? You jerk!

220
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,895
Stop it, both of you!

221
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:45,095
This is no time for something like this!

222
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:48,395
Talk about stupid.

223
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:52,395
The one who was really upset about the will being re-written

224
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:55,295
was none other than you, right, Kozo?

225
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,495
What?

226
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,095
Mitsuyo, talk for yourself.

227
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:01,695
I'll bet you were pissed about the original will too.

228
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,295
Because you didn't think your share was good enough.

229
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,395
Yes.

230
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,595
That goes for Eisuke too.

231
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,595
I wasn't as affected as you guys!

232
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,495
-What? -What?

233
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,195
What do you want?

234
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,995
Mr. Mouri...

235
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,195
Please calm down, everyone.

236
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:26,295
Your father's funeral will be starting soon.

237
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:33,695
So, I'll be telling you the details later is what I'd like to say,

238
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:37,095
but I have one thing I'd like to clarify.

239
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:41,395
Where were all of you this morning?

240
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:45,395
And can you back it up?

241
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,495
See, he's checking our alibis already!

242
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:49,995
Interesting!

243
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,695
I tell you.

244
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,195
You mean you're happy being treated like a criminal?

245
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:56,995
He's always been that way.

246
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,795
And, who do you want to start with, famed detective?

247
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:04,795
Let's start with you, the oldest, Kozo.

248
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:05,995
That was your name, correct?

249
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:10,495
Would you tell us where you were this morning?

250
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,495
Of course I was home at that time.

251
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,395
That's right!

252
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,895
I was suddenly awakened by his phone call!

253
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,695
Really?

254
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,095
If you're a famed detective,

255
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,095
I'm sure you can get the police or telephone company

256
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:25,495
to verify it for you.

257
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:30,095
It's for sure that I got a call from him early this morning.

258
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:31,495
At home?

259
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,195
Not on your cell phone?

260
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:38,395
Yeah. Only, I don't know where he called from though.

261
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,895
I called from my home,

262
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:43,895
after the call from big sis woke me up.

263
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:47,195
I see. You called from home phone too?

264
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:51,395
Only, I don't know where she called me from.

265
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:55,095
She complained about not liking the way the funeral was being organized.

266
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,495
I couldn't take it, so I called Kozo.

267
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,395
But big sis came in on catch phone while we were talking.

268
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:02,695
Just because you're the oldest,

269
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,695
you organized all of the funeral on your own,

270
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:05,895
but I figured that

271
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:08,295
Dad wouldn't be able to rest in peace the way you went about it!

272
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,995
What?

273
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,595
And, I'll tell you before you even ask me,

274
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:14,895
but I called from the home phone too.

275
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,595
You too?

276
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,895
I only use my cell phone when I'm not at home.

277
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:23,295
Why don't you check on it, Mr. Famed Detective?

278
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,195
Is that right?

279
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:29,895
That's right,

280
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,095
if there's a nail or something sticking out,

281
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,895
I can hook the rope on and cut the rope.

282
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:37,195
Darn. I can't see too well.

283
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,395
That's it!

284
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:53,195
Okay, over here.

285
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,895
Come over this way.

286
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:59,895
Looking at how confident they are...

287
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,095
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

288
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:06,895
Yes, of course I'll verify what they said later,

289
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,295
but they probably...

290
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,295
Our alibis have been established?

291
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,795
I wonder. You never know.

292
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:13,895
Yeah,

293
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:17,295
because maybe someone was paid to do it.

294
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,095
If so, I'm safe!

295
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:21,195
I don't have that kind of money.

296
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:23,195
Unlike you.

297
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,995
Oh, really?

298
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,995
You can pay after inheriting the money, can't you?

299
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:30,795
That goes for you too.

300
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:34,195
You guys look suspicious after all.

301
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,195
Look who's talking. You seem the most suspicious to me.

302
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:40,195
-What do you mean? Gosh, this is annoying. -You are a nut.

303
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,195
I did it!

304
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:56,395
It's broken.

305
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:57,495
Then...

306
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:14,195
How is it? Did you find him?

307
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:18,295
"Eel" -It sure looks good.

308
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,295
He's not on this side!

309
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,395
I wonder where Conan is.

310
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,995
Maybe we should report this to the police after all?

311
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,395
Wait a sec!

312
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,895
Okay!

313
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,695
A car? Which means,

314
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:49,395
judging from the way the sound is echoing,

315
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:50,795
this is inside a building?

316
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:53,595
No, it could be the basement parking lot!

317
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,495
Wait a sec!

318
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,795
Wait!

319
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:14,195
Wait, don't go!

320
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,795
Wait!

321
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,095
Hey!

322
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:24,695
No good. Darn!

323
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:26,395
Repairing the lock?

324
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,295
It seems that the resident of the building

325
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,095
called him early this morning.

326
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,495
Is that what Conan saw?

327
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:36,295
Maybe there's a really delicious diner inside or something.

328
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,995
I mean, I guess not.

329
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,095
I wonder if it was a thief.

330
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:43,795
I don't think he was informed of anything like that,

331
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,295
but it's possible.

332
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:48,995
Maybe we should contact the police.

333
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:57,795
Ai?

334
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:00,395
Oh, Dad.

335
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:02,495
What? A funeral?

336
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:03,795
From now?

337
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,595
-Conan? -Conan?

338
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:06,795
Where on earth are you?

339
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:09,295
Stop shouting.

340
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:12,895
I don't know either, where this is?

341
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:15,595
I don't seem to be buried, but...

342
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,195
What do you mean?

343
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:24,495
From the size, I think I'm in a coffin.

344
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:27,295
A wooden board's been placed on a stack of folded cardboard boxes,

345
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:29,195
to create a double bottom.

346
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:33,495
I'm in the lower bottom space.

347
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,995
Which means that...

348
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:40,295
somebody's body is right above me?

349
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,395
What's this?

350
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,395
What?

351
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:54,095
Darn.

352
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:56,995
No good.

353
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:58,795
And where are you guys now?

354
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,995
We followed your tracks

355
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,495
and are now at the backdoor of the building.

356
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:05,395
Yeah, yeah!

357
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:07,995
There was a burglary in this building and...

358
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:19,195
It... it's moving?

359
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:23,795
Which means I'm in a car.

360
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:27,695
A car with a coffin in it?

361
00:22:27,695 --> 00:22:29,395
Don't tell me...

362
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,495
that this is a hearse?

363
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,395
"Next Episode" -I'm in a double bottom coffin

364
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,495
and above me...

365
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:00,995
is someone else's corpse.

366
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,195
Where's Conan?

367
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,595
-We found him! -Really?

368
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,395
He's in a hearse now!

369
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:11,395
A hearse?

370
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,395
What?

371
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:16,195
Conan is in a coffin?

372
00:24:16,195 --> 00:24:18,895
The will is in there too?

373
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:20,295
Next Conan,

374
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:24,295
"Conan Cornered in the Darkness (Part 2)"

375
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:27,638
Next Conan's Hint:

376
00:24:27,638 --> 00:24:29,238
"Hearse"

377
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,138
Bummers! 30 minutes in the dark.

378
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,538
Every night comes to an end.

379
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,038
Shut up.
