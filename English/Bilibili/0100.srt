1
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:05,573
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,393
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:11,153
Today is Conan's 100th episode!
My first love is about to be found out!

4
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:12,773
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:14,783
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:16,823
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:02,444
"The Memories of
First Love Case (Part 1)."

8
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:09,764
Thanks for offering to clean
Shinichi's house, Ran-kun.

9
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:13,134
It's no problem!
We have nothing to do anyway!

10
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,694
"We"?

11
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:17,594
Don't decide these things on your own!

12
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:21,304
But it will turn into a
ghost house if we don't clean it...

13
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:22,364
Oh well.

14
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:29,474
Shinichi must be happy to have
such a thoughtful girlfriend as you!

15
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,014
You're so silly!

16
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,834
Don't you agree, Conan-kun?

17
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,174
Y-Yeah.

18
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,044
You jerk...

19
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:38,924
Well, we're off, Doc!

20
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:40,514
Okay! We're counting on you!

21
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:41,974
Right!

22
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:44,134
You'll pay for this.

23
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:53,274
You're not thinking of cleaning
the entire house, are you, Ran?

24
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:56,484
Well, let's do as much
as we can for today.

25
00:02:56,724 --> 00:03:00,324
Eh? Does that mean we're
going to clean all day?

26
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,284
Yeah. That's the plan.

27
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:05,754
Oh, geez...

28
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,204
Sheesh!

29
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:14,844
How did Sonoko-sama get stuck
cleaning Shinichi-kun's house

30
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,424
on such a nice Sunday?

31
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:20,884
You could've just ignored it,
yet you went and got Doc's spare key!

32
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,804
Sorry! I just figured
the place was covered in dust

33
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,884
and that it'd be hard to clean alone...

34
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,014
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:36,424
Oh, Sonoko. You should dust
the bookcases before sweeping.

36
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,194
Eh?

37
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,384
It's like they say, you should
clean from the top down.

38
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:43,744
Plus, you're supposed to follow
the tiles when sweeping the floor!

39
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,074
You sound like such an old hag...

40
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,174
Girls these days are supposed
to be crazy about catching men

41
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:55,504
and experiencing pure love,
first love, and all that...

42
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:59,214
Yet here I am, getting covered
in dust for that mystery dweeb...

43
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:02,174
I'm oh-so-pathetic.

44
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,634
So sorry for the trouble, you two!

45
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,974
Say. Speaking of first love...

46
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,014
Yeah?

47
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:13,774
What do you suppose
Shinichi's first love was like?

48
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:14,564
Eh?

49
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:19,514
He must've had a love or two by now!

50
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:25,224
I dunno. He's super-dull in the head
when it comes to things like that.

51
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:31,204
But, given his hot mother,
it was probably a TV idol, or...

52
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:37,384
Come to think of it, you've always
been together since you were kids.

53
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,514
Y-Yeah...

54
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:41,424
What's more,
you're thoughtful and strong...

55
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:45,884
Who knows,
maybe you're his first love!

56
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:46,674
Eh?!

57
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,134
Hey, now!

58
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:53,514
Yeah, right! We only played
together when we were kids!

59
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,934
But then there's your precedent, too.

60
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,904
Huh? Isn't Shinichi-kun your first love?

61
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,094
H-Hold on! Don't make stuff up!

62
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:10,534
Oh? Your bashfulness says
otherwise, Girl of Twenty Faces.

63
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:14,244
Knock it off, Sonoko! Before I get mad!

64
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:16,704
S-Seriously?

65
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:18,924
Huh? Who could that be?

66
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:21,844
You're so dumb!
It's obviously Shinichi-kun!

67
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,844
No, I kind of doubt that.

68
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,724
Why would he ring the
doorbell to his own house?

69
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,804
He probably heard about us from
the doc and wants to surprise us!

70
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:32,764
It's not me...

71
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:36,684
B-But Shinichi didn't say
anything about coming home...

72
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:40,444
What're you so embarrassed about?
Hurry and see him!

73
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,924
He's your first love prince, isn't he?

74
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:47,104
I'm telling you, it's not like that!

75
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:48,394
Oh?

76
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,034
Are you a friend of Kudo-kun?

77
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:52,744
Y-Yes...

78
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:55,674
Huh?! Isn't she...

79
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:00,054
Umm, are you Asami-senpai?

80
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:00,954
Yes.

81
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:03,174
You know her, Sonoko?

82
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:04,674
What are you saying?

83
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:08,344
She was student body president
during our first year of middle school!

84
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:10,374
Uchida Asami (18) Toto Univ. Literature Dept., 1st Year
You know! Uchida Asami-senpai!

85
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,764
Uchida Asami (18) Toto Univ. Literature Dept., 1st Year

86
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:17,264
Oh. So Kudo-kun has been
away for a while on some cases?

87
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:20,554
So that's why I always
got the answering machine.

88
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:24,014
I'm sorry, it's almost like
I've asked you to clean...

89
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:26,574
It's no problem at all!
I had nothing else to do!

90
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:29,784
Anyways, Senpai. Why did you
want to see Shinichi-kun?

91
00:06:30,844 --> 00:06:36,174
My friends in the university's
mystery club are going to rent a lodge

92
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:38,494
and hold a birthday
party for me this weekend.

93
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:42,644
I really wanted to invite Kudo-kun.

94
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:48,424
Seeing as he's a great detective
and an old soccer club teammate.

95
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:52,724
But I sent the letter quite a while back...

96
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:55,844
Did he say anything before he left home?

97
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:56,934
Not really...

98
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:59,354
Oh no! I forgot!

99
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:04,174
Oh. I was sure he would come.

100
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,324
I wonder if he forgot about
that confession four years ago...

101
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,784
Confession?

102
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:13,514
Though I guess I can't
blame him for forgetting.

103
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:19,084
First loves are bound
to fade away with time...

104
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,794
F-First love?!

105
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:22,514
Eh?!

106
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:28,634
She was Shinichi's first love?

107
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:33,154
Now I get it. It all makes sense.

108
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:37,094
Everyone was talking about
it our first year of middle school.

109
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,814
Supposedly a first-year boy
made a pass at Asami-senpai.

110
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:43,594
So that daredevil was
actually Kudo Shinichi, huh?!

111
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:47,444
It wasn't like that.
It was an actual confession.

112
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:48,864
Uh oh!

113
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,824
And then it--

114
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,284
Uhh, say!

115
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,514
If Shinichi-niichan won't go,
why not ask someone else?

116
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:58,494
That's an idea.

117
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,304
Then how about us?

118
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:05,674
We've solved a few cases
ourselves, you know!

119
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:06,964
Hold on, Sonoko!

120
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:11,674
Come on! We might be able
to catch some lively Toto boys!

121
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:16,974
Yes. I think my male friends would
love having high school girls attend.

122
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:21,054
Plus, if you invite us, there's
no question that he'll come too!

123
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:22,444
"He"?

124
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,644
S-Sonoko! You don't mean...

125
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:28,974
Yep! The great detective
who needs no introduction!

126
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,444
A get-together of Toto
University's mystery study club?

127
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:36,054
Forget it!

128
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:39,114
I can't allow you to go to a
sleepover without any real adults!

129
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,594
But you're invited too, Dad.

130
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:45,584
I'm busy! I don't have
time to mess with stuff like that!

131
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:54,304
Yeah. As a great detective,
you can't relax on a weekend.

132
00:08:54,804 --> 00:09:02,474
But for the mystery study club,
Mori Kogoro-san is almost like a god.

133
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:06,764
How they'd all like to
hear from the peerless detective!

134
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:09,764
Not to mention all the
pretty girls who'll be there,

135
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,524
including Uchida Asami-senpai,
who holds the title of Miss Toto!

136
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:14,444
M-Miss Toto?

137
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:20,514
But if you're busy,
we'll accept that we can't go either...

138
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,514
Well, I'm sure I can somehow
rearrange my busy schedule

139
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,914
to go with you as your chaperone.

140
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:32,924
Besides, I wouldn't want to
disappoint all the promising youngsters

141
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,134
of this mystery study club!

142
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:41,344
If my stories about the cases
I've solved can help them in any way,

143
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,474
it may be my duty as
a great detective to assist!

144
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,434
What a predictable personality...

145
00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:52,564
Miss Toto...

146
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:04,094
Alright! We're finally here!

147
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,674
So, where is the lodge?

148
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,544
Let's see...

149
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:11,444
The bus stop is here,
so we go up and right...

150
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:14,004
Over there!

151
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:19,014
Oh! Over there?
Miss Toto isn't too far now! Let's go!

152
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:21,594
Yeah! I'm gonna get me a Toto boy!

153
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,984
This is a real honor...

154
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:34,734
...being able to talk and drink
with the young minds of Toto U.!

155
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:39,594
Not only that, you're all
good-looking boys and pretty girls!

156
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:41,154
You're too much!

157
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:41,474
Sawai Manabu (22) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, President of Mystery Study Club

158
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,384
Just as I'd expect from a great detective!
Sawai Manabu (22) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, President of Mystery Study Club

159
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,344
You know how to control
Sawai Manabu (22) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, President of Mystery Study Club

160
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,124
people's hearts with words alone!
Sawai Manabu (22) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, President of Mystery Study Club

161
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:47,674
Hayasaka Tomoko (21) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, V.P. of Mystery Study Club

162
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:50,224
Oh? Are you sure you're not referring to yourself,
Hayasaka Tomoko (21) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, V.P. of Mystery Study Club

163
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,834
playboy Sawai-kun?
Hayasaka Tomoko (21) Literature Dept.,
4th Year, V.P. of Mystery Study Club

164
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:52,844
playboy Sawai-kun?

165
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,884
Noguchi Shibahisa (20) Literature Dept., 2nd Year
Miyazaki Chika (19) Literature Dept., 2nd Year
I heard you made a 1st-year girl cry

166
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:57,724
just recently, President!
Noguchi Shibahisa (20) Literature Dept., 2nd Year
Miyazaki Chika (19) Literature Dept., 2nd Year

167
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,554
Eh?! Is that true?!

168
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:03,884
Hey, now! This is
Asami's birthday party!

169
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:05,724
This isn't the time to put me on trial!

170
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,674
Yes. And it's also a celebration party

171
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:12,234
for the "Newcomer Award"
her novel won the other day.

172
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,674
That was too bad, Morimoto.

173
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,764
I heard you made it
to the final selection, too.

174
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,194
It couldn't be helped.

00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,384
I lost to Asami-kun,

177
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:23,404
our department's most promising writer!
Morimoto Yoshinobu (22) Literature Dept., 3rd Year

178
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,424
Speaking of losing,

179
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:30,514
I lost to her pair in the Literature
Department's tennis tournament!

180
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,424
Plus she was named
Miss Toto as a freshman!

181
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,374
I didn't even make it through
the preliminary round...

182
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:40,844
I really admire her. She can do
everything, but doesn't act conceited.

183
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,424
She's also an incredible cook!

184
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:46,594
Speaking of which,
where is her lemon pie?

185
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,634
She and Ran are baking it right now!

186
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:52,024
Huh? Asami-kun said she was
going to make one and bring it here...

187
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:54,024
Sorry for the wait!

188
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:55,984
Great!
I've been looking forward to this!

189
00:11:58,444 --> 00:11:59,394
Whoa...

190
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:00,264
It's sloppy...

191
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:02,614
Did you really make this, Asami?!

192
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,074
No, I did. It was my first time...

193
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,344
What about your pie, Asami-kun?

194
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,344
I accidentally forgot to bring it.

195
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:16,084
She said she would make
one for me, so I asked her to.

196
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:19,584
Geez. Why're you making
stuff you don't know how to?

197
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:20,804
But...

198
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:24,224
Now, now. Save your criticism
until after you've tried it.

199
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,554
Well, go ahead.

200
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,514
Oh? This pie...

201
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,224
It's a little fragrant, but it's...

202
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:36,104
Yummy!

203
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:38,804
Me too!
Me too!

204
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,064
Let me taste!

205
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,074
It really is! This is good!

206
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:50,994
Yeah! It looks iffy, but tastes great!

207
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,704
This is really something!

208
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:55,914
It's good!

209
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:59,514
See? With cooking,
substance is what matters.

210
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:03,134
Once you eat it, you can't tell
what it looks like anyway!

211
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:14,014
I've solved every
case 100% of the time!

212
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,674
And then you solved the case?!

213
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:17,484
That's right!

214
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:20,694
I was the one who solved them all.

215
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,114
Wow! What a pretty cake!

216
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:27,174
I went all the way to Ginza to get it!

217
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,724
I'll find some matches!

218
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,674
Oh, that's okay. I borrowed
Sawai-kun's lighter.

219
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:42,174
At any age, watching birthday
candles being lit is so exciting!

220
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,674
Actually, only until you're 20.

221
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,384
Eh? Is that so?

222
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:53,344
Yeah. Once you're over 20,
you start to hate each extra candle.

223
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,564
Oh...

224
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,514
Congratulations. I pray for even greater future
success. Toto Literature Prof. Takamura Masao

225
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:01,644

success. Toto Literature Prof. Takamura Masao

227
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,844
Right at midnight, as promised!

228
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,154
See? It's good we got
a lodge with a fax machine!

229
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,424
Takamura-sensei sent it, Asami!

230
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:13,114
Huh?

231
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:16,334
I think she's asleep.

232
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,294
No way. What should
we do with the cake?

233
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:22,724
Aren't we supposed to go to the
karaoke place by the station next?

234
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,754
Yeah. I already made reservations.

235
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:26,304
Oh well.

236
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:30,224
Let's save the cake for tomorrow
and go do karaoke ourselves.

237
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:34,334
Yeah. Nothing else
we can do. Let's do that.

Oh! I'll go next!

244
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,144
What's wrong, Ran?

245
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:09,224
Why the glum look?

246
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,804
Nothing! I'm not glum at all!

247
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:17,264
Shall I guess what you're thinking?

248
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:20,264
Smart and beautiful,
a sports warrior and scholar...

Considerate, popular,
and ♪1 at everything...

250
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,734
You're thinking about
Asami-senpai, aren't you?

251
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,694
Eh?! How could you tell?!

252
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:34,664
"I'm no match for her!"
is written all over your face!

253
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,934
But you can't blame
Shinichi-kun for falling for her.

254
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,624
She was the soccer club's manager.

255
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:49,724
But don't worry about it!
She must've rejected him anyway!

256
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,674
Besides, you're childhood friends!

257
00:15:52,894 --> 00:15:57,604
Did you know Shinichi
loves lemon pie, Sonoko?

258
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:03,074
I heard it for the first time
today from Asami-senpai.

259
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:07,014
Eh? Shinichi loves lemon pie?

260
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,644
Yes! It's his favorite!

261
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:14,014
I told everyone I'd make one
because I thought he'd come today,

262
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,154
so I brought this.

263
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,814
Oh? Shinichi does?

264
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,054
He loves this?

265
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:25,724
I can teach you how
to make it if you'd like!

266
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:29,474
I don't stand a chance.

267
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:33,304
She knows so much
about Shinichi that I don't.

268
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:35,264
Ran...

269
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:43,684
C'mon, cheer up! You have
your own good qualities too!

270
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:45,604
Like what?

271
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:50,524
You know! You are strong and
brawny 'cause you practice karate!

272
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,854
Come on, now!

273
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:53,834
Geez.

274
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:01,974
Oh? There are a lot fewer people.

275
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:05,184
Because you were taking
so long in the bathroom.

276
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,874
Everyone ran off to the
bathrooms by the train station.

277
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,394
My apologies!

278
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,304
Oh, do you have my cigarettes?

279
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:14,514
I bought some at the
convenience store next door!

280
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,224
Oh! They're back!

281
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,184
Huh? Where's Noguchi-kun?

282
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,144
He's still walking around
the train station to sober up.

283
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,014
It's already past 3:00...

284
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:28,354
Maybe we should head back.
We left the place messy, too.

285
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:31,274
Let's tidy up and hit the hay--

286
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:35,904
H-Hey! Is that a fire?!

287
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:37,704
It is!

288
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,014
H-Hold on! Isn't that...

289
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,664
...our lodge?!

290
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,394
What?!

291
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:49,684
Oh no! Asami-senpai is still in there!

292
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:54,304
Let's hurry to the lodge!
We might still make it in time!

293
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,124
Where's the rental car key?!

294
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,054
Noguchi-kun has it!

295
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,594
Huh? What's the problem?

296
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:05,054
"What's the problem"?!
The lodge we rented is on fire!

297
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:13,804
Senpai... Senpai...

298
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:18,654
Please be all right,
Asami-senpai!

299
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:28,704
This is bad!

300
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,124
Asami!

301
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:31,424
Asami-senpai!

302
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,804
Not good! It doesn't look
like she fled outside!

303
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,384
D-Don't tell me she's
still asleep inside?!

304
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,764
Oh no!

305
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:42,974
Should we call her on the phone?!
She was asleep in the living room!

306
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,764
It's no use! It's already burned up!

307
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,524
Damn! There's no other choice!

308
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:49,484
H-Hey!

309
00:18:52,184 --> 00:18:54,774
I-It's no use! There's no way inside!

310
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:55,904
No!

311
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,304
It's dangerous! Step back!

312
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,734
Asami-senpai!

313
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:03,554
Hey! Move that motorcycle!
We don't want its gasoline to ignite!

314
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:04,184
Right!

315
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,394
Where's the fire truck?!

316
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:09,584
Huh? My helmet...

317
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:13,044
I'm coming, Senpai!

318
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:15,164
Hey!

319
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,604
What?! Ran and Conan went inside?!

320
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:21,514
President Sawai followed them, too!

321
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,014
Those idiots!

322
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:28,644
Senpai!

323
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:34,774
Senpai! Asami-senpai!

324
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,144
Ran!

325
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,564
S-Stop, Mori-san!

326
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:40,554
Let go! My daughter's in there!

327
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,784
You'd be in danger too!

328
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:47,554
Ran! Ran!

329
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,124
Ran. Ran!

330
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:58,794
Say something, Ran!

331
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:02,894
Sonoko...

332
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:03,764
Ran!

333
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,304
Where are we?

334
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,934
A hospital near the lodge.
They brought you here afterwards.

335
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,434
Oh...

336
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,894
What about Asami-senpai?!

337
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:18,864
She's sleeping right over there.

338
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:24,574
Other than a little carbon
monoxide poisoning, she's just fine!

339
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,974
Thank goodness! She made it out!

340
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:31,804
What're you talking about?
You're the one who saved her!

341
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,044
You don't remember?

342
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:38,554
Nothing at all...
I rushed inside without thinking...

343
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:43,464
And Sawai-san led the way
to safety after I found her...

344
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:48,554
I felt relieved when I got outside,
but things got blurry...

345
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:52,224
But that was amazing! You busted
inside with that helmet on!

346
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:56,554
Even the firefighters said that
it wasn't smart to go into the fire,

347
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,404
but wearing the helmet
was the correct thing to do!

348
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:03,304
Oh, that was Conan-kun.

349
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,554
He gave it to me just as
I was about to run inside.

350
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:11,374
He said I should put it on to protect
my hair and face from the flames.

351
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:16,084
Conan-kun did? He's as
strange a kid as always...

352
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,744
Yeah. He is.

353
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:30,014
So the fire started around 2:50?

354
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:35,184
Yes. People in nearby lodges
said they saw smoke.

355
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,894
They thought it was a bonfire at first.

356
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:42,054
So, do you suspect it was arson?

357
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:44,514
No. The fire started in the living room.

358
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:47,034
This cake candle was probably the cause.

359
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,554
Cake candle?

360
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:54,204
Yes. It probably fell
onto the floor while still lit,

361
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:59,924
where it ignited the nearby
wrapping paper and curtains.

362
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:02,034
Why didn't you blow them out?!

363
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,604
How rude! I did put them out!

364
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:08,554
It couldn't be helped.
We were all in a hurry when we left.

365
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,094
I told you, I put them out!

366
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:14,554
But the candle did burn down to its base.

367
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:19,104
If she didn't forget to put it out,
there's one other possibility...

368
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:25,774
The possibility that Asami-san
herself lit the fire in the living room!

369
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:27,574
You can't be serious!

370
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,074
That's absurd! Why would she do that?!

371
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:14,954
S-Senpai?

372
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,584
She's gone?!

373
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:20,294
She must've left while we were
getting something to drink!

374
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:22,124
What do we do, Dad?!

375
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:30,204
Asami-san was nearly burned to death.

376
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:34,724
By one of you here!

377
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,664
On the next Conan--

378
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:40,394
"The Memories of First Love Case (Part 2)."
