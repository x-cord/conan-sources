1
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,070
It's Mount Fuji!

2
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,580
It's so beautiful!

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,480
It deserves to be called the No. 1 mountain in Japan.

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,720
What is that?

5
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,230
That's the newly constructed Nishitamashi Twin Towers.

6
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,320
The two towers are 319 meters and 294 meters tall,

7
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,340
which makes them the tallest buildings in Japan.

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,230
I really want to go there.

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,140
Professor,

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,780
can we visit that place on the way back home from camping?

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,750
We might have to take a detour...

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,850
Fine, we can go.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,240
Nishitamashi City...

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,840
Because I exposed the crimes committed by the former mayor,

15
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,450
Teiji Moriya challenged me.

16
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,920
By the way...

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,360
These guys really love camping.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,530
We'll go camping tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, too...

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,280
I'm so full!

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,020
You haven't eaten up all the rice.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,760
My mom told me that if you leave even a bit of rice behind,

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,550
you'll be punished by god.

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,090
That's right.

24
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,590
The farmers worked hard

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,890
and go through eighty-eight processes to produce the rice.

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,430
Eighty-eight processes?

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,990
If we disassemble the word 'rice',

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,190
it becomes the number eighty-eight.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,360
Really?

30
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,490
It's true!

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,610
It really is!

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,940
So, a person's 88th birthday is called 'Rice Birthday'.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,210
Just so you know,

34
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,210
one's 77th birthday is called 'Joyous Birthday'.

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,040
And 99th birthday is called 'White Birthday'.

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,350
Do you know why the 77th birthday is called 'Joyous Birthday'?

37
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,390
That's because the word 'Joyous' in cursive style

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,010
looks just like the number seventy-seven, right?

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,820
The word 'hundred' will become the word 'white'
if the upper line is removed.

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,370
I always felt that

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,370
the two of you knew too much.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,530
Are you guys lying about your age?

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,100
Ha... he's right about that.

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,640
Right, I'll give you guys a riddle.

45
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,640
What is one's 44th birthday called?

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,110
Fourty-four...

47
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,340
The answer is a kanji and three katakanas.

48
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,210
You could ignore the word 'birthday'.

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,690
A kanji and three katakanas.

50
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,590
What would it be?

51
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,320
Fourty-four... Eighty-eight... it can't be.

52
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,730
Professor, I got the answer, but it's so boring.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,600
Really? What about Ai?

54
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,340
I don't know either!

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,270
Me neither!

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,710
Me neither!

57
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,570
All right, time to reveal the answer.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Fourty-four is half of eighty-eight, right?

59
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,110
Eighty-eight is 'rice'

60
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,020
in English,

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,970
and the word 'half' is (HAN) is Japanese,

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,590
so it's half bowl of rice (HAN RICE).

63
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,520
Ha... I knew it...

64
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,100
What's wrong?

65
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,270
If I serve half a bowl of rice three times (SAN),

66
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,530
it becomes (SUNRISE).

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,570
I'm just joking.

68
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,700
I peed a little on my pants.

69
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,880
It's so cold.

70
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,920
We might go to the Nishitamashi twin towers tomorrow.

71
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,530
Of course, he's going too.

72
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,830
I got his whereabouts, boss.

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,030
The Nishitamashi twin towers.

74
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,410
That building is called the place closes to heaven.

75
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,810
Perfect.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,440
The place which is closest to heaven is perfect for an execution...

77
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,920
(Detective Conan Countdown to Heaven)

78
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,880
I am Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective.

79
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,080
When I was at an amusement park with Ran,

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,880
my childhood friend,

81
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,150
I witnessed two men in black in the middle of a suspicious deal.

82
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,580
At that time, I was so focused at what was happening

83
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,990
that I ignored one of them had come up behind me.

84
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,690
I was forced to consume poison.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,700
When I woke up again,

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,200
my body had shrunk.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,170
If they knew that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,400
they'll try to kill me

89
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,410
and even hurt the people around me.

90
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,710
So I listened to Professor Agasa's advice

91
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,150
and hid my true identity.

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,550
When Ran asked about my name,

93
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,210
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly hit me.

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
In order to get more information on those guys,

95
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,830
I moved in with Ran and her detective father.

96
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,200
I am Hiroshi Agasa, the ingenious inventor.

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,030
Allow me to introduce my masterpieces.

98
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,070
The Stun-gun wristwatch.

99
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,230
The Voice-Changing Bowtie.

100
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,440
The Power Assisted Kick Shoes.

101
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,980
The Turbo-Engine skateboard

102
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,240
And the Criminal Locator Glasses.

103
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,350
I've even added a secret weapon in these glasses,

104
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,860
which are night-vision telescopic lenses.

105
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,160
These were all designed for Shinichi whose body had shrunk.

106
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,670
By using these tools,

107
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,200
he has been able to mimic Mr. Mouri's voice

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,930
to solve cases and capture criminals.

109
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,340
That's right. I almost forgot.

110
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,750
His classmates, the Detective Boys,

111
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,050
have the Detective Badges.

112
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,880
Along with the watch flashlight,

113
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,890
which were all invented by me.

114
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,080
Apart from me, there are four people

115
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,290
who know about Conan's real identity,

116
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,260
His father, Yusaku Kudo, who's a mystery novelist.

117
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,300
His mother, Yukiko Kudo, who used to be an actress.

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,700
Heiji Hattori, who's a high school detective in Kansai.

119
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,330
And finally Ai Haibara, his classmate.

120
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,880
Ai's real name is Shiho Miyano.

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,610
She used to be a member of the Black Organization.

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,810
However, after her sister, Akemi Miyano,
was killed by the organization,

123
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,850
she decided to flee from them.

124
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,450
By taking the same poison Shinichi took,

125
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,490
her body shrunk as well.

126
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,320
People of the Black Organization

127
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,520
have been trying to track her down.

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,220
Now,

129
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,730
somewhere hidden from me,

130
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,770
a crime is being committed.

131
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Though my body was shrunken, I remain clever.

132
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,330
I am the famous detective who can solve all the cases.

133
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,530
Only one truth will prevail!

134
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,540
This seat is too cramped.

135
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,180
It's because you're sitting in the back, Genta.

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
You were in the front seat when we came.

137
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,090
I thought it would be more fun in the back.

138
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,290
Conan, move over a bit.

139
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,260
Come one.

140
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
Why did you eat five bowls of rice in the morning?

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,530
Sorry, Ayumi, let's squeeze together.

142
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,470
Mitsuhiko, let's play a game.

143
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,340
Let's play the 30-seconds game.

144
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,680
Countdown to 30 seconds without looking at a timer

145
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,850
and then push on the stop button.

146
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,780
Interesting, let's all play!

147
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,180
I have to drive.

148
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll pass on that too.

149
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,780
28, 29, 30!

150
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,830
40 seconds! I'm off by 10 seconds.

151
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
29, 30!

152
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,540
I got 27 seconds.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,200
What a pity...

154
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,400
30...

155
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,980
59 seconds?

156
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,240
Is this thing broken?

157
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,610
It's you that's broken.

158
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,120
28, 29, 30!

159
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,190
Exactly 30 seconds!

160
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,690
Ayumi, you are brilliant.

161
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,420
It's like you have a superpower.

162
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,520
It was just a coincidence.

163
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,730
By the way, Haibara,

164
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,730
who were you talking on the phone with late at night yesterday?

165
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,430
I didn't make a phone call.

166
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,500
Kojima, maybe you were having a dream.

167
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,840
Really?

168
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,410
It's so tall.

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,140
I can't even see the top.

170
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,780
It looks like it could reach the clouds.

171
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,890
Isn't that Conan?

172
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,590
Sister Ran.

173
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,630
What a coincidence.

174
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
You brats, why are you guys here?

175
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,920
We were going home after camping.

176
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,730
Then we decided to take a detour to see this building.

177
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,860
Uncle, what about you guys?

178
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,370
Tokiwa Mio, the owner of this building

179
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,970
is my old college friend.

180
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,280
She invited me to visit a week before the opening ceremony.

181
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,880
Why have I never heard about this?

182
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,950
Me neither.

183
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,890
My dad didn't tell me about this.

184
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,970
I felt he was acting strange,

185
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,890
so I had to interrogate him to get him to confess.

186
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,390
Confess... you are exaggerating...

187
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,120
I see, Sister Ran and Sister Sonoko are here

188
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,990
to keep watch on Uncle Mouri.

189
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,340
Because Tokiwa Mio is

190
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,090
the president of the Tokiwa Corporation

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,000
and also single right now.

192
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,070
Since Ran's parents are living apart right now,

193
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,340
of course she'll feel worried.

194
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,150
Excuse me, are you Mr. Mouri?

195
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,210
Yes, I am.

196
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,910
I'm the president's secretary, Sawaguchi.

197
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,420
She's meeting with our clients right now.

198
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,550
So please follow me to the showroom.

199
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,330
This is Tower A where all the offices are.

200
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,460
Tokiwa Corporation uses all of the floors above the 31st floor.

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,830
The showroom is on the 2nd and 3rd floor.

202
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,700
What kind of company is the Tokiwa Corporation?

203
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,780
Tokiwa specializes in software

204
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,210
but deals with everything concerning computers.

205
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,370
So, they make video games too?

206
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,450
We are going to have so much fun here.

207
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,150
There are so many interesting things here.

208
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,690
Welcome, everybody.

209
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,230
This is Mr. Hara, our executive and programmer.

210
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,660
Nice to meet you.

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,790
What is this?

212
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,420
A game machine?

213
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,870
Do you want to have a try?

214
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,490
This computer

215
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,160
can predict what someone will look like in ten years.

216
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,800
What we'll look like in ten years?

217
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,240
This is awesome.

218
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,070
Professor, can we?

219
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,150
Why don't you two have a seat?

220
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,470
I'd rather not see

221
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,880
how aged and ugly I've become ten years later.

222
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,680
Are you ready? Let's start.

223
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,400
All right, this is what you'll look like in ten years.

224
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,510
What the heck, you look exactly the same.

225
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,810
The machine must be broken.

226
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,140
No, it doesn't seem like it.

227
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,710
Check out Ayumi's photo.

228
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:19,750
So cute!

229
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,730
She'll definitely be more popular than Sister Sonoko.

230
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,430
What do a bunch of brats know about the charms of an adults?

231
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,160
Anyway, let's try it too!

232
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,200
Okay!

233
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,340
Yeah, yeah! I've seen high school students who look like this.

234
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,380
Wow, the two of you look great.

235
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,640
Really?

236
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,640
Let's go try it too, Ran.

237
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,860
Yeah, yeah! I've seen old ladies looking like this.

238
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
Shut it you!

239
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,360
So pretty.

240
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,470
You look just like a younger version of Eri.

241
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,590
Too bad you're stuck with Shinichi

242
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,260
It bugs me to think that

243
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,340
you''re stuck with that guy.

244
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,770
What are you talking about, Sonoko?

245
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on... don't say that... ha...

246
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,850
Why are you blushing?

247
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,280
No... I'm not...

248
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,320
That's not what I mean...

249
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,070
Conan and Haibara should go next...

250
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,950
Haibara!

251
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,460
I'll pass on that.

252
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,050
So do I.

253
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,630
Of course, my face will look exactly
the same as Shinichi's in the photo

254
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,000
and Haibara will become Shiho Miyano.

255
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,070
I'd like to see

256
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,870
what this wicked boy will look like ten years later!

257
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,410
Haibara, you do it too!

258
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,510
Wait...

259
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,110
This is bad.

260
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,610
I wonder what Conan will look like.

261
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,320
Error? That's odd.

262
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,890
Lucky!

263
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,070
Maybe it means we'll be dead

264
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,550
within ten years.

265
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,030
Okay, understood.

266
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,000
Everyone,

267
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,270
please follow me to the banquet venue on the 75th floor.

268
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,200
Let's walk to the elevator.

269
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,240
Sorry.

270
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,140
It's fine...

271
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,440
You're at it again.

272
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,640
She was born on the year of the Boar, so she's always so clumsy.

273
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,220
Ha... that's what it is.

274
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,380
So you are always like this.

275
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,750
Does this elevator go straight to the 75th floor?

276
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,660
Yes.

277
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,390
This is the VIP elevator

278
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,660
which has access to any floor of the building.

279
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,240
The only other way to access this elevator

280
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,280
is from the concert hall on the 66th floor.

281
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,810
It's so beautiful. So tall.

282
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,680
The scenery is splendid.

283
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,380
It feels like we're going straight to heaven.

284
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,030
Sorry for the mess,

285
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,000
everything is being set up for the party.

286
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,200
Senior Mouri!

287
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,940
Tokiwa, it's been a while.

288
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,880
Thanks for travelling all the way here.

289
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,410
No, I was supposed to be here alone...

290
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm Ran, his daughter.

291
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,210
My mom told me to say hi.

292
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,720
Ran.

293
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,010
Let me do the introduction.

294
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,120
This is Sonoko Suzuki, my classmate.

295
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,120
Professor Agasa, an inventor.

296
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,960
Conan Edogawa,

297
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,370
Ai Haibara,

298
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,830
Ayumi Yoshida,

299
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,970
Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya,

300
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,560
Hello.

301
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,930
and Genta Kojima

302
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,230
Nice to meet you.

303
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,400
Hello everyone, I'm Tokiwa Mio.

304
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,560
Please allow me to introduce my associates.

305
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,170
This is my art teacher,

306
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,140
and also a famous painter in Japan, Hosui Kisaragi.

307
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,870
Hosui Kisaragi...

308
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,680
Are you the painter who's known for painting Mount Fuji...

309
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,620
I know something about you too!

310
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,470
Are you that detective,

311
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,550
Sleeping Bug Kogoro?

312
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,890
I am 'Sleeping Kogoro'.

313
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,450
This man smells of liquor.

314
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,270
This is a council member in Nishitamashi,

315
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,260
Iwamatsu Oki.

316
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,660
When we were constructing this building,

317
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,570
he gave me a lot of help.

318
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,270
This is Hidehiko Kazama,

319
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,370
the architect who designed this building.

320
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,670
I believe we've met in the past, Mr. Mouri.

321
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,310
I actually studied under Teiji Moriya.

322
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,650
You are a student of Teiji Moriya.

323
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,590
But don't worry.

324
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,070
I won't blow buildings up

325
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,320
like Moriya did.

326
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,860
Blow... blow up.

327
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
It's because the two buildings have different height

328
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,860
and are asymmetrical, right?

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,230
Little boy, you know a lot of things.

330
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,800
Hurry, hurry! The view from here is great!

331
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,810
It's so beautiful!

332
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,380
So big!

333
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,620
What a fantastic view!

334
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,520
You can see Mount Fuji at night from this place.

335
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,490
At night?

336
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
What does she mean?

337
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,260
We could see Mount Fuji even at night?

338
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,370
What can we see

339
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,960
from the windows over there?

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,830
What is that?

341
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,130
It's like the roof of a Dome.

342
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,710
Tower B is a commercial building.

343
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,240
The bottom floors are stores

344
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,640
while the top is a hotel.

345
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,970
The top floor is home to an indoor pool

346
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,780
complete with a retractable roof.

347
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,150
How incredible!

348
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,720
By the way, Mio,

349
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,780
can I stay at the hotel this weekend?

350
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,260
But... the hotel hasn't opened yet.

351
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,380
I guess that's a no, huh?

352
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,660
I understand.

353
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,130
I'll prepare the suite on the 67th floor for you.

354
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,970
I'd like to have dinner with you

355
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,570
if that's possible...

356
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,670
That's a very unusual brooch.

357
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,670
From a special someone, perhaps?

358
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,080
No, this is something I bought.

359
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,980
Mio, I'm going now!

360
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,710
Oh, let me see you off.

361
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,410
There's no need to.

362
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,190
He seems pretty unhappy.

363
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,670
Mio bought Mr. Kisaragi's paintings

364
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,250
and sold them for a profit.

365
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,160
That's why he feels a bit...

366
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,200
It's chocolate!

367
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,230
Well, since you guys saw it,

368
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,810
I'll give you a treat.

369
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,380
Awesome!

370
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:47,920
Here you are.

371
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,070
Thanks a lot.

372
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,120
Thank you.

373
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,710
Thank you.

374
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,450
Though he's a genius programmer,

375
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
he's actually very childish.

376
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,260
That's why he could create interesting games.

377
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,330
That's right!

378
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,020
I'm currently writing the software for a new game.

379
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,870
If it's possible,

380
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,220
can you guys give me some advice?

381
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,060
Games?

382
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,330
No problem!

383
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,900
I live in Sou chou.

384
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,840
We live in Beika chou.

385
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,240
So we live pretty close.

386
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,640
It would be a short journey by bus.

387
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,340
Why don't you guys come to my house to have fun next Sunday?

388
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,910
Okay, we'll be there!

389
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,580
Ai, what's wrong?

390
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,810
Nothing.

391
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,460
Sister Ran...

392
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,960
Actually, there's something I need to discuss with you.

393
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,530
Can we meet tomorrow?

394
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,570
Sure.

395
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,190
I'll tell you when and where later.

396
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,580
Sister Ran, there's something I need to talk to you about in private.

397
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,710
The problem must be my haircut.

398
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,090
Maybe I should get a perm.

399
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,820
I can't believe we can still see that car.

400
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,060
What's it called?

401
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,100
It's a Porsche 356A.

402
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,430
What...

403
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,660
You two!

404
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,100
That elevator is for the VIP guests only.

405
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,440
Staff members should take the elevator at the back!

406
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,270
Yes... we are sorry...

407
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,510
Where did you see that car?

408
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,510
What's the color of it?

409
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,680
It was parked in front of the building.

410
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,910
And the color is black.

411
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,540
It's Gin's car!

412
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,160
Wait, Conan.

413
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,520
Brat, where are you going?

414
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,730
Come on, come on!

415
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,140
It's over there!

416
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,120
Damn it!

417
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,060
Why did they come to this building?

418
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,940
In fact, I've been having a crush on Ayumi since kindergarten.

419
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,980
But Ayumi seems to like Conan.

420
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,380
Sister Ran, can you please tell me

421
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,170
how can Ayumi and I

422
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,960
turn into a couple from childhood friends

423
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,650
like you and Brother Shinichi did?

424
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,460
Wait... Shinichi and I aren't...

425
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,130
Also, I've started to like Haibara too...

426
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,730
Am I a horrible guy

427
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,000
for liking two girls?

428
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,370
You are not a horrible person.

429
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,040
It's a good thing to have someone you like.

430
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,120
I think you should cherish those feelings.

431
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,420
Then...

432
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,670
But don't you think

433
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,680
it's good to stay as friends for now?

434
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,730
Whether it's Ayumi or Harbara?

435
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,390
And also with Conan and Genta.

436
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,130
I see.

437
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,270
Get five donuts

438
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,640
and enjoy a fifty percent discount.

439
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,070
Welcome.

440
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,110
I like Conan so much.

441
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
But Conan has a crush on someone else.

442
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,570
Do you mean Haibara?

443
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,480
No. It's you, sister Ran

444
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,350
It can't be.

445
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,050
Conan must have fallen in love with you. I'm sure.

446
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,650
So I hope you could tell him that

447
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,390
you already have Shinichi as your boyfriend.

448
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,690
Please tell him to give up.

449
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
Well...

450
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
Otherwise, Conan will be so pathetic.

451
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,770
But we don't know whether

452
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,530
Conan likes me.

453
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,170
I know!

454
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,570
How?

455
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,150
A woman's intuition!

456
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,080
Rea... really?

457
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,750
What?

458
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,350
I said that Conan has a crush on me.

459
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,620
That's absurd.

460
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,590
He doesn't like you at all, you fool.

461
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,000
How would you know?

462
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,090
Well...

463
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,170
Kids having a crush on someone is as common as having the measles.

464
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,600
It's nothing to worry about.

465
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,010
Can you be serious about this matter?

466
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,370
Then, don't lie to yourself

467
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,540
and be honest with yourself.

468
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,950
Be honest with myself?

469
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,870
If you do that,

470
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,650
you'll find the answer yourself.

471
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,880
That's all for now. I'll call you alter on.

472
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,020
Sigh.

473
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,030
I'm the one who should be honest with myself...

474
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,380
(Nishitamashi Twin Towers)

475
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,870
(67th floor suite of Tower B)

476
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,350
What... what do you want...

477
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,390
I called you guys here

478
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,360
because we found a murder victim

479
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,490
in the suite of the twin towers.

480
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,090
That man is...

481
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,370
Iwamatsu Oki, a council member in Nishitamashi.

482
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,570
I heard that when he asked Tokiwa Mio to arrange a room for him,

483
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,370
you guys happened to be there.

484
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,170
Chiba.

485
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,410
Yes.

486
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,480
The time of death is

487
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,550
between ten o'clock at night to midnight.

488
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,590
The murder weapon is suspected to be a knife.
But we didn't find it at the scene.

489
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,750
However, Oki had in his hand,

490
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,230
a sake cup that was broken in half.

491
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,490
Sake cup?

492
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,650
This one.

493
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,260
This cup is very expensive.

494
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,890
Oki likes to drink a lot.

495
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,300
Perhaps he brought it there with sake.

496
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,270
However, we believe that

497
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,470
it's the victim's message

498
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,000
to suggest the identity of the murderer.

499
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,370
In order words, the police think that

500
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,680
the murderer is one of those five.

501
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,810
That's because the building isn't open to the public yet.

502
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,420
I know!

503
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,720
Sake cup (ochoko) means chocolate (choko)!

504
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,370
So the murderer must be

505
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,320
Hara Yoshiaki who likes chocolate!

506
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,060
No way!

507
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,900
It can't be Mr. Hara!

508
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,470
Because he gave his chocolate to us!

509
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,940
He's a good guy!

510
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,870
Stay out of it you kids!

511
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,710
Mr. Hara should be innocent.

512
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,940
We questioned the five of them

513
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,570
and he's the only one who had an alibi.

514
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,550
Alibi...

515
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,740
Come on, Inspector Megure,

516
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,150
why didn't you say that early?

517
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,770
Sake cup.

518
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,950
It means to be worried (ochokochoi).

519
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,170
If that's the case, then the most suspicious person

520
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,620
would be Mr. Mouri, right?

521
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,530
Shiratori...

522
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,070
I'm just joking.

523
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,760
Seriously.

524
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,130
What about the motive?

525
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,300
It's still under investigation.

526
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,770
Although Oki was just a council member,

527
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,970
he seemed to have greater power

528
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,500
than the mayor.

529
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,100
An example would be the Twin Tower Buildings.

530
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,470
The municipal law which opposes high-rise building projects

531
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,880
was overturned because of him.

532
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,370
That's why Miss. Mio couldn't reject Mr. Oki's request of

533
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,790
living in the hotel before the opening ceremony.

534
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,970
Come to think of it,

535
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,990
doesn't the brooch which Mio wore

536
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,260
look a lot like this broken cup?

537
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,030
Wait, it can't be Mio...

538
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,230
No, considering the success rate of the murder,

539
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,640
she's the current main suspect.

540
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,770
That's because Mr. Oki lived

541
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,270
on the 67th floor of Tower B.

542
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,820
While she stayed on the 68th floor.

543
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,180
No way...

544
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,070
That sake cup reminds me of the bowl

545
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,990
used for Japanese painting.

546
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,060
My dad is also interested in Japanese paintings.

547
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,470
This sake cup is like the bowl

548
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,690
used to mix powder.

549
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,970
It seems like Mr. Kisaragi

550
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,230
is relevant to the sake cup too...

551
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,070
But Mr. Kazama and Miss. Sawaguchi seem to

552
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,840
have nothing to do with the sake cup.

553
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,100
Officer Shiratori,

554
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,870
is Mr. Kazama really a student of Teiji Moriya?

555
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,240
Yeah.

556
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,510
But he's unlike Moriya who's an artist

557
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,950
and more of a tech guy.

558
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,280
So he's really not a perfectionist like Moriya.

559
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,620
As for Sawaguchi Chinami,

560
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,520
her father is a journalist

561
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,290
who died from exhaustion on her senior year of college.

562
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,470
But so far,

563
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,990
we didn't find her connection with Oki.

564
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,070
Inspector Megure,

565
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,510
The reason why the crime took place in the hotel
which hasn't opened...

566
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,530
The blood splatter is only on the lower part of the closet

567
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,700
with a very unnatural shape.

568
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,680
This is not something a child should look at.

569
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,680
Okay.

570
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,970
Besides, why did Gin and Vodka

571
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,490
go to the twin towers...

572
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,850
Wait...

573
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,400
The sake cup could be connected with alcohol.

574
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,690
Haibara, could it be them...

575
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,970
Their code names are all based on alcoholic beverages.

576
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,010
But they wouldn't do something so stupid,

577
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,700
leaving such obvious note at the crime scene.

578
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,150
Tomorrow we...

579
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,770
How about that?

580
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,860
Mitsuhiko, over here!

581
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,820
You two are early.

582
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
I'm so excited!

583
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,170
I feel so happy that we could dump Conan

584
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,520
and act on our own.

585
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,190
Who did say you want to dump?

586
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,170
He's here!

587
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,000
How... how did you find out?

588
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,840
It's too easy to

589
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,910
guess the plan you had in mind.

590
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,270
You must be thinking

591
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,540
I'll say it's too dangerous for you to investigate by yourselves

592
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,770
and stop you guys.

593
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,350
Right?

594
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,110
That's... correct...

595
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,690
I'll let this slide this time.

596
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,890
But don't ever do this again.

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,660
Okay!

598
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,830
Did they really listen?

599
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,460
So, where are we going today?

600
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,470
We are going to find Mr. Kazama and Mr. Kisaragi.

601
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,370
Tomorrow, we'll go to Mr. Hara's place.

602
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,240
Though Mr. Kazama's home is at Setagaya,

603
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,570
he has a workshop near Asahino station

604
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,780
which is only one stop ahead of Nishitamashi station.

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,470
He will be staying there

606
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,550
until the twin towers is put into operation.

607
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,380
Mr. Kisaragi is single.

608
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,470
Three years ago, he built a house

609
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,720
which he uses as a workshop and also his residence in Asahino.

610
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,390
They did some good investigating.

611
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,620
If we knew Conan would come,

612
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,060
we should've convinced Haibara to come as well.

613
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,360
You already asked Haibara to join you?

614
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,300
Yes.

615
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,070
But she said she would be busy with housework today,

616
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,070
so she couldn't come.

617
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,060
Brother!

618
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,190
This is what will happen to a traitor...

619
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,090
Brother, brother!

620
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,770
The apartment which Mr. Kazama rented

621
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,640
should be near the bus station.

622
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,840
And Mr. Kisaragi's house

623
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,850
might be on that hill.

624
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,850
First, let's head to Mr. Kazama's apartment.

625
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,090
This is a CAD system, right?

626
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,860
You design everything with this computer, right?

627
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,730
I'm surprised that you know that.

628
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,770
No one uses

629
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,170
drawing boards anymore.

630
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,100
What is a drawing board?

631
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,640
Ha... right.

632
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,010
You wouldn't know what a drawing board is.

633
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,270
We used to attach a paper

634
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,280
on a large board.

635
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,720
Then we use pencils and compasses to draw the plans.

636
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,950
I see.

637
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,080
By the way, why was it you wanted to see me?

638
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,320
Ask him, quick.

639
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,550
Me?

640
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,650
You are the one who gathered us together.

641
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,100
Fine... all right.

642
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,230
Actually, Mr. Kazama, we...

643
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,640
You have a nice apartment.

644
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,740
The air is fresh here and you can see Mount Fuji.

645
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,110
This is not going to work...

646
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,480
We are known as the Detective Boys.

647
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,070
We're currently investigating

648
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,180
the death of Mr. Oki.

649
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,580
You guys are so brave.

650
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,450
All right, you can ask anything you want,

651
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,460
young detectives.

652
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,960
So...

653
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,570
What do you think of

654
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,060
Mr. Oki who has passed away?

655
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,100
That's very blunt.

656
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,430
A filthy middle-aged man.

657
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,600
Anyway, thanks to his influence in the city council,

658
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,200
I have my job.

659
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,470
So I thank him for that.

660
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,970
During the process of designing,

661
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,740
did you have any disagreements with Mr. Oki?

662
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,980
No, not with Mr. Oki.

663
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,990
Which mean you quarreled with someone else.

664
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,360
No... that's not what I mean.

665
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,360
That photo...

666
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,960
That's my only child.

667
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
He's cute, isn't he?

668
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,060
When I work alone at night,

669
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,760
I would always want to hear his voice.

670
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,470
So sometimes I would call him,

671
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,070
even though I know he's asleep.

672
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,640
Parents are silly, right?

673
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,970
Me?

674
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:31,920
Well... we are the Detective Boys.

675
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,530
And we'd like to ask you about Mr. Oki's murder...

676
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,370
Kid's shouldn't try to imitate the police!

677
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,770
No... we...

678
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,370
Though,

679
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,880
I don't want you to go back empty handed.

680
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,320
Let me give you something.

681
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,020
I'm glad that he gave us his paintings,

682
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,460
but we didn't ask him anything about the case.

683
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,530
So we can't do it because we are not the police?

684
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,500
That's right.

685
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,290
It's almost six o'clock.

686
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,770
Let's call it a day.

687
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,750
What's that sound?

688
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,780
Oh, it was my snoring.

689
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,140
Haibara was on the phone last night?

690
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,870
When we went camping last time,

691
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,700
Genta mentioned something similar.

692
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,400
It seems she did make a phone call then.

693
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,480
But...

694
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,810
There should be no one

695
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,610
she could phone.

696
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,120
I trust her.

697
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,210
But what if her fear for the Black Organization

698
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,520
drove her back to that organization.

699
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,390
It's fine, Professor.

700
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,190
There's nothing to worry about.

701
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,130
Bye.

702
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,040
Good morning, everyone.

703
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,370
Morning, Conan.

704
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,460
You are so slow!

705
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,040
We've been waiting for so long!

706
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,480
Haibara is going to Mr. Hara's home with us.

707
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,910
Oh really...

708
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,140
Can I go too?

709
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm also interested in

710
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,840
the games at Mr. Hara's home.

711
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,060
Apartment 407.

712
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,530
This is Mr. Hara's apartment.

713
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,130
The door's open.

714
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,740
He's so careless.

715
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,970
Mr. Hara, we are here...

716
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,810
Co... Conan, Mr. Hara, he...

717
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,580
Call the police and an ambulance!

718
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,850
He was shot in the chest and killed instantly.

719
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,330
A knife...

720
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,390
Was he going to eat some cake?

721
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,960
This is...

722
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,830
A sake cup.

723
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,300
That means...

724
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,870
it's the same criminal.

725
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,540
What do you think, coroner?

726
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,980
I can't say for sure until the autopsy.

727
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,670
The time of death should be between

728
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,960
yesterday afternoon to evening.

729
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,570
Mr. Hara seemed to have been ready

730
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,020
to eat this chocolate cake.

731
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,190
The murderer came at that time,

732
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,870
so he used the knife for cutting cake to

733
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,270
fight the murderer.

734
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,570
But...

735
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,900
How do you explain the sake cup?

736
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,300
That's easy.

737
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,470
It's from the same person who killed Mr. Oki.

738
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,240
This person is a serial killer.

739
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,870
If that's the case,

740
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,300
the cup was not a message from the victim

741
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,170
but it is very likely now

742
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,870
they are hints left by the killer

743
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,610
Hi Kids.

744
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,590
Officer, are you finished?

745
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,420
Yeah.

746
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:17,970
By the way,

747
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,520
I heard that you all found the body.

748
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah, it was scary...

749
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,160
Is that the sake cup at the crime scene?

750
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,700
Yeah, that's right.

751
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,630
Odd. There's no blood stain on the broken pieces...

752
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,830
Officer, are all the pieces here?

753
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,030
Of course.

754
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,700
The Crime Scene Team wouldn't miss anything.

755
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,210
See you then.

756
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,010
Now you believe they aren't the culprits, right?

757
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,520
They wouldn't leave that kind of thing there.

758
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,060
According to the autopsy, we know that the victim was likely killed

759
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,760
between five and six last evening.

760
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,270
Also, all the data on Mr. Hara's computer

761
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,030
have been wiped.

762
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:05,270
That could be one of the killer's motives.

763
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,070
Mr. Kisaragi was innocent

764
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,330
because he met with Conan and the other kids between 5 and 6 o'clock.

765
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,170
However,

766
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,770
if Mr. Kazama drove to the crime scene

767
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,270
right after Conan and the others left,

768
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,850
he would have had the time to commit the murder.

769
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,010
Then... what about Miss. Mio?

770
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,590
Miss Tokiwa and Miss Sawaguchi, her secretary,

771
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,380
both have solid alibi.

772
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,420
Mouri, sorry to say this.

773
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,570
But the killer would be either

774
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,690
Tokiwa Mio, Hidehiko Kazama

775
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,200
or Sawaguchi Chinami.

776
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,570
Also, we believe that the killer is very likely to

777
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,830
go on a killing spree.

778
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,970
That's why INspector Megure asked Miss Tokiwa to

779
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,880
postpone the opening party on Saturday.

780
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,910
But she refused firmly.

781
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,180
Not only that, I also received this.

782
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,410
Isn't this the invitation to the party?

783
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,670
Conan and I are invited,

784
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,890
as well as the other kids.

785
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,820
We are invited too?

786
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,690
Seriously, what is she thinking?

787
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,230
Boss,

788
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,920
is this the room?

789
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,930
The building manager confirmed it was her from the picture.

790
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,240
So she has been hiding in this place behind our back.

791
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,970
She paid a full year in advance

792
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,100
and the phone has been used to receive messages.

793
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,840
According to the neighbors,

794
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,610
the phone would sometimes ring

795
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,080
and a message is left

796
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,150
However, when I was about to hear those messages,

797
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,010
I found something weird.

798
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,050
The messages weren't recorded.

799
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,560
Who is it? What does that person want...

800
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,360
A woman is a woman after all.

801
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,020
There's a computer in the car. Go get it.

802
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,470
This is a tracing program

803
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,400
developed by the organization.

804
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,470
With this,

805
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,600
we will be able to trace the call in 20 seconds.

806
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,740
I see.

807
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm Miyano.

808
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,050
I'm not at home right now.

809
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,570
Please leave your name and message

810
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,150
after the beep.

811
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,820
Sister, it's me.

812
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,770
The day after tomorrow,

813
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,460
I'll attend the opening ceremony of the twin towers.

814
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,170
(Unable to trace)

815
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,900
Kudo...

816
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,950
I knew it, you've been calling your sister.

817
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,480
You've been calling the apartment

818
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,520
which your sister rented secretly when she was alive.

819
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,710
It explains the matter.

820
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,760
You wanted to hear your sister's voice.

821
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,190
It's not that I don't understand you feelings,

822
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,290
but it's too dangerous...

823
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,060
No one would understand my feelings!

824
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,700
Haibara!

825
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,330
Hold on.

826
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,400
Let's just leave her alone now.

827
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,880
Damn it, we were so close!

828
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,860
Boss.

829
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,830
I'm Miyano. I'm not at home right now...

830
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,770
The message was erased.

831
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,810
Did that woman find out that we are here?

832
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,000
No, she didn't.

833
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,970
She deleted the messages

834
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,380
because she didn't want it to be heard by anyone.

835
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,180
She has no idea

836
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,880
we are listening to her by the phone.

837
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,080
Will she call again?

838
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,890
I don't think she will.

839
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,950
Anyway, I feel that even God is helping us now.

840
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,600
On the opening ceremony of the twin towers...

841
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,310
I can finally meet you, Sherry.

842
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,540
I will see your pale and rigid face after you die...

843
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,260
I'm sorry for what happened last night.

844
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,230
I know it's a dangerous thing to do

845
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,770
and that I have to change that habit.

846
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,630
Even so,

847
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,800
I still pick up the phone without knowing

848
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,970
when I feel lonely

849
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,700
and very scared.

850
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,670
I just want to hear my sister's voice,

851
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,840
even for less than ten seconds...

852
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,140
You fool,

853
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,480
you are not alone.

854
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,420
I think it's about time I had stopped doing this anyways.

855
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,020
I won't do it again.

856
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,450
I already deleted the messages,

857
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,220
so you don't have to worry.

858
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,670
However, I've been wondering lately.

859
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,170
Who am I?

860
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,970
Who am I?

861
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,140
Where do I belong...

862
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,110
I have no place to stay...

863
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,980
Haibara said that she didn't have a place to stay.

864
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,850
What are you talking about, Haibara?

865
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,890
Isn't that your seat?

866
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,520
My seat is here.

867
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,190
Mine is here.

868
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,320
Mine here.

869
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,830
See, I told you that you were not alone.

870
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,110
The wealthy lady still hasn't come?

871
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,940
She said that she already set off.

872
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,610
I'm so excited about the party.

873
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
I bet there will be a lot of delicious food.

874
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,890
I want to eat grilled eel over rice.

875
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,860
I don't think they'll have that...

876
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,970
Is it possible that Hara

877
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,520
worked for the Black Organization too?

878
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,660
It is possible.

879
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:49,770
They have been selecting talented young people

880
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,860
from the financial, medical

881
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,970
and chemical fields

882
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,670
since a long time ago.

883
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,440
What about Mr. Oki, the council member?

884
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,340
Though he was not talented enough

885
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,000
he was young indeed...

886
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,270
Anyway,

887
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,110
the organization

888
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,980
will kill anyone who tries to flee

889
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,170
or betray the organization

890
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,280
without mercy.

891
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,720
Just like how they are hunting me.

892
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,570
So, if the murderer is

893
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,320
among the four people...

894
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,470
That's right. Then it's very likely that the murder

895
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,130
has something to do with the Black Organization.

896
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,800
Hi, sorry everyone!

897
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,890
Sonoko,

898
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,770
what happened to your hair?

899
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,310
I felt like changing my style.

900
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,140
I got my hair permed like she did.

901
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,650
How do I look? Is it pretty?

902
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,090
You seem to have something to say.

903
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,820
No... nothing!

904
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,390
You were admiring Sister Sonoko.

905
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,790
Is that so, Conan?

906
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,160
No, I didn't...

907
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,440
Maybe I need to get a perm too.

908
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,440
Inspector, we should also go to the party.

909
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,540
No.

910
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,580
Since Miss Tokiwa rejected our proposal,

911
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,450
we can to stay here.

912
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,670
Now we can only pray that

913
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,010
nothing would happen...

914
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,260
Caviar, foie gras and roast duck!

915
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,630
I'm gonna go mad!

916
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,800
I want this too!

917
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,380
No, Professor, you should only have Japanese dishes.

918
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,270
I'll go get some low-calorie food for you.

919
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,510
That girl is like your wife.

920
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,020
Thanks to her, I'm always starving.

921
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,610
What a cool car!

922
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,550
This is a Ford Mustang Convertible.

923
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,970
But, how did they transport

924
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,720
such a big car here?

925
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,770
They must have disassembled the car first

926
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,730
and reassembled it here.

927
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,730
No.

928
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,060
They used the cargo elevator.

929
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,260
A cargo elevator?

930
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,360
There is one in the building I live.

931
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,870
It's larger than regular elevators.

932
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,100
It's easy to transport a closet with that.

933
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:10,970
Can an elephant fit in there?

934
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,010
I guess so.

935
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,340
No one would keep an elephant as a pet.

936
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,050
It's so beautiful.

937
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,970
That's right. If I could watch such splendid scenery

938
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,390
with Shinichi,

939
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,670
I'll be so...

940
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:33,630
That's what you are thinking, right?

941
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,030
What the hell are you talking about? Stop poking fun at me!

942
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,670
Actually, the original plan was to have the other building

943
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,270
provide a view of Mount Fuji as well.

944
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,970
However, that couldn't be accomplished

945
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,100
due to the foundations.

946
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,370
I see.

947
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,060
So we can't see Mount Fuji in Tower B.

948
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,100
Everyone, thank you for

949
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,020
taking your time to attend the opening party of

950
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,150
Tokiwa Corporation's twin towers.

951
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,700
Now, for entertainment,

952
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,720
I would like to invite everyone for a little game.

953
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,300
I learned this game

954
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,860
from my father, Tokiwa Kannari.

955
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,600
And in order to celebrate

956
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
the 30th anniversary of Tokiwa Corporation,

957
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,400
we'll play the game which is related to time.

958
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,400
The 30-seconds game.

959
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,380
That's the game Mitsuhiko showed us.

960
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,140
Whoever manages a perfect 30 seconds

961
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,910
or comes closest

962
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,100
will bring that Mustang Convertible

963
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,930
back home.

964
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,660
Awesome!

965
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,060
The prize is the car.

966
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,500
It's a foreign convertible!

967
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,260
That is so cool.

968
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,100
However, if there is a tie,

969
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,100
the winner will be decided by rock-paper-scissors

970
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,900
and the loser will have to make do

971
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,800
and receive this mountain bike and helmet.

972
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,740
I prefer the mountain bike.

973
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,710
Me too.

974
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,280
Because we can't drive.

975
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,320
Excellent, Mitsuhiko!

976
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,820
We have Ayumi here.

977
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,520
The winner will definitely be us!

978
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,350
Conan... where are you?

979
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,100
Anyone who wants to participate the game,

980
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,060
please hand in your watch.

981
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,900
Later, we'll present you a gem

982
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,990
which has the same value as your watch.

983
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,970
Amazing, she said gem!

984
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,830
Tokiwa Corporation sure is loaded.

985
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,350
Here, please take a flag.

986
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,110
Here.

987
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,080
Here.

988
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,380
I'll pass.

989
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,890
Me too.

990
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,330
I didn't wear a watch today,
neither do I want to participate in the game.

991
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,100
All the kids, please come to the front

992
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,660
so we could see you.

993
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,040
Huh? Conan and Haibara, are you guys not playing?

994
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,210
Now, let's get ready.

995
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,700
After she says 'Start', each one of you should start counting,

996
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,620
and raise your flag when you think 30 seconds have passed.

997
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,080
Let's do this!

998
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,120
Ready, start!

999
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,430
8, 9, 10... 15, 16...

1000
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,260
21, 22, 23...

1001
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,490
6, 7, 8... 8, 9, 10...

1002
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,260
7, 8, 9...

1003
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,930
24, 25, 26...

1004
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,480
Shoot, I lost count!

1005
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,400
All right.

1006
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,810
I'm done.

1007
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,610
Anyway, I'll just go with them...

1008
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,650
Okay!

1009
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,720
Okay, the guest who raised the blue flag.

1010
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,330
Congratulations, you have won!

1011
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,290
Dad!

1012
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,020
Really?

1013
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,830
If it isn't Senior Mouri.

1014
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,630
Please come over here.

1015
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,360
Excuse me.

1016
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,940
Everyone,

1017
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,470
the winner is Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective.

1018
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,070
Let's hear his speech.

1019
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,600
I could finally say goodbye to

1020
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,610
rental cars!

1021
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,510
Come on, dad.

1022
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,380
We lost.

1023
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,920
I counted to only 25.

1024
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,550
I thought it was only 12 seconds.

1025
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,860
I get it, next time please...

1026
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,900
Excuse me, Mr. Kazama. Would you come with me please?

1027
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,100
Sorry.

1028
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,400
Everyone, allow me to introduce our

1029
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,240
very special guest of the night.

1030
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,900
Introducing the most famous painter of Japan,

1031
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,310
Mr. Kisaragi and his masterpiece!

1032
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,120
Mr. Kisaragi loves Mount Fuji.

1033
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,300
He spent more than 30 years

1034
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,690
painting the majestic Mount Fuji.

1035
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,800
And now, to commemorate

1036
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,790
Tokiwa Mio's Twin Tower Building

1037
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,500
he presents his newest work!

1038
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,400
Please put your hands together for

1039
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,240
the 'Mount Fuji with Spring Snow.'

1040
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,100
That's...

1041
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,100
What?

1042
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,520
President!

1043
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,460
Damn it!

1044
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,400
Let her down.

1045
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,260
Get her down!

1046
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,930
Close the curtains!

1047
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,900
Yes!

1048
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,910
She's gone.

1049
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,150
The pearl necklace was hooked up to piano wire.

1050
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,300
And the piano wire is

1051
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,750
connected to the painting...

1052
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,190
That is...

1053
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,960
a sake up?

1054
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,400
Does this mean that the killer...

1055
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,630
What did you say? Tokiwa Mio was also...

1056
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,700
Let's go!

1057
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,650
The painting of Mount Fuji...

1058
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,560
You can see Mount Fuji here at night too.

1059
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,760
So that's what she meant.

1060
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,700
So the necklace which Mio wore

1061
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,530
was attached to the piano wire's hook.

1062
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,570
By passing it through the back,

1063
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,500
she was raised up

1064
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,440
when the painting lowered.

1065
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,530
I see.

1066
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,620
Who was on the stage at that time?

1067
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,180
Mr. Kisaragi and I.

1068
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,720
Please stand over there.

1069
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,480
Chiba, you stand at Tokiwa's place.

1070
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,560
Okay.

1071
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,100
Using these lights to mark our positions,

1072
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,650
Mio stood in the middle,

1073
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,830
I was here.

1074
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,870
You were not on the stage at that time, right?

1075
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,060
Yes, I was responsible for raising the painting.

1076
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,140
What about the pearl necklace.

1077
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,040
She said it was a gift from someone.

1078
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,910
But we don't know who.

1079
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,710
When was this painting transported here?

1080
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,370
Last night.

1081
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,300
Under Mr. Ksaragi's supervision,

1082
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,470
we carried it inside.

1083
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,100
That means,

1084
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,720
the person most likely to attach the piano wire was...

1085
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,760
Sorry, I know nothing.

1086
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,020
Speaking of which, Mr. Kisaragi,

1087
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,430
I heard that you were mad at Mio

1088
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,430
because she made a profit

1089
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,930
with your paintings.

1090
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,970
I wouldn't kill her because of that.

1091
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,100
Besides, according to what you just said,

1092
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,510
the one who did this should be a serial killer.

1093
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,510
If that's the case,

1094
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,100
I had an alibi

1095
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,740
when Mr. Hara was murdered.

1096
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,080
Doesn't it mean that I'm not the murderer?

1097
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,100
We didn't show Mr. Kisaragi

1098
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,710
the sake cups in the other crime scenes.

1099
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,900
So, it shouldn't be possible for him to put a sake cup there

1100
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,820
and frame the serial killer for this.

1101
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,550
Excuse me,

1102
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,960
when the lights were dimmed,

1103
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,000
I recall someone running toward Mio

1104
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,260
and saying something to her.

1105
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,360
Really?

1106
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,700
Was that person a male or female?

1107
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,100
There was a faint smell of the perfume at that time.

1108
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,640
Yeah, it was me!

1109
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,210
But... but...

1110
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,600
I went there to

1111
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,300
confirm the next program with the president.

1112
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,900
Inspector Megure,

1113
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,480
I think I know who the murderer is!

1114
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:44,060
It's you, Sawaguchi Chinami!

1115
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:47,620
No... no, why do you think it's me?

1116
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,130
Miss Sawaguchi,

1117
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,000
I heard that your father was

1118
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,260
a righteous journalist

1119
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:56,460
who always reported crimes committed by politicians, right?

1120
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,900
After you father passed away,

1121
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,600
you started working in Tokiwa Corporation

1122
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,240
as the secretary of the president.

1123
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,600
However, during the process of building the twin towers,

1124
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,780
you saw illegal deals taking place.

1125
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,150
After Mio and Mr. Hara made a discussion,

1126
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,550
they decided to bribe Mr. Oki, the councilman

1127
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,650
and ask him to amend the municipal law.

1128
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,400
As a result, just like your father before you,

1129
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
you couldn't tolerate such things.

1130
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,060
Thus, you killed the three of them.

1131
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,960
I didn't...

1132
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,270
But, Mr. Mouri,

1133
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,570
the sake cups which the murderer left at the crime scene

1134
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,540
has nothing to do with Miss Sawaguchi.

1135
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,040
No, Inspector Megure,

1136
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,480
The Kanji for sake cup is boar and kuchi.

1137
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,700
Miss Sawaguchi was born in the year of the boar.

1138
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,110
Plus, her name contains the character kuchi.

1139
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,850
Combining the two parts and you get "sake cup".

1140
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,300
Which means,

1141
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,950
she used sake cups to reveal her identity

1142
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,000
and smashed the cups

1143
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
to represent the anger that's killing her

1144
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,260
and send a message at the crime scene.

1145
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,860
That explains the matter!

1146
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,900
Though he's not asleep,

1147
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
his deduction sounds quite logical.

1148
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,310
That's just a bunch of crap you made up.

1149
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,940
What the hell did you say?

1150
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,140
That's because the sake cup wasn't broken this time.

1151
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,100
If she really wants to show that

1152
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,650
she was so angry that she wanted to break her body...

1153
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,550
Shut up, you brat!

1154
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,350
That hurts!

1155
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,400
You seem to be having a hard time.

1156
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,060
If you're aware, why don't you give me some advice?

1157
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,390
Well...

1158
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,900
The only thing I can say is that,

1159
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,440
Mio seemed to have drunken a lot of alcohol.

1160
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,510
If she wasn't so drunk,

1161
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,100
she would have at least felt something

1162
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,070
when something was hooked up to her neckless, right?

1163
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,980
The pearl.

1164
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,880
Why would it be here?

1165
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,280
Wait, does this mean...

1166
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,160
Mr. Kazama,

1167
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,200
I didn't do anything, you know it, right?

1168
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,900
I have no idea. It was too dark.

1169
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,790
So I didn't know what have happened...

1170
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,430
If that guy is the murderer...

1171
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,720
I see. So that's his motive!

1172
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,600
But if so,

1173
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,020
what about... what about that case...

1174
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,830
I see.

1175
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,530
It explains everything.

1176
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,510
Now I see

1177
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,540
the whole picture of the three mysterious murders.

1178
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:04,220
(Basement Level 4 Power Room)

1179
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:12,560
What was that?

1180
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,370
Why is the building shaking!

1181
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,910
Is it an earthquake?

1182
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,540
What on earth has happened?

1183
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:28,950
There was an explosion?

1184
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,690
Where?

1185
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,250
In the power room and the power generator room
at the 4th basement level!

1186
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,720
And the computer room on the 40th floor.

1187
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,050
The computer room...

1188
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:38,920
Mr. Kazama,

1189
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,760
the main computer of Tokiwa Corporation is there.

1190
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,200
All the important files will be gone!

1191
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,100
There's a fire on the 40th floor.

1192
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,640
Please evacuate everyone immediately!

1193
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,040
I understand!

1194
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,340
Inspector Megure, we must evacuate immediately!

1195
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,240
If the power room and the power generator room were both destroyed,

1196
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,280
that means the backup generator is also gone.

1197
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,470
So we can't use the elevators?

1198
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,910
Yes.

1199
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,780
No, the VIP elevator may still work.

1200
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,010
Really?

1201
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,320
It was designed for the VIP guests to escape.

1202
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,250
So it runs on an independent power source.

1203
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,360
It's working...

1204
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,530
What about the maximum load?

1205
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,190
It could carry 9 adults.

1206
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,790
It'll take too long for everyone to escape by the elevator.

1207
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,930
Is there another way to escape?

1208
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,230
The emergency stairs will reach the sky bridge at the 60th floor.

1209
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,370
From there, we can descend Tower B to the ground.

1210
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,000
All right, all elders, women and children

1211
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,810
take the elevator.

1212
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,320
The others take the emergency stairs.

1213
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,840
What's the situation?

1214
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,740
The power generator room was destroyed.

1215
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,710
The sprinklers are not working.

1216
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,780
What about the fire door?

1217
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,110
It was closed.

1218
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,620
What about the Sky Bridge which connects the two towers?

1219
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,450
There's an express elevator that connects to it.

1220
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,200
All right, Team A, Team B,

1221
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,290
go to the power room and power generator room!

1222
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:19,000
I'll lead Team C to the Sky Bridge from Tower B

1223
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,760
and then walk to the 40th floor.

1224
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,690
Yes.

1225
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,360
Get in there, Conan.

1226
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,330
Sister Ran, you should go in first.

1227
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,030
Just go.

1228
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,670
It's overloaded.

1229
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,900
Conan...

1230
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,540
It's fine, I'll take the next ride.

1231
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,380
Please go down.

1232
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,500
The remaining women, Conan,

1233
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,220
and Mr. Kisaragi,

1234
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,420
are to take the next elevator.

1235
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,580
I'll take the stairs.

1236
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,690
But, Mr. Kisaragi...

1237
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,200
Don't treat me like an elder!

1238
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,560
Okay... I see.

1239
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:03,300
Mr. Kazama, please lead the way.

1240
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,200
Okay, everyone,

1241
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,670
I'll be your guide. Please follow me!

1242
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,910
Shiratori, you should go with him.

1243
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,500
I'll catch up with you.

1244
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,880
Okay.

1245
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,870
Professor.

1246
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,920
Okay, leave it to me.

1247
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,360
Huh?

1248
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:30,060
Sorry.

1249
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:33,770
Please go ahead.

1250
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:34,700
But...

1251
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,100
It's fine.

1252
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,700
We'll go to Tower B

1253
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,870
through the Sky Bridge on the 60th floor.

1254
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,840
See you down there.

1255
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,510
Come on, hurry up.

1256
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,310
Thank you, kids.

1257
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,850
This is terrible. Why is it so dark here?

1258
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,290
I don't even know where we are.

1259
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,360
What should we do?

1260
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,550
I gave up my watch flashlight just now.

1261
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,900
This is bad.

1262
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,300
Seriously guys.

1263
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,400
You all should've considered that before exiting.

1264
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,960
That's right. Conan and Haibara didn't participate in the game.

1265
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:14,540
Let's go then!

1266
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,110
Wait.

1267
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,370
Why don't we wait for the next elevator?

1268
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,410
You're so stupid.

1269
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,010
The next one would surely be full.

1270
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,750
Anyway, let's get to the 60th floor first.

1271
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,600
(Tower B, 45th floor, the elevator lobby)

1272
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,910
Let's get in there!

1273
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,600
Judging from the size of the explosion

1274
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,860
and the concise planning...

1275
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,000
Is it possible that the people responsible

1276
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,770
were from the Black Organization?

1277
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:15,540
If so,

1278
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,900
I think I know why

1279
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,200
the computer room was blown up.

1280
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,040
But, why the power room...

1281
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,070
Please get in.

1282
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,280
Miss. Chinami, please get in too.

1283
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,610
We'll need you for questioning later.

1284
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,210
I understand.

1285
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,400
Did they do it to prevent the automatic sprinklers from working?

1286
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,670
Or maybe there's another reason?

1287
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:57,800
Luckily this elevator runs on an independent power supply.

1288
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,100
Otherwise we'll be so exhausted

1289
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,810
walking down the stairs.

1290
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,740
Could it be...

1291
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,390
Gin!

1292
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,370
Rest in peace, Sherry.

1293
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,180
Eternal peace.

1294
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,650
Sister Sonoko, your underpants is showing!

1295
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,200
What happened? What happened?

1296
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,030
Why did it stop?

1297
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,060
Is it... not her?

1298
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,560
The red dot disappeared.

1299
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:59,610
Did he find out that he got the wrong person?

1300
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,720
No, it stopped working!

1301
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,290
Sister Ran, raise me up!

1302
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,880
Okay...

1303
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,630
Conan, leave it to me!

1304
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,610
You can do it, Sister Ran!

1305
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,840
Please!

1306
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:49,950
You are awesome, Ran...

1307
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,000
(Tower A 45th floor regular elevator lobby)

1308
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,130
What floor is this?

1309
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,760
The 45th.

1310
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,970
This is the floor connected to the Sky Bridge.

1311
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,640
Oh no, there's so much smoke!

1312
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,750
Run to the bridge, we can get to the adjoining building!

1313
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,420
It's me. How's everything going with your side?

1314
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,990
She's not here... I've only seen men.

1315
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:34,800
Maybe she found out that we were looking for her.

1316
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,200
So she's still up there.

1317
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,100
I won't let you run away.

1318
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,030
Blow up the bridges.

1319
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,800
As long as we cross over the bridge,

1320
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,130
we can get to Tower B!

1321
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,920
It's the Sky Bridge!

1322
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,170
Watch out, Conan!

1323
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,510
What's happened?

1324
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,110
The Sky Bridge collapsed!

1325
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,810
Mr. Mouri, the VIP elevator has stopped.

1326
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,150
What?

1327
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,920
Ran...

1328
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,670
Ran, are you all right?!

1329
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,860
I'm fine!

1330
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,470
What should we do, Conan?

1331
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,740
This is terrible, there's no way back.

1332
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,070
There's smoke coming out from behind the fire door.

1333
01:09:58,350 --> 01:09:59,580
How could this be...

1334
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,960
What do we do?

1335
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,330
The battery is dead.

1336
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:12,520
It'll be dangerous for us to run around.

1337
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,790
Let's wait for help.

1338
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,240
Are you all right, Conan?

1339
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,320
Sister Ran, are you...

1340
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:38,500
I don't know if this will work

1341
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,190
like in the movies...

1342
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,970
Hold tight, Conan.

1343
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,730
It's Ran!

1344
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,540
What? Give me that!

1345
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,550
What are they trying to do?

1346
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,230
Sister Ran, aren't you scared?

1347
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,700
Of course I'm scared...

1348
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,670
But, you are with me now and

1349
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,400
Shinichi told me to wait for him.

1350
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,370
I can't die before Shinichi comes back...

1351
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:41,380
Conan, I...

1352
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:45,760
It's going to be all right, Sister Ran.

1353
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,320
I understand your feelings.

1354
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,700
No, the hose is on fire!

1355
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,680
Are you OK, Conan?

1356
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:51,990
You did great, Sister Ran.

1357
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,700
Mr. Mouri...

1358
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,800
Ran!

1359
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,270
I'm so glad that you are fine!

1360
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,810
Come on, you were so reckless.

1361
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:14,950
Run!

1362
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,410
Look, the VIP elevator.

1363
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,990
Professor! Where's that person?

1364
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,400
Sorry, I lost him...

1365
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,260
Also, I haven't seen the kids.

1366
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:35,490
What?

1367
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,470
Ayumi, Genta, Mitsuhiko!

1368
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,900
Can you hear me?

1369
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,500
Yes, Conan!

1370
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,370
Where are you guys?

1371
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,250
We are... in front of the Sky Bridge on the 60th floor.

1372
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,610
What?

1373
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,840
They are there?

1374
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,120
Takagi,

1375
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,380
call the rescue helicopter!

1376
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,650
Yes...

1377
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:17,080
(Tower B 60th floor elevator lobby)

1378
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:23,550
Mister, please lend me your flashlight!

1379
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,210
Boy, come back!

1380
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,340
What's that?

1381
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,390
That sound...

1382
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,690
It's the skateboard!

1383
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:32,850
Is that Conan?

1384
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:47,740
It hurts!

1385
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,140
That was amazing!

1386
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,470
You are so cool!

1387
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,410
You are a lifesaver!

1388
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,400
Come on.

1389
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,310
Now's not the time for admiration.

1390
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:00,020
What the?

1391
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,350
It's Conan's skateboard.

1392
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,050
Conan just crossed the Sky Bridge on the 60th floor.

1393
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,860
What?

1394
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,730
I'm Megure.

1395
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,590
Inspector.

1396
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,220
We are going up now.

1397
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,270
Please ask the helicopter to land at the roof.

1398
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,670
Where are you guys now?

1399
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,080
Climbing 15 floors is so tiring.

1400
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:30,710
Come on, Genta, we are almost there!

1401
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,680
You guys go up first.

1402
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:40,260
Conan, where are you going?

1403
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:47,930
Where are you going?

1404
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,060
What is he planning to do?

1405
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,400
I think

1406
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,230
Conan must have his reason.

1407
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,170
Let's get to the roof first.

1408
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,170
Let me think for a moment.

1409
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,880
(Tower A 75th floor Banquet Hall)

1410
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,190
Someone's there.

1411
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,400
It's the one who killed Mr. Oki

1412
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,660
and Miss. Mio.

1413
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,970
You wanted to kill Miss. Mio for some reason,

1414
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:26,060
so you presented her that pearl necklace

1415
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,610
and told her to wear it

1416
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,300
when she introduced the painting you donated

1417
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,410
on the opening party.

1418
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,480
Then the murderer is...

1419
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:38,820
That's right.

1420
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,620
Miss. Mio's Japanese painting teacher,

1421
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,220
Mr. Kisaragi.

1422
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,770
You are...

1423
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,240
My name is Conan Edogawa.

1424
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,670
I'm a detective.

1425
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,900
The pearl necklace

1426
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,940
which you presented to Miss. Mio.

1427
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:10,240
You made it easy to be removed, right?

1428
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:12,000
Then you

1429
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,950
prepared an identical necklace.

1430
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:16,800
At the party,

1431
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,460
you took the second necklace out

1432
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,500
and hooked it up to

1433
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,520
the piano wire which hung down along the fold on the curtain

1434
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,360
from the Mount Fuji painting.

1435
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:29,300
After that, you used the lights as a guide

1436
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,040
and took off Miss. Mio's necklace.

1437
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,130
After that, you said to the panicking Miss. Mio,

1438
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,510
"It's fine. I'll get it for you."

1439
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,210
Then you put on the other necklace on her neck.

1440
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,680
The one hooked up to the piano wire.

1441
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:46,480
Which means...

1442
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:47,500
Miss. Mio's necklace

1443
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,390
didn't get caught in the hook.

1444
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:51,600
Instead, the hook was already

1445
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,050
attached onto the necklace.

1446
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,960
That's why she didn't feel anything.

1447
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:59,500
The pearl I picked up

1448
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,700
is from the necklace

1449
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,900
which was removed by Mr. Kisaragi.

1450
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,900
The sake cup on the stage

1451
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:07,400
was put there because

1452
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,100
you wanted to make it look like another murder
committed by the serial killer.

1453
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,070
Wait,

1454
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:11,400
when Mr. Hara was killed,

1455
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,480
Mr. Kisaragi had an alibi.

1456
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,670
That's not strange.

1457
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,720
That's because the one who killed Mr. Hara is someone else.

1458
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,460
The fire has reached the 70th floor!

1459
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:34,160
Where is the helicopter?

1460
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:35,830
I'll check on that.

1461
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,670
Conan...

1462
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,230
That night, after we left,

1463
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,800
Mr. Kisaragi went to Mr. Hara's apartment

1464
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,570
to kill the latter.

1465
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,200
However,

1466
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,580
Mr. Hara was already shot in the chest and died.

1467
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,900
Therefore, you decided then to make it seem like

1468
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,450
a case of serial homicides.

1469
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,660
What's more, this could also be your alibi.

1470
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,030
If it's a serial homicide,

1471
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,900
as long as you have an alibi for one of the murders,

1472
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,060
you wouldn't be suspected for the rest.

1473
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,900
So you copied the scene of Mr. Oki's murder

1474
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,100
by smashing the sake up you brought there.

1475
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,000
At that time, pieces of the sake cup

1476
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,740
landed on the dried blood.

1477
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,100
That was why none of the pieces in the police's evidence bag

1478
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,780
had blood on them.

1479
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:23,700
Also, when I saw the picture of

1480
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:25,380
Mr. Oki death in the hotel,

1481
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,750
I noticed that the blood splatter
was only on the lower part of the closet.

1482
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,700
I think that's because

1483
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,160
the painting which you drew was hung there.

1484
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,560
You visited Mr. Oki

1485
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,400
with the excuse that you wanted to give him your paintings

1486
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,900
to let his guard down.

1487
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,740
That was some impressive reasoning, little detective.

1488
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,810
However, your reasoning lack...

1489
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,640
Of course I have proof.

1490
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,370
It's inside your walking stick.

1491
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:57,800
The pearl necklace which Miss. Mio originally wore

1492
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,880
should be hidden in there.

1493
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,760
How did you know that?

1494
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,940
The sound.

1495
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,970
After Miss. Mio died,

1496
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,100
your walking stick started to

1497
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,010
make different sound.

1498
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,150
Those are the ears of a detective.

1499
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,280
It's here.

1500
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:43,330
But what is the motive?

1501
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,700
Is it because she sold his paintings at a high price

1502
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,920
after she bought them?

1503
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:49,400
No, I think the motive should be

1504
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,970
this twin towers.

1505
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:54,900
His motive to kill Mr. Oki and Mr. Hara

1506
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,670
should be the same.

1507
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,680
During the presentation,

1508
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,800
I noticed that the Mount Fuji paintings which you drew

1509
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,910
all had the same angle and composition.

1510
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,600
That's because

1511
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,920
you drew them at the same place.

1512
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,200
I found a hill

1513
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,520
at the edge of Nishitamashi.

1514
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,000
Over the past decades,

1515
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,860
I've been painting on that hill.

1516
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,900
However, because I'm getting older and older,

1517
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:26,100
it became harder and harder for me to climb that hill.

1518
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:28,070
Therefore, three years ago,

1519
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,180
I bought that hill and built a house on it

1520
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,870
in order to continue to draw Mount Fuji

1521
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:35,280
for the rest of my life.

1522
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,300
I also built a workshop

1523
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,410
which had the best view of Mount Fuji.

1524
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,500
From that window,

1525
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:47,720
I could see the whole Mount Fuji.

1526
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:50,290
But that woman

1527
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,160
did that!

1528
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,900
So the broken sake cup

1529
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,870
symbolizes Mount Fuji...

1530
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,900
That's right. Because the twin towers

1531
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,780
divided Mount Fuji into two parts.

1532
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,850
That's his message of anger.

1533
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,100
But when Miss. Mio was killed,

1534
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,250
the sake cup wasn't broken.

1535
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,100
That cup was left at the crime scene

1536
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,720
in order to make the murder look like part of a serial homicide.

1537
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,100
There was also no need to

1538
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,120
leave the message.

1539
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,100
Since the painting of Mount Fuji

1540
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,470
was already cut in half by Miss. Mio's corpse.

1541
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,400
Since you already found the necklace,

1542
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,530
there is no way for me to defend myself anymore.

1543
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:50,320
Sorry.

1544
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:54,050
But as a detective, I can't let you die like this.

1545
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,660
We are here!

1546
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:02,700
How did you know

1547
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,600
Hosui Kisaragi's motive?

1548
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,300
On the way to his house,

1549
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,270
I already noticed something strange.

1550
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,700
When we arrived at Asahino station,

1551
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,100
behind Mitsuhiko was the view of Mount Fuji

1552
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,410
which was divided into two parts by the twin towers.

1553
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,100
And directly opposite Mount Fuji was

1554
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,350
Mr. Kisaragi's house.

1555
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:23,500
However, the curtains at the

1556
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,590
largest windows in his workshop were closed.

1557
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:28,500
Perhaps it's because he doesn't want others to see

1558
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,790
Mount Fuji which was divided into two parts by the twin towers.

1559
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,090
But there's one more thing...

1560
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,030
You want to know who killed Mr. Hara, right?

1561
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,470
This is just my assumption.

1562
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:41,200
He had a silver knife in his hand at that time.

1563
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,200
And the word 'silver' is spelled as G I N.

1564
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,340
You see,

1565
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,100
if you think of it as the name of an alcohol,

1566
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,380
the pronunciation will be different.

1567
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,450
Gin...

1568
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,350
It's likely that when Gin pointed the gun at Mr. Hara,

1569
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:04,020
the latter must have picked up the knife on the table.

1570
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,400
Maybe Gin assumed that

1571
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,530
Mr. Hara wanted to fight him with the knife.

1572
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,570
thus he didn't notice that
it was actually a message which Mr. Hara left.

1573
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:14,230
Mr. Hara used to work with them then?

1574
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,600
Yeah, perhaps Mr. Hara hacked into

1575
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,470
their computers and stole some confidential files.

1576
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,100
That's probably why they killed Mr. Hara

1577
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,980
and wiped out all the data in his computer.

1578
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:27,700
Finally, they blew up the main computer

1579
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,680
which might be used for transferring files in Tokiwa Corporation.

1580
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:34,790
So that's what have happened...

1581
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,760
Crap, the battery is dead.

1582
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,100
I'll go up to find someone to help

1583
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,960
carry Mr. Kisaragi.

1584
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,870
Wait for me here.

1585
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,440
(Tower B Rooftop Swimming Pool)

1586
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:16,600
Finally, we are saved!

1587
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,530
There's no wind now. They should be fine.

1588
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,450
Everyone, come back!

1589
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:38,560
Hurry up!

1590
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,070
Who... who did this?

1591
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,500
The helicopter

1592
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,510
won't be able to land anytime soon.

1593
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:58,270
They can only wait for the fire to die out.

1594
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,070
But before that...

1595
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,080
Time up.

1596
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:13,890
What is wrong with this building?

1597
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:17,590
Looks like we have to wait for the fire on the roof to go out.

1598
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,560
We don't have that much time.

1599
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:27,000
Bomb?!

1600
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,770
Every table has one.

1601
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,310
...and the timer.

1602
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,510
We only have four minutes left!

1603
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:41,880
Shoot, the whole banquet hall will blow up!

1604
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,100
So that no one would know

1605
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:44,750
who their target is...

1606
01:26:57,370 --> 01:26:58,630
Ran...

1607
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,930
Hurry up!

1608
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,980
Sir, the water won't reach!

1609
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,310
Damn it, will it not work?

1610
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,940
Wait.

1611
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,490
The roof over there.

1612
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,860
Great, the key's still here.

1613
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,400
Perfect, we can fly to the adjoining building

1614
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,560
in this car.

1615
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,140
That's impossible.

1616
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,170
The distance between the two buildings is 50 meters.

1617
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,100
If we want to fly over there,

1618
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,540
the flying distance should be 60 meters...

1619
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:41,940
The height difference between the two buildings is 20 meters.

1620
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,800
Objects on earth could

1621
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,880
move in a constant speed horizontally,

1622
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:49,400
but they'll fall at an accelerating rate

1623
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,690
due to gravity.

1624
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,200
When we fall from 20 meters,

1625
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,990
the formula to calculate time is

1626
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:59,190
t=√2s/g

1627
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:00,960
t stands for time,

1628
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:02,400
g stands for the acceleration of gravity,

1629
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,330
which is 9.80665 m/s^2,

1630
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,930
s stands for the distance to fall, which is 20 meters.

1631
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,180
After we plug those numbers into the formula,

1632
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,480
we can get the result.

1633
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,770
2.02 seconds.

1634
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,700
This means

1635
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,680
it'll only take 2 seconds for us to fall from 20 meters.

1636
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,520
If you want to make 60 meters in 2 seconds...

1637
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,650
You would need to move 30 meters in 1 second.

1638
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:25,100
Which means the speed required is

1639
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,420
108 kilometers per hour.

1640
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,220
Judging from the size of the hall,

1641
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:31,020
the car could at most reach a speed of 50 to 60 kilometers per hour.

1642
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,500
If we drive out the window at that speed,

1643
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,120
we'll plummet down before we reach the other side.

1644
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,830
What if I do this?

1645
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,240
You... you

1646
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,470
want to use the blast...

1647
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,940
What?

1648
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,370
What are you talking about?

1649
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,600
Conan wants to fly to the other building

1650
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,350
with the help of the blast of the explosion.

1651
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,210
What?!

1652
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:53,380
We are going to die anyway if we wait here.

1653
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,920
Let's give it a try.

1654
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,290
All right, Conan!

1655
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:00,050
Let's do this!

1656
01:29:00,190 --> 01:29:02,090
Let's go out with a bang!

1657
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,100
Whether we'll succeed depends upon the timing.

1658
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,800
If the bombs don't explode

1659
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,460
when the car

1660
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,330
goes through the windows,

1661
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,370
we'll decelerate and fall.

1662
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:18,070
The problem is that we can't see the timer when we are on the car.

1663
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,080
And my watch is dead.

1664
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,400
If that's the case,

1665
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,010
Ayumi should count the seconds.

1666
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,900
Ayumi should be able to

1667
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,050
count exactly 30 seconds!

1668
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:30,520
But didn't she just fail?

1669
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,660
What do you say, Ayumi? Can you do it?

1670
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,690
Though I'm not confident...

1671
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,700
But,

1672
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,350
as long as I'm with Conan...

1673
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:42,100
As long as Conan stays by my side,

1674
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,400
I think I can do it!

1675
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,200
Ayumi...

1676
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,900
I'll stay beside the timer

1677
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,110
until there's 30 seconds left.

1678
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,650
After that I'll get in the car. What do you think?

1679
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,250
There's no time for second thoughts.

1680
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:00,850
Let's do it that way.

1681
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:04,620
What? There are bombs in the hall?

1682
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,560
Open the roof of the dome immediately.

1683
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:08,750
The roof...

1684
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,330
Come on, hurry up!

1685
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,520
Mr. Kazama!

1686
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,760
It's me.

1687
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,840
Immediately open the roof of the dome!

1688
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:17,800
Do it now!

1689
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,030
I'm sorry.

1690
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:21,230
What are you going to do, Conan?

1691
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,300
Sister Ran,

1692
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,140
I'll go to you now.

1693
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,410
Conan...

1694
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:53,510
55,

1695
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:54,410
54,

1696
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,310
53,

1697
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:56,210
52,

1698
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,110
51,

1699
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:58,010
50,

1700
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:58,910
49,

1701
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,810
48,

1702
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,810
47,

1703
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:01,810
46,

1704
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:02,810
45,

1705
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:03,810
44,

1706
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:04,810
43,

1707
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,810
42,

1708
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:06,810
41,

1709
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:07,810
40,

1710
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:08,810
39,

1711
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:09,810
38,

1712
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:10,810
37,

1713
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:11,710
36,

1714
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:12,710
35,

1715
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:13,710
34,

1716
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:14,710
33,

1717
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:15,710
32,

1718
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,710
31,

1719
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:17,630
30,

1720
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:18,630
29,

1721
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:19,630
28...

1722
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:20,600
Hibara!

1723
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,600
What happened?

1724
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,800
Hibara... she's still counting!

1725
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:25,770
What?

1726
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:28,810
Hibara, what are you doing? Come over here!

1727
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:32,240
You fool. Isn't this more accurate?

1728
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:33,510
Does she plan to

1729
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:35,310
stay here and sacrifice herself?

1730
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:36,250
21,

1731
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,610
20.

1732
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,360
What are you doing?!

1733
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,930
My mom said that

1734
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,100
if you leave even a grain of rice in the bowl,

1735
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,400
you would be punished by god.

1736
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,360
We are going now!

1737
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,350
Haibara!

1738
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,990
I won't let go! I won't...

1739
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,900
Shoot, the trajectory...

1740
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,250
Haibara will hit the pillar.

1741
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,290
Let me borrow this!

1742
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,690
Conan!

1743
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,830
Sister Ran!

1744
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:02,300
We are fine!

1745
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,390
This is great!

1746
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:08,470
By the way, Conan,

1747
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:10,510
where did you learn how to drive?

1748
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,130
In Hawaii, at my father's...

1749
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:23,000
Boss, the people who got out in the car

1750
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,420
were five kids and an old man.

1751
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,700
I think that woman

1752
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,350
didn't go to the party.

1753
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:31,100
Forget about it.

1754
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,630
We already achieved our original purpose.

1755
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:34,630
Yeah...

1756
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:38,400
I can't believe that man betrayed us

1757
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,570
and hacked into the organization's computer.

1758
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,700
We know who did it, boss.

1759
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,800
The hacker came from the twin towers

1760
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,140
in Nishitamashi.

1761
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,440
I knew it was that guy.

1762
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,310
We already got rid of Hara,

1763
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:55,410
and blew up the main computer of Tokiwa Corporation.

1764
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:59,550
The information about our organization wouldn't be leaked.

1765
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,600
I wanted to make that building

1766
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,400
the place to execute that woman.

1767
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:08,200
I guess I'll save that pleasure

1768
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,590
for another time then.

1769
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:30,980
I can't believe Mr. Kisaragi is the murderer.

1770
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:32,460
This is so shocking.

1771
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,680
Is it?

1772
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:36,990
I found him suspicious from the beginning.

1773
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:38,530
The police's investigation

1774
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:40,030
will probably stop here.

1775
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:43,600
The investigation into Mr. Hara's murder which was committed by Gin

1776
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,660
will go nowhere.

1777
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,510
The truth of the explosion

1778
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:49,710
won't be revealed either.

1779
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,410
Thanks for what you did just now.

1780
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:57,040
Thanks to you that I was saved.

1781
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,810
It's nothing.

1782
01:34:58,920 --> 01:34:59,600
I just fulfilled my duty

1783
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,610
as a man.

1784
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,020
Thank you too, Kojima.

1785
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,650
So, I'm like a grain of rice to you, huh?

1786
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:10,420
By the way, Ayumi,

1787
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:11,600
how did you manage to

1788
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,470
accurately count down from 30 seconds?

1789
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,260
It's just by coincidence.

1790
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,130
Actually, it's all because of Conan.

1791
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,900
When you are around me,
I'll become nervous and my heart starts to race.

1792
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,440
That's how I count time by counting my heartbeat.

1793
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:28,200
Come to think of it,

1794
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,950
the first time you managed to win the 30s game...

1795
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:34,250
28, 29, 30!

1796
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:35,600
That's why you said that

1797
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,350
as long as I was with you...

1798
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:39,650
Mitsuhiko, you were pretty cool!

1799
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,560
I'm not.

1800
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:41,630
So are you, Genta!

1801
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:43,360
Ha... really?

1802
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,430
What are you going to do?

1803
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:47,530
What do you mean...

1804
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:49,600
If you break Yoshida's heart,

1805
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,470
I'll never forgive you.

1806
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,120
Wait!

1807
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:07,820
Is this car...

1808
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:08,870
That's right.

1809
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,100
That's your prize.

1810
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:13,100
The Mustang Convertible.

1811
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:16,770
My dream car...

1812
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:26,140
Wait.

1813
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:29,810
Maybe it could still function after it dries...
