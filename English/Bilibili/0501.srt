1
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.566
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.266
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.966
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.966
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.466
Eisuke Hondo who searches for the whereabouts of his sister and father,

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.566
lands up at Haido Central Hospital

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.166
where the FBI was hiding the Organization member, Kir,

8
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.066
"Rena Mizunashi, Kir" -commonly known as Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.766
"Jodie Starling" -We had tracked down Rikumichi Kusuda,

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:31.166
a member of the Organization sent to get Rena back.

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.566
But when he failed to report,

12
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.866
"Gin, Vodka" -Gin and the others finally make their move,

13
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.466
"Gin, Vodka" -and we are ruthlessly attacked by them.

14
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.766
"Vermouth"

15
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.566
"James Black" -During the uproar over the bombs

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.066
the Organization had planted,

17
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.266
"Camel Andre" -we execute a plan to move Rena Mizunashi.

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.466
Gin sees through our plan

19
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:52.466
and Rena Mizunashi is taken away by the Black Organization.

20
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.066
"Shuichi Akai" -However, it was a plan

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.666
that Mr. Akai and I had thought up.

22
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:03.366
Rena Mizunashi actually happens to be an agent of the CIA,

23
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.666
"Rena Mizunashi, Hidemi Hondo" -and also Eisuke's older sister, Hidemi.

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.466
Due to the bone-marrow surgery that he underwent when he was a child,

25
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.466
his blood type had changed.

26
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.866
We also found out that...

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.766
"Ethern Hondo" -Ethern Hondo being killed by Rena Mizunashi,

28
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.966
was actually a one-man act carried out by Ethern himself

29
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.166
to save his daughter's life from the Organization.

30
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.066
I hope you're not going to tell me

31
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.966
to go back to the Organization again.

32
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.566
Of course.

33
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.566
That's what I'm going to ask you to do.

34
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.366
Sizzling hot suspense.

35
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.866
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

36
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.466
The fight to get Rena Mizunashi has ended?

37
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.766
The suspect for a new incident...

38
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.266
is a FBI agent.

39
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.766
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.466
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

42
00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:40.722
"Red and Black Crash: Suspicion"

43
00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.722
"Haido Central Hospital" -I see.

44
00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:48.722
So, you deliberately gave Rena Mizunashi over to those guys.

45
00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:50.922
You told her to sneak in there

46
00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:53.922
and investigate all kinds of things about them as she had previously doing.

47
00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:54.922
Yes.

48
00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.022
Not as one who cooperates with the FBI,

49
00:03:57.022 --> 00:04:00.022
but as a CIA agent.

50
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:02.522
Which means that the sound of you being struck

51
00:04:02.522 --> 00:04:04.122
just before the Organization got her back

52
00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.122
was also foul play?

53
00:04:07.722 --> 00:04:09.022
Yes.

54
00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:12.222
Mr. Akai told me to act like I had passed out after being struck

55
00:04:12.222 --> 00:04:15.222
and to stop the car.

56
00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:20.222
I didn't think that I was really going to be struck though.

57
00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:23.722
I asked her to do so.

58
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:27.422
Because if by chance, you happened to be killed.

59
00:04:27.422 --> 00:04:30.522
If there is no trace on your neck that you had been struck,

60
00:04:30.522 --> 00:04:33.222
it would endanger the life of Rena Mizunashi.

61
00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.722
True.

62
00:04:35.722 --> 00:04:37.122
But...

63
00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:39.522
If so, it wouldn't have hurt to tell us so!

64
00:04:39.522 --> 00:04:41.722
Exactly.

65
00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:45.122
You can't even tell how shocked and depressed we were

66
00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:47.322
to find that she had been taken by them again.

67
00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:49.322
That's exactly what we were after.

68
00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.822
It's more than likely that

69
00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:54.822
they had been monitoring the wireless of the FBI.

70
00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:58.522
Unless we are genuinely disappointed about her being taken away,

71
00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:01.022
they probably wouldn't have been convinced.

72
00:05:01.022 --> 00:05:04.422
It had to be real, no acting.

73
00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:06.922
But, I just can't figure how you could even think of returning her back

74
00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:08.922
into the Organization as an agent of the CIA.

75
00:05:08.922 --> 00:05:11.522
It's not like we plain returned her.

76
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:12.722
We told her that...

77
00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:15.322
after we report the Organization's information to CIA headquarters,

78
00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:22.322
It... it's amazing that she agreed to something like that.

79
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.622
Yes.

80
00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:26.522
Of course she came up with a request

81
00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.622
that was equal to what we asked her to do.

82
00:05:29.622 --> 00:05:32.422
The witness protection program?

83
00:05:32.422 --> 00:05:34.622
You want us to apply that to your younger brother?

84
00:05:34.622 --> 00:05:36.022
Yes.

85
00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:39.022
I'll write to Ei-chan telling him

86
00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:41.222
to obey the request.

87
00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:43.822
You'll do that for me, won't you?

88
00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:46.922
After all you're telling me to deliberately return to a place

89
00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.922
where they suspect me of being a spy for the CIA.

90
00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:50.122
Yeah.

91
00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:53.622
I guarantee the FBI will take care of your younger brother.

92
00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:55.922
And...

93
00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.322
No matter what the reason maybe...

94
00:05:58.322 --> 00:06:01.022
the mission of my father for CIA will be top priority.

95
00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:03.522
So, please don't be offended

96
00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:05.522
if it turns out to be inconvenient for the FBI.

97
00:06:05.522 --> 00:06:09.522
Yes. I was just thinking of saying the same thing.

98
00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:14.022
Right, sonny?

99
00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:15.922
Yep.

100
00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:18.822
Witness Protection Program...

101
00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:22.222
I'm pretty sure it can be applied to him

102
00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:25.322
because he knows the email address of the boss.

103
00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:28.022
But I'm worried about the people in this hospital too!

104
00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:31.222
Those guys will probably think that they all protected Rena Mizunashi here

105
00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:34.822
in cooperation with the FBI.

106
00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:35.922
We've got to do something.

107
00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.322
It'll be fine.

108
00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:41.022
-Huh? -I think it's about time that Rena Mizunashi is...

109
00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:48.822
Don't do anything to that hospital?

110
00:06:48.822 --> 00:06:50.922
Are you saying to leave the people that lent a hand to the FBI alone

111
00:06:50.922 --> 00:06:52.422
without doing anything?

112
00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:56.322
No. It looks like they didn't cooperate or anything.

113
00:06:56.322 --> 00:06:57.922
It seems that the FBI lied saying that

114
00:06:57.922 --> 00:07:01.922
I was Shuichi Akai's younger sister and hospitalized me.

115
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.522
But you're a popular announcer that everyone knows.

116
00:07:05.522 --> 00:07:09.022
They had to say I resembled her a number of times.

117
00:07:09.022 --> 00:07:10.422
If I were to be the announcer herself,

118
00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:14.222
I'm sure the media would've made a big fuss over it too.

119
00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:17.522
Of course I'm sure that the FBI was doing their best

120
00:07:17.522 --> 00:07:21.022
to hide my whereabouts too.

121
00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:23.722
What's up, Kir?

122
00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:26.522
Why are you so hung up about that hospital?

123
00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:28.622
Is there something to that place?

124
00:07:28.622 --> 00:07:29.722
No.

125
00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:35.622
It's just that I don't feel good about killing people

126
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.922
who gave me treatment for my wounds.

127
00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:43.122
Besides, if that hospital was cooperating with the FBI,

128
00:07:43.122 --> 00:07:46.522
as soon as they find out that you guys are coming to get me back,

129
00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:49.822
I'm sure they would've taken some sort of measure toward it.

130
00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:52.622
I guess we won't do anything for now,

131
00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:54.322
with all due respect for you.

132
00:07:54.322 --> 00:07:56.522
For now?

133
00:07:56.522 --> 00:07:57.922
I don't like the idea.

134
00:07:57.922 --> 00:07:59.222
Huh?

135
00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:01.122
I can't believe that Akai would think up a plan

136
00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:05.322
that would so simply get Kir back to us.

137
00:08:05.322 --> 00:08:08.422
I'm sure he's still got something up his sleeve.

138
00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:13.522
Come to think of it, we didn't get to kill him.

139
00:08:13.522 --> 00:08:15.022
Right.

140
00:08:15.022 --> 00:08:17.622
I was so sure that he would show up one way or another

141
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.022
when we went to get Kir back.

142
00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:25.022
Maybe that's just the kind of man he was to begin with?

143
00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:57.122
Oh, so that announcer called Rena Mizunashi was a CIA agent.

144
00:08:57.122 --> 00:08:58.422
Yeah.

145
00:08:58.422 --> 00:09:02.622
Thanks to her agreeing to go back into the Black Organization,

146
00:09:02.622 --> 00:09:05.222
we're finally getting somewhere.

147
00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:07.822
Which means we have a chance of crushing them.

148
00:09:07.822 --> 00:09:10.222
Well. I guess you already know,

149
00:09:10.222 --> 00:09:13.122
but don't make too light of the Organization.

150
00:09:13.122 --> 00:09:14.422
Gin, in particular.

151
00:09:14.422 --> 00:09:17.122
Yeah. I know.

152
00:09:17.122 --> 00:09:19.422
I wonder if you really know.

153
00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:20.522
Huh?

154
00:09:20.522 --> 00:09:23.422
And that boy Eisuke...

155
00:09:23.422 --> 00:09:26.122
did he say he was going to accept the Witness Protection Program?

156
00:09:26.122 --> 00:09:27.322
No.

157
00:09:27.322 --> 00:09:29.322
I heard that he doesn't want to.

158
00:09:29.322 --> 00:09:30.522
Although it seems that the people of the FBI

159
00:09:30.522 --> 00:09:32.722
are trying to explain it to him.

160
00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:35.522
I would think so. I refused too.

161
00:09:35.522 --> 00:09:38.522
Well, I guess it can't be helped

162
00:09:38.522 --> 00:09:39.922
because it's a system in which your name

163
00:09:39.922 --> 00:09:40.922
and citizenship are completely changed

164
00:09:40.922 --> 00:09:43.022
and you end up being a totally different person.

165
00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:44.522
The fact is...

166
00:09:44.522 --> 00:09:46.822
I'm hoping that he would refuse just like you did

167
00:09:46.822 --> 00:09:50.122
and work alongside me.

168
00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:54.422
He maybe a klutz but he sure is sharp.

169
00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:56.122
But, are sure he'll be okay?

170
00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:58.322
Because unlike me, it seems that he'll go on his own

171
00:09:58.322 --> 00:09:59.522
and do something reckless.

172
00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:01.022
No need to worry.

173
00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:04.722
For now, Jodie and Mr. Akai are always near him.

174
00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:07.322
Oh, I'd sure like to meet

175
00:10:07.322 --> 00:10:08.722
this man called Akai.

176
00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:10.122
Huh? Why?

177
00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:11.722
No matter what you maybe on the inside,

178
00:10:11.722 --> 00:10:14.722
you outwardly look to be a first grader.

179
00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:16.722
I'm really interested in him,

180
00:10:16.722 --> 00:10:18.922
because despite you being a child,

181
00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:20.022
this sharp FBI agent lends an ear to you.

182
00:10:20.022 --> 00:10:22.722
Oh yeah...

183
00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.122
What?

184
00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.222
Is there any reason you can't introduce him to me?

185
00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:27.522
Oh, no.

186
00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:29.522
I couldn't possibly tell her.

187
00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:30.722
Hey...

188
00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:33.322
I can't possibly tell her that he's the guy that approached your sister,

189
00:10:33.322 --> 00:10:35.522
so that he could sneak into the Organization,

190
00:10:35.522 --> 00:10:36.922
became her lover

191
00:10:36.922 --> 00:10:40.322
and as a result created a reason for them to kill her.

192
00:10:40.322 --> 00:10:43.222
I'm sure she already knows what he looks like besides.

193
00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:44.522
Don't tell me that...

194
00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:45.622
Don't tell me that he's...

195
00:10:46.622 --> 00:10:48.822
That he has Lolita complex

196
00:10:48.822 --> 00:10:50.922
or something like that?

197
00:10:50.922 --> 00:10:52.522
Huh? You mean I'm right?

198
00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:53.722
Talk about stupid!

199
00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:57.622
You guys are talking secrets, just the two of you again!

200
00:10:57.622 --> 00:10:59.922
You just said stupid, didn't you?

201
00:10:59.922 --> 00:11:03.222
Hey, I hope you weren't talking about me?

202
00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:05.322
No, we weren't.

203
00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:08.122
We were talking about the buffet we're headed for.

204
00:11:08.122 --> 00:11:11.622
Right, we didn't say stupid,

205
00:11:11.622 --> 00:11:13.922
but was wondering if they'd have stewed buttered clam.

206
00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:14.922
Huh?

207
00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:16.122
Stewed buttered clam?

208
00:11:16.122 --> 00:11:18.322
Stewed buttered, what's that?

209
00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:20.722
I never heard of that before!

210
00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.422
Well... it's said to be very tasty.

211
00:11:23.422 --> 00:11:26.122
That this especially is reputed to be a delicious dish

212
00:11:26.122 --> 00:11:29.922
of the buffet in this hotel.

213
00:11:33.222 --> 00:11:34.922
That's amazing!

214
00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:36.822
There are so many dishes!

215
00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:38.922
Yes, there sure are a lot to choose from!

216
00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:41.122
You mean, this is really all-you-can-eat stuff?

217
00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:43.222
Yeah. But don't over eat

218
00:11:43.222 --> 00:11:44.622
and come down with a stomach ache, mind you.

219
00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:47.822
-Everything looks so delicious! -I'm going to take a lot!

220
00:11:47.822 --> 00:11:51.222
I'll take this, and this...

221
00:11:53.222 --> 00:11:55.522
Doing something like this at times is good too, isn't it?

222
00:11:55.522 --> 00:11:56.522
Yeah.

223
00:11:58.522 --> 00:12:00.922
A police car? This hotel?

224
00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:07.722
Officer Takagi!

225
00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:11.922
Oh! Conan!

226
00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:15.122
What? A homicide?

227
00:12:15.122 --> 00:12:17.022
You mean at this hotel?

228
00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:18.322
Quiet.

229
00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:20.822
Since this has still not been made public.

230
00:12:20.822 --> 00:12:23.422
And, who was killed?

231
00:12:23.422 --> 00:12:27.022
The president of a foreign talent production company

232
00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:30.522
that has an office on the 39th floor of this hotel.

233
00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:32.922
The one who found him is his secretary

234
00:12:32.922 --> 00:12:34.322
and she says that when she got back,

235
00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:37.722
she found him smeared with blood sitting in his chair.

236
00:12:37.722 --> 00:12:41.122
He's been shot in several places in the top part of his body.

237
00:12:41.122 --> 00:12:42.522
According to his secretary,

238
00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:47.022
the president had an appointment to meet a new talent,

239
00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:50.822
so the suspicious one is that person.

240
00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:53.822
It's a man that the president saw on the street and scouted,

241
00:12:53.822 --> 00:12:56.022
but his secretary hasn't met him yet,

242
00:12:56.022 --> 00:12:59.322
so she doesn't know what he looks like or what his name is.

243
00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:01.622
What time did the secretary report this?

244
00:13:01.622 --> 00:13:04.022
About two or three minutes ago.

245
00:13:04.022 --> 00:13:06.922
The estimated time of the crime is one or two minutes before that.

246
00:13:06.922 --> 00:13:09.422
I just happened to be doing some questioning nearby,

247
00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.422
that's why I was able to come here right away.

248
00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:14.422
How did you figure out the time he was murdered?

249
00:13:14.422 --> 00:13:16.822
The secretary was in the warehouse two floors down

250
00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:20.622
organizing some things.

251
00:13:20.622 --> 00:13:22.322
About five minutes ago,

252
00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:24.622
the president asked her to check on something for him,

253
00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:27.922
and she called him a minute later to report what she found,

254
00:13:27.922 --> 00:13:30.322
but she said she got the answer phone.

255
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:35.122
Which means that the killer may still be inside this hotel.

256
00:13:35.122 --> 00:13:37.422
Huh? I think more than five minutes have passed

257
00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:39.822
since it happened though.

258
00:13:39.822 --> 00:13:40.822
But just look at that.

259
00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:44.622
Out of the three elevators there are,

260
00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:47.422
the second elevator is out of order and under maintenance,

261
00:13:47.422 --> 00:13:49.122
and first elevator is moving,

262
00:13:49.122 --> 00:13:50.222
but since everybody rides it,

263
00:13:50.222 --> 00:13:51.922
it takes a while for it to come,

264
00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:53.322
so I think it's constantly full of people

265
00:13:53.322 --> 00:13:56.022
from the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

266
00:13:56.022 --> 00:13:57.722
I see...

267
00:13:57.722 --> 00:13:59.922
I guess you can't ride it if it's full.

268
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.022
Huh? Why not?

269
00:14:02.022 --> 00:14:03.422
Because after you shoot a gun,

270
00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:05.322
the smell of gun powder sticks on.

271
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.022
So, I guess the killer would avoid

272
00:14:10.022 --> 00:14:11.622
getting on an elevator that's full.

273
00:14:11.622 --> 00:14:16.822
Which means the killer went up five flights of stairs,

274
00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.622
and is eating at the restaurant arcade on the top floor,

275
00:14:19.622 --> 00:14:22.622
or is hiding in the restroom of that floor,

276
00:14:22.622 --> 00:14:25.422
or is perspiring profusely and going down the stairs.

277
00:14:25.422 --> 00:14:27.722
Either way, if the person speaks Japanese

278
00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:31.122
and is a foreigner who is working as a talent,

279
00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:33.622
it shouldn't be difficult to find the person, right?

280
00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:54.475
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production"

281
00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:04.375
Then, when you found President Sunouchi,

282
00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:07.175
there was no one in this room?

283
00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:09.475
No, there wasn't.

284
00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:14.475
And what did the president want you to check for him?

285
00:15:14.475 --> 00:15:17.475
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -He asked me to pick out the files of the talents

286
00:15:17.475 --> 00:15:20.475
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -who were hired 10 years ago.

287
00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:21.975
Since I finished doing so,

288
00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:24.775
I called him to ask him if he wanted me to take them to him.

289
00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:27.575
But after many calls,

290
00:15:27.575 --> 00:15:30.375
I just got the answer phone.

291
00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:35.275
By the way, do you happen to have any idea who that new talent

292
00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:37.075
that the president was going to meet today was?

293
00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:40.775
No, until the president formally hires you,

294
00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:43.975
he doesn't let anyone see you.

295
00:15:43.975 --> 00:15:46.075
It was the same for me too.

296
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:48.775
Which means you're a talent too?

297
00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:50.075
Yes.

298
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:53.675
But, since I can't write Japanese,

299
00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:57.875
he told me to work as his secretary and study for a while.

300
00:15:57.875 --> 00:16:00.575
But Kanji is so difficult

301
00:16:00.575 --> 00:16:02.775
that I have all emails from the president

302
00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:04.675
written to me in English even now.

303
00:16:06.275 --> 00:16:07.675
But, without knowing what the culprit looks like

304
00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:10.075
or not even knowing the name,

305
00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:12.575
it's going to be pretty tough finding the culprit.

306
00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:13.975
No! Inspector Megure!

307
00:16:13.975 --> 00:16:16.575
Huh? Oh, Officer Takagi?

308
00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.975
Inspector! We've found two!

309
00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:20.075
What?

310
00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:22.975
Both are suspicious foreigners who speak fluent Japanese.

311
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:25.875
Suspicious? What's suspicious about them?

312
00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:26.875
Yes sir.

313
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:30.075
One of them was loitering around the restaurant

314
00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:33.175
and the other was hiding in the toilet.

315
00:16:35.075 --> 00:16:38.675
So, what makes them suspicious?

316
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:42.675
Conan said so.

317
00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.775
Takagi.

318
00:16:44.775 --> 00:16:47.575
Since there's only one elevator working right now,

319
00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:51.275
any foreigner that is near the areas I just mentioned should be suspected.

320
00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:53.275
Don't tell me you told him about the case

321
00:16:53.275 --> 00:16:54.375
without permission again?

322
00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:56.375
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:58.975
I guess I just did it out of habit.

324
00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:01.675
But, all for the better!

325
00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:04.575
He was able to bring in suspects like them.

326
00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:06.075
It's nothing to complain about.

327
00:17:07.575 --> 00:17:08.975
Takagi.

328
00:17:08.975 --> 00:17:10.775
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:10.775 --> 00:17:13.875
And were they the only two you found?

330
00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.675
Oh, no.

331
00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:18.675
Officer Chiba and the others are checking the stairs.

332
00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:19.975
Inspector!

333
00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:22.675
-How was it? -I found one more!

334
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.875
He's a pretty suspicious foreigner

335
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:27.675
who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs!

336
00:17:27.675 --> 00:17:29.075
See! Come over here!

337
00:17:29.075 --> 00:17:31.875
Oh, so like I've been saying you're mistaken.

338
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.975
Never mind, just hurry up and do as you're told!

339
00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:41.175
Conan.

340
00:17:41.175 --> 00:17:42.875
Agent Camel?

341
00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:44.775
Why...

342
00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:50.675
Oh, right.

343
00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:53.675
It's a secret to the Japanese police

344
00:17:53.675 --> 00:17:55.975
that he's here as an agent of the FBI.

345
00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:58.475
But, why was he here at this hotel

346
00:17:58.475 --> 00:17:59.875
which is the site of a crime?

347
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:03.475
And, why is he dressed in a jersey outfit?

348
00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.975
So, there are three suspects.

349
00:18:09.975 --> 00:18:10.975
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Yes.

350
00:18:10.975 --> 00:18:13.175
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -This is Mr. Toby Keynes who was loitering

351
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.575
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -around the restaurant arcade on the top floor.

352
00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:16.975
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -He's Mr. Hal Buckner

353
00:18:16.975 --> 00:18:18.775
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -who was hiding in the toilet on the same floor.

354
00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:21.575
"Andre Camel, age 27" -And this is Mr. Andre Camel

355
00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:23.875
"Andre Camel, age 27" -who was perspiring profusely going down the stairs.

356
00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.475
Hey...

357
00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:28.575
it sounds bad when you say I was loitering.

358
00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:32.075
I was just trying to decide where to eat.

359
00:18:33.475 --> 00:18:35.575
I see you speak fluent Japanese.

360
00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:39.775
Yeah, my father's American and my mother's Japanese.

361
00:18:39.775 --> 00:18:42.575
That's why I'm working as a model,

362
00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:44.975
because of my Caucasian looks.

363
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.975
Do you know the fashion magazine called Annnon?

364
00:18:49.975 --> 00:18:53.175
I'm on the pages sometimes.

365
00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:54.775
Confirm it later, will you?

366
00:18:54.775 --> 00:18:56.175
Yes, sir.

367
00:18:56.175 --> 00:18:58.575
I'm...

368
00:18:58.575 --> 00:19:02.875
It... it's not that I was hiding in the toilet either.

369
00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.275
I was troubled about a student of mine, so...

370
00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:06.275
A student?

371
00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:08.375
Oh, I'm working as an English teacher

372
00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:11.375
at a prep school near here.

373
00:19:11.375 --> 00:19:15.175
I fell in love with one of the students there,

374
00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:16.275
so I was planning to call her over to the restaurant on the top floor

375
00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:18.775
and came here.

376
00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:20.275
But, when the time came to call her,

377
00:19:20.275 --> 00:19:21.875
I couldn't think of what to say.

378
00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:24.575
That's why when came out of the toilet, you're looking pale.

379
00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:25.775
Yes.

380
00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:27.675
When I'm worried, I like to be alone.

381
00:19:30.275 --> 00:19:34.075
Now, what were you doing

382
00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:35.375
running down the stairs perspiring profusely?

383
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:39.075
Can't you tell? I was training.

384
00:19:39.075 --> 00:19:41.575
The height and the length of the stairs in this hotel

385
00:19:41.575 --> 00:19:44.475
is just great for training.

386
00:19:44.475 --> 00:19:47.375
I can't afford getting out of shape, in the line of work I do.

387
00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:51.675
I used to come here in the past when I found the time.

388
00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:52.875
In the past?

389
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:53.875
Yes.

390
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:56.575
I found it when I came to Japan two years ago.

391
00:19:56.575 --> 00:19:59.175
You know the juice that they have at the restaurant on the top floor.

392
00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:00.975
The special fruit juice.

393
00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:05.375
I just couldn't forget how delicious it is to drink after training.

394
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:06.375
So, I had a glass today too.

395
00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:11.375
So, what line of work are you in?

396
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:12.675
Huh?

397
00:20:14.375 --> 00:20:17.275
If it's a job that requires you to keep in shape,

398
00:20:17.275 --> 00:20:18.275
are you a Pro Wrestler?

399
00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:19.775
Oh, no...

400
00:20:19.775 --> 00:20:22.775
There's only one reason you can't tell us about it.

401
00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:27.375
That's because your job is killing.

402
00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:28.975
What?

403
00:20:28.975 --> 00:20:30.375
Hey...

404
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:32.075
You're keeping your body in shape,

405
00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:36.075
so that you can swiftly corner your target.

406
00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:37.575
I'm sure that the scratch on his face

407
00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:39.775
is one that he got when his target fought back at him.

408
00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:41.575
No, this scratch is...

409
00:20:41.575 --> 00:20:42.875
Not only your scratch.

410
00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.875
But, we're saying that your face is...

411
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.375
one of a murderer.

412
00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:51.475
Well, it's obvious that you're not a tourist, right?

413
00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:56.975
I don't think anyone would train themselves

414
00:20:56.975 --> 00:20:58.575
when on a trip.

415
00:20:58.575 --> 00:21:00.375
Oh, but he is...

416
00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:02.775
Hey, what's this? Do you know him?

417
00:21:02.775 --> 00:21:05.575
-Huh? -Is it true, Conan?

418
00:21:05.575 --> 00:21:08.475
Don't tell me he's wanted internationally?

419
00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:10.175
I just know he's a bad guy, right?

420
00:21:10.175 --> 00:21:12.975
Yep, because a good person doesn't hide anything!

421
00:21:12.975 --> 00:21:14.675
Oh, well, you see...

422
00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.975
It's just as the children say.

423
00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:19.975
If you have nothing to feel guilty about, tell us, will you?

424
00:21:19.975 --> 00:21:22.675
What kind of work do you do?

425
00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:29.275
I've got no choice.

426
00:21:30.275 --> 00:21:32.075
"Haido Central Hospital" -Huh?

427
00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:33.875
Camel's being suspected

428
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.675
as one of the suspects of a murder case?

429
00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:40.475
Yep, he seems to have been training on the stairs

430
00:21:40.475 --> 00:21:42.375
where the murder occurred.

431
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:44.675
Training using the stairs of a hotel?

432
00:21:45.675 --> 00:21:48.875
I guess he would since he's a muscle training fanatic.

433
00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:50.975
He did the same thing two years ago too.

434
00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:52.675
Come to think of it,

435
00:21:52.675 --> 00:21:55.275
it seems he came to Japan two years ago too.

436
00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:57.075
Did something come up?

437
00:21:57.075 --> 00:21:59.675
No, nothing really.

438
00:21:59.675 --> 00:22:03.675
Never mind that, will you hurry and help him get out of trouble.

439
00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:07.475
You're going to the hotel now, aren't you?

440
00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:09.075
Yes.

441
00:22:09.075 --> 00:22:10.275
Make sure that you don't give away the fact

442
00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:14.775
that the FBI are here in Japan for top-secret investigation.

443
00:22:14.775 --> 00:22:16.575
Yes, sir. Of course.

444
00:22:16.575 --> 00:22:19.575
Okay, Conan, I'll be right over.

445
00:22:19.575 --> 00:22:21.275
Bye, see you later.

446
00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:22.975
Oh, Jodie.

447
00:22:25.575 --> 00:22:26.775
Be careful.

448
00:22:28.675 --> 00:22:31.875
I have this bad feeling today.

449
00:22:31.875 --> 00:22:35.575
Oh, it's Friday the 13th, right?

450
00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:41.375
I don't really go for things like that.

451
00:22:42.675 --> 00:22:45.575
Really?

452
00:24:10.475 --> 00:24:12.775
"Next Episode" -People who suspect

453
00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:15.175
and people who are suspected.

454
00:24:15.175 --> 00:24:16.975
In order to clear oneself of suspicion,

455
00:24:16.975 --> 00:24:18.775
you have to prove your innocence

456
00:24:18.775 --> 00:24:21.175
by showing evidence of the truth,

457
00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:24.675
or keep on deceiving to the very end.

458
00:24:24.675 --> 00:24:28.275
The offensive and defensive battle between the Organization

459
00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:29.675
and the FBI revolving around Rena Mizunashi continue,

460
00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:33.675
after her return to the Black Organization.

461
00:24:33.675 --> 00:24:36.675
Next on Detective Conan,

462
00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:40.575
"Red and Black Crash: Innocence"

463
00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:58.475
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:58.475 --> 00:25:00.475
English Pronunciation.

465
00:25:00.475 --> 00:25:02.275
The movie will be released this Saturday.

466
00:25:02.275 --> 00:25:03.275
The title is...

467
00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:05.875
"Youth Detective Squad: Full Score of Fear"
