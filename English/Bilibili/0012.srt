1
00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.755
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.625
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.335
If the organization learned that
Shinichi and Conan were the same person,

4
00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:13.295
everyone close to me would be in danger!

5
00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:15.545
The only one who knows
the truth is Professor Agasa!

6
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.415
I hide my identity yet again today,
in which there is only one truth!

7
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.822
Ayumi-chan's Abduction.

8
00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:03.202
There is no such thing
as "the perfect crime."

9
00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:06.612
I'm sorry to say this, but your
crime is as clear as daylight.

10
00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:09.532
You've made three very basic mistakes!

11
00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:13.282
Mistake ♪1: Cans scattered around
the waste bin in an unnatural fashion.

12
00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:17.232
The number of cans is proof enough
that there's something inside the bin.

13
00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:21.112
Mistake ♪2: The ice cream bar you
were just eating is lying nearby.

14
00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:23.452
Yes. You were in a rush to hide,

15
00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:26.082
so you dropped it on the ground,
half-eaten.

16
00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:29.512
Mistake ♪3: The most
incriminating evidence of all...

17
00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:34.152
...is that I can see your big butt
inside the waste bin, Genta-kun!

18
00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:36.732
You talk too much, you know?!

19
00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:38.202
Arrested

20
00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:42.282
Ayumi-chan! I found Genta too! Come back!
Arrested

21
00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:44.032
Already?!

22
00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:49.002
It's no fun when you're it--
the game always ends right away!

23
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.202
It's no fun for me either!

24
00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:55.402
A high school student playing
detective games in the park...

25
00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:57.642
These badges are so awesome!

26
00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:01.342
They say "Detective Boys" since
we're the Junior Detective Club!

27
00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:06.282
We're the only grade school students
in the world with badges like these!

28
00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:07.822
Yeah, huh?

29
00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:11.282
There are tiny transceivers built inside!

30
00:03:11.282 --> 00:03:13.992
You can communicate over long distances

31
00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:16.072
by using the dial on the
back to change frequencies!

32
00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.532
It's perfect for kids' games,
but I'd rather not have to play myself...

33
00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:21.702
If they hadn't come over
to invite me to play,

34
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.972
I would've gone with Ran to
Teitan University's school festival!

35
00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:32.032
Don't you worry! I'll have plenty
of fun with the college girls for you!

36
00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:36.372
Okay! This time I'll be the detective
and you guys'll be the criminals!

37
00:03:36.822 --> 00:03:39.252
I have to be a criminal again?!

38
00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.862
We only need one detective!
Now get going!

39
00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:44.162
Whatever.

40
00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:46.032
One, two, three...

41
00:03:46.032 --> 00:03:48.072
I love Hide-and-Go-Seek!

42
00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:50.202
Hurry, Conan-kun!

43
00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:53.362
I can't believe I keep
going along with this...

44
00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:56.172
What happens if this keeps up
and I turn stupid?!

45
00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.572
Upsy daisy. Sorry!

46
00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:05.992
99, 100!

47
00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:08.652
Here I come! Time to show you all
the skill of Genta Kojima-sama,

48
00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:11.582
leader of the Junior Detective Club!

49
00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:21.062
Genta's looking hard!

50
00:04:24.862 --> 00:04:27.512
"Multiple girls kidnapped and murdered."

51
00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:30.652
They still haven't
caught those guys yet?!

52
00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:33.452
Scary, isn't it?

53
00:04:33.452 --> 00:04:35.072
Ayumi-chan...

54
00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:38.612
Cute girls are the only ones
they're going after.

55
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.112
That means I'm in huge danger, huh?

56
00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:46.842
But I'm not worried.

57
00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:48.072
If something bad ever happened,

58
00:04:48.072 --> 00:04:50.442
you'd be there to protect me,
wouldn't you, Conan-kun?

59
00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:58.702
After all, we're destined
to be together!

60
00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:02.082
Come on now, Ayumi-chan...

61
00:05:03.612 --> 00:05:05.862
Found you, Conan!

62
00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:09.512
You may be good at finding people,
but you sure suck at hiding!

63
00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:13.112
I hate running away
and hiding from people!

64
00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.142
That's weird though, I could
swear I heard Ayumi's voice too...

65
00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:19.352
Stupid! Hurry and hide!

66
00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:22.002
Was there something there?

67
00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:23.192
Just a cat!

68
00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:26.612
Let's see... Somewhere for me to hide...

69
00:05:29.572 --> 00:05:32.452
What's keepin' that idiot?!

70
00:05:38.992 --> 00:05:40.202
Lucky!

71
00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.402
Found Mitsuhiko!

72
00:05:49.112 --> 00:05:52.422
Odd. Scientifically speaking,
he shouldn't have found me.

73
00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:55.352
What was scientific about that?

74
00:05:55.352 --> 00:05:58.062
Okay! That leaves just Ayumi!

75
00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.162
That dumb Genta...

76
00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:07.112
How long can it possibly take him
to find an ordinary little girl?!

77
00:06:07.952 --> 00:06:10.032
She is not an ordinary little girl.

78
00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:13.022
Oh, never mind...

79
00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:17.842
Guess I'll tune up the skateboard
the professor gave me.

80
00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:25.282
Um, do you mind if I ask you something?

81
00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:29.892
How do you... How do you
feel about Ayumi-chan?!

82
00:06:29.892 --> 00:06:33.532
I'm asking you how you
feel about her as a girl!

83
00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:35.392
As just a friend!

84
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:38.362
Oh, really?

85
00:06:38.782 --> 00:06:42.062
Mitsuhiko... Don't tell me you
have a crush on Ayumi-chan...

86
00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:47.902
No! I'm simply asking your opinion
to help me decide on my "life plan"!

87
00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:51.572
Life plan? You're not talking
about marriage, are you?!

88
00:06:52.782 --> 00:06:56.022
You're so lucky! The professor
makes so much stuff for you!

89
00:06:56.822 --> 00:06:59.612
Gimme a break! Kids these days!

90
00:06:59.612 --> 00:07:01.552
What took you so damn long?!

91
00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:06.862
Come on! I already said I'm sorry!

92
00:07:06.862 --> 00:07:08.702
We're in trouble if we don't get movin'!

93
00:07:08.702 --> 00:07:09.952
Yeah.

94
00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:19.172
You still haven't found Ayumi-chan?

95
00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.902
Just give up and have her come out.

96
00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:22.812
Yeah, right!

97
00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:27.522
Like I'd ever say anything
that uncool in front of her...

98
00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:30.752
Ah! So Genta likes Ayumi-chan too!

99
00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:35.322
After all, we're destined
to be together!

100
00:07:36.612 --> 00:07:38.782
What a situation
I've gotten myself into...

101
00:07:41.242 --> 00:07:42.952
Ayumi-chan! Can you hear me?

102
00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:45.402
Let's call it quits.
You can come out now.

103
00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:49.112
That's strange.

104
00:07:49.112 --> 00:07:51.302
Do you think she went
home without us?

105
00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:54.342
Maybe something happened to her?!

106
00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:56.802
I'll turn the volume up...

107
00:07:57.282 --> 00:07:59.332
Ayumi-chan! Ayumi-chan!

108
00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:02.022
Conan-kun?

109
00:08:03.952 --> 00:08:05.122
Ayumi-chan!

110
00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.112
Ow!

111
00:08:09.112 --> 00:08:10.082
Ayumi-chan!

112
00:08:10.082 --> 00:08:11.062
Conan-kun?!

113
00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:12.992
Where are you?!

114
00:08:13.612 --> 00:08:16.932
I don't know.
Somewhere dark and cramped.

115
00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:19.422
How did I get here?

116
00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:21.412
That sound!

117
00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:23.152
It's a car!

118
00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:24.112
Oh, yeah!

119
00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:27.912
I hid in the trunk of a car
that was stopped in front of the park.

120
00:08:28.322 --> 00:08:30.992
But then I got sleepy...

121
00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:32.252
In front of the park?!

122
00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.282
That car?!

123
00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:39.652
What's this?! Awesome!

124
00:08:40.112 --> 00:08:43.152
Money! There's tons
of it in a paper bag!

125
00:08:43.152 --> 00:08:45.092
A million yen times 100, I bet!

126
00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:46.822
A hundred million?!

127
00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:48.282
Awesome!

128
00:08:48.282 --> 00:08:50.562
The car must belong to someone rich!

129
00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:54.272
Why would that much money
be in a paper bag?!

130
00:08:54.612 --> 00:08:56.362
Is there anything else
besides the money?

131
00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.322
Let me see...

132
00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:01.772
Yeah, there is. It looks
like a plastic bag.

133
00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:03.702
Is it filled with
grilled eel lunches?!

134
00:09:03.702 --> 00:09:05.862
Oh, look, a saw.

135
00:09:05.862 --> 00:09:06.812
A saw...?

136
00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:10.002
But what's this thing?
It's slippery!

137
00:09:12.032 --> 00:09:15.092
Hey. You been hearin'
a kid's voice come from the back?

138
00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:18.322
Knock it off. There's no way
that thing could talk.

139
00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:20.532
Yeah, you're right.

140
00:09:21.072 --> 00:09:23.062
Is the saw the only thing
inside the bag?

141
00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:26.892
There's also something round
and wrapped in paper...

142
00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.452
Let me see what's inside...

143
00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:32.572
Stop! Don't open that, Ayumi-chan!

144
00:09:39.032 --> 00:09:42.112
It's a head! A girl's head!

145
00:09:42.112 --> 00:09:44.322
A girl's head?!

146
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:48.042
Don't tell me the car Ayumi-chan got in

147
00:09:48.362 --> 00:09:51.222
belonged to those kidnappers
who're killing little girls!

148
00:09:53.452 --> 00:09:55.452
Hey! Something's not right!

149
00:09:55.452 --> 00:09:57.232
Yeah, I heard it too!

150
00:09:57.742 --> 00:09:59.782
Let me check out the trunk.

151
00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:05.282
Hey, unlock it!

152
00:10:05.282 --> 00:10:06.142
Right!

153
00:10:12.402 --> 00:10:15.652
Ah! So that's what we heard!

154
00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:18.452
That had me scared for a minute there!

155
00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:25.692
Don't cry!

156
00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:29.412
Don't cry, Ayumi-chan!
They'll hear you if you do!

157
00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:32.782
I know! Think of something funny!

158
00:10:32.782 --> 00:10:34.622
Something funny?

159
00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:41.302
Ayumi-chan?

160
00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:44.742
I just remembered how
Genta-kun looked like a bear

161
00:10:44.742 --> 00:10:48.012
when he fell down the stairs
the other day and got two bumps!

162
00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:51.652
Girls don't make sense,
even at times like this...

163
00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.982
Ayumi-chan. You can stop now.
Girls don't make sense,
even at times like this...

164
00:10:53.982 --> 00:10:54.952
Eh?

165
00:10:54.952 --> 00:10:56.712
Be quiet and don't move a muscle!

166
00:10:58.282 --> 00:10:59.022
Okay...

167
00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:01.572
I'm coming to save you!

168
00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:04.112
Okay!

169
00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:09.072
But how are you gonna chase them?!

170
00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:12.162
They're in a car, you know!
It'll be hopeless with that skateboard!

171
00:11:12.782 --> 00:11:15.842
The professor made this for me--
it's no ordinary skateboard!

172
00:11:20.532 --> 00:11:23.242
It's equipped with a
high-performance turbo engine!

173
00:11:23.242 --> 00:11:27.802
But it's solar powered, so you can
only use it when the sun is out.

174
00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:30.712
One hour until sunset...

175
00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:35.402
Are you stupid?
You guys wait here!

176
00:11:35.402 --> 00:11:37.232
That car belongs to
a couple of murderers!

177
00:11:37.232 --> 00:11:39.282
Murder, schmurder!

178
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.152
I can't just sit here
while Ayumi-chan is in danger!

179
00:11:42.152 --> 00:11:44.672
Protecting women is a man's duty!

180
00:11:45.032 --> 00:11:46.462
You're serious...

181
00:11:47.742 --> 00:11:48.912
Alright, then!

182
00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.782
Ayumi-chan! Where's the car now?!

183
00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:53.952
I have no idea!

184
00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:57.862
This car's weird, it keeps
moving and then stopping!

185
00:11:57.862 --> 00:12:00.492
Plus there are weird sounds outside...

186
00:12:00.492 --> 00:12:03.652
Turn up your badge's volume, would you?

187
00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:04.192
Okay...

188
00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:07.282
This sound...

189
00:12:07.282 --> 00:12:11.322
That's it! They're stuck in traffic
because of road construction!

190
00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:13.492
The only place around here
where there's construction

191
00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:15.282
is at the intersection on 2nd Street!

192
00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:16.502
We can still catch them!

193
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.662
Here we go! Better hold on!

194
00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:19.232
Right!

195
00:12:26.032 --> 00:12:27.282
Ayumi!

196
00:12:27.282 --> 00:12:29.842
There's no reason to kill her, you know.

197
00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:35.902
Her parents paid the ransom,
and besides, she's just a kid...

198
00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:39.062
You fool! She's seen our faces.

199
00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:42.402
We can't leave her alive!
Even if she is just a kid!

200
00:12:42.402 --> 00:12:44.202
Bastards!

201
00:12:44.202 --> 00:12:46.922
Hang on, Ayumi! We're coming for you!

202
00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:03.107
Where is their car?!

203
00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:06.247
Ayumi! Are you still stopping and going?!

204
00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:09.567
Yeah. But it's not
the same place as before.

205
00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:11.947
I don't hear those
weird sounds anymore,

206
00:13:11.947 --> 00:13:15.027
plus the car just drove a long way!

207
00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:18.817
Hold on. If they're in a
traffic jam up ahead, then...

208
00:13:18.817 --> 00:13:21.397
That's it! The freeway!

209
00:13:21.397 --> 00:13:25.067
This is bad! There's no catching them
if they get on the freeway!

210
00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:26.497
Dammit! What do we do?!

211
00:13:28.447 --> 00:13:30.777
There sure have been a lot
of police cars passing by...

212
00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:33.807
Yeah, that's the fourth one...

213
00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:36.647
Inspector Megure?

214
00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:41.117
Is something going on?

215
00:13:41.117 --> 00:13:44.277
...the kidnappers appear to have
escaped to the city of Beika.

216
00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:45.777
The authorities have
formed a police cordon

217
00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:48.237
and are trying as hard
as possible to arrest them.

218
00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:50.857
Ayumi-chan! Have you
heard any police cars?!

219
00:13:50.857 --> 00:13:54.667
Yeah! About 3 of them passed
by when we were stopped!

220
00:13:55.277 --> 00:13:58.837
There's no doubt about it!
They've set up an inspection checkpoint!

221
00:13:59.237 --> 00:14:03.447
Probably where the roads converge
right before the freeway starts--

222
00:14:03.447 --> 00:14:04.337
on Beika Bridge!

223
00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:07.167
Let's go!

224
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.507
Hey! Beika Bridge is straight
down that last street!

225
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:13.817
You idiot! They wouldn't dare
go through the checkpoint!

226
00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:17.367
They'd obviously take a side street
to get out of Beika

227
00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:19.157
without going over the bridge!

228
00:14:24.817 --> 00:14:27.697
They'll have to come down this street!

229
00:14:27.697 --> 00:14:29.827
We're moving! The car's moving!

230
00:14:30.317 --> 00:14:33.317
Bring it on! You're as good as ours!

231
00:14:35.647 --> 00:14:39.067
Where are they?
It's already been 5 minutes...

232
00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:41.407
Hey! What the heck's going on, Conan?!

233
00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:42.907
That's odd.

234
00:14:42.907 --> 00:14:46.207
Ayumi-chan! Is the car stopped
right now? Or is it moving?

235
00:14:48.247 --> 00:14:49.987
What's going on, Ayumi-chan?!

236
00:14:49.987 --> 00:14:51.317
Say something, Ayumi!

237
00:14:51.867 --> 00:14:54.777
Did she go out of range?!

238
00:14:54.777 --> 00:14:58.157
No, these things have a
broadcast radius of 20 kilometers!

239
00:14:58.157 --> 00:15:00.157
There's no way they could've
gone that far in 5 minutes!

240
00:15:00.487 --> 00:15:02.907
Maybe she's in a tunnel
or something?!

241
00:15:02.907 --> 00:15:05.227
Beika Tunnel! That must be it!

242
00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:08.237
No, they'd have to pass through the
inspection point and go over the bridge

243
00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:10.367
to enter Beika Tunnel!

244
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:13.437
Which means they must be inside
a building that disrupts our signals!

245
00:15:13.437 --> 00:15:16.277
You don't think it's
their hideout, do you?!

246
00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:18.367
In that case,
they're like rats in a trap!

247
00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:20.017
The police'll find them eventually!

248
00:15:20.017 --> 00:15:21.367
You idiot!

249
00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:24.197
They'll find Ayumi-chan
before they get caught!

250
00:15:24.567 --> 00:15:28.197
She's seen our faces.
We can't leave her alive!

251
00:15:28.197 --> 00:15:30.697
Even if she is just a kid!

252
00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:31.817
If something bad ever happened,

253
00:15:31.817 --> 00:15:34.207
you'd be there to protect me,
wouldn't you, Conan-kun?

254
00:15:35.117 --> 00:15:36.817
Ayumi!

255
00:15:36.817 --> 00:15:38.677
...na... ku...

256
00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.907
Conan-kun! Where are you?!

257
00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.407
Ayumi-chan!

258
00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:47.367
Why wouldn't you say anything,
you jerk?!

259
00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:48.617
Calm down, Ayumi-chan!

260
00:15:48.617 --> 00:15:51.117
They'll hear you if you yell too loud!

261
00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.907
There's no way they would hear me!

262
00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:56.817
The car's so loud that
I can't hear their voices!

263
00:15:56.817 --> 00:15:57.917
Do you know where you are right now?!

264
00:15:57.917 --> 00:16:03.657
No! There was this roaring sound
and then you stopped replying to me!

265
00:16:04.117 --> 00:16:06.697
Roaring sound? So they
were in the tunnel?!

266
00:16:06.697 --> 00:16:09.907
But how did they pass
through the checkpoint?!

267
00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.907
We'll come after you right away!

268
00:16:11.907 --> 00:16:13.097
Just keep quiet and wait for us!

269
00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:29.637
Come on, faster!

270
00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:32.117
The skateboard'll stop
soon if we don't hurry!

271
00:16:34.817 --> 00:16:38.817
Conan-kun! It sounds like the car's
in some sort of shop now!

272
00:16:38.817 --> 00:16:39.647
Shop?!

273
00:16:40.117 --> 00:16:43.597
I heard someone say, "Welcome,"
and this weird sound just started!

274
00:16:43.597 --> 00:16:45.117
Sound?!

275
00:16:46.947 --> 00:16:49.307
A gas station! Which one?!

276
00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:51.617
Ayumi-chan! Let me hear
what's going on outside!

277
00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:52.417
Okay.

278
00:16:54.157 --> 00:16:57.907
We're currently giving away
Masked Yaiba towels and T-shirts...

279
00:16:57.907 --> 00:17:00.237
We don't need any!
We're in a hurry!

280
00:17:00.237 --> 00:17:02.427
The only gas station you
can get Masked Yaiba stuff

281
00:17:02.427 --> 00:17:04.057
is Yotsubishi Gas,
which we just passed!

282
00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:18.987
I finally found them!

283
00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:28.277
What was that sound, Conan-kun?!

284
00:17:28.907 --> 00:17:31.987
Ayumi-chan's definitely
in the trunk of that car!

285
00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:33.717
As is the girl's head and the money!

286
00:17:34.317 --> 00:17:37.657
They're the ones kidnapping
and killing little girls!

287
00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:41.127
Hey, did you hear
anything strange just now?

288
00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:43.557
It's just some kids playing pranks!

289
00:17:47.487 --> 00:17:49.947
What's going on?

290
00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:53.797
What's going on, Ayumi-chan?!

291
00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:01.107
Ayumi-chan! Respond! Ayumi-chan!

292
00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:04.027
Hey, something's definitely strange!

293
00:18:04.027 --> 00:18:06.567
It's probably just a stray cat.
No need to get worked up!

294
00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.197
Bastards! There's no escape now!

295
00:18:13.117 --> 00:18:14.077
Huh?!

296
00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:15.877
What's going on?!

297
00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:17.447
They're getting away!

298
00:18:17.447 --> 00:18:20.567
Oh no! There's not enough solar power!

299
00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.877
We have to do something
before we stop altogether!

300
00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:25.297
That's it!

301
00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:31.277
Hey! Stop, you kids!

302
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:41.657
Stop the car! Or else I'll do this!

303
00:18:44.907 --> 00:18:46.017
Damn kids!

304
00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:50.717
Who were those kids?!

305
00:18:50.717 --> 00:18:51.367
Hell if I know!

306
00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:53.747
Let's just hurry! There's no time!

307
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.987
Ugh! My hands are going numb!

308
00:19:15.617 --> 00:19:18.347
I can't hold on any longer!

309
00:19:19.237 --> 00:19:20.117
Genta!

310
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.777
Ayumi! Ayumi! Ayumi!

311
00:19:30.447 --> 00:19:32.237
It's those kids!

312
00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:34.777
Who cares?! Let's just get her
out of there and split!

313
00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:35.467
Right!

314
00:19:38.617 --> 00:19:40.077
Who're you?!

315
00:19:42.277 --> 00:19:44.817
Who is this brat?!

316
00:19:44.817 --> 00:19:45.847
Don't kill me!

317
00:19:45.847 --> 00:19:46.617
What?!
Don't kill me!

318
00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:48.017
Ayumi!

319
00:19:48.657 --> 00:19:50.007
Here goes!

320
00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:51.857
Hey, be quiet!

321
00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.657
Ayumi!

322
00:19:54.157 --> 00:19:55.327
Get down!

323
00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:06.567
Ayumi-chan!

324
00:20:08.317 --> 00:20:09.437
You're all here!

325
00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:11.207
Ayumi-chan!

326
00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:12.777
I'm so glad you're all right!

327
00:20:12.777 --> 00:20:14.717
You had us worried!

328
00:20:16.317 --> 00:20:17.907
It's all over for you!

329
00:20:17.907 --> 00:20:19.917
You're the ones who've been kidnapping
and murdering little girls!

330
00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.747
Murdering?!

331
00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:23.947
There's no point in playing dumb!

332
00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:27.157
We heard your guys'
conversation in the car!

333
00:20:27.157 --> 00:20:30.587
Yeah! You said you'd have
no trouble killing little kids!

334
00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:33.317
And then there's the corpse
and money in your trunk!

335
00:20:33.317 --> 00:20:34.827
Try talking your way out of that one!

336
00:20:34.927 --> 00:20:37.627
You idiots!

337
00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:39.537
Take a better look!

338
00:20:41.027 --> 00:20:43.867
They're all hand-made props!

339
00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:45.687
Props?!

340
00:20:45.687 --> 00:20:48.747
Our conversation in the car was us
practicing our lines one last time!

341
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.947
Practicing your lines?

342
00:20:50.947 --> 00:20:55.917
We're performing in a play here!

343
00:20:56.867 --> 00:20:57.817
Come to think of it!

344
00:20:58.277 --> 00:21:00.237
Let's go to Teitan University's
school festival, Conan-kun!

345
00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:04.597
I hear they're going to have
an interesting mystery play!

346
00:21:05.317 --> 00:21:10.227
And besides, they said on the radio
that they just caught the murderer!

347
00:21:14.237 --> 00:21:15.507
Inspector Megure!

348
00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:20.867
So was that the real killer then?

349
00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:23.777
Look at what you've done!

350
00:21:23.777 --> 00:21:28.237
He has a big lump and a broken neck!

351
00:21:28.237 --> 00:21:29.367
Well, it was nice meeting you...

352
00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:30.537
Not so fast!

353
00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:32.587
Yes?

354
00:21:32.587 --> 00:21:36.617
You'll have to take
responsibility for this!

355
00:23:11.487 --> 00:23:16.407
Her parents paid the r... ransom,
We Won't Live to See Tomorrow

356
00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:17.737
Her parents paid the r... ransom,

357
00:23:17.737 --> 00:23:19.867
and besides, she's just a kid...

358
00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.447
You fool! She's seen our faces!

359
00:23:22.447 --> 00:23:23.427
We can't leave her alive!

360
00:23:23.817 --> 00:23:26.027
Hey, there's something weird
about that actor.

361
00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:27.407
You think?

362
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:31.437
He can't stand up straight,
and he keeps blowing his lines!

363
00:23:31.437 --> 00:23:36.277
You're so beautiful, Miss!
What do you say?!

364
00:23:36.277 --> 00:23:38.147
No thanks...

365
00:23:38.147 --> 00:23:42.887
Oh, come on, now! Wouldn't you like
to see my famous detective skills--

366
00:23:45.027 --> 00:23:47.087
That's enough of that!

367
00:23:49.407 --> 00:23:51.197
Genta! Say the next line!

368
00:23:51.617 --> 00:23:52.227
I don't know how to read this word!

369
00:23:52.227 --> 00:23:54.657
That's right--we were put onstage
I don't know how to read this word!

370
00:23:54.657 --> 00:23:56.627
as a main character.
That's pronounced "cruel"!

371
00:23:57.567 --> 00:24:01.217
Incidentally, the role of the decapitated head...
That's cruel!

372
00:24:01.697 --> 00:24:04.237
...went to Ayumi-chan herself.

373
00:24:04.237 --> 00:24:06.897
I hate Hide-and-Go-Seek!

374
00:24:15.707 --> 00:24:16.567
He's dead?!

375
00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:21.427
And she just found her father, too!
How horrible!

376
00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:24.537
There's still no saying
for sure that he was murdered...

377
00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:25.397
We can't give up yet!

378
00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.667
Come on! Make it in time!

379
00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:35.567
Where's Masami-san?
What's happened to her?!

380
00:24:35.947 --> 00:24:37.407
On the next Conan--

381
00:24:37.407 --> 00:24:39.897
The Bizarre Manhunt Murder.

382
00:24:57.264 --> 00:25:00.067
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:25:00.067 --> 00:25:00.073
Next Conan's Hint:
A Hundred Million Yen.

384
00:25:00.073 --> 00:25:01.688
A Hundred Million Yen.
