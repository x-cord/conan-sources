1
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:07,858
Mr. Mori received a
letter from a dead man

2
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:10,028
and then headed to Tsukikage Island.

3
00:00:10,028 --> 00:00:13,668
The letter's author was Keiji Aso,
a pianist who murdered his family,

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:18,208
lit his house on fire, and died
while playing the Moonlight piano sonata.

5
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:21,428
The 1st murder happened on the night
of the memorial for Mr. Kameyama,

6
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:23,428
the previous mayor.

7
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:25,718
Hideo Kawashima was
found dead in the piano room,

8
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,578
while the first movement
of Moonlight played.

9
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:32,518
The second murder took place
as the second movement played.

10
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:35,548
The victim was the current mayor,
Tatsuji Kuroiwa.

11
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,988
The number of suspects was
narrowed down to six people.

12
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:40,968
The third murder was
that of Ken Nishimoto.

13
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:43,098
He was killed in a manner
that made it look like suicide.

14
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:49,078
"To my son, Seiji."

15
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:51,708
Ah, now I see!

16
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,468
The reason the killer dragged
Kawashima-san into the piano room

17
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:56,638
after drowning him!

18
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,348
The meaning of the music
played at the murder scenes!

19
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,318
And the mystery behind
the code written in blood!

20
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:07,338
There's no doubt about it!
That's the one who did it!

21
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:14,018
What's the big idea, rushing here
to the broadcast room like that?!

22
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:16,008
Is there something here?!

23
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:17,768
No, not really.

24
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:22,398
I've got no choice! I'll have to
use the old man's voice for this!

25
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,368
One shot of this
Anesthetic Watch Gun and...

26
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:30,838
Hirata-san and Shimizu-san will
have to come to the mainland with us

27
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:31,808
tomorrow morning.

28
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,448
You can't be serious!

29
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:36,588
The first incident, in which
Mr. Kawashima was drowned

30
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:40,258
and dragged into the community center's
piano room last night...

31
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:42,718
The second incident,
in which Mr. Kuroiwa was murdered

32
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,678
in the broadcast room
this very night...

33
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:48,718
The third incident, which also
took place this very night,

34
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:50,508
in which Mr. Nishimoto
was killed in the storeroom

35
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,388
in such a way to make
it look like a suicide...

36
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:56,378
The only ones without alibis for
these three incidents are you two

37
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,728
and Murasawa-san,
who is resting at the clinic.

38
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,718
I'm sorry to do this, but we'll
have to watch you tonight.

39
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:06,718
I've figured it out, Inspector!

40
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,798
Almost everything about the murders
on this island, that is.

41
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,828
Dad! You're in the broadcast room?

42
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:16,338
First, the person who beat Murasawa-san
unconscious in the piano room.

43
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:19,988
That would be you, Hirata-san!

44
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:21,338
What?!

45
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:23,678
Hirata-san suffered
the injury on his left hand

46
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,548
when he broke the window and escaped.

47
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:29,588
You were also the suspicious
person we saw last night.

48
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,508
But what was he doing?

49
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:36,128
He was making deals with
Mr. Kawashima in that room.

50
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:37,078
Drug deals.

51
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:38,648
Drugs?!

52
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,838
Hirata-san used a
hidden panel in the piano

53
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:47,028
to trade drugs he bought overseas
for large sums of money.

54
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:52,858
Aha! So that's why they were at the
community center every single night!

55
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:57,338
The reason Hirata-san always
claimed the piano was cursed

56
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:00,068
was to keep people
from getting in the way.

57
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:02,378
He probably assaulted
Murasawa-san and escaped

58
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,718
because Murasawa-san saw him taking
back the drugs he had left there!

59
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:07,998
Does that mean you killed Mr. Kawashima

60
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,968
because you were having a dispute
with him about the deals?!

61
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,008
No!

62
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:15,478
Hirata-san has nothing
to do with the three murders.

63
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:20,128
If he was the murderer, he wouldn't
have killed anyone in the piano room.

64
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,288
That was the room where
he left the drugs, after all.

65
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,678
Next is Murasawa-san.

66
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,468
He's the killer?!

67
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:31,578
He's not the killer either.

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,338
The reason the killer wrote a
will to make it look a suicide

69
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,298
but didn't place an object
to stand on in the room

70
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,758
was because the murderer bolted
when Ran and the others showed up.

71
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,498
It would have been impossible
to enter the piano room afterward.

72
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,278
You're right!

73
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:47,128
So far, our image of the
killer has been that of a man,

74
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,468
because all three murders
required someone with strength.

75
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,988
And someone without an alibi.

76
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:56,418
The only suspect left is Shimizu-san...

77
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:59,388
Next, we need to look
at the second murder.

78
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,378
We assumed Kuroiwa-san was killed
only minutes before he was found.

79
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,468
But if you'll remember...

80
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:11,978
...the blood code didn't
come off when Conan fell on it.

81
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:18,628
At room temperature, it takes 15
to 30 minutes for human blood to dry.

82
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:21,918
But that blood was dry,

83
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,848
even though he was supposedly
killed only minutes before.

84
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:31,828
That's right. It was a trick the killer
did to alter the estimated time of death.

85
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,718
What?!

86
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:37,768
But only the first 5 and a half minutes
of the tape were blank!

87
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,548
Automatic tape reverse.

88
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,758
The killer played the 2nd side
of the tape, which had no music on it

89
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:46,728
and gained 30 extra minutes
by using tape reverse.

90
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:48,818
Please have a look at the photographs.

91
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:52,048
There's a button lit
near Kuroiwa-san's neck.

92
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:55,278
And the light is off
just after his body is moved.

93
00:04:55,278 --> 00:05:00,338
That's proof that the killer
turned it off when you weren't looking.

94
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,488
But if I remember correctly,
the one who approached the body was--

95
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,008
That's right.

96
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:07,378
The person who got near the body,
aside from the police...

97
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,718
The person who faked
the estimated time of death...

98
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:14,668
...was the one who inspected
the body--you, Dr. Narumi!

99
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,928
That's not true, is it, Dr. Narumi?!

100
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:25,838
You drowned Kawashima-san and
dragged him into the piano room

101
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,948
in order to send the coroners
back to the mainland,

102
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:31,508
since they wouldn't be able
to examine an unnatural death here.

103
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:35,218
And the reason you put blank space
at the start of each tape

104
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:39,588
was so that you could throw us off
by faking the time of the 2nd murder.

105
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,718
Doing this, you altered
Kuroiwa-san's time of death,

106
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,898
thereby creating an alibi for yourself.

107
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:50,588
But Mori-kun! You just
said the killer was a man!

108
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:53,468
The motive for the murders
extends 12 years back.

109
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,108
Come again?

110
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:59,308
Back to the incident in which pianist
Keiji Aso and his family were killed.

111
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,138
Killed?!

112
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:04,298
Kawashima-san, Nishimoto-san,
Kuroiwa-san,

113
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,118
and the previous mayor, Kameyama-san...

114
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,218
They used Aso-san's
international performances

115
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,558
as opportunities to buy and sell drugs.

116
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:16,408
But then Aso-san said he
refused to help them any longer.

117
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:19,678
Afraid their secret would get out,

118
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:23,378
they shut him and his family inside
his house and set it on fire.

119
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:30,678
This is all written in the sheet music
that survived that fire...

120
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:34,278
In the confession letter
that Aso-san wrote for his child...

121
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:35,748
A son?!

122
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:40,468
He had a son in a Tokyo hospital.

123
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,788
One named Seiji.

124
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,728
Seiji? It couldn't be...

125
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,508
Dr. Narumi's real name is Seiji.

126
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,188
She was Keiji Aso's son, Seiji Aso!

127
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,398
You can't be serious!

128
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:58,568
Asai is probably his
foster family's last name.

129
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:03,408
So it was all to avenge his father...

130
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:05,778
What?!
Inspector! The killer's gone!

131
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,118
Find him!

132
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,008
I know where he is!

133
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:13,718
The place where Aso Keiji's donated
piano is kept--the community center!

134
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,878
It's over, Father.

135
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,378
It's not over yet!

136
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:29,998
Here, look at this!

137
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:34,068
It's written in this sheet
music your dad left for you!

138
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:37,778
He says he wants you
to live an honest life!

139
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,948
I wish I had known that sooner.

140
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:45,578
How did you find out about your father
if you haven't read this?!

141
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:50,218
I always had my suspicions
about my foster father.

142
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:51,718
After graduating from medical school,

143
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:54,418
I came to this island
as a woman doctor.

144
00:07:55,718 --> 00:08:00,388
It doesn't say on my license
how to pronounce my name, after all.

145
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:04,588
But I was sweating bullets
when they started questioning people.

146
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,368
They would've found out
I was really a man.

147
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:10,758
I see. So that's why you
stayed with us that night--

148
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,818
so you could have them
question you last.

149
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:19,128
When I told Kameyama, the previous mayor,
that I was Aso's son,

150
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:22,058
he suddenly grew fearful
and told me everything.

151
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,038
He finished it all off by falling
lifeless from a heart attack.

152
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:31,258
It was when I played my father's
favorite piece, Moonlight,

153
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,778
as a farewell song for him that I came up
with the idea for these murders.

154
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,628
Seiji! Let's get out of here!
We can still make it!

155
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,928
It's too late for me.

156
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:46,658
These hands are as
bloodstained as theirs are.

157
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,008
Conan-kun!

158
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:53,648
Dammit!

159
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,548
No!

160
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:55,778
Let go!

161
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,468
What's that sound?

162
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,328
This is the code.

163
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:07,298
He's playing it. Inside the fire.

164
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:20,878
Murasawa-san missed Keiji Aso,
the pianist,

165
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:23,428
so he apparently tuned
his piano on occasion...

166
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,178
On the night he was assaulted, too.

167
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:31,328
Why did Dr. Narumi warn us
about the murders?

168
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:35,518
My only guess is that it was actually
a letter of challenge to Dad...

169
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,678
I think she wanted to be
stopped from killing...

170
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:44,218
Say, what did the code

00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,108
Oh, I already forgot.

172
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:49,078
Your expression says otherwise!

173
00:09:51,508 --> 00:10:01,338
Thank you, Little Detective

174
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:49,147
Don't tell me the car

175
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,309
belonged to those kidnappers
who're killing little girls!

176
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:56,180
Hold on, Ayumi-chan!
We're coming to save you!

179
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:02,606

180
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,302

181
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:24,303
