1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,702
(Sebundai Police Station)

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:06,606
It is now 29 September at 5 pm.

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,608
Yosuke Katsuki, you are arrested

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,811
on the suspicion of murdering Shuhei Odawara.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,900
(Yosuke Katsuki (27), office worker)

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,950
(Yosuke Katsuki (27), office worker)
Yes, sir!

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,110
(Yosuke Katsuki (27), office worker)

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,225
The culprit was arrested a few hours

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,627
after the incident was discovered.

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,230
Or that was what we thought.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,932
(Two Days Later)

12
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,902
(Cafe Poirot)

13
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,205
Inspector!

14
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,809
It's you.

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,515
I heard you resolved the incident
at Sebundai very quickly.

16
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,319
I very quickly arrested the wrong person.

17
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,821
What do you mean?

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,323
It's a waste of time telling it to you.

19
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,027
Let's hear the story at my office.

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,128
Let me go!

21
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,531
Don't say that.

22
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,700
I'll listen to everything you have to say,
even the complaints.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,702
I'm not complaining!

24
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,504
It's all right...

25
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,208
Were you scolded by your bosses again?

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,510
Conan.

27
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,915
I knew I shouldn't have passed by here.

28
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,216
Come on...

29
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,417
It's all right...

30
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,618
Come on...

31
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,920
It's all right...

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,422
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,224
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

34
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,326
The culprit keeps saying he did it.

35
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,428
What is the mysterious man after?

36
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,030
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,032
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,301
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:29,008
"The Man at the Police Station"

40
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,681
The incident was discovered two days ago,

41
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,083
on the afternoon of the 29th.

42
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,188
(Shuhei Odawara (27), office worker)
The victim was Shuhei Odawara,

43
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,290
(Shuhei Odawara (27), office worker)
27 years old.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,892
The estimated time of death

45
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,396
was between 1 and 3 pm the previous day.

46
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,267
There weren't any particular traces,

47
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,071
but we thought he was murdered
due to a grudge.

48
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,274
The first person to see the body
was Tomoko Yaguchi,

49
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,210
who had gotten engaged to the victim the other day.

50
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,580
(Tomoko Yaguchi (25), Odawara's fiancee)
who had gotten engaged to the victim the other day.

51
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,183
There are traces of the victim
being hit in the back of the head

52
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,485
and strangled with a rope.

53
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,189
Possible murder weapons are found in the room.

54
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,292
A piece of vinyl rope and a steel pipe.

55
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,693
Not only that,

56
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,250
the Japanese-style window was broken in.

57
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,468
I see. So that means...

58
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,569
The culprit snuck in

59
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,772
through the Japanese-style window
yesterday afternoon.

60
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,975
After knocking out the victim
with a steel pipe,

61
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,177
they choked him to death with the rope.

62
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,480
That's likely.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,084
However, we could only find fingerprints
on the steel pipe

64
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,130
but not on the vinyl rope.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,980
There were fingerprints on
only one of the murder weapons?

66
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,500
Inspector Megure.

67
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,240
Could I have your time?

68
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:01,167
Shuhei was gentle and kind.

69
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,871
Not a man anyone
would have a grudge against.

70
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,870
- But...
- But?

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,776
But if it were Katsuki...

72
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,177
Katsuki?

73
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,970
Apparently, he used to date Miss Yaguchi.

74
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,586
I thought he was very attractive back then.

75
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,989
He's handsome and well-spoken.

76
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,191
But as our relationship went on,

77
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,050
I learnt that

78
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,300
he was an extremely egoistic narcissist.

79
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,399
When I decided I couldn't take it anymore,

80
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,469
I started getting to know Shuhei,

81
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,771
who was Katsuki's classmate in high school.

82
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,175
I see. You later broke up with Katsuki

83
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,170
and got engaged to Odawara.

84
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,081
He might have a grudge against Odawara
for that reason.

85
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,200
When we went to interrogate Katsuki...

86
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,789
Well, you came sooner than I expected.

87
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,393
I was just thinking about turning myself in.

88
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,498
You do admit to murdering Odawara, then?

89
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,167
Yes. I won't run or hide.

90
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,971
Something that disgraceful wouldn't suit me.

91
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,075
Tomoko is the reason.

92
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:20,179
Why would she dump such a wonderful guy

93
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,420
for someone as unattractive as Odawara?

94
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,530
I thought I had to let her know that

95
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,680
she'd regret making such a foolish decision.

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,150
That's why Odawara had to die.

97
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,097
It's so that Tomoko would grieve about it.

98
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,168
Just as I was waiting for
the right time to strike,

99
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,680
I heard that the two were engaged
the other day.

100
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,673
I had to do it.

101
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,777
And in the end, I did it brilliantly.

102
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:55,882
After all, I'm a man who achieves
everything he sets his goal on!

103
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,886
What is wrong with him?

104
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,888
Take him away for now.

105
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,050
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,293
Later, to confirm that the fingerprints
on the steel pipe

107
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,190
were the same as Katsuki's.

108
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,098
Yosuke Katsuki, you are arrested

109
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,368
on the suspicion of murdering Shuhei Odawara.

110
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,670
Yes, sir!

111
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,874
That was when we encountered difficulties.

112
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,160
What do you mean?

113
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,880
His testimony did not match the evidence

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,582
at the crime scene.

115
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,786
You murdered Odawara in the evening?

116
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,688
Yes, that's right.

117
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,291
It was around 6 pm last night!

118
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,694
Wasn't it earlier, say, in the afternoon?

119
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,496
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,098
If the culprit says it,

121
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,967
then it has to be correct.

122
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,070
By the way,
where were you that afternoon?

123
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,172
I was in Eito-cho.

124
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,675
I got involved with some hooligans

125
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,670
and almost died there.

126
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,482
I snuck in through the door

127
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,384
using a duplicate key I had prepared.

128
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,487
I threw it into the river

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,889
while running away, though.

130
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,791
I beat Odawara to death

131
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,193
while he was sleeping on the sofa

132
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,597
with the steel pipe!

133
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,799
It's certainly strange.

134
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,867
Yes.

135
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,870
But that mystery was solved

136
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,471
when the autopsy results came in.

137
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,273
What do you mean?

138
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,075
The cause of death was asphyxiation

139
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,978
from being strangled by the vinyl rope.

140
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,981
The time of death
was between 1 pm and 3 pm

141
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,084
as estimated at the crime scene.

142
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,685
But the hit to the back of the head

143
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,687
was made a few hours

144
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,770
after the victim died.

145
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,591
In that case...

146
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,895
There were probably two culprits.

147
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,340
You, and a Culprit X.

148
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,690
What? Culprit X?

149
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,470
Culprit X wore gloves and snuck in

150
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,473
by breaking the Japanese-style window
yesterday afternoon.

151
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,775
Culprit X was the one
who murdered Odawara.

152
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,277
A few hours later,

153
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,079
you came in using a duplicate key

154
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,182
and hit Odawara with the steel pipe
without realising

155
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,286
that he was no longer breathing.

156
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,589
In other words,
what you did was not murder,

157
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,600
but desecration of a corpse!

158
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,893
That can't be!

159
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,240
I was the one who killed Odawara!

160
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,697
Gosh.

161
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,669
In any case...

162
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,572
I'll be honest with you, Inspector.

163
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,075
I snuck into that house twice!

164
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,276
- What?
- What?

165
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,678
The first time was in the afternoon,

166
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,179
when I used the duplicate key

167
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,481
and choked Odawara to death.

168
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,784
I was wearing gloves at the time.

169
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,586
But when evening came,

170
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,987
I started to worry that

171
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,190
he was just unconscious.

172
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,094
So I went back
and broke in through the window.

173
00:09:55,094 --> 00:10:00,099
That was when I used the steel pipe
to hit Odawara

174
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,367
and make sure he was dead.

175
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,568
I forgot to wear gloves,

176
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,870
so I left fingerprints on the pipe.

177
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,872
That's the truth!

178
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,875
You said you broke in
through the window the second time,

179
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,478
but your fingerprints weren't on it.

180
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,381
And didn't you say something else?

181
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,483
You were in Eito-cho and almost died

182
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,480
after dealing with hooligans
that afternoon.

183
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,187
That was...

184
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,489
In any case, now we're considering that

185
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,491
you desecrated a corpse,

186
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,194
you're no longer suspected of murder.

187
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,195
I won't accept this!

188
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,196
What?

189
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,898
It's irresponsible to arrest me
on suspicion of murder

190
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,568
and later tell me that
I'm not suspected of it anymore!

191
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,070
There's no Culprit X!

192
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,373
In order to make that stupid woman grieve,

193
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,475
I killed Odawara!

194
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,176
Please believe me!

195
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,680
I did it!

196
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:53,185
So, was Katsuki really...

197
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,987
He's been at the police station

198
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,490
for the last two days.

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,592
He keeps saying that there's no Culprit X

200
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,994
and that he is the culprit.

201
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,198
We're looking for the hooligans

202
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,068
he said he was involved with at Eito-cho.

203
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,170
If we could find evidence for his alibi,

204
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,973
he would agree with us.

205
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,077
Of course, we're also continuing to
search for the real culprit.

206
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,580
We already have a few witness accounts.

207
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,682
A few days ago,

208
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:27,386
a neighbour saw a man
peeking into Odawara's home.

209
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,910
(Sanpo Hayashi (75), lives near the crime scene)
It was indeed suspicious.

210
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,092
And according to Miss Yaguchi,

211
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,895
Odawara received a call a few days ago

212
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,300
from someone who wanted revenge.

213
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,430
Perhaps it's from Culprit X.

214
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,970
It's likely. In other words,

215
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,374
Culprit X had a deep grudge
against Odawara.

216
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:53,479
We tried asking an old friend of Odawara's,

217
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,182
but there was nothing of note.

218
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,091
Katsuki can only be detained

219
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,193
until this evening.

220
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,894
It would be great

221
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,797
if they could find Culprit X by then.

222
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,768
But I don't understand Mr. Katsuki.

223
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,069
What don't you understand?

224
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:23,075
Didn't he get to
make his ex-girlfriend grieve?

225
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,379
He should have been happy to
escape the consequences.

226
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,983
Why is he insisting that he did it?

227
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,686
He's just the kind of guy

228
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,187
who wants it to be his doing.

229
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,330
I wonder if that's all there is to it.

230
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,191
What other reason...

231
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,700
What's wrong, Uncle Kogoro?

232
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:48,667
Katsuki must've realised who Culprit X is!

233
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,170
- What?
- He's staying at the police station

234
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,773
to cover for Culprit X.

235
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,775
It could be.
That can explain some of it.

236
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,877
Anyway,

237
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:02,681
Odawara's old friend should know Katsuki.

238
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,785
He should also know who would
have a deep grudge against Odawara

239
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,388
and who Katsuki would cover for!

240
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,897
There's nobody.

241
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,940
Sorry?

242
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,567
(Koji Emoto (27), construction worker)
I said this to the inspector before.

243
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,900
(Koji Emoto (27), construction worker)
Odawara's not the kind of guy anyone
would have a grudge against.

244
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,070
Odawara's not the kind of guy anyone
would have a grudge against.

245
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,820
And about Katsuki...

246
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,777
I don't think he would cover for anyone.

247
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,480
He only cares about himself, after all.

248
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,684
Well, that's the kind of guy he is.

249
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,386
So why...

250
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,080
Hey, kid!

251
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,889
Let's go to the Odawara house!

252
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,590
We'll go everywhere we can!

253
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,450
Wait for me!

254
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,495
I see.

255
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,667
He was killed by Culprit X while sitting here.

256
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,870
But even if Culprit X snuck in,

257
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,572
wouldn't the victim have noticed

258
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,875
when someone was sneaking up on him?

259
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,177
We were also wondering about that.

260
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,000
He was probably asleep at that moment.

261
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,886
Could it be that Culprit X was a guest?

262
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,289
A guest would have come to
the living room normally,

263
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,191
and they could attack Mr. Odawara
when he's not looking.

264
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,395
But how does that explain
the Japanese-style window being broken?

265
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,890
It was a diversion!

266
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,267
So that the culprit wouldn't be suspected

267
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,569
as someone who knew the victim.

268
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,500
That could be it!

269
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,873
Yes.

270
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,076
"I'll get my revenge for
what happened long ago."

271
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,879
That was the call he received.

272
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,580
I see.

273
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,884
But Shuhei couldn't
recall anything relevant,

274
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,686
so he tried to hang up
since he thought it was a prank.

275
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,689
You should also warn those close to you.

276
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,993
They should take care
as to not get involved.

277
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:58,097
Shuhei said he was concerned,

278
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,299
so he told me.

279
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,669
He wouldn't have told me about it otherwise.

280
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,574
I told him to consult a security company.

281
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,875
But then...

282
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,178
Is that so?

283
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,281
You don't remember what they looked like?

284
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,350
Yes.

285
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,400
But I haven't seen anyone so suspicious.

286
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,388
When I called out to him,

287
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,570
he panicked and ran away.

288
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,293
What's the deal with Culprit X?

289
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,196
It's like he's advertising to
people that he's suspicious.

290
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,967
Someone who leaves
a suspicious phone call

291
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,670
and sneaks around the house
can only be seen

292
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,273
as wanting to let people know they exist.

293
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,175
But why?

294
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,376
Seriously.

295
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,578
We're running out of time.

296
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,982
I would have liked to
find out who Culprit X was

297
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,084
before the detention period ended
and that guy was released

298
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,789
so that Inspector Megure
would stop worrying...

299
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,092
So that's how it is.

300
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,500
In that case...

301
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,295
(Eito-cho Shopping District)

302
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,499
What is it that you want us to check,
Detective Mouri?

303
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,500
Yes. That's right.

304
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,773
It was the morning of the day Shuhei died.

305
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,079
I apologize for causing you so much trouble

306
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,250
for the last two days.

307
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,084
Good grief.
If you just wanted to apologise,

308
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,380
you shouldn't have stayed at the station.

309
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,688
But I had a reason for insisting

310
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,891
that I was the culprit
even though it wasn't true.

311
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:37,596
I was frustrated that
someone else beat me to it.

312
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,100
My plan was perfect!

313
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,468
I didn't want to admit defeat!

314
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,970
In any case,

315
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,773
even though you didn't happen to
kill the victim,

316
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,375
what you did...

317
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,878
What you did...

318
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,480
Should be stopped.

319
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,181
Detective Mouri?

320
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,783
Is this it?

321
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,986
Don't you think it's strange, Inspector?

322
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,588
What is it?

323
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,590
The threatening phone call to the victim

324
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,092
and the suspicious person
appearing in broad daylight.

325
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,494
I can't think of any reason
for them other than

326
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:13,899
that person is trying to
say that they're Culprit X.

327
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,769
You may be right.

328
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,872
What are you trying to say?

329
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,675
In other words, Culprit X doesn't exist.

330
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:28,981
And the person who killed Odawara
is none other than...

331
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,980
You, Yosuke Katsuki.

332
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,500
What?

333
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,050
On the afternoon of the crime,

334
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,593
you visited Odawara at his home.

335
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,197
While waiting for the chance to strike,

336
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,498
you put on your gloves

337
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,067
and killed Odawara from behind.

338
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,171
Then, you stayed there for a while.

339
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,274
When evening came,

340
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,276
you used your bare hands to
hit the back of Odawara's head

341
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,078
with the steel pipe.

342
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,084
It means Culprit X
is an imaginary person.

343
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
A person who was created by Katsuki

344
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,689
so that he could escape the police!

345
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,095
Not only that,

346
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,297
you hinted at the existence of Culprit X

347
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,266
by preparing in advance.

348
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,170
The phone call to Odawara
was one of them.

349
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,973
But it couldn't be proven

350
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,876
if the receiver died, so...

351
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,779
You should also warn those close to you.

352
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,182
They should take care
as to not get involved.

353
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,480
You said it so that Miss Tomoko Yaguchi
was set up as a witness.

354
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,890
You also wore suspicious clothing

355
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,092
so that an eyewitness could see it.

356
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,495
It's unnatural to be out
wearing clothes like that

357
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,680
in broad daylight to scope out the scene.

358
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,600
Breaking the windowpane was so that

359
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,970
it looked like
there was a culprit other than you.

360
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
You also hit Odawara's body
using the steel pipe

361
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,375
hours after killing him with the rope

362
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,177
for the same reason.

363
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,280
Finally, you let yourself get arrested

364
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,430
to mislead the police.

365
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,280
To mislead the police?

366
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,086
He did it himself.

367
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,150
There's no Culprit X.

368
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,390
The police kept insisting that
Culprit X exists

369
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,394
and thought Katsuki was frustrated
for being overtaken.

370
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,796
That was how there was no doubt

371
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,798
in Culprit X's existence.

372
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,300
Certainly.

373
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,771
Excuse me.

374
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,973
May I ask, Detective Mouri?

375
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,276
If I wanted to get away from the police,

376
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,878
wouldn't it have been much easier

377
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,381
to make it look like a hit-and-run?

378
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,183
No matter how careful you were,

379
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,286
you couldn't completely
eliminate traces of yourself

380
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,688
at the crime scene.

381
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,890
That's how you got the idea.

382
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,495
If you were to sneak in
and kill Odawara,

383
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,900
you're bound to leave traces.

384
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,367
But if you were beaten to it
by someone else,

385
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,470
you'd be able to escape suspicion.

386
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,272
How absurd.

387
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,075
You must be imagining things,
Detective Mouri.

388
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,579
You don't even have supporting evidence.

389
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,780
You may be right.

390
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,482
By the way, Katsuki,

391
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:21,486
when did you prepare the duplicate key
to sneak into that house?

392
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:26,291
I guess it was a week or two ago.

393
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,494
It was so long ago that
I don't quite remember.

394
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,967
When Miss Yaguchi heard about
the suspicious phone call,

395
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:40,772
she asked Odawara to
consult a security company.

396
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,975
Upon checking with them,

397
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:47,379
he had the keys to
the front door changed just in case.

398
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,082
It was changed on the morning
before the incident.

399
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,884
In other words,

400
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,688
even if you had a duplicate key,

401
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,891
you couldn't have opened the front door.

402
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,497
We found it, Detective Mouri.

403
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,499
What did you find?

404
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,950
I asked for it.

405
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,570
I wanted to check the footage

406
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,400
from the security camera
at Sebundai Station.

407
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:19,350
On 29 September at 12:58 pm,

408
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,700
Mr. Katsuki was seen passing through
the ticket gate at the station.

409
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,684
On the day of the incident,
where were you in the hours

410
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,087
between 1 pm when you were
at Sebundai Station

411
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,650
and the evening
when you beat up Odawara's corpse?

412
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,397
Answer me, Yosuke Katsuki.

413
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,271
Well, then.

414
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,274
Shall I go back to the holding cell?

415
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:53,578
Struggling doesn't suit me.

416
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,984
Take him away!

417
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,667
Goodness.

418
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,071
I can't believe
he just stayed at the police station.

419
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,873
More draught beer, please!

420
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,876
You'd better get home, Detective Mouri.

421
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,979
The customers reserving the place
are waiting.

422
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,481
It's fine. Just give me one more.

423
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,383
Even half a pint is fine by me.
Come on, how about it?

424
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:43,188
Hey... He's the one staying for too long here.

425
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,192
(Next Episode)
Even if my mouth is forced open,

426
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,895
there's no way I can say it!

427
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,498
Thanks for your patience,

428
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,168
Yoko Okino!

429
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,269
It's okay.

430
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,350
It's a locked-room murder.

431
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:09,080
If you're talking about the footprints
in the hallway...

432
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,782
Next Conan,

433
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,930
"Yoko Okino and the Locked Room in the Attic
(Part 1)"

434
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,171
Next Conan's Hint:
Here you go.

435
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,973
"A deck of cards"

436
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,374
My beer mug is empty again!

437
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,576
This can only be a mystery!

438
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,677
You're the one who did it.

439
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,078
Of course...
