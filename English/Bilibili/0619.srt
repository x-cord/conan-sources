1
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.740
Satan!

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.040
The devil.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.340
What? The devil?

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.440
But there are still two keywords left.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.740
It's still too soon to conclude that it's the devil.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.240
But the remaining two are...

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.040
"A long-nosed wizard living in a castle"

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.340
and "Pierce through the white back with two swords." Right?

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.940
They sound eerie even before looking for the keyword.

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.440
As for the long-nosed wizard living in a castle,

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.140
I've figured out where it is!

12
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.440
The long nose is the elephant!

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.140
Then, for the word castle...

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.640
There's a district called Elephant & Castle in London,

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.140
so will you try going there for me!

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.340
But, where do I go when I get there?

17
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.840
Well, I guess you can start with the station or something.

18
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.340
Okay! I'll try going to Elephant & Castle Station!

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.540
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.440
The target that emerges beyond the code.

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.440
Who is the culprit's target?

23
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.240
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.591
An eerie coded paper awaited us when we got to London.

27
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.291
It was a forewarning of a crime

28
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.791
that would be committed by Hades Sabara

29
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:57.391
a vicious killer who was on the run.

30
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.191
Each sentence of the code

31
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:05.091
indicated a characteristic building in London.

32
00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.591
And in each place,

33
00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:10.091
hints that appeared in Holmes' novels were left behind.

34
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.091
The hint was a letter of the alphabet one at a time.

35
00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:16.191
We continued to decipher the code

36
00:03:16.191 --> 00:03:19.291
and got hold of five letters.

37
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:21.091
There are only two more letters left.

38
00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:24.191
You just wait, Hades!

39
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:26.191
I'll decipher the code at all cost

40
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:28.691
and prevent you from committing the crime!

41
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:37.991
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Code Break)"

42
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.691
"Elephant and Castle Station" -Well...

43
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:44.191
we came to the station and looked for close to an hour,

44
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:46.391
but we've come up with nothing!

45
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:51.491
Shinichi. Are you sure it's here?

46
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.491
Yeah. I'm sure the place is right, but...

47
00:03:55.491 --> 00:03:59.091
It could be the shopping mall in the same district.

48
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:01.991
Hey.

49
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.891
That man...

50
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:05.491
He's been going back and forth

51
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.891
since we've come here, hasn't he?

52
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:09.691
True.

53
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:11.491
Hey, Shinichi!

54
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.091
The briefcase that the man is holding

55
00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:17.091
has written in large letters the word "identity!"

56
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:18.591
That's probably...

57
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.891
"A Case of Identity", a title of Holmes' story,

58
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.691
with the Japanese title, "Disappearance of the Flower Lady".

59
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.891
Please ask that man.

60
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.391
It seems that he was paid by someone

61
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:34.391
who told him to stay in front of station

62
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.791
looking the same and walk around.

63
00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:39.991
He says that the empty case and the clothes he's wearing

64
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.391
were all given to him by this person.

65
00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:44.091
His clothes too?

66
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:47.791
When I look at a woman,

67
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:49.891
the first thing I look closely at are the sleeves.

68
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:50.891
In the case of men,

69
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.991
you should probably look at the knees of his trousers.

70
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:55.891
The knees of his trousers!

71
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:57.391
Look at the knees of the man!

72
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:00.791
Huh? The knees?

73
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.291
But there's nothing written there.

74
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:05.191
-Then, flip his trousers up! -What?

75
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.891
-What? -What are you doing?

76
00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:09.491
Hey, hey. What are you doing here?

77
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.691
I found it!

78
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.891
On the back of the trousers by the knee part!

79
00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:15.191
It's the letter "U"!

80
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:22.491
So, now we've got T, N, A, A, S, U.

81
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:26.191
The only code left then, is, "Finish everything off.

82
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:31.591
Pierce the white back with two swords." The last sentence.

83
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:35.191
The thing that bothers me is "the white back" and "two swords".

84
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:36.491
There aren't anything shaped like that,

85
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.791
or a building or place with that kind of name.

86
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.891
I see! It's this!

87
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.591
It's the mark of the porcelain maker!

88
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.791
"Pierce the white back with two swords"

89
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.691
was referring to the mark of the two swords on the dish

90
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:57.791
that is famous for its whiteness!

91
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:01.091
Then, are you saying that you want us to go to the store in London

92
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:02.391
where that maker's things are next?

93
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:05.191
Mother used to go to that store a lot!

94
00:06:05.191 --> 00:06:08.891
Mother loves the dishes of that maker.

95
00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:11.691
And there's only one store in London that carries things of that maker!

96
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:14.691
What? A strange decoration?

97
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.091
Yep. I asked the salesclerk and was told that

98
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.691
they were bothered because someone would come

99
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:21.791
and put a strange decoration on the sign of the store.

100
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:24.491
What kind of decoration is it?

101
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:27.691
There is a bell on the tip of strings of various colors.

102
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:31.291
There seems to be one letter on each of the bells.

103
00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.891
There are words that look to be a title too

104
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.591
on the part where the strings are bunched together.

105
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:38.291
But it's soiled and I can't make it out.

106
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:40.491
The title is probably...

107
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.291
"A Study in Scarlet."

108
00:06:43.291 --> 00:06:45.491
It's the very first novel,

109
00:06:45.491 --> 00:06:47.391
that Conan Doyle wrote of Sherlock Holmes',

110
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.491
"A Study in Scarlet" -bringing him into this world!

111
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.691
Take the scarlet string from the bunch.

112
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.491
In other words, find a bright red string!

113
00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:00.891
Holmes' dialogue in that story goes like this.

114
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:03.391
"There's a scarlet thread of murder

115
00:07:03.391 --> 00:07:06.591
mixed among the colorless skein of life.

116
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:10.491
Our duty is to unravel it, isolate it

117
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:11.591
and expose every inch of it,

118
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:14.891
under the light of the sun as soon as possible."

119
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:17.291
I found it, the red thread!

120
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.391
The letter "R" is written on the bell

121
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:22.091
that's attached to that string!

122
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.891
If the "R" is the final letter, it means

123
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:32.791
that the keywords are the seven letters, T, N, A, A, S, U, R.

124
00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:35.691
If the five letter make out the word "Satan",

125
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:38.391
what about the other two letters, U and R?

126
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:43.191
Hey, Shinichi?

127
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.191
It seems that only one "A" is necessary.

128
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.691
-Huh? -The order of the letters is...

129
00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:55.391
"Saturn".

130
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.891
Planet Saturn!

131
00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:58.691
Therefore, the culprit's probably

132
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.591
planning to do something on Saturday.

133
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:03.291
Saturday...

134
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:05.791
Hey, that's tomorrow?

135
00:08:05.791 --> 00:08:07.591
Hold it...

136
00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:08.991
If it were in Japanese,

137
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.291
I can see that you'd come up with the word "Saturday"

138
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:11.791
because of the kanji character used to write it,

139
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:17.191
but you don't write it like that in English, do you?

140
00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:19.291
The etymology of Saturn

141
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:23.791
comes from the agricultural god of Roman mythology, Saturnus.

142
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:26.691
Saturnus' day became Saturday

143
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:30.291
and Saturnus is pronounced "Saturn" in English.

144
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.391
Is that so?

145
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.991
But, where on Saturday is it going to happen?

146
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.691
Apollo!

147
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.591
It sounds Apollo!

148
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:40.891
Mom!

149
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:43.091
How did you know I was here?

150
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:46.191
The solution of the code brought me here.

151
00:08:46.191 --> 00:08:49.591
The last sentence might hint this boutique.

152
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:52.491
See, I told you so, Ares.

153
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:56.891
Yes, you deserve to be a Sherlockian.

154
00:08:56.891 --> 00:09:00.891
Now, we are going back to the hotel!

155
00:09:00.891 --> 00:09:04.391
Tomorrow, we are going to watch Minerva's game!

156
00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:05.791
Not now!

157
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:07.891
Leave solving the code to us,

158
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.891
and you go home to your mama, sonny!

159
00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:11.691
But...

160
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:15.691
Hey, your mother says we're all going to go cheer,

161
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.091
but if I remember correctly, weren't your mother's eyes...

162
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.091
She can't see, but she can tell by sounds!

163
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:22.491
"Juno Grass (45), MG's mother" -That's why mother always...

164
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.291
comes only to the finals!

165
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:26.191
She makes sure to come

166
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.591
"Ales Ashley (30), MG's ex-coach" -because big sis lost

167
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:29.791
at French Open Tennis Finals last year, since mother wasn't there.

168
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.891
Apollo, be an angel and jump in the car!

169
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:36.691
Though I broke all of the codes,

170
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:40.591
I can't find out what and where it will happen!

171
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.091
Of course, you can't.

172
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:48.091
Because you didn't break them.

173
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.191
Now, I gave you a chance.

174
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:58.591
It's your fault that you can't stop my final revenge

175
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.191
since you couldn't read my revelations.

176
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.191
Curse your incompetence.

177
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:12.491
Holmes' apprentice is on your side, right?

178
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:14.391
He'll make it clear.

179
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:18.491
Holmes' apprentice?

180
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:22.491
No kidding.

181
00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:32.996
"The following day" -Really, talk about easygoing...

182
00:10:32.996 --> 00:10:34.796
Today is Saturday.

183
00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:39.396
There may be a massacre somewhere here in London

184
00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:41.396
and they go walking with their dog.

185
00:10:41.396 --> 00:10:43.696
You notified Scotland Yard

186
00:10:43.696 --> 00:10:48.396
that the code was deciphered to mean "Saturday", didn't you?

187
00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:51.496
Yep. The seven code sentences

188
00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:54.396
each indicate buildings or places.

189
00:10:54.396 --> 00:10:59.196
And in every place one keyword letter is hidden.

190
00:10:59.196 --> 00:11:00.696
When you connect the letters together,

191
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:02.696
the word "Saturn" came up, so it's Saturday!

192
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:03.996
I went on to explain that therefore,

193
00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.896
the culprit may be planning to carry something

194
00:11:06.896 --> 00:11:08.896
out on Saturday, but...

195
00:11:08.896 --> 00:11:11.896
I was asked which Saturday is it?

196
00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:14.896
And the person hung up the phone after telling me

197
00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:16.196
that unless I can give him what's going to happen where,

198
00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:17.796
there's nothing he can do.

199
00:11:17.796 --> 00:11:21.796
Didn't that detective kid say anything?

200
00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:25.096
Shinichi said, he had to go investigate a different case,

201
00:11:25.096 --> 00:11:27.396
so that he'd leave the rest up to us.

202
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:30.096
Leave the rest up to us...

203
00:11:30.096 --> 00:11:32.696
I mean, we solved the last hint that was left to solve

204
00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:36.696
and found out that something's going to happen on Saturday.

205
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.596
What else does he want us to do anyway?

206
00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:44.696
Maybe the code isn't completely deciphered yet.

207
00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:49.296
Because there's only one letter "A" in the keyword Saturn.

208
00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:52.996
Maybe there's another reason why Big Ben

209
00:11:52.996 --> 00:11:55.596
where the letter A was found, came out twice?

210
00:11:55.596 --> 00:11:58.396
Conan! Is your cold okay, already?

211
00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:01.596
Yep! Although I'm still coughing a bit...

212
00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:06.896
What's with this guy called Hades Sabara, anyway?

213
00:12:06.896 --> 00:12:10.696
Why's he handing out coded warnings of a crime?

214
00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.596
Maybe he loves the attention he's getting.

215
00:12:13.596 --> 00:12:17.496
In the past when he bombed the hospital,

216
00:12:17.496 --> 00:12:20.396
he also sent out a coded warning of the crime he was going to commit.

217
00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:22.096
After he blew up the hospital,

218
00:12:22.096 --> 00:12:23.396
it seems that he sent the police

219
00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:27.296
a video tape of the scene and all.

220
00:12:27.296 --> 00:12:28.396
He seems to have also included

221
00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:31.396
a letter of explanation of the code back then.

222
00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:33.096
I see.

223
00:12:33.096 --> 00:12:36.996
It's like he's saying "catch me if you can".

224
00:12:36.996 --> 00:12:40.396
If so, we'd better figure out the real meaning of the code

225
00:12:40.396 --> 00:12:42.196
and report it to the police.

226
00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:45.796
And we better be really careful!

227
00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:47.696
At the time of the 2nd hospital,

228
00:12:47.696 --> 00:12:49.796
the code was somehow deciphered

229
00:12:49.796 --> 00:12:52.796
but the hospital seems to have blown up

230
00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:54.696
right after the bomb squad charged inside.

231
00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:56.096
What?

232
00:12:56.096 --> 00:12:57.696
Which means that he's going to carry out whatever he plans to do,

233
00:12:57.696 --> 00:12:59.296
whether we solve the code or not!

234
00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:00.896
It seems that the video tape taken at that time

235
00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:03.296
was also sent to the police!

236
00:13:03.296 --> 00:13:05.596
They say that Hades' voice saying, "Too late"

237
00:13:05.596 --> 00:13:07.596
was also included in the video.

238
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:12.696
That's why in order to keep him from carrying out the crime,

239
00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:14.796
we've to decipher the code accurately,

240
00:13:14.796 --> 00:13:16.796
secretly go over to the place indicated,

241
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.396
sneak up to him and then nab him.

242
00:13:19.396 --> 00:13:22.796
If I remember correctly, the City Hall and Gherkins are...

243
00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:26.396
standing confronting each other, with the Thames between them.

244
00:13:26.396 --> 00:13:27.796
When you went to the place

245
00:13:27.796 --> 00:13:29.196
that was indicated by the code,

246
00:13:29.196 --> 00:13:32.196
didn't you see anyone suspicious?

247
00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:34.496
A suspicious person?

248
00:13:34.496 --> 00:13:35.896
Come to think of it,

249
00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:39.096
there was a woman wearing sunglasses.

250
00:13:39.096 --> 00:13:40.396
Could it be...

251
00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:43.696
Did she look like this?

252
00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:47.096
She's an expert on explosives that's helping Hades out.

253
00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:50.796
I can't really say for sure.

254
00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:53.196
I see! A balloon!

255
00:13:53.196 --> 00:13:55.896
Maybe that Hades guy is planning to attach a bomb to a balloon

256
00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:58.696
and let it fly off?

257
00:13:58.696 --> 00:14:00.696
First, it takes off from the first Big Ben

258
00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:02.696
that is in the coded sentence.

259
00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:03.996
Then it'll fly by Elephant and Castle Station

260
00:14:03.996 --> 00:14:05.796
that's mentioned in the 2nd sentence.

261
00:14:05.796 --> 00:14:08.096
Then on to City Hall in the 3rd sentence.

262
00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:10.996
After that, it'll cross the Thames,

263
00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:13.396
pass through Gherkins in the fourth sentence,

264
00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:15.796
over to St. Bride Church that is in the fifth sentence,

265
00:14:15.796 --> 00:14:17.396
and go pass it.

266
00:14:17.396 --> 00:14:20.296
Then, back to Big Ben in the sixth sentence.

267
00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:22.396
Finally to the last sentence...

268
00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:24.496
If a line is drawn from the store

269
00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.996
that sells chinaware on Walton Ave...

270
00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:29.196
See, look!

271
00:14:31.396 --> 00:14:33.996
It looks just like a balloon!

272
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:36.596
Big Ben came out twice in the coded sentence

273
00:14:36.596 --> 00:14:39.296
because a line had to be drawn in the order

274
00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:41.896
as indicated in the coded sentence!

275
00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:48.496
Rather, than a balloon... I think that's...

276
00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:49.496
Don't tell me that...

277
00:14:50.496 --> 00:14:52.996
Excuse me.

278
00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:55.796
We're looking for this man. Have you seen him?

279
00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:56.896
I'm sorry?

280
00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:01.296
He seems to have entered the toilet that you came out of.

281
00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:03.096
Who is this man?

282
00:15:03.096 --> 00:15:07.696
He's known to be the mass murderer terrifying the people in London.

283
00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:11.696
And he seems to have changed his appearance to this.

284
00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:15.596
Sorry, I haven't seen him!

285
00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:17.696
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

286
00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:22.296
Oh, he won't be around here.

287
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.796
Yeah, I guess so.

288
00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:26.896
Incompetent fools.

289
00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:28.496
Just as I thought,

290
00:15:28.496 --> 00:15:31.396
nobody even comes close to my level.

291
00:15:35.996 --> 00:15:38.996
It's a bit of a throw off that I get no resistance,

292
00:15:38.996 --> 00:15:40.196
but this is the last thing I have to do

293
00:15:40.196 --> 00:15:42.496
to take revenge for mother.

294
00:15:42.496 --> 00:15:44.996
It's not bad ending it all quietly.

295
00:15:44.996 --> 00:15:48.196
Yes, for my mother's sake.

296
00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:50.396
I'll hush this place up.

297
00:15:50.396 --> 00:15:52.296
This place that echoes with cheer.

298
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:59.496
This Wimbledon Center Court.

299
00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:00.696
This...

300
00:16:00.696 --> 00:16:03.296
Hades Sabara will...

301
00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:08.096
What? A tennis racket?

302
00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:10.396
-Not a balloon? -Yep!

303
00:16:10.396 --> 00:16:13.696
It's true that it's a little crooked,

304
00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:15.896
but it does sort of look like a racket.

305
00:16:15.896 --> 00:16:19.296
Hey, hey. When you refer to racket in London...

306
00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:20.996
The Wimbledon!

307
00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:24.296
Minerva is competing in the finals today at 14:00!

308
00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:28.196
But, wasn't the Wimbledon ruled out?

309
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.296
Yep.

310
00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:33.096
If the culprit told all the children that he gave the coded paper

311
00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:35.596
to that "Someone would die right in front of their eyes",

312
00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:37.396
I thought it wasn't Wimbledon.

313
00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.496
Taking into consideration that the police are not

314
00:16:39.496 --> 00:16:42.496
on their guard of a massacre about to happen yet.

315
00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:45.896
He probably relayed those words only to Apollo.

316
00:16:45.896 --> 00:16:48.396
He passed out the same paper with coded sentences to other children

317
00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:52.096
just to confuse the police.

318
00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:54.796
If somebody's going to die in front of Apollo,

319
00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:59.696
the culprit may be after the finals of the Wimbledon.

320
00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:03.196
But, why is the Wimbledon?

321
00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:05.396
Maybe it has something to do with tennis.

322
00:17:05.396 --> 00:17:08.496
The culprit gave Apollo the paper with the codes

323
00:17:08.496 --> 00:17:10.196
at the Wimbledon grounds too.

324
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:13.396
That something is maybe the bookie?

325
00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:16.896
Hades' mother passed away of a heart disease

326
00:17:16.896 --> 00:17:18.596
in July last year.

327
00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:20.296
It seems that a month before

328
00:17:20.296 --> 00:17:23.996
that Hades bet on a certain match through a bookie and lost.

329
00:17:23.996 --> 00:17:25.196
Come to think of it,

330
00:17:25.196 --> 00:17:28.396
Minerva lost at the French Open last year.

331
00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:31.096
The finals back then was in June, wasn't it?

332
00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:35.296
If I remember correctly, she won all the matches she entered

333
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:37.496
except for those she skipped because of injury.

334
00:17:37.496 --> 00:17:39.996
So, if Hades tried to make just a little more cash

335
00:17:39.996 --> 00:17:41.696
for his mother's surgery,

336
00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:47.996
and bet a great sum of money on her sure-win game...

337
00:17:47.996 --> 00:17:49.696
And if he lost the bet, lost a great sum of money,

338
00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:51.596
and couldn't pay for his mother's surgery,

339
00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:52.596
which resulted in her death...

340
00:17:52.596 --> 00:17:56.096
Then, don't tell me that the culprit is after...

341
00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:59.496
Grass Queen, Minerva Grass!

342
00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:13.496
I wonder if she's okay.

343
00:18:13.496 --> 00:18:16.896
Yep! She'll win for sure since you're here, mother!

344
00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:19.196
But, are you sure you really don't mind

345
00:18:19.196 --> 00:18:21.396
always sitting in the general seat here?

346
00:18:21.396 --> 00:18:24.596
No. I don't like the family seats.

347
00:18:26.296 --> 00:18:28.496
The TV stations will zoom me,

348
00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:30.596
because they know I can't see the match.

349
00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:32.496
If Minerva sees this while she's competing,

350
00:18:32.496 --> 00:18:36.096
it'll distract her, wouldn't it?

351
00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:38.396
Well, though it seems that

352
00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:39.596
she always seems to find where I am,

353
00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:42.396
by the time the match ends.

354
00:18:42.396 --> 00:18:45.096
But it's really disappointing

355
00:18:45.096 --> 00:18:46.796
that this match will be the last one

356
00:18:46.796 --> 00:18:48.696
I'll be watching with you.

357
00:18:48.696 --> 00:18:53.196
After all, I thought you were going to be my son-in-law.

358
00:18:53.196 --> 00:18:55.496
I took your husband away from you,

359
00:18:55.496 --> 00:18:58.096
and I can't possibly also take your daughter from you too.

360
00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:01.796
Is it true that you're going to be someone else's coach?

361
00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:06.396
Yeah. So it'll be difficult to see you all.

362
00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.996
Well, it'll work out.

363
00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:10.096
Your sister can work things out on her own

364
00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:11.896
without me already.

365
00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:14.696
Hey, hey.

366
00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:16.796
It's after 14:00 already!

367
00:19:16.796 --> 00:19:18.596
The match has already started!

368
00:19:18.596 --> 00:19:22.396
But, what do you propose to do when you get to Wimbledon?

369
00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:24.396
We don't even have tickets.

370
00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:28.096
We'll just have to do something about it somehow!

371
00:19:28.096 --> 00:19:30.096
Do something somehow...

372
00:19:30.096 --> 00:19:31.996
How about it? Conan.

373
00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:33.596
Did you get a hold of Apollo?

374
00:19:33.596 --> 00:19:37.396
No. Maybe his cell phone is switched off

375
00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:38.996
because he's watching the match.

376
00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:40.696
Hello?

377
00:19:40.696 --> 00:19:43.396
-Apollo! -Just what were you doing?

378
00:19:43.396 --> 00:19:45.596
Not contacting me at all!

379
00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:48.096
Sorry. Where are you now?

380
00:19:48.096 --> 00:19:50.996
I couldn't talk in the spectator's seat,

381
00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:52.596
so I came out to the corridor.

382
00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:55.596
Since you're calling me,

383
00:19:55.596 --> 00:19:59.696
did you catch the culprit who gave me the coded letter?

384
00:19:59.696 --> 00:20:01.296
No, not yet.

385
00:20:01.296 --> 00:20:03.496
Then, don't call me now!

386
00:20:03.496 --> 00:20:06.796
I'm watching big sis play, you know!

387
00:20:06.796 --> 00:20:10.796
And, did anything out of the ordinary happen over there?

388
00:20:10.796 --> 00:20:12.996
Like somebody talking to you or something.

389
00:20:12.996 --> 00:20:15.596
Yeah, the fans of big sis told me

390
00:20:15.596 --> 00:20:17.796
to hang in there and encouraged me!

391
00:20:17.796 --> 00:20:20.896
Everybody knows the faces of mother, Ales and I,

392
00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:25.196
so I also got a big stuffed doll for sis!

393
00:20:25.196 --> 00:20:27.396
How does your sister look like she's doing?

394
00:20:27.396 --> 00:20:29.196
How she's doing?

395
00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:31.396
Like always I guess.

396
00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:34.496
The match has just started.

397
00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:37.696
But, why are you asking those questions?

398
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:40.196
Don't tell me that something's going to happen here?

399
00:20:42.296 --> 00:20:45.296
No, it's not that.

400
00:20:45.296 --> 00:20:48.696
We decided that we wanted to watch your sister's match too.

401
00:20:48.696 --> 00:20:51.196
Do you happen to have any extra tickets?

402
00:20:51.196 --> 00:20:52.496
Extra?

403
00:20:52.996 --> 00:20:55.396
"Wimbledon Front Gate" -Well, I guess not.

404
00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:57.396
No tickets are available, I'm sure.

405
00:20:57.396 --> 00:20:59.796
And we're already by the gate.

406
00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:01.596
We know that a vicious criminal

407
00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:04.796
is among the crowd inside and yet...

408
00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.896
Darn it! I guess I just have to...

409
00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:09.296
Hey, hey.

410
00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:12.096
Oh, Sleeping Detective!

411
00:21:13.396 --> 00:21:15.396
Are you here for the game?

412
00:21:15.396 --> 00:21:17.696
Diana!

413
00:21:17.696 --> 00:21:20.096
I forgot our tickets!

414
00:21:20.096 --> 00:21:22.196
Can you help me with this?

415
00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:25.496
How about this idea?

416
00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:32.596
I see.

417
00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:33.896
As long as we have admission tickets,

418
00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:36.296
even though we can't get inside the center court,

419
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.996
we can watch the finals on this huge screen here!

420
00:21:39.996 --> 00:21:42.796
So, this is the famous Murray Mound!

421
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:44.996
We were sure lucky though,

422
00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:48.596
that Diana has influence over the Steering Committee here,

423
00:21:48.596 --> 00:21:52.196
and was able to immediately get tickets for us.

424
00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:54.796
Well, but as expected, we weren't able to push our luck

425
00:21:54.796 --> 00:21:57.796
as far as to get tickets for the Center Court, though.

426
00:21:58.996 --> 00:22:02.296
Who the heck is she? That old lady...

427
00:22:02.296 --> 00:22:05.396
And, how's the match going?

428
00:22:05.396 --> 00:22:08.896
It seems that Minerva's not in mint condition.

429
00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:11.496
All her serves are touching the net

430
00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.996
and she's losing with a score of 3-1.

431
00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:18.196
Let!

432
00:22:18.196 --> 00:22:20.096
First service!

433
00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:26.296
Please... somebody...

434
00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:31.496
Anybody, help...

435
00:22:32.896 --> 00:22:34.296
Help me...

436
00:22:34.296 --> 00:22:35.696
Holmes!

437
00:23:58.396 --> 00:23:59.696
"Next Episode" -Huh?

438
00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:01.996
Big sis is the target of the culprit?

439
00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:05.496
Soon... Soon, mother...

440
00:24:05.496 --> 00:24:09.096
There's no way that someone like you

441
00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:11.496
would exist in this world.

442
00:24:11.496 --> 00:24:14.296
A man like Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:17.096
I'll help you!

444
00:24:17.096 --> 00:24:20.096
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

445
00:24:20.096 --> 00:24:22.796
Holmes' apprentice?

446
00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:24.296
Next Conan,

447
00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:28.217
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Grass Court Queen)"

448
00:24:29.123 --> 00:24:31.223
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:24:31.223 --> 00:24:33.523
"A stuffed bear"

450
00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:36.523
I'll stop you no matter what.

451
00:24:36.523 --> 00:24:38.102
Am I talking to myself?
