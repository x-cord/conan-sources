1
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240
Cool! Let me touch it too.

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.640
It's so thorny. I guess it hurts.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.940
Dad got it for me at the department store!

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.940
I've got a stag beetle at home too! -How lucky.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.140
It's meaningless if you don't go and catch them yourself!

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
But, I'd like to have a beetle too.

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.340
Yeah.

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.440
Beetle?

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.840
So that's what you want?

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840
You're a kid after all.

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.940
You can catch as many beetles as you want.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540
Really?

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.940
You're gonna get it if it's a lie!

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.340
Yeah, an old friend of mine lives in Yamanashi, you see.

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.040
He's been asking me to go and see him.

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.440
If we go there, you can catch as many beetles as you like.

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.840
And so, we decided to go visit Doc's old friend.

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.740
Talk about going into the mountains.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.340
For sure, we'll be able to catch lots of beetles and stag beetles here!

20
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.540
Absolutely!

21
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.740
Maybe we'll even find a Giant Hercules Beetle!

22
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.640
Wow!

23
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.940
No, we won't.

24
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.640
If all cases were men,

25
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.340
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.540
Beetles, stag beetles and Buddhist statues?

27
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.040
The detective squad goes on an all out investigation.

28
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.840
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.179
"Pursue the Miyama Stag Beetle"

32
00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.179
He said he'd come to pick us up, but...

33
00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.679
There isn't even a convenience store in sight.

34
00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.479
There aren't any vending machines either.

35
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.479
Agasa.

36
00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.279
Ryutaro, long time no see!

37
00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.979
How are you doing?

38
00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.479
I'm doing just great!

39
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.879
Let me introduce.

40
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.679
He's my friend, Ryutaro Namatame.

41
00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.979
"Ryutaro Namatame (52)" -Thanks for coming all the way here, kids.

42
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.579
Welcome.

43
00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.979
-We'll be in your care! -We'll be in your care!

44
00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.379
You said that your house is located at the foot of the mountain.

45
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.179
Is it far from here?

46
00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.979
No, it's just about an hour from here by car.

47
00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.679
Well, I'm dying of thirst.

48
00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.379
Can I get something to drink?

49
00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.979
What a nuisance of a brat.

50
00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.079
Follow me.

51
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.579
"Roadside Resting Place"

52
00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.179
I'll have coke.

53
00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:28.479
I want a large serving of soft ice cream cone!

54
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.179
I'll have... What should I have?

55
00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:34.779
Hey, Kei!

56
00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.679
Seeing that you're having lunch here,

57
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.179
it must mean that you went to play pachinko again.

58
00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.879
No... No way!

59
00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.279
"Kei Yabe (27)" -Geez, how rude!

60
00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.679
I brought some watermelons

61
00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:48.679
that I grew here to the direct sales store.

62
00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.379
I doubt that.

63
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.879
Don't you ever get into debt again

64
00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.379
and make your mother suffer again.

65
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.379
I know.

66
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.379
It's a beetle. How large!

67
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.679
There's a Miyama stag beetle too. Awesome!

68
00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:04.479
Hey!

69
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.079
That's not for sale. Don't touch it!

70
00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.979
"Shuhei Ikeda (50)" -Someone from a department store in Tokyo

71
00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.479
is going to come to purchase them.

72
00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.779
I can't sell them if they become weak!

73
00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.379
Shuhei, they were just looking at the beetles.

74
00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.279
Why all the fuss?

75
00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.979
Ryutaro, are they your acquaintances?

76
00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.979
Yeah, they're my guests from Tokyo.

77
00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.679
Don't go into our mountains

78
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:30.279
just because you want beetles now.

79
00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:34.579
What a warm welcome after we just got here.

80
00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.279
Oh, my! How cute!

81
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.979
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.079
Shuhei's always been stingy and suspicious of others

83
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.979
ever since he was a child.

84
00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.579
Moreover, we're having issues regarding the border of the land we own.

85
00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:49.679
You're having issues regarding the land?

86
00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:52.579
Does that mean you're rich, sir?

87
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:54.179
Don't be silly.

88
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:57.079
Well, since I own a farm, I won't starve,

89
00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.779
but I have no money at all.

90
00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.879
But, we can all sleep over here, can't we?

91
00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.179
Although it's an old house, there are many rooms, so don't worry.

92
00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:09.879
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

93
00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.779
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

94
00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.179
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

95
00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:17.479
was something from the Kamakura era.

96
00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.479
I'll take this!

97
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.279
Okay, thank you very much!

98
00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.479
This picture is sort of frightening.

99
00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.379
As expected of ignorant children.

100
00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.379
It could be a piece drawn by Okyo Maruyama, you know.

101
00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.179
And that statue of Buddha may have been made by Unkei.

102
00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:46.579
It can't be...

103
00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:50.179
Never mind that. Let's hurry and go!

104
00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:51.579
Yeah!

105
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.579
I have to catch a stag beetle no matter what

106
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.979
and brag about it to everybody in class!

107
00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:56.979
Yeah!

108
00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.779
Shall we start around here?

109
00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.579
Are the beetles here?

110
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:09.379
I'm not sure, but beetles and stag beetles

111
00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.979
like to hang around oak trees like these.

112
00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.179
It stinks of liquor.

113
00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:17.679
Did you put the banana we got and soaked it in this?

114
00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:20.179
Never mind that. Just spread the stocking, will you?

115
00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:21.779
Yes, sure.

116
00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.179
Since you told me to bring some old stockings,

117
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:27.079
I was wondering what you were going to use it for.

118
00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.779
I guess this was it.

119
00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:32.779
Dad asked me if I was going to play cops and robbers.

120
00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:35.979
Are you sure we can catch them with something like this?

121
00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:37.979
We'll find out at night.

122
00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:39.279
Okay, this should do it.

123
00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:40.979
How many more should we set up?

124
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.379
How I wish night time would come quickly.

125
00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:49.379
Huh?

126
00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.679
What's that tool for?

127
00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.579
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

128
00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:56.979
The car keys are still in the truck.

129
00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:59.679
Hey! What the heck are you looking at? -What?

130
00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.779
Well. You see...

131
00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:05.279
It's the guy who plays pachinko.

132
00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.679
Didn't I tell you I didn't play?

133
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:10.479
What are you guys doing in a place like this?

134
00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.179
We came to catch beetles.

135
00:08:13.179 --> 00:08:15.379
Don't you dare come near my truck.

136
00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:16.979
Scat!

137
00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:19.379
We were just looking around.

138
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:20.879
Get out of here right this minute!

139
00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.879
If you don't, I'm giving you guys a licking!

140
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:25.179
Let's go. -Okay, okay.

141
00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:29.179
He didn't have to get so angry.

142
00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:32.379
I wonder if there was something he didn't want us to see?

143
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.879
What did you just say?

144
00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:42.379
You're still making those weird inventions of yours.

145
00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:44.879
Calling them weird is unnecessary, I think.

146
00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.579
I think it's about time.

147
00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:51.979
I guess so.

148
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.379
I think you'll be okay,

149
00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:56.279
but be careful because there are snakes around here.

150
00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.579
What?

151
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.579
Letting the children go on their own worries me,

152
00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.779
so I guess I'll go with them after all.

153
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.079
Ryutaro, you go ahead and sleep without me.

154
00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:05.079
Okay.

155
00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.279
Wow!

156
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.079
It's beetles! The beetles are here!

157
00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:13.279
Awesome! Let me catch them!

158
00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.779
I did it!

159
00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:19.479
Okay. Let's go catch some more!

160
00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:21.279
There's a giant stag beetle here!

161
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:25.179
Look! A saw tooth stag beetle!

162
00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:29.379
Awesome! This is the first time I've seen something like this!

163
00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:30.879
Look at this one!

164
00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:33.079
This one is bigger.

165
00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:35.479
Let's make them compete as soon as we get home!

166
00:09:35.479 --> 00:09:37.679
Yes! -I can't wait!

167
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.679
I tell you.

168
00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:44.479
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

169
00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:46.879
He's doing sneaky things behind my back.

170
00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.779
I won't let him get away with this.

171
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:51.179
That's the man we saw this afternoon.

172
00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.079
Someone from a department store in Tokyo

173
00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:55.679
is going to come to purchase them.

174
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:58.479
I can't sell them if they become weak!

175
00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:01.279
He's the man we saw at the roadside resting place.

176
00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:04.379
He was saying something about Ryutaro.

177
00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:07.179
Big catch, big catch!

178
00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:09.279
That is what fishermen say.

179
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.979
It seems he's still awake.

180
00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:14.979
Strange. The paper sliding door is open.

181
00:10:19.579 --> 00:10:21.679
Sir, please get a hold of yourself!

182
00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.979
What happened?

183
00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.379
Ryutaro!

184
00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:26.279
Sir!

185
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.479
Sir, we'll call the ambulance right away.

186
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:35.779
Miyama... Stag Beetle...

187
00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:37.779
Did you say Miyama stag beetle?

188
00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:39.379
What do you mean?

189
00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:43.179
Ai, call an ambulance!

190
00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:44.379
Yes!

191
00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:49.279
Huh? -What's the matter?

192
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:51.579
The statue of Buddha that was here is gone.

193
00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.479
Just hurry and call the ambulance first.

194
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:56.179
Yes.

195
00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:57.579
We're out of the service area!

196
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.579
What's this?

197
00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:09.179
Anyway, I wonder

198
00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.779
what he meant by saying "Miyama stag beetle".

199
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.430
Mr. Namatame was taken to the hospital while unconscious.

200
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.530
And then, the police began their investigation.

201
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.930
"Detective Motohashi (45)" -Miyama stag beetle?

202
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.830
Did he really say that?

203
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.030
Yeah. -We heard him say so too.

204
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.130
Yeah...

205
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.930
"Detective Fuji (27)" -It's not something we'd expect one would say

206
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.530
just before passing out.

207
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.230
I wonder what it means.

208
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.330
Beats me.

209
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.730
There's one other thing that's bothering me.

210
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.530
What is it? -The statue of Buddha

211
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.430
that was there when we left has gone missing.

212
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.830
A statue of Buddha?

213
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.130
Come to think of it, there have been a series of statues

214
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.030
being stolen from temples in this prefecture.

215
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.630
The robber broke in to steal the statue

216
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.230
and ran into the victim,

217
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.930
then struck him with the vase that was there.

218
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.830
I guess that's what happened. -Yeah.

219
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.730
Excuse me.

220
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.830
This was found on Mr. Namatame's clothes.

221
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.530
It's some sort of hair.

222
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.430
Give it to forensics team. -Yes, sir.

223
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.330
I wonder why Ryutaro mentioned Miyama stag beetle.

224
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.530
There's no way that a Miyama stag beetle could be the culprit.

225
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.130
Hey. We saw that man on our way back, didn't we?

226
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.530
That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him.

227
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.830
He had a Miyama stag beetle at the roadside resting place!

228
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.930
Do you know his name?

229
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.830
Mr. Namatame called him Shuhei.

230
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.630
I think he's referring to

231
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.930
"Officer Iwanaga (55)" -Mr. Shuhei Ikeda who lives in this village.

232
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.730
Let go of me!

233
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.830
Just what the hell are you saying I did?

234
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.030
It seems that you had some issues with Mr. Namatame

235
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.930
regarding where the border of your land is.

236
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.130
Yeah, that place has been our land since the time of my ancestors.

237
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.330
He had the nerve to turn it into a field without permission.

238
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.830
But I didn't attack him!

239
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.830
Where were you at around 12 am last night?

240
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.030
12 am? -He was walking along the road.

241
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.430
He looked really angry and was saying,

242
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.130
"That Ryutaro. You can never be too careful with him."

243
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.630
Well, that's...

244
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.530
Is that true?

245
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.830
I went on my routine check around the area

246
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.130
and found that the water of the field was turned off.

247
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.930
I figured that only Ryutaro would do something like that

248
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.330
and thought I'd give him a piece of my mind the next time I see him!

249
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.430
I bet you gave him a piece of your mind last night, no?

250
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.630
No. I didn't do it.

251
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.430
Please believe me!

252
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.630
Sir, did you know that there was a statue of Buddha

253
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.830
in the alcove on the other side?

254
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.230
A statue of Buddha?

255
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.930
Yeah, there was a very dirty one there.

256
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.630
It seems that the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame took it.

257
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.330
You're not the one, are you?

258
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.830
You mean the statue of Buddha?

259
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.630
I see, so a robber came to steal the statue.

260
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.330
If so, I know who might have done it.

261
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.730
Really?

262
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.930
It's Kei.

263
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.830
He has things like a fret saw and a grinder loaded in his truck

264
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.230
and goes out night after night.

265
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.730
So, I was thinking that something was fishy!

266
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.430
It's true that he had them in his truck.

267
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.730
Yeah. He was really angry at us because we saw them.

268
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.430
True, he was really angry.

269
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.530
Come to think of it,

270
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.530
he was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of a Miyama stag beetle on it.

271
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.330
Who is it?

272
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.630
We're the police.

273
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.030
We have something we'd like to ask you.

274
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.230
Could we ask you to come with us?

275
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.830
What the heck is it?

276
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.630
Just what did I do?

277
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.830
Where were you at about 12 am last night?

278
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.330
12 am?

279
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.630
Where else would I be if not at home?

280
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.830
That's a lie!

281
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.330
After I went to check around the field, I passed in front of your house,

282
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.230
but the truck wasn't there!

283
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.830
You broke into the house to steal the statue of Buddha,

284
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.030
but Mr. Namatame found you, so you hit him on the head and fled.

285
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.430
Isn't that what happened?

286
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.430
Hold it there!

287
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.630
If I came to steal something from here, I wouldn't come by truck.

288
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.230
Don't you think so? It's walking distance.

289
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.430
Then, where were you at around 12 am last night?

290
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.130
Well...

291
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.330
Either way, I didn't attack Mr. Namatame!

292
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.730
It's true!

293
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.130
Did you find out what the hair was?

294
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.330
Oh, yeah. It was a dog's hair.

295
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.030
Dog's hair?

296
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.230
I wonder what someone would be doing in a place like this.

297
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.730
The car keys are still in the truck.

298
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.330
Hey! What are you looking at? -What?

299
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.430
Just as I thought.

300
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.630
Neither of the two attacked Mr. Namatame.

301
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.630
If they didn't, who on earth did?

302
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.830
Are you blind or what?

303
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.230
It's you, Ai.

304
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.530
What do you mean, "It's you, Ai"?

305
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.630
Just what do you propose to do now?

306
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.830
Those two aren't the culprit.

307
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.530
But they're both connected to the Miyama stag beetle, aren't they?

308
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.730
If it were one of them,

309
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.930
I'm sure Mr. Namatame would've said their names.

310
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.230
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

311
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.730
I don't know. However,

312
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.030
the culprit who attacked Mr. Namatame

313
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.130
took the statue of Buddha, that's for sure.

314
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.130
I wonder if that dirty looking statue

315
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.730
is really worth any value.

316
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.930
Beats me.

317
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.830
He did say that it was made in the Kamakura era though.

318
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.430
Mr. Namatame mentioned that it may have been made by Unkei.

319
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.830
Well, though it's true that Unkei

320
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.530
made some items in the Kamakura era,

321
00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.630
it could also have been made in the Heian era, right?

322
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.630
No, I'm sure I heard that it was from the Kamakura era.

323
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.530
I wonder where I heard that.

324
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.330
Well, there are also a lot of old junk.

325
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.130
The antique shop dealer that came the other day

326
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.630
said that the statue of Buddha that I put on the alcove

327
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.330
was something from the Kamakura era.

328
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.530
It was at that roadside resting place!

329
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.630
Ai, let's try going to the roadside resting place

330
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.930
that we passed by when coming here!

331
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.130
"Roadside Resting Place"

332
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.130
We came here yesterday, but do you remember us?

333
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.630
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

334
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.230
If you come up with anything...

335
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.130
Hi, madam. We came here yesterday. Do you remember us?

336
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.330
Yes, you're the ones who came along with Mr. Namatame, right?

337
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.130
I remember you.

338
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.030
Do you remember if there was anyone else back then?

339
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.130
Well, let me see.

340
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.130
Oh, my! How cute!

341
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.730
There was a young couple.

342
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.630
Do you remember anything about them?

343
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.630
Not really.

344
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.330
All they did was buying a potted plant, you see.

345
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.630
What kind of potted plant was it?

346
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.230
This one.

347
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.830
It has an interesting name, don't you think?

348
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.030
It's a bit different from what we like though.

349
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.730
This is...

350
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.930
Oh, my God.

351
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.830
So, that's the story.

352
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.430
Didn't that young couple bring a dog with them?

353
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.530
Oh, I'm surprised you know that.

354
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.230
That's right.

355
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.530
I wonder where Conan and the others went?

356
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.530
Doc went with them too.

357
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.130
I hope they're not having lunch without us.

358
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.030
At any rate, we'll hear out

359
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.130
the rest of your story at the station.

360
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.430
I'm telling you, I have nothing to do with this.

361
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.030
Same here. -Hold it there.

362
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.030
Suddenly, just like that again...

363
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.430
Those two aren't the culprit.

364
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.830
What?

365
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.630
Well, Kei is guilty of stealing a statue of Buddha, though.

366
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.930
Don't be ridiculous!

367
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.730
I looked beneath your truck.

368
00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.730
The statue was tied onto it.

369
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.430
You went to some temple last night to steal it, right?

370
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.930
How can you be so sure

371
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.730
that these two didn't attack Mr. Namatame?

372
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.530
The reason is simple.

373
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.830
If it were one of them, Ryutaro knows their name.

374
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.830
He would never have said, "Miyama stag beetle".

375
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.630
Maybe it was dark when he was suddenly attacked

376
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.430
that he couldn't see the culprit's face?

377
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:50.330
When we got back, the light of the Japanese room was on.

378
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.730
Ryutaro had gone to bed,

379
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.330
but noticed a sound and came to the Japanese room.

380
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.430
He was attacked after he switched on the light.

381
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.630
What if the culprit's face was hidden?

382
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.930
I'm sure that if it were one of the two,

383
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.330
Ryutaro would've been able to recognize them.

384
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.830
The fact is, on our way here yesterday,

385
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.830
we stopped by at a roadside resting place.

386
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.930
Ryutaro was bragging back then that stolen statue of Buddha

387
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.130
was something from the Kamakura era.

388
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:24.730
At the time, a couple who seemed like tourists were there.

389
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.730
That couple bought a potted plant at that roadside resting place.

390
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.330
This is the one.

391
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.730
-This is... -This is...

392
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.030
"Miyama Stag Beetle"

393
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.530
Right.

394
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.830
Miyama Stag Beetle was the name of this flower

395
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.630
and not the name of an insect.

396
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.630
Ryutaro saw the culprit, but he didn't know their name.

397
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.930
That's why he wanted to let us know that the culprit

398
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.530
was the one who bought the Miyama stag beetle potted plant.

399
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.830
Proof... Do you have proof?

400
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.130
According to the woman who sold them the plant,

401
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.330
the couple had a Maltese with them.

402
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.130
A Maltese?

403
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.130
Dog hair was also found on Ryutaro's clothes.

404
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.830
A DNA test should clarify everything.

405
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.730
I'm sure that the couple is the culprit.

406
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.930
You can take over from here, officers.

407
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.430
After that, the police checked on

408
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.930
all hotels and pensions in the area where pets are allowed,

409
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.930
and the identity of the couple was revealed.

410
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.030
The couple who was arrested in Tokyo

411
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.130
heard that the statue was one that was made in the Kamakura era,

412
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.930
and thought that it could be sold at a high price.

413
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.530
That's why they tailed our car

414
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.030
and went to rob it from Mr. Namatame's house.

415
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.830
However, when they took the statue to an antique shop,

416
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.530
they were told that it wasn't made by Unkei or anyone special,

417
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.030
and was worth only 5,000 yen at most.

418
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.630
Meanwhile, Mr. Namatame recovered

419
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.330
and was discharged a few days later.

420
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.830
How about it? Fantastic, huh?

421
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.730
We caught it ourselves!

422
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.530
A giant stag beetle.

423
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.430
You mean the name of this plant is Miyama Stag Beetle?

424
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.930
Right.

425
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.130
Are you really going to give it to class?

426
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.430
Yeah, mother told me to show it to everyone in class

427
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.730
because it's a really rare flower.

428
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.830
Then, let's decide on who the watering monitor will be!

429
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.430
Great! How should we decide?

430
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.930
Too bad you couldn't brag about your beetles.

431
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.130
Yeah, you worked hard for nothing.

432
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.630
Cool! How are you doing?

433
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.430
It's a map, right?

434
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.430
Is it a treasure map?

435
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.730
Maybe this map has nothing to do with a burglary,

436
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.230
but rather, has something to do with Mr. Kouzuki's case.

437
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.430
What do you think? The map, do we have a case?

438
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.930
No connection. I'd like to say that, but...

439
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:37.330
Next Conan, "Good Work, Cool 2"

440
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.430
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.330
"Cigarette butts"

442
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.330
Today is the Star Festival Day.

443
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.630
When stars and wind fall.

444
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.292
That's a godsend.
