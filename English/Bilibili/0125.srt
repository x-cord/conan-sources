1
00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:03.482
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.582
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:07.482
Today we'll find out who the real assassin is.

4
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.482
The killing and motive are full of mystery.

5
00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:11.182
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:13.182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:15.682
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.595
Pops who was invited to a celebration party for a champion sumo player

9
00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:01.095
were asked by Seiji Ishimoto to do an investigation for him.

10
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:07.295
Ishimoto had received a blackmail saying that he would be killed.

11
00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:09.095
The event hall becomes dark,

12
00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.895
and the politician Masao Takada passes behind Ishimoto

13
00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:15.995
in order to make his speech.

14
00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:20.595
The bullet that was fired from the lighting box

15
00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:22.295
skims pass Ishimoto's shoulder

16
00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:24.695
and pierces through Takada's chest.

17
00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:27.895
Within the commotion.

18
00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:31.395
I happened to see a suspicious man flee from the light fixture box.

19
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:33.895
The following day,

20
00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:40.195
that man, blackmailer Shiro Hiraoka was found dead.

21
00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:41.495
I see.

22
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.995
We were being deceived by the culprit.

23
00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:47.295
But I'll figure it out for sure

24
00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:49.495
and untangle the one string of truth

25
00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.895
among the complicated and tangled strings!

26
00:02:54.495 --> 00:03:00.495
"Mysterious Assassin (Part 2)"

27
00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:25.795
The top floor.

28
00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:27.895
It must be where the president's room is.

29
00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:36.395
It's Mr. Niikura, the secretary of Mr. Takada who was shot and killed.

30
00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.095
Shiro Hiraoka?

31
00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.095
I don't know such a man.

32
00:03:45.095 --> 00:03:47.895
You received a threat letter

33
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.695
and is actually the target of the killer.

34
00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:53.795
Furthermore, the bullet that skimmed by you

35
00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:57.295
hit Mr. Takada in the chest and killed him.

36
00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:01.095
This is a murder case.

37
00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:09.995
-Actually... -President.

38
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:12.395
It's okay, Ms. Yukiko.

39
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.395
We can't keep hiding the fact, can we?

40
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:19.195
Just as you say, I was being blackmailed by Hiraoka.

41
00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:24.095
You don't want this account to be publicized, do you?

42
00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.595
You'll be nabbed for evasion of taxes,

43
00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:29.095
and your company's reputation will go down the drain.

44
00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:33.395
So, you want me to give you 10 billion yen?

45
00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.495
I think that's cheap.

46
00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:38.495
You're making a lot of money, aren't you, Mr. Ishimoto?

47
00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:42.395
I thought of paying him.

48
00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:44.295
But I flatly refused.

49
00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.295
Once I give him the money,

50
00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.995
I am sure that he'd come back and threaten me for more later.

51
00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:53.795
That's why I thought of having you come in protect me, Mr. Mouri.

52
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:59.395
However, that ended up in getting Mr. Takada killed.

53
00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:03.495
That's what his secretary Mr. Niikura said to me.

54
00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:05.595
Mr. Niikura said that?

55
00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:09.295
He told me to not put Mr. Takada's life to waste.

56
00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:14.695
He told me in the other room to tell the police everything I knew.

57
00:05:14.695 --> 00:05:17.395
Huh? What is it, kid?

58
00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:18.695
Well...

59
00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:21.795
Conan! Why are you here?

60
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:24.995
Ran told me to bring you some change of clothes.

61
00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:28.695
Mr. Ishimoto, could I have you come to the station with me?

62
00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.095
Yes.

63
00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.795
Which means that I'm not needed here anymore?

64
00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:35.595
It was only for a short while,

65
00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:38.095
but thank you all the same.

66
00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:39.295
I thought so.

67
00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:47.995
How unlucky of me,

68
00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:50.995
for the murder to be solved so quickly.

69
00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:53.995
Talking about unlucky,

70
00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:57.295
the man called Hiraoka was sure unlucky, too.

71
00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:59.795
Because he was supposed to have shot Mr. Ishimoto

72
00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:01.795
and yet the bullet hit someone else.

73
00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:04.795
On top of that, he falls down from the stairs and dies.

74
00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:07.095
He's really unlucky, isn't he?

75
00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.095
lt really does seem to be unlucky.

76
00:06:09.095 --> 00:06:11.495
Or rather, everything fits too nicely together.

77
00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:14.395
Maybe Hiraoka had an accomplice,

78
00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:18.995
and that person killed Hiraoka who goofed to shut him up.

79
00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:22.995
Which means that Mr. Ishimoto may still be in danger of being killed!

80
00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.495
Ms. Yukiko!

81
00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:26.895
I'm not done with this job yet!

82
00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:29.095
Wait, Pops!

83
00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:30.795
Oh, well.

84
00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:32.395
I guess I'll take a look around the room while I can.

85
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:38.595
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

86
00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:42.995
Excuse me then, for I am in a rush.

87
00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.995
Somebody's coming.

88
00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:06.595
That man is...

89
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:12.495
He was talking to Ms. Yukiko after Mr. Takada was killed.

90
00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:30.295
That's...

91
00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:44.495
What is his relationship with Ms. Yukiko?

92
00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:45.995
And what is he going to do

93
00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:48.095
with the remote controller that he was holding?

94
00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:54.495
Maybe...

95
00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:04.895
If Hiraoka

96
00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:09.795
had realized that he was just hired to be framed as the killer...

97
00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:13.095
No, even if he didn't know about it,

98
00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:15.195
he's Hiraoka the blackmailer.

99
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:20.095
He could've hidden something that would serve as evidence.

100
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.595
There's a hole here.

101
00:08:51.795 --> 00:08:53.695
Ms. Yukiko...

102
00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:56.495
I'm back.

103
00:08:56.495 --> 00:08:59.195
Where were you all this time, Conan?

104
00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:00.695
Well...

105
00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:03.895
Pops, aren't you guarding Mr. Ishimoto anymore?

106
00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:06.895
I don't need to guard him while he's at the police station.

107
00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:11.095
I can't wait to guard Yukiko real closely.

108
00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:14.095
Hey, come on. Is that the only thing on your mind, Pops?

109
00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:16.895
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

110
00:09:16.895 --> 00:09:18.895
Inspector Megure.

111
00:09:18.895 --> 00:09:20.795
Inspector!

112
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.895
I have something I'd like to confirm with you.

113
00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:26.995
Here's some coffee.

114
00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:29.795
Thank you, Ran.

115
00:09:29.795 --> 00:09:31.995
Inspector Megure.

116
00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:34.695
What is it that you want to confirm with me?

117
00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:39.795
You took Mr. Ishimoto to the hospital last night

118
00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:40.795
but how long after that

119
00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:44.895
did his secretary, Ms. Yukiko Tanaka stay at the hospital?

120
00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:47.095
Ms. Yukiko?

121
00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:49.995
Let's see, if I'm not mistaken...

122
00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:53.895
After Mr. Ishimoto went back into his room,

123
00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:58.095
I was talking story with Yukiko over a glass of cola.

124
00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:01.795
That was just about when you called.

125
00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:05.695
I sort of dozed off after that.

126
00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:10.495
I got up the next morning when you called.

127
00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:14.795
At that time, Yukiko was nowhere in the room.

128
00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:19.795
Then, you don't know when Ms. Yukiko left the hospital?

129
00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:21.895
Inspector, don't tell me that...

130
00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:27.095
In other words, Ms. Yukiko had time to kill Hiraoka.

131
00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:28.495
That can't be!

132
00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:31.395
Why would such a beautiful woman like Ms. Yukiko kill Hiraoka?

133
00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:34.395
I'm just considering it as one possibility.

134
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:36.695
It's not yet definite whether Hiraoka's death

135
00:10:36.695 --> 00:10:38.795
is an accident or a homicide.

136
00:10:38.795 --> 00:10:40.295
Ridiculous!

137
00:10:40.295 --> 00:10:42.295
Why would Ms. Yukiko do something like that?

138
00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:46.795
The thing is she has a lover called Kenichi Shibata.

139
00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:48.795
Lover?

140
00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:51.595
What are you shouting for?

141
00:10:51.595 --> 00:10:54.395
No, it's nothing.

142
00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:57.395
That guy 's father committed suicide.

143
00:10:57.395 --> 00:10:59.095
Suicide?

144
00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:00.895
He committed suicide because the company that he was managing

145
00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:04.295
was forced into bankruptcy by Mr. Ishimoto.

146
00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:08.095
Mr. Shibata hated Mr. Ishimoto because of that.

147
00:11:08.095 --> 00:11:13.195
Being his lover, I'm sure that Ms. Yukiko felt the same about him.

148
00:11:13.195 --> 00:11:16.895
However, Ms. Yukiko would never do something like that.

149
00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:19.695
What kind of person is Mr. Shibata?

150
00:11:22.195 --> 00:11:23.495
It's him.

151
00:11:26.395 --> 00:11:27.895
Just as I thought.

152
00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:33.195
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

153
00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:36.395
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

154
00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.795
It was quite recent.

155
00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:40.195
That's right!

156
00:11:44.295 --> 00:11:47.495
I see. So, that's what it was.

157
00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:48.995
Inspector.

158
00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:50.795
Please gather all those involved in the incident

159
00:11:50.795 --> 00:11:54.195
in the event hall we used last night.

160
00:11:54.195 --> 00:11:56.595
Huh? Why?

161
00:11:56.595 --> 00:11:58.795
I, the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri

162
00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:02.295
will solve this incident for you!

163
00:12:15.884 --> 00:12:18.384
With the death of Mr. Takada and all,

164
00:12:18.384 --> 00:12:20.284
"Tsuneaki Niikura (32)" -I'm really busy.

165
00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:22.484
You've got to be kidding. Gathering all of is at a time like this.

166
00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:24.084
"Kenichi Shibata (29)" -Why do I who has nothing to do with this incident

167
00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:25.784
have to be called here?

168
00:12:25.784 --> 00:12:27.484
"Yukiko Tanaka (25)" -Kenichi, cool it.

169
00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:29.184
It's going to end soon.

170
00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:33.184
"Seiji Ishimoto (54)" -Wasn't the murder incident already solved?

171
00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:36.884
We'll clear that right away.

172
00:12:36.884 --> 00:12:39.884
Actually, it's not a very good idea to bring you here

173
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.984
because we are still interrogating you.

174
00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:44.284
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, everyone!

175
00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:46.084
Oh, Mr. Mouri!

176
00:12:49.084 --> 00:12:52.284
I had you all gather here today

177
00:12:52.284 --> 00:12:54.884
because I wanted to make clear who killed Mr. Takada

178
00:12:54.884 --> 00:12:57.684
at the place where he was murdered.

179
00:12:57.684 --> 00:13:00.584
Isn't the culprit is Hiraoka who died of an accident?

180
00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:01.884
No!

181
00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:03.884
Hiraoka was only being used by the real culprit

182
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:06.184
and was eventually killed.

183
00:13:06.184 --> 00:13:10.284
Hurry up and give us the name of that culprit then!

184
00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:13.284
I have a meeting to go to and it's already begun.

185
00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:15.284
I have a part-time job that I have to go to, too.

186
00:13:15.284 --> 00:13:17.284
Hurry up or I'm going to leave!

187
00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:20.784
Okay, let me tell you the whole truth.

188
00:13:20.784 --> 00:13:23.584
The real culprit is you!

189
00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:30.184
Because you wanted to kill Mr. Ishimoto

190
00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:32.984
who was the cause of your father committing suicide,

191
00:13:32.984 --> 00:13:35.784
you hired Hiraoka.

192
00:13:35.784 --> 00:13:39.184
However, Hiraoka goofed and didn't kill Mr. Ishimoto.

193
00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.284
Therefore, you decided to kill Hiraoka last night

194
00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:43.484
in order to shut him up.

195
00:13:43.484 --> 00:13:45.384
Wait a minute.

196
00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:48.184
It's obvious that I hate Ishimoto,

197
00:13:48.184 --> 00:13:50.584
and I was here at this hall last night, too.

198
00:13:50.584 --> 00:13:53.584
But I don't even know what this Hiraoka guy looks like.

199
00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:55.184
Besides, after I left here,

200
00:13:55.184 --> 00:13:59.084
I was busy at my part-time job that I couldn't go anywhere.

201
00:14:00.384 --> 00:14:02.584
Would you like to come with me and find out for yourself

202
00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:03.784
because I have to go to work now?

203
00:14:03.784 --> 00:14:07.084
I have a lot of people who can testify my alibi.

204
00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:09.184
No, well...

205
00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:10.784
Oh, no.

206
00:14:13.584 --> 00:14:15.884
So, here it comes after all.

207
00:14:18.184 --> 00:14:19.584
Mr. Mouri?

208
00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:21.384
What's the matter, Pops?

209
00:14:21.384 --> 00:14:24.284
Are you all right?

210
00:14:24.284 --> 00:14:27.584
I sat down because I figured it would take a while to explain.

211
00:14:27.584 --> 00:14:29.684
You go and stay put.

212
00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:30.884
Okay!

213
00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:35.584
Now, let's get down to business.

214
00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.984
Before I give you the culprit's name,

215
00:14:37.984 --> 00:14:42.784
let me explain how the murder was carried out last night.

216
00:14:42.784 --> 00:14:47.584
From the part where Mr. Takada starts walking towards the stage.

217
00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:48.884
Well, everyone.

218
00:14:48.884 --> 00:14:51.484
Will you please all move to where you were last night?

219
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:56.684
Inspector, please take Mr. Takada's position.

220
00:14:56.684 --> 00:14:57.784
What? Me?

221
00:14:57.784 --> 00:14:59.484
Right.

222
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:00.984
Oh, all right.

223
00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:06.184
Inspector, please the microphone that is on the table on your chest.

224
00:15:06.184 --> 00:15:07.284
Microphone?

225
00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:12.084
That's the same microphone that Mr. Takada was wearing last night.

226
00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:18.984
Mr. Detective, what do you want me to do?

227
00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:21.584
Please go over to the wall.

228
00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:22.684
Okay.

229
00:15:22.684 --> 00:15:24.984
Okay, so let's begin.

230
00:15:24.984 --> 00:15:28.484
Please switch off the lights and turn on the spotlight!

231
00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:33.684
Mr. Niikura.

232
00:15:33.684 --> 00:15:35.384
Please walk as you did last night

233
00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:37.984
when you lead the way for Mr. Takada.

234
00:15:41.084 --> 00:15:43.184
Officer Takagi.

235
00:15:43.184 --> 00:15:44.584
What is it, Conan?

236
00:15:44.584 --> 00:15:48.384
Pops asks you to go over to the light box.

237
00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:56.984
You have that remote controller on you, don't you?

238
00:15:57.884 --> 00:16:01.084
Pops sees through everything, you know.

239
00:16:01.084 --> 00:16:04.784
Will you turn the remote controller on when I give you a signal?

240
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:10.784
Now!

241
00:16:14.684 --> 00:16:16.884
That was an empty cartridge,

242
00:16:16.884 --> 00:16:19.584
but it skimmed by Mr. Ishimoto's shoulder

243
00:16:19.584 --> 00:16:22.984
and went right through the Inspector's chest.

244
00:16:22.984 --> 00:16:24.484
What do you mean?

245
00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:26.884
Please turn on the light!

246
00:16:29.584 --> 00:16:30.784
What...

247
00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:33.384
Officer Takagi, did you just fire the gun?

248
00:16:34.384 --> 00:16:35.884
No, I didn't do anything.

249
00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:38.684
Huh? This is...

250
00:16:38.684 --> 00:16:41.084
There is a gun stuck to the pin spotlight!

251
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.284
What?

252
00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:45.384
Moreover, a motor is set onto the gun and a fishing string

253
00:16:45.384 --> 00:16:48.184
is attached to the trigger,

254
00:16:48.184 --> 00:16:50.584
When the motor spins and winds the string,

255
00:16:50.584 --> 00:16:52.784
the trigger is set to go off.

256
00:16:52.784 --> 00:16:54.984
Mr. Mouri, what is the meaning of this?

257
00:16:54.984 --> 00:16:58.584
It means that Hiraoka did not fire the gun,

258
00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:01.884
but the gun was set up and attached to the pin spotlight to begin with.

259
00:17:02.984 --> 00:17:07.684
The lightings in this hall are the newest ones around.

260
00:17:07.684 --> 00:17:09.484
That pin spotlight

261
00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:11.784
responds to the microphone that the Inspector is wearing on his chest,

262
00:17:11.784 --> 00:17:14.684
and moves automatically.

263
00:17:14.684 --> 00:17:15.884
What?

264
00:17:20.184 --> 00:17:21.684
Oh, I see.

265
00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:22.984
Moreover,

266
00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:26.384
if it is set up so that it can be operated using a remote controller,

267
00:17:26.384 --> 00:17:30.584
the culprit can fire the gun anytime at will

268
00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:33.384
and aim it at Mr. Takada's chest and kill him.

269
00:17:36.384 --> 00:17:38.884
What do you think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

270
00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:41.184
Mr. Ishimoto was the target, wasn't he?

271
00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:43.284
He was even blackmailed.

272
00:17:43.284 --> 00:17:46.684
That was only a scheme to deceive police.

273
00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:50.584
The culprit was after Mr. Takada's life to begin with.

274
00:17:50.584 --> 00:17:54.684
The culprit sent a threat letter to Mr. Ishimoto first

275
00:17:54.684 --> 00:17:59.684
to make it look like someone really after his life.

276
00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:03.384
Then, the culprit used the function of the spotlight

277
00:18:03.384 --> 00:18:05.984
responding to the movement of the microphone on Mr. Takada's chest,

278
00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:09.984
and the moment Mr. Takada passed by Mr. Ishimoto...

279
00:18:17.684 --> 00:18:21.284
This way, the culprit made it look like the bullet

280
00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:23.584
that was aimed at Mr. Ishimoto missed him

281
00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:26.584
and in turn killed Mr. Takada.

282
00:18:26.584 --> 00:18:31.784
After that, Hiraoka removed the gun and motor and fled.

283
00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:37.684
Then, who killed Mr. Takada?

284
00:18:37.684 --> 00:18:38.884
It's Ishimoto!

285
00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.484
Huh?

286
00:18:40.484 --> 00:18:44.284
Ishimoto over there killed Mr. Takada.

287
00:18:44.284 --> 00:18:47.784
Don't be ridiculous. That's all baloney!

288
00:18:47.784 --> 00:18:49.384
No use playing dumb with me.

289
00:18:49.384 --> 00:18:51.884
I've already got proof.

290
00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:54.484
Huh? And just what is that?

291
00:18:54.484 --> 00:18:57.884
I found the remote controller

292
00:18:57.884 --> 00:19:00.184
that was used to operate the motor of the gun at your company.

293
00:19:00.184 --> 00:19:01.184
-What? -Huh?

294
00:19:01.184 --> 00:19:03.884
Is that true?

295
00:19:03.884 --> 00:19:06.084
You really thought it out well, Ishimoto!

296
00:19:06.084 --> 00:19:09.184
You pretended to be blackmailed by Hiraoka,

297
00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:11.584
but behind the scene, you were in this together.

298
00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:15.684
And just when Mr. Takada passed behind you

299
00:19:15.684 --> 00:19:18.684
you operated the remote controller and killed him.

300
00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:20.884
Isn't that right, Mr. Detective?

301
00:19:20.884 --> 00:19:22.284
Mr. Shibata.

302
00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:25.384
Your deduction has one serious mistake.

303
00:19:25.384 --> 00:19:26.584
What?

304
00:19:26.584 --> 00:19:28.184
Think about it.

305
00:19:28.184 --> 00:19:31.484
Mr. Takada walked behind Mr. Ishimoto

306
00:19:31.484 --> 00:19:34.884
only because he was being led that way by Mr. Niikura.

307
00:19:34.884 --> 00:19:39.284
There was no way that Mr. Ishimoto could've foreseen that.

308
00:19:39.284 --> 00:19:43.584
Then, why was the remote controller found in Mr. Ishimoto's room?

309
00:19:43.584 --> 00:19:47.084
You heard was he just said, didn't you, everyone?

310
00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:48.484
Huh?

311
00:19:49.684 --> 00:19:52.284
Yes, I heard him all right.

312
00:19:53.184 --> 00:19:54.784
I said that I found the remote controller

313
00:19:54.784 --> 00:19:57.284
that was used at Ishimoto's company.

314
00:19:57.284 --> 00:20:00.784
I said nothing of finding it in his room.

315
00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:05.084
You've turned yourself in, Mr. Niikura.

316
00:20:05.084 --> 00:20:07.784
You're the culprit!

317
00:20:10.184 --> 00:20:12.084
You've been thought

318
00:20:12.084 --> 00:20:15.184
to become Mr. Takada's successor for quite some time.

319
00:20:15.184 --> 00:20:19.684
But he had no intention of resigning.

320
00:20:19.684 --> 00:20:21.284
Therefore, you became impatient

321
00:20:21.284 --> 00:20:23.484
and set Hiraoka up as your accomplice

322
00:20:23.484 --> 00:20:26.584
and killed Mr. Takada.

323
00:20:26.584 --> 00:20:30.384
Moreover, in order to shut Hiraoka up,

324
00:20:30.384 --> 00:20:32.584
you pushed him off the stairs of the dilapidated building

325
00:20:32.584 --> 00:20:34.784
and killed him.

326
00:20:34.784 --> 00:20:36.384
After that,

327
00:20:36.384 --> 00:20:39.084
you couldn't find the motor that Hiraoka had hidden

328
00:20:39.084 --> 00:20:42.284
between the space in the floor.

329
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:45.984
So, you thought up a scheme.

330
00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:52.084
In order to deceive the police just in case the motor were to be found,

331
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:57.084
you decided to hide the remote controller in Mr. Ishimoto's room.

332
00:20:58.284 --> 00:20:59.884
Don't be ridiculous.

333
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.984
Do you have proof that the remote controller is mine?

334
00:21:03.984 --> 00:21:06.584
You're very cautious,

335
00:21:06.584 --> 00:21:11.284
so I'm sure that you left no fingerprints behind.

336
00:21:12.784 --> 00:21:14.684
But don't you remember?

337
00:21:14.684 --> 00:21:15.884
You dropped the remote controller that night

338
00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:19.884
when you exchanged name cards, didn't you?

339
00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:21.984
At that time, you picked the battery up with your bare hands

340
00:21:21.984 --> 00:21:25.684
and put it back into the remote controller right away.

341
00:21:27.384 --> 00:21:30.384
So, you do remember.

342
00:21:30.384 --> 00:21:31.484
Yes.

343
00:21:31.484 --> 00:21:35.284
Your fingerprints are on that battery!

344
00:21:38.284 --> 00:21:39.984
Oh, no.

345
00:21:39.984 --> 00:21:41.684
This can't be!

346
00:21:45.984 --> 00:21:47.984
No way!

347
00:23:19.184 --> 00:23:21.584
"Mouri Detective Agency"

348
00:23:25.584 --> 00:23:27.484
He's been that way

349
00:23:27.484 --> 00:23:29.384
ever since he's read the letter he received from Ms. Yukiko.

350
00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:32.784
Ms. Yukiko says she's going to try it all over with Mr. Shibata again.

351
00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:35.984
I'd like Mom and Dad to try it over again.

352
00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:40.184
What a fleeting love affair it was!

353
00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:43.884
Excuse me. I'd like you to find someone for me.

354
00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:49.384
Please leave it to me!

355
00:23:49.384 --> 00:23:50.384
Nothing is impossible

356
