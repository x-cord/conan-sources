1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,240
Although we were planning to play tennis in Karuizawa,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,540
it was cancelled since it began raining,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,340
and we decided to go bowling.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,140
So? Who is it that you want me to meet?

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,940
It's someone who's been waiting for 4 hours

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,740
at the tennis court in the pouring rain.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,540
I think he'll be showing up soon

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,240
after he changes into dry clothes.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,940
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,940
I came all the way here in this rain on my motorbike, you know?

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,840
Who are you?

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,740
Jeet Kune Do?

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,240
He dodged me?

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,240
Very interesting.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,740
I'll beat you to a pulp!

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,140
No, Masumi!

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,340
He's the one!

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,540
The one whom Sonoko wanted you to meet!

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,840
Although Masumi and Kyogoku

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,740
were about to have it out because of Sonoko,

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,740
we had a good time bowling with Jr. High School teachers

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,040
whom we became acquainted with.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,540
However, the PE teacher

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
who was supposed to be sleeping in the car disappeared,

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,240
so we all ended up going to look for him.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,440
What... What's the matter?

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
The... The toilet door was unlocked.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,040
So I opened it, and inside it...

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,040
The glaringly dazzling sun, take the heat.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,840
A stylish and fashionable deduction show.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,740
Masumi is suspiciously reading a mail?

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,740
Clear Makoto Kyogoku of the charges against him!

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,340
His name is Detective Conan!

36
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:38,936
"Makoto Kyogoku, A Suspect? (Part 2)"

37
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,036
"Saturday Bowl"

38
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:45,336
What? He was undoubtedly drowned to death?

39
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,336
-Really? -Yes, sir.

40
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,036
We got a report from the medical examiner

41
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,336
saying that water was found in the airway of the corpse.

42
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:56,436
But it doesn't matter if you made him pass out using a stun gun.

43
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:00,936
To drown such a strong man to death without even tying him up,

44
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,336
it'd require two to three guys to team up and kill him, right?

45
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:04,636
That's true.

46
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,236
Well, if it was the Iron Karate Man,

47
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:09,836
I think one person would have been enough.

48
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,836
What's with you? You mean you're still suspecting Makoto?

49
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,236
Not really.

50
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:16,936
Besides that, we received a report

51
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,736
that there was a strap-shaped surface imprint

52
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:19,936
on the lower abdominal part of the corpse.

53
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:22,136
-The lower abdominal part? -Yes.

54
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,436
The surface imprint wasn't found all around the hips,

55
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:27,636
so the culprit probably used the belt of the corpse

56
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,536
and carried it along.

57
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,236
I see.

58
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:35,336
That means the culprit has great muscular strength.

59
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:39,636
Like that of an Iron Karate Man.

60
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,136
I... I was just stating an instance.

61
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,236
It was an example.

62
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:48,036
Come to think of it, you said that the victim

63
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,136
was going through all kinds of things.

64
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:52,836
What happened?

65
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,236
"Sunami Masaki (29)" -Mr. Tanba was going to

66
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:57,936
"Jr. High Science Teacher" -get married to my younger sister,

67
00:04:57,936 --> 00:05:00,536
"Michiko Monna (30)" -but his parents were against the marriage.

68
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:03,436
It seems that his parents had arranged a fiance

69
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,736
for him to get married to.

70
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:08,236
The two of them were shocked when they learned about it,

71
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:11,736
and they seemed to have considered eloping at one point.

72
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:15,036
Eventually, only my younger sister jumped into the water

73
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,036
and committed suicide.

74
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,936
Did you also know that she wanted to elope?

75
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:24,236
Yes, I received a mail from her.

76
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,236
It said, "We're going to journey off, just the two of us".

77
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:30,236
I received the same text mail from her as well,

78
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,736
since we were classmates and best friends.

79
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,236
It began since then, didn't it?

80
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:39,336
Mr. Tanba started getting violent each time he was drunk.

81
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:43,336
Yes. That's why I thought that he woke up

82
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,736
while we were bowling,

83
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,536
and got into a fight, and then...

84
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:51,836
Did you all come to this bowling alley a lot?

85
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:56,336
Yes. My late best friend loved bowling.

86
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:57,936
Come to think of it, the last time we came,

87
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,936
it was raining, too.

88
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,736
Inspector Yamamura!

89
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:05,036
A wet towel and four strange empty cans

90
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:09,036
were found in the trash can of the toilet.

91
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,136
-Empty cans? -Yes, sir.

92
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:14,236
The mouth of all four cans have burn marks on them.

93
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:17,036
Maybe somebody used them as ashtrays?

94
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:21,136
No, but it smelled like kerosene inside the cans.

95
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,036
Kerosene?

96
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,736
Wait! Conan?

97
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,236
"Parking lot"

98
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:34,836
Forensic officers!

99
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,736
Could you check out

100
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,136
-the shelf up there... -No! No!

101
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:41,936
Children should stay away.

102
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:46,436
But Pops Kogoro said that there may be something

103
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:49,436
behind those spare toilet paper rolls!

104
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,536
What an obstinate boy.

105
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,736
If the Sleeping Kogoro's asking us to do so...

106
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:58,836
There's a burn mark on the ceiling?

107
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,836
Hey! Pictures, take pictures!

108
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,036
Okay!

109
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,736
It's just as I thought.

110
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,136
This explains why the area

111
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,136
below the toilet wall was strangely wet.

112
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,836
There's no mistake about it.

113
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:14,636
That person is the culprit.

114
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:19,136
It looks like he has arrived at the truth, too.

115
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,636
I've got to confirm whether my deduction is the same as his.

116
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:26,136
Recently, I've lost a bit of my confidence.

117
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,336
I've got a reply really quickly.

118
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,036
He said, "Who is he"?

119
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:38,436
I knew that was how he'd reply me.

120
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,936
"Mail received"

121
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,436
"This is him. Surprised? Masumi."

122
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,336
Here it comes.

123
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:02,236
"If it's him, there will be no problem"?

124
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,136
A fight! He got into a fight!

125
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,736
The victim who was drunk and asleep in the car,

126
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,836
got up and got into a fight with someone

127
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,836
at a pub he went to have another drink at.

128
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:18,336
Then, he was taken somewhere and was killed.

129
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,836
But you mentioned that

130
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:23,336
while you and everyone else went out searching for the victim,

131
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,636
nobody mentioned seeing the victim, right?

132
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:30,536
They were all just playing dumb!

133
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:33,636
If word spreads around that customers got into a fight at their shop,

134
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,336
the reputation of that shop would go down.

135
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:40,736
But I wonder why the culprit carried a stun gun around?

136
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,636
Besides, we don't even know

137
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,136
where and how he was drowned to death.

138
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:46,536
Moreover, it's totally incomprehensible

139
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:49,036
why the victim was taken from the car he was asleep in

140
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:53,936
over to the make-shift toilet at the same parking lot.

141
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,536
How would I know?

142
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,736
At any rate, the victim, Mr. Tanba,

143
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:03,936
was brought to the car at the parking lot by Ms. Masaki

144
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:07,036
to sleep it off.

145
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,936
About an hour later,

146
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:12,836
Ms. Monna went to check on the situation in the car at the parking lot.

147
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,336
But by that time, he had left the car.

148
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,336
After hearing that Mr. Tanba was gone,

149
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:21,436
we went looking for him around the pubs.

150
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,836
Meanwhile, he got into a fight with somebody

151
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,836
and was drowned to death.

152
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,236
There's no mistake that when we returned to the parking lot,

153
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,536
he was already moved into the toilet there.

154
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:36,036
Well, it's not that this Iron Karate Man

155
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:39,036
who was asleep in a car in the same parking lot

156
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,836
is not suspicious either.

157
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:46,236
But taking into consideration that the culprit used a stun gun,

158
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,636
chances are that he's innocent.

159
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,736
That's why I told you a while ago

160
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:53,036
to carefully check out the pubs in this area!

161
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,936
I think you're right.

162
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,436
Inspector Yamamura!

163
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,836
The preparations for the experiment are ready!

164
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,636
Experiment?

165
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,736
Yes, sir. Detective Mouri indicated

166
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,236
that it was necessary to do so in order to solve the case,

167
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,236
and forensics said that you gave permission

168
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:09,836
to carry out the experiment.

169
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:11,636
What are you saying?

170
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,636
I don't remember saying anything like that!

171
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:17,236
But according to the forensic officers,

172
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,136
that boy over there...

173
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:20,936
At... At any rate, let's go and see it!

174
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,836
I love experiments!

175
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:24,736
You're still a first grade brat in elementary school,

176
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,336
but you've already done experiments?

177
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,836
But he might have been doing some at Doc's house.

178
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:33,136
Well, let us go and hear what they have to say.

179
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:34,536
I guess so.

180
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:42,336
"If it's him, there will be no problem."

181
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,836
Why?

182
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:46,836
How would he know that?

183
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,536
How did brother know about him?

184
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:02,886
Hey, hey! What is this?

185
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:06,086
The area around the toilet is soaked in water.

186
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,786
But you were the one who instructed us

187
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,486
to do so, didn't you, Detective Mouri?

188
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,386
You told us to place a towel over the drain

189
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:16,886
to stop the rain water and let it accumulate!

190
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,186
I see.

191
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:21,586
They said that this area is tilted because of ground sinkage.

192
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:26,086
Water accumulated because of the rain that was pouring until a while ago.

193
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:30,086
But the important details of the crime scene will go down the drain.

194
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,786
If it's the toilet that the corpse was found in,

195
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,486
it's been moved to another place

196
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,786
-and is under investigation now. -What?

197
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:38,286
This is another make-shift toilet.

198
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:39,886
As for this, I was also informed

199
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:43,186
that Detective Mouri had instructed us to do so.

200
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:46,686
Like I said, I never...

201
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,486
Dad! There's a water puddle over there!

202
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:58,486
Like I was saying, I never care

203
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,486
whether my slacks are wet or not

204
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:04,786
if I can show you how this trick works.

205
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:06,886
Trick?

206
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:09,886
Don't tell me that he was drowned with the rain water

207
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,986
that was accumulated?

208
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,886
But for this much rain water to accumulate,

209
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,586
it would take quite a lot of time.

210
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,486
Even if a stun gun was used to knock him out,

211
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:23,786
to make a grown man drown forcibly in a place like this

212
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,886
without even tying him up...

213
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:27,886
The culprit has to be

214
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:31,686
someone with great muscular strength after all, right?

215
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,786
I'm telling you that Makoto isn't the culprit!

216
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,986
Right, Makoto?

217
00:12:36,986 --> 00:12:38,786
Makoto!

218
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,786
-He fled! -Let him be!

219
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:43,986
He probably went to use the toilet or something.

220
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,686
Besides, he has nothing to do with this case.

221
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:48,986
-But... -Why?

222
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:51,886
Because muscular strength isn't necessary to carry out this trick.

223
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:54,586
The culprit locked the victim in the toilet,

224
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:58,986
and drowned him without even laying a hand on him.

225
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,286
Just like magic.

226
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,486
Magic...

227
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,986
Seeing is believing.

228
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:11,186
Let's actually try it out

229
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:15,486
and test whether a person can actually drown in the toilet.

230
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:17,386
And of course, Inspector Yamamura,

231
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,286
you're the one to be experimented on.

232
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:22,286
What? Me?

233
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:23,686
You'll be fine

234
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:27,386
since some oxygen has been prepared for you.

235
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:30,286
Isn't this a can of oxygen?

236
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,786
Hey, tomboy.

237
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,286
You help set up the trick.

238
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:38,186
You know how to work this trick too, don't you?

239
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,386
Yeah, sort of.

240
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,386
First, put the victim into the toilet.

241
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,486
Seal the ventilation hole on the back of the toilet

242
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,986
with masking tape.

243
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,086
Next, fill four empty cans with kerosene

244
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,586
and cover the mouth of the cans with cloth.

245
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,786
Set fire to the cloth,

246
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:59,886
then line them up on the shelf inside the toilet.

247
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:01,386
Finally, all you have to do

248
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:05,786
is close the door and seal it tight with masking tape.

249
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:08,486
So, how did he drown?

250
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:10,986
Well, just watch.

251
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:24,886
Geez.

252
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:28,486
The water only rose up to my ankles.

253
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:32,186
How the heck can someone drown in a place like this?

254
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:36,486
But it sure is getting hot in here.

255
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:37,986
The fire went out.

256
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:45,386
What? What's happening inside?

257
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:55,586
Watch closely now.

258
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,286
Are you all right?

259
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:09,086
Mr. Mouri, just what do you think you're making me do?

260
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:12,586
I was about to drown to death, you know?

261
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:16,186
But why was there so much water inside the toilet?

262
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,486
It's because the air pressure inside the toilet dropped.

263
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,886
Don't you remember doing it in science class?

264
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,386
You pour water into a deep dish

265
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:27,286
with a burning candle inside it,

266
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:28,986
and place a beaker over it.

267
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:30,886
Then the flame of the candle goes out.

268
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:35,786
And before you know it, water is sucked up into the beaker.

269
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:37,786
It works in the same way.

270
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:40,186
The cans were left burning on the shelf

271
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,886
of the toilet that was sealed.

272
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:44,586
The air becomes warm and expands,

273
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,886
thus decreasing the density of oxygen.

274
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:49,686
The flame will then go out, and the air is cooled and decreased.

275
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,786
Because of the decrease in air,

276
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:56,286
rain water is sucked up through the ventilation hole under the door.

277
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:59,686
This explanation is correct, isn't it?

278
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:04,786
Our science teacher, Ms. Sunami Masaki.

279
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:07,486
While you were bringing Mr. Tanba

280
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:09,486
to the car at the parking lot,

281
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:12,286
you first made him go inside the make-shift toilet.

282
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:15,386
You probably said something like you forgot the key to the car,

283
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:17,686
so you told him to wait in the toilet

284
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,986
and take shelter from the rain.

285
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,486
After you got him inside,

286
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:24,086
you immediately knocked him out using a stun gun,

287
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,186
pulled a string through the back of his belt,

288
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,586
and tied it onto the joint of the lid of the toilet seat

289
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,486
so that Mr. Tanba couldn't stand up.

290
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,486
You put the four cans with kerosene inside

291
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:35,386
on the shelf of the toilet,

292
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:37,586
locked the door with a padlock,

293
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,786
and posted an "Out of Order" sign.

294
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,486
After that, you sealed the ventilation hole behind the toilet

295
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:44,186
with masking tape,

296
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,986
and place a towel onto the drain of the parking lot

297
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:50,786
to accumulate rain water. Now, all is set.

298
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,386
You lied to Ms. Monna,

299
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,486
telling her that he fell asleep in the car

300
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,586
and waited for the rain water to accumulate.

301
00:16:57,586 --> 00:17:00,686
After a while, Ms. Monna who is a worrier,

302
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,886
went to check on Mr. Tanba like you had calculated.

303
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:08,186
Well, if she didn't voluntarily do so,

304
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:13,286
you were probably planning to go with her to check up on him anyway.

305
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:14,686
Just as you expected,

306
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:18,386
she came back to tell you that Mr. Tanba wasn't in the car.

307
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,286
You, who ended up having to search the parking lot

308
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:24,986
confirmed that enough rain water had accumulated,

309
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,986
tore off the sign on the toilet door,

310
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:28,986
unlocked the padlock,

311
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:31,386
lit the cans that were on the shelf,

312
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,386
and sealed the door using masking tape.

313
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,086
Later, just as in the experiment,

314
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,386
rain water was sucked into the toilet.

315
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:40,986
And just about when Mr. Tanba drowned,

316
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:44,686
you and Ms. Monna were searching around the pubs.

317
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,386
Having established your alibi in this way,

318
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,586
your goal was achieved.

319
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:52,286
After that, you returned once again to the parking lot,

320
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:54,286
removed the towel from the drain,

321
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,386
drained off the accumulated rain water,

322
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:58,686
and tore off all the masking tape.

323
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,286
You threw the burned cans on the shelf into the trash can,

324
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:03,686
and cut the string on the belt.

325
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:06,886
In order to hide the fact that water had accumulated in the toilet,

326
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,986
you inserted the toilet paper

327
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,686
that was on the shelf onto the toilet paper holder.

328
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:14,586
Then, you screamed and acted like

329
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:16,986
you had just found the corpse.

330
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,786
The key to this crime

331
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,486
is how quickly the corpse was found.

332
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:22,986
If discovery was delayed,

333
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:26,086
and the longer the time span of estimated time of death was prolonged,

334
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,786
your alibi would go down the drain.

335
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,686
That's why the only possible culprit is you,

336
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:34,186
the first person who discovered the corpse.

337
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,786
You were also the only one who had time

338
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:39,686
to accumulate the rain water.

339
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,186
Well, I guess

340
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,386
forensics would have found the masking tape with your fingerprints

341
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,986
from the toilet tank by now.

342
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,986
If it wasn't in the trash can,

343
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,886
you must've flushed in down the toilet.

344
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:54,386
And masking tape is hard to peel off unless you use your bare hands.

345
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,686
That's correct, isn't it?

346
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:59,086
Sleeping Kogoro?

347
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:00,386
Yeah.

348
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,786
This must be some kind of a mistake!

349
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:07,986
Because... Because Sunami had no reason to kill Mr. Tanba.

350
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,886
I did.

351
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,986
That man left my best friend to die

352
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:18,286
and didn't do anything about it.

353
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:21,186
That was my motive.

354
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:23,186
Best... Best friend?

355
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:25,286
Do you mean my younger sister?

356
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:29,086
Yes, the person who was engaged to marry that man,

357
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,886
your younger sister.

358
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:36,486
But my sister jumped off a cliff by the ocean.

359
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,186
She even left a suicide note, too.

360
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:41,586
You received a text mail from her before that.

361
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:44,786
It said, "We're going to journey off, just the two of us".

362
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:45,786
Yes.

363
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,686
That wasn't a mail saying she was going to elope,

364
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,886
but a mail telling you that she was going to die

365
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:54,386
and crossover along with him!

366
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:55,586
And yet...

367
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:59,086
And yet, that man suddenly got scared of dying

368
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,786
and left the cliff without even going in

369
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:03,186
to save her from drowning.

370
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,586
Is that true?

371
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,186
Yes.

372
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:11,886
Tanba blabbered on and on about it to me when he was drunk.

373
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:16,886
He cried, saying that he was a hopeless coward.

374
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,886
Well. Although he was that kind of a guy,

375
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:25,686
my best friend loved him enough to die for him.

376
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:30,086
So I led him

377
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:33,786
to the water where she's waiting for him.

378
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:57,986
What? You went to look for the culprit?

379
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,186
-Yes. -But...

380
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,086
you didn't know who the culprit was, did you?

381
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,986
And how did you...

382
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:09,486
No. Since the culprit seemed to be pretty strong,

383
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:13,986
I thought that I could tell from the murderous air that he gives off.

384
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:17,386
And I'll bet you thought that if you had the chance,

385
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:20,886
you wanted to compete with him?

386
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:25,686
Well, sort of...

387
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:27,886
He was going to fight it out.

388
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:33,186
Well, just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro!

389
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:37,586
You solved the case so perfectly!

390
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,486
Well...

391
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:41,586
Just as expected of the real me.

392
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,786
But regarding that experiment...

393
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:45,286
-That klutz is back... -if you had told me about it beforehand,

394
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,986
-I could've acted a lot more awesome. -to his usual way of talking.

395
00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:50,886
But I guess she was the one

396
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:53,786
who got the frosting and the cake.

397
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:55,686
Come to think of it, dad.

398
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:59,186
Hurry up and change your slacks or you'll catch a cold.

399
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:04,186
You sat on a water puddle when making your deduction.

400
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:08,686
What... What's this? I'm drenched!

401
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,086
But Pops, you said,

402
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:13,886
"I never care whether my slacks are wet or not".

403
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:16,586
I said something like that?

404
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:17,986
You did, you did!

405
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,286
You were super awesome!

406
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:23,186
Super awesome?

407
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:26,286
A mail? It's from brother.

408
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:31,986
I see. So that's the story.

409
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,986
A postscript?

410
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:40,886
"P.S. Have you already met the wizard?"

411
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:48,886
Well, I guess so.

412
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:52,886
I heard about it, you know!

413
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:55,686
Thief Kid is coming again, isn't he?

414
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,586
Thief Kid?

415
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:03,886
Mr. Kyogoku and Thief Kid are going to confront each other?

416
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:07,386
Well, you'll see once we get there!

417
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:09,786
"Okay, let's have it out fair and square. Thief Kid"

418
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:12,986
Yes! I will protect it over my dead body

419
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:15,486
with these fists of mine!
