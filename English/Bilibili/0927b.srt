1
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:04,589
Did you get any sleep after that?

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,889
None, but I'm hungry.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:09,789
Where are we going today?

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,589
We're visiting power spots.

5
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,989
A tengu?

6
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,589
A tengu appeared in Agata's room?

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:20,989
Yeah, like some kind of special effects movie.

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,089
So, what did the tengu do after that?

9
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,589
When Agata threw his ashtray at it,

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,489
it went up in flames and vanished.

11
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,389
It went up in flames and vanished?

12
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:33,789
That really does sound like a special effect.

13
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,789
According to him, after Nishiki was killed,

14
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,089
he returned to his room to rest.

15
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,689
Unable to fall asleep,

16
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,489
he decided to get a drink at the bar,

17
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,589
but he had too much to drink and got drunk.

18
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,889
When he came to, he was back in his room.

19
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:04,289
When he lit a cigarette to have a smoke...

20
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,789
he sensed something strange and looked up at the ceiling.

21
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:21,289
Keiko heard him from the neighboring room.

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:26,589
We arrived after she contacted us and saw the tengu, too.

23
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,989
If he returned to his room at some point,

24
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,289
it's possible someone took the drunk Agata to his room

25
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:36,589
and set something up.

26
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:39,789
But we didn't find any signs of a trick.

27
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,189
Then what about the cipher?

28
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,389
There was a new cipher, right?

29
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,689
There wasn't one of those either.

30
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,789
But...

31
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,389
like the murdered Nishiki,

32
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:55,989
Agata had two bumps on his head.

33
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,789
Speaking of bumps,

34
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,389
Keiko Kurachi said she got bumps on her head during filming.

35
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,689
Yeah.

36
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,289
She asked the director to re-shoot the final scene

37
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,089
and got the bumps then when she tripped.

38
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:13,589
When I saw her earlier,

39
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:16,189
her forehead was still a little swollen,

40
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,989
so it's probably true that she tripped.

41
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,789
She said looking back, it's possible someone pushed her.

42
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,589
When she tripped, she laughed about

43
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,189
how she looked like the Kobutori Jisan from the folktale.

44
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,689
What? I thought the Kobutori Jisan's bumps were on his cheeks.

45
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,389
Each region seems to have its own version of the story.

46
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,789
Anyway, was the blood on the ceiling at Nishiki's murder scene

47
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,989
really his blood?

48
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,589
No. The police examined it

49
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:52,089
and determined that only the center of the blood spray.

50
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,189
In other words, the bit that dripped on your shoulder

51
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:57,489
was Nishiki's blood,

52
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,489
and the rest was paint sprayed onto the ceiling beforehand.

53
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,489
I knew it.

54
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,989
Also, they didn't find the blade

55
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,689
used to stab Nishiki at the crime scene.

56
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,189
I thought it'd be buried under the pages scattered on the floor.

57
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:21,089
Which means the culprit still has the weapon.

58
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,389
Ran, what's wrong?

59
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,689
What's wrong?

60
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,289
People are saying you and I French kissed in London!

61
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,889
What's going on?

62
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,889
What?

63
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,089
Nakamichi's telling everyone in a weird Kansai accent.

64
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,689
He says, "Those two kids already smooched."

65
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:47,289
Well...

66
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,389
That was my voice, but it wasn't actually me.

67
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,389
What? It was your voice, but not you?

68
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,089
You're not making any sense!

69
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,989
-Explain yourself, Shinichi! -Why's he speaking in a Kansai accent?

70
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,189
-Explain myself? -I'm not sure.

71
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,389
Apparently, Shinichi told him to do

72
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,289
as the Romans do when in Rome.

73
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,189
-Really? -Stop trying to trick me!

74
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,289
Hey.

75
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:15,189
Why are your sleeves folded up like that?

76
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,089
Normally wouldn't you push your sleeves up like this

77
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,389
if they were in the way?

78
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,389
I didn't really think about it.

79
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,489
It's like a small child was wearing that jacket.

80
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,189
You idiot. That's obviously not what happened.

81
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:35,489
It's a poster for the movie Keiko's in.

82
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:36,589
"11/10 National Theatrical Release"

83
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,489
"The Fighting Red Tengu", huh?

84
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:43,289
But considering what happened to the scriptwriter Nishiki,

85
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:45,189
it might not open.

86
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,589
Yeah.

87
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,489
I wonder what it's about.

88
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,889
It's set in the Edo Period.

89
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,789
A police officer of the Kyoto magistrate's office named Kuranosuke

90
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,489
asks the magistrate

91
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:01,989
if there's anything unusual he can offer the general.

92
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,089
Hearing this,

93
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,589
his wife Mana presents her husband

94
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,389
with a golden paper plant leaf and says to him...

95
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,989
I found this paper plant leaf

96
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,789
while foraging for vegetables in the mountains.

97
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,289
Since it seemed divine, I always prayed to it with clasped hands,

98
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,789
but I have brought it for you.

99
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,389
Now, this is truly unusual.

100
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,689
I'm sure the general will be delighted.

101
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,489
Saying that, Kuranosuke thanks Mana.

102
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,689
But after that day,

103
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,989
strange monsters began appearing every night in Kyoto

104
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:33,789
and eating people.

105
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,689
That paper plant leaf was a magic seal a tengu used long ago

106
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,789
to imprison the monsters.

107
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,789
While this is happening,

108
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,689
the tengu appears to Kuranosuke in his dreams.

109
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,389
The monsters fear the one who broke the seal

110
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,689
will come to imprison them again.

111
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:55,489
They are looking for her so that they may kill her.

112
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:00,289
If you hide the golden paper plant leaf in your wife's bosom

113
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:02,489
and allow the monsters to eat her,

114
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:05,389
they will be imprisoned once again.

115
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,289
I won't do that even if it kills me!

116
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,389
I see. You're willing to risk your life.

117
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:12,989
Then take the paper plant leaf

118
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,589
and jump from the Kiyomizu butai.

119
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,889
The path will open to you.

120
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,489
Believing the Tengu's words,

121
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:24,489
Kuranosuke leaps from the Kiyomizu butai

122
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:26,789
and becomes a golden tengu.

123
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,689
He saves Mana from the monsters just before they're about to eat her,

124
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,289
and defeats them using great magical powers.

125
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,789
But now that Kuranosuke is a tengu,

126
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,189
Mana can't see him anymore.

127
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:43,289
As Mana is crying over the sudden disappearance of her husband,

128
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,689
she hears Kuranosuke's voice.

129
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,589
If you want to see me,

130
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,389
take a tengu's flower to the Kiyomizu butai at sunset

131
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,389
when the leaves are reddest.

132
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,389
Mana picks a speedwell

133
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,189
and goes to the Kiyomizu butai as she was told.

134
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,789
Kuranosuke appears before her as a tengu

135
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,789
and explains to Mana what happened.

136
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,389
But why did you tell me to come in the evening?

137
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,389
If I'd come when the sun were higher,

138
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,489
we could've spent more time together.

139
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:20,189
My rage at the monsters turned my face red,

140
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,689
and my entire body is red with their blood.

141
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:28,089
I thought if we were surrounded by red,

142
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,289
the color would hide it a little.

143
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,689
Answering her question, they exchange a farewell kiss,

144
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,089
and Kuranosuke disappears into the approaching darkness.

145
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,989
It's a sad story.

146
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,189
Wow!

147
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,589
How do you know so much about it?

148
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,289
It hasn't come out yet, right?

149
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,189
Actually, this movie is a remake of a graduation project

150
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:57,589
they shot at Gion Art School.

151
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,889
"The Fighting Red Tengu" -The entire story's available online.

152
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,989
They became famous because of that graduation project,

153
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:12,889
so it's hard to imagine one of them was unhappy with it.

154
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:15,789
Come to think of it,

155
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,589
when we met Keiko at the Kiyomizu butai,

156
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,889
she released a pressed flower into the wind.

157
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,389
Maybe that was a speedwell like the one in the story.

158
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,589
-Is that true? -Yeah.

159
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,389
I think she also said, "You just wait, Dekuri."

160
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,489
"It won't be long now."

161
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,889
What? Dekuri?

162
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,889
Who's Dekuri?

163
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,389
There wasn't anyone like that on the staff list.

164
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:56,789
Mana and Kuranosuke kissed at the Kiyomizu butai...

165
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:09,789
Does Shinichi want to kiss, too?

166
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:29,855
Okay, everyone.

167
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,355
This afternoon, you'll be free to go where you want with your groups.

168
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:36,555
Make sure you follow the course you planned with your group

169
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,355
and return to the hotel by six.

170
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,355
Okay...

171
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,455
Have you heard, Kudo?

172
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,055
If you use a selfie stick at the hotel baths,

173
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:48,955
you can look into the women's baths.

174
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,255
-Seriously? -Seriously.

175
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:55,755
Sera's chest isn't much to look at,

176
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:00,355
but Ran's must be crazy.

177
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,955
Well, yeah.

178
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,555
Well, yeah?

179
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,355
Not only have you kissed her, but you've also bathed together?

180
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,155
Of course not.

181
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:13,855
Why did you hesitate? Come on, tell me!

182
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:16,655
I told you, I haven't!

183
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:18,555
Sometimes I do as Conan, though.

184
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:21,955
Spit it out. Tell me, and I'll forgive you.

185
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,255
Come on. Confess already.

186
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:29,155
-Come on. -Time out.

187
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:30,855
Someone's calling me.

188
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,955
Hattori?

189
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,755
-Sorry, I gotta take this. -Sure.

190
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,655
Hello, Hattori?

191
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,855
Did something happen again?

192
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,455
It's not looking good.

193
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,455
The media's gathered in front of the hotel.

194
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:46,855
They're making a huge fuss.

195
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,755
It can't be helped

196
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:52,555
since Naomoto Award winner Taro Nishiki died last night,

197
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:56,055
but will you be okay with all this going on?

198
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,055
Your teachers might cancel the trip

199
00:10:58,055 --> 00:11:00,855
and take you guys back to Tokyo.

200
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,755
Oh, yeah. We're fine for now.

201
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:08,055
The teachers seem to be avoiding mentioning the case,

202
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:10,355
and the rooms we're staying in

203
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:14,755
are pretty far away from the room Nishiki died in.

204
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,655
Anyway, think you can slip away?

205
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:17,655
What?

206
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,255
Those four want to tell us about

207
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:23,455
that Dekuri guy who came up with the cipher.

208
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:26,255
It's hard for them to talk here with the media around,

209
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:28,455
so they want to secretly meet for lunch

210
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,355
at a restaurant where they have a reservation.

211
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:34,155
I'm going with the police.

212
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,655
You'll want to speak with them in person, right?

213
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,255
What's the restaurant?

214
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:41,155
Hey, where should we get lunch?

215
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,455
Yesterday's fruit sandwiches were good.

216
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:44,855
I want beef.

217
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:46,755
Then today...

218
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:47,955
Hey.

219
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:51,255
How about a place called Isogiyama in Ponto City?

220
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,255
"Ponto City"

221
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,055
Way to go, Sonoko.

222
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:57,255
At first, they said they were booked solid.

223
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,655
The Suzuki Conglomerate sure is great.

224
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:01,855
Well, yeah.

225
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,855
What's this round barrier made of bamboo?

226
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:10,055
There are similar ones in front of the other shops, too.

227
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,755
Maybe it's a fad in Kyoto.

228
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:13,155
That can't be right.

229
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:15,855
It's an inuyarai.

230
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:21,155
They say they're to deter thieves or mark the edges of the street,

231
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:24,355
but they're apparently for deterring dogs from urinating.

232
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,555
-Momiji. -You know her?

233
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:30,255
Yeah. We met last time I came to Kyoto with my dad.

234
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,555
Her tits are huge.

235
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:34,455
Are they your friends?

236
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,855
You're wearing the same uniforms.

237
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:40,955
Yes. We came from Tokyo on a school trip.

238
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:44,055
I see. From Tokyo?

239
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:48,555
Thank you for coming all the way from the provinces.

240
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,155
The provinces?

241
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:52,655
But we're from the capital.

242
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:56,155
What do you have to eat to get that big?

243
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:59,155
My high school's off this afternoon.

244
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,855
I was thinking about having lunch here.

245
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:04,755
Shall we eat together?

246
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:09,655
Oh, right. Momiji, you attend Kyoto Senshin High School, right?

247
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,455
Yes, I do.

248
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:14,755
Do you know Soshi Okita?

249
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:19,755
Oh, yes. That kendo brat is in my class.

250
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,255
Really?

251
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,955
Let's not stand around out here.

252
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,955
Why don't we talk inside?

253
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:27,255
Okay.

254
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,355
Tengu!

255
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:32,355
There are tengu on Kiyamachi Way!

256
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,455
Tengu!

257
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,255
-Tengu? -Really?

258
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:47,555
Hey...

259
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,255
Just how many are there?

260
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,755
Inspector Ayanokoji.

261
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:54,555
What's all this noise?

262
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:55,955
Sorry, sir.

263
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:00,555
People are saying tengu have appeared on Kiyamachi Way.

264
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:03,455
Kiyamachi Way? That's just around the corner.

265
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:07,455
Do something about those idiots yourselves.

266
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:12,255
But, Inspector, it's not just a couple of tengu.

267
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,655
What?

268
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,955
Do those tengu...

269
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,555
Have something to do with Nishiki's case?

270
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:21,455
Hey! You'll protect us, right?

271
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:23,055
Fine, then.

272
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:25,855
We have to step away for a moment.

273
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,955
Please don't go anywhere.

274
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,555
Okay.

275
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,855
I'm scared.

276
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:34,255
Don't let them escape.

277
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,055
We've got this.

278
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:47,055
What should we do, Kudo?

279
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,655
Start catching them!

280
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,655
Got it.

281
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:54,055
Ran, let's help them!

282
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:55,055
Okay.

283
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:58,155
Hey, wait! Don't leave me behind!

284
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,155
Iori.

285
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:21,455
Miss.

286
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:22,855
Iori!

287
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,055
Miss, are you hurt?

288
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,255
I'm all right.

289
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,255
-Who's that? -Who are you actually?

290
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,555
Gosh. I got caught.

291
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,055
Heiji!

292
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,755
What are you wearing these weird masks for?

293
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,255
They were recruiting online.

294
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,555
100 thousand yen up front just for wearing a tengu mask

295
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,355
and running around Kiyamachi Way.

296
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:46,355
If you don't get caught for thirty minutes,

297
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:48,255
they said they'd pay a million.

298
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:49,855
Is that true?

299
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,555
Hattori!

300
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:54,355
Hattori, is it just those four in the restaurant right now?

301
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:56,855
Yeah. We'd better head back soon.

302
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:04,555
-Darn it. -They got us.

303
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,655
It's the actor Ihaya this time.

304
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,855
Yeah. Sliced his carotid artery right open.

305
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:17,255
He's upside down with two bumps on his head again.

306
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:19,855
What a strange culprit.

307
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:23,055
They must've taken the time to make these marks

308
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:26,555
before inviting him out here to kill him.

309
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:27,755
No.

310
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:30,455
When we left ten minutes ago...

311
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,855
these marks weren't here.

312
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:26,655
"Next Episode" -The blood spray and footprints on the inuyarai...

313
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:32,555
Are we being tricked by a fox?

314
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,955
Huh?

315
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:38,155
There are weird marks around the inuyarai.

316
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:41,055
Did he just say "Huh"?

317
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:44,555
I don't have time to think about that right now.

318
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:45,855
Time?

319
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:49,055
Next Conan special,

320
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:52,755
"The Scarlet School Trip (Red Love Arc)"

321
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,398
Next Conan's Hint:

322
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,798
"A movie poster"

323
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,198
Let's say it again together.

324
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,198
Thanks for another year...

325
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,598
Thank you!
