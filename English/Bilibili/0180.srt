1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.640
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.240
Today's episode is about a visitor from France.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.440
The will to kill harmonizes in the melody of the piano.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.790
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 1)"

9
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.390
"The Kana Amusement Group"

11
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.990
"Yoshinori Kana" -The Kana Amusement Group is a very big company.

12
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.390
What would the chairman of such a company want to talk to me about?

13
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.190
Well, we're going to be making Gerald Tenma's CD at our company.

14
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.590
And, we're going to be holding a private party

15
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.090
upon the signing of the contract.

16
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.090
How nice, Mr. Tenma is finally going to make his Japan debut?

17
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.390
-Do you know him? -Of course.

18
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.190
He's a mysterious singer that is the talk of the French world of Chanson.

19
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.190
No one knows anything about his personal history, isn't that right?

20
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.090
I'm amazed that you know.

21
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.690
Ever since that day, we decided on the day of the party,

22
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.490
eerie things have been happening around his wife, Misaki.

23
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.290
Eerie things happening?

24
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.390
Repeated phone calls without no caller responding.

25
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.990
Rose bouquets sent by an unknown sender.

26
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.690
This letter came with the bouquet of roses.

27
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.090
Blackmail.

28
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.790
Those who do not realize my love,

29
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.890
will surely fall to the pits of despair.

30
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.390
We got the other one yesterday.

31
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.590
The curtains will be opened to commence the party of revenge.

32
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.990
Enjoy a party of terror to your heart's content.

33
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.690
The party will be held in three days.

34
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.090
We can't cancel it now and I'm also worried about my wife.

35
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.790
Do you have any idea who this may be?

36
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.890
We are carrying out contract procedures secretly.

37
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.590
Therefore, the only ones who know that there is going to be a party

38
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.190
are my wife and I,

39
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.490
and the other four who are scheduled to attend.

40
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.690
"Three days later" -You left me behind all alone,

41
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.790
but I still haven't forgotten you.

42
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.890
My eyes are always on you.

43
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.690
I hear your voice and I am just so delighted.

44
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.190
What on earth is that?

45
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.390
Oh come on! It's the Japanese lyrics

46
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.590
to Mr. Tenma's "Nocturne of Red Love."

47
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.890
I'll send you a flower a day.

48
00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.790
A red rose, a marigold, a roberia,

49
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.990
a bright red dahlia, and a love song...

50
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.990
You are forever mine.

51
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.290
I wonder what she likes about a song like this?

52
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.590
I'm so happy that I'm going to get to see Mr. Tenma.

53
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.890
This is work now, remember, work!

54
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.090
We're supposed to be members of the Morita family,

55
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.990
a friend of the chairman, understand.

56
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.090
All right, all right.

57
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.490
I can't have them finding out that I'm a top-notch detective.

58
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.790
Don't worry, because you don't look like one.

59
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.090
Really, you two better behave yourselves.

60
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.990
That's for me to say, not you.

61
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.290
Going from the gate to the entrance of the house by car,

62
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.890
is like what I've seen in movies from abroad.

63
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.090
This is really some house.

64
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.090
They must be millionaires.

65
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.790
Doesn't it look like a castle that comes out in horror movies?

66
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.790
Oh, no. Thunder.

67
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.890
It was such a fine day until just a while ago, and now it's so...

68
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.690
Didn't you want to see Gerald?

69
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.290
Being scared is another thing.

70
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.390
Mr. Morita?

71
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.590
Yes, I'm Morita. The one that was invited.

72
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.590
Thank you for coming.

73
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.790
Please come in.

74
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.790
Mr. Morita.

75
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.390
I've been waiting for you.

76
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.090
Thank you for inviting us.

77
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.590
Thank you for coming.

78
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.990
She is my secretary.

79
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.590
Masayo Tokudaiji.

80
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.590
How do you do?

81
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.690
It's nice to meet you.

82
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.590
This is the reception room.

83
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.590
Oh, well, well.

84
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.390
The art work here is also fantastic.

85
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.190
It's all my wife's taste.

86
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.990
Come this way please.

87
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.290
May I take a look around your residence before doing so?

88
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.090
Sure.

89
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.690
Ms. Tokudaiji!

90
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.190
Please show them around.

91
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.790
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.890
No.

93
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.790
I'll show them around.

94
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.590
She is my wife, Misaki.

95
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.190
She is the president of the group company, Kana Music Publisher.

96
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.390
"Misaki Kana (32)" -How do you do? Let's go.

97
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.490
Yes.

98
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.190
Please prepare things in the kitchen, Masayo.

99
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.190
Your wife doesn't like me,

100
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.590
does she, chairman?

101
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.690
Hey, you...

102
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.690
This is the room right above the large reception hall.

103
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.290
The room beyond is the piano room.

104
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.490
How wonderful.

105
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.990
You even have a spiral corridor within the house.

106
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.190
This sword...

107
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.790
Hey!

108
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.390
Don't you dare touch it!

109
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.290
It's not all that fragile.

110
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.990
Although it's decoration,

111
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.090
it is made of the same materials and in the same way as the real thing.

112
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.090
In other words, it's the real thing?

113
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.790
The room next to the piano room is mine.

114
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.490
Come, this way please.

115
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.790
This room is also of good taste.

116
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.990
A picture of your wedding?

117
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.690
How beautiful.

118
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.090
It was taken 10 years ago today in Fiji.

119
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.690
How nice.

120
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.090
We belonged to the same music club in our university days.

121
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.590
We went steady for a year and then got married.

122
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.890
My, how I envy you.

123
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.690
Hello.

124
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.490
Who is it?

125
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.690
Who is this?

126
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.090
The person hung up.

127
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.390
Hello.

128
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.690
It hung up.

129
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.290
Does this kind of thing happen often?

130
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.090
Yes. In a hoarse man's voice,

131
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.790
things like "Mon amie" and "Je taime" are whispered.

132
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.090
And when I answer, the phone is hung up immediately.

133
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.790
You have no idea who it is?

134
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.990
That's not all.

135
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.690
Together with a letter,

136
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.290
I got this too.

137
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.690
Was this taken without you being aware?

138
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.290
This is what I found together with the bunch of Marigold

139
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.290
I found it at the front door this morning.

140
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.190
This seems to have been taken yesterday.

141
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.590
I feel like someone is always watching me

142
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.090
that I'm scared.

143
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.490
After the rose is the marigold.

144
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.290
Always being watched.

145
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.090
Worry no more.

146
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.890
I will protect you Misaki over my dead body.

147
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.290
Chairman, the guests have arrived.

148
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.090
All right. I'll be right there.

149
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.990
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

150
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.790
Thank you so much for coming.

151
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.290
Yoshinori, this is Gerald Tenma's manager.

152
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.790
I'm Michelle, nice to meet you.

153
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.290
This is my older brother, Yoshinori Kana,

154
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.090
and his wife, Misaki.

155
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.190
How do you do?

156
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.490
Thank you for coming.

157
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.590
Where is Mr. Tenma?

158
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.790
I'm sorry, he had some other work to attend

159
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.890
so he will arrive here in about 30 minutes.

160
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.590
Yoshinori, who are they?

161
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.790
He is my old friend, Mr. Morita.

162
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.390
They are his children, Ran and Conan.

163
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.690
Mr. Morita, he is my younger brother, Hideki.

164
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.290
He is the vice president of Kana Music Publishers.

165
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.290
Yoshinori, may I have a word with you?

166
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.290
What is it?

167
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.790
Excuse me.

168
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.290
Please come this way and have a seat.

169
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.790
What delicious looking dishes.

170
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.990
Don't forget why we're here.

171
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.690
Why did you invite outsiders here?

172
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.790
This is an important time when we have to sign a contract with Gerald.

173
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.790
The contract?

174
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.690
You leave for France on your own and suddenly bring Gerald along.

175
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.990
Thinking of the company,

176
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.290
I don't see anything wrong in what I did.

177
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.590
For the company? I guess so,

178
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.990
because if this doesn't work out,

179
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.290
you can't make yourself look good to Misaki.

180
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:45.690
What a thing to say!

181
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.490
I hear you've been making passes to Misaki persistently.

182
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.390
Who said such a thing?

183
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.390
How about you and Ms. Tokudaiji, Yoshinori?

184
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.490
The rumor is going around all over the company.

185
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.690
Don't be ridiculous!

186
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.390
There is nothing going between her and me!

187
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.790
Anyway! I'm going to make this contract go through

188
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.290
no matter what it takes.

189
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.890
It's about time for Gerald to arrive.

190
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.890
I'll go wait for him by the front door.

191
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.090
Let me go with you.

192
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.390
I'll go to the restroom before that.

193
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.390
Please get the next dish ready, will you?

194
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.590
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.590
You don't have anything to drink, Mr. Morita.

196
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.690
I'll go get you some.

197
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.090
Thank you very much.

198
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.390
Will you excuse me while I go fix my make-up?

199
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.790
Don't drink too much, Dad.

200
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.990
I know, I know.

201
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.690
You know what...

202
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.390
Don't you have to guard Misaki?

203
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.890
That's right, Dad. You've got work to do.

204
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.390
I couldn't possibly go into a room where a is fixing make-up.

205
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.890
Ran, you go.

206
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.090
I guess so.

207
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.790
It's a black out.

208
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.090
A thunder bolt probably fell somewhere.

209
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.490
This is bad.

210
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.890
Upstairs?

211
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.090
Darn!

212
00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:29.779
Help!

213
00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.479
The door is locked!

214
00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:35.679
Out of the way!

215
00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:41.779
Help!

216
00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.079
Hold it!

217
00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:48.179
Misaki!

218
00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.179
Darn. Where the heck is he?

219
00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:55.279
Darn... where'd it go?

220
00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.779
Misaki.

221
00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:01.779
What's the matter? Are you all right?

222
00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:05.779
Somebody lowered the breakers.

223
00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:06.879
Misaki!

224
00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.179
What's the matter?

225
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.579
Somebody, suddenly...

226
00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:15.479
What's that?

227
00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:17.579
No!

228
00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:18.779
Roberia.

229
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:22.279
Just as I thought, this is...

230
00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:26.679
Ran, flowers by that name come out in that song too, don't they?

231
00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:29.979
That song? You mean, "Nocturne of Red Love".

232
00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:32.679
A rose, marigold, and roberia.

233
00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.879
Which means that all the flowers

234
00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:39.179
-that the person had sent up to now are... -"I am always watching you."

235
00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:43.479
"Hearing your voice delights me."

236
00:14:43.479 --> 00:14:45.579
Are you saying that someone is threatening Misaki

237
00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:48.679
according to the lyrics of Gerald Tenma?

238
00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:49.979
Threatening?

239
00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:55.479
It means that someone is stalking your beautiful wife.

240
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.879
Although I know we are all in the midst of a party,

241
00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:01.379
I'd like to question all of you.

242
00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.779
Are you the one who lifted the breaker?

243
00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:06.279
Yes. On my way here,

244
00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:09.479
the breaker at the top of the stairs.

245
00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:12.579
Where were you at that time, Hideki?

246
00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.779
Mr. Morita, who are you?

247
00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:20.279
Excuse me, I am not Morita, but Kogoro Mouri, a detective.

248
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.579
Kogoro Mouri?

249
00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:23.479
You mean that famous detective?

250
00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:25.279
Yes, that's right.

251
00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.579
Misaki, you locked the door, didn't you?

252
00:15:28.579 --> 00:15:31.379
Yes, just as I was about to fix my make-up,

253
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:34.879
the lights went out and I was attacked from behind.

254
00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:37.079
You didn't see what the attacker looked like?

255
00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:38.079
No...

256
00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.079
I saw.

257
00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:43.279
I couldn't see very clearly but...

258
00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:46.679
He was wearing a cape and had a blank facial expression.

259
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:49.179
He looked like a foreigner.

260
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:50.879
Like a foreigner?

261
00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:53.479
Me? Why me?

262
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:56.179
Pardon me, where were you at that time?

263
00:15:56.179 --> 00:16:00.179
I went to the front door to meet Gerald.

264
00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:03.979
The lights went out and I came inside because it began to rain.

265
00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:08.179
I saw Hideki, and heard a voice scream, "Help!"

266
00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:10.379
We came here together.

267
00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:12.179
Will you cut it out.

268
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:15.079
Michelle is an important guest.

269
00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:19.779
Gerald!

270
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:25.379
He looks like the attacker.

271
00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:28.079
Let me introduce you,

272
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:31.579
this is our main guest tonight, Mr. Gerald Tenma.

273
00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:34.979
"Gerald Tenma (34)" -There seemed to be no one downstairs so I...

274
00:16:34.979 --> 00:16:37.479
We had a black out here.

275
00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.179
May I speak to you downstairs?

276
00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:41.879
Please come with me too, everyone.

277
00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.979
The door of the room was locked.

278
00:16:48.979 --> 00:16:53.179
Which means that the attacker was already in the room.

279
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.179
Everyone who left the large reception room beforehand had a chance...

280
00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:59.979
Which means that someone lowered the breaker.

281
00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:02.279
Could there be more than one attacker?

282
00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:05.879
What is this a piece of?

283
00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.879
The crack is still new...

284
00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:10.279
There are other small debris around.

285
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.679
Here?

286
00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.779
No, the size is different.

287
00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:19.179
What is this a trace of?

288
00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.179
Where were you all when the incident occurred?

289
00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:27.279
I was in the restroom.

290
00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.679
I panicked when the lights went out.

291
00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:34.379
I was in the kitchen checking on the cake Misaki had baked.

292
00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:38.279
Mr. Tenma, you were drenched, weren't you?

293
00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:41.679
That's because I got off the taxi by the gate.

294
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.079
Is that true?

295
00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:48.479
Well, why don't we take a break then?

296
00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:50.179
Excuse me.

297
00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:58.379
Oh no, where's Conan?

298
00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:00.179
Don't tell me he's at it again.

299
00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.579
Are you all right?

300
00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:09.879
Can you go and get medicine from my room?

301
00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:11.679
Yeah, okay.

302
00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:16.479
The picture that was taken last night was...

303
00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:24.079
They seemed to have struggled pretty hard...

304
00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:32.179
Misaki and Gerald Tenma?

305
00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.479
This is dated 10 years ago.

306
00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:37.579
It's 6 months before Misaki got married.

307
00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:39.479
Hey!

308
00:18:39.479 --> 00:18:43.179
Conan, you're going to be scolded by Dad again.

309
00:18:43.179 --> 00:18:45.779
-What's that? -Well, this is, you see...

310
00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:48.379
-Show it to me. -Oh, no!

311
00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.879
No, you can't.

312
00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:52.579
What's the matter?

313
00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.379
Oh no!

314
00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.579
What is the meaning of this?

315
00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:03.979
Did you have intimate relationships with Misaki in the past?

316
00:19:03.979 --> 00:19:05.179
What shall I do?

317
00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:07.179
Yoshinori, what a rude thing to say!

318
00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:08.279
Hideki!

319
00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:10.779
Don't tell me that you knew and yet deliberately...

320
00:19:10.779 --> 00:19:12.179
Why would I do such a thing?

321
00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:13.179
Stop it.

322
00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:17.679
-Misaki. -Dear...

323
00:19:17.679 --> 00:19:20.879
It's true, that before I married you, I was going with him.

324
00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:24.279
His real name is Junya Tenma, and I used to go with him.

325
00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:27.079
He was a nameless artist back then.

326
00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:31.079
But, on a certain day, 20 years ago,

327
00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:33.279
your whereabouts suddenly became unknown.

328
00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:34.479
Isn't that right?

329
00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:38.079
When I saw the papers of Gerald Tenma

330
00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.779
that we were going to sign a contract with,

331
00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:42.479
I was surprised to find that such a coincidence existed.

332
00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:46.779
It's been a long time, Mr. Tenma.

333
00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:48.479
Yeah.

334
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:56.679
Mrs. Kana, I have a gift for you.

335
00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:00.779
It's hand made wine, something that you cannot get in Japan.

336
00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:06.579
I would like to taste the wine.

337
00:20:10.779 --> 00:20:13.779
There seems to be nothing wrong with it.

338
00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.479
Let's have juice.

339
00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:20.479
Now, let's all have a toast.

340
00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:26.479
-Cheers! -Cheers!

341
00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:32.479
She's still on her guard after all.

342
00:20:32.479 --> 00:20:35.179
Yes, this sure is good wine!

343
00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:38.079
Excuse me.

344
00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:39.779
No problem.

345
00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:42.679
Oh yes. I was baking a cake.

346
00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:45.879
Masayo, will you go to the basement in the yard

347
00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:47.479
and get me the silver tea set?

348
00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:48.479
Yes.

349
00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.879
I will serve you all a special hand-made cake I made.

350
00:20:52.879 --> 00:20:54.579
Please wait a moment.

351
00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:00.979
As one of the conditions of publishing the "Nocturne of Red Love"

352
00:21:00.979 --> 00:21:02.479
from your company,

353
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:06.479
have slightly changed the lyrics and made new arrangements.

354
00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:08.279
One with a new arrangement?

355
00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:11.679
Gerald insisted on doing so.

356
00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:15.679
I found this bunch of flowers at the entrance.

357
00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:17.179
Dahlias.

358
00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:20.479
Dahlias stand for betrayal.

359
00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.079
Betrayal?

360
00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:25.879
Thank you for waiting.

361
00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:28.079
Listen, everyone.

362
00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:33.979
Mr. Tenma, won't you play your music for us?

363
00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:36.479
After all, you're here in person.

364
00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:39.279
Very well.

365
00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:44.479
You attacked Misaki, didn't you?

366
00:21:44.479 --> 00:21:46.879
Not that again.

367
00:21:46.879 --> 00:21:49.279
Who else but you could've done it?

368
00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:51.979
I have to make preparations, so please leave me alone.

369
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.379
Don't tell me you're thinking of fleeing?

370
00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:55.679
Will you cut it out?

371
00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.279
They seem to be having an argument.

372
00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:58.779
Let's go check on them.

373
00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:04.579
It's Mr. Tenma's voice!

374
00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:12.779
What's wrong?

375
00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:16.579
No, I didn't do it.

376
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:17.579
Gerald?

377
00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:23.179
Gerald!

378
00:22:23.179 --> 00:22:24.779
This is?

379
00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:03.179
"Next Episode" -"Nocturne of Red Love."

380
00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:07.579
This song was one that Mr. Tenma had written for Misaki 10 years ago.

381
00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:11.179
Is it blood?

382
00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:13.279
No.

383
00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:22.279
He's the one who attacked Misaki.

384
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:24.479
Next Conan,

385
00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:28.279
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 2)"

386
00:24:28.997 --> 00:24:31.597
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:31.597 --> 00:24:33.297
"Wine"

388
00:24:33.297 --> 00:24:34.297
Next episode is solving the case.

389
00:24:35.397 --> 00:24:36.397
What was that?

390
00:24:36.397 --> 00:24:37.497
The sound of solving the case.

391
00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:38.497
Really?
