1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.740
There's flood above and a big fire below.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.540
What's this?

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.040
Hot spring!

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.840
Right!

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.440
The answer is bathtub, right?

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
Because you don't boil the water of a hot spring.

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.940
Well, I don't think they're all that wrong.

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.640
Because most hot springs are warmed

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.240
by the heat of burning magma.

10
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.940
Well, that's true.

11
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.540
But, I wonder what's going on?

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.540
Why would Dr. Agasa want to take us to a hot spring?

13
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.640
I'm going over to repair my invention.

14
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.440
The owner of this inn really liked it

15
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.540
and bought a whole lot from me.

16
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.740
It seems that the guests favored them too,

17
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.940
but it seem to have broken down recently.

18
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.640
What kind of thing did you make?

19
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.840
A chair that makes you feel like you took

20
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.340
a hot spring bath just by sitting in it,

21
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340
as well as the good effects of the hot spring working on your body?

22
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.540
Amazing!

23
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.540
With something like that you don't need hot springs.

24
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.940
Well, I'll keep you in suspense.

25
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.940
Well, I'm sure it's one of his not useful inventions again.

26
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.640
Brooding over passing seasons

27
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.340
An open-air bath afloat on the lake.

29
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.440
The locked room mystery before dawn.

30
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:56.903
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 1)"

34
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.403
"Hakone Hot Spring Kobo Inn"

35
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:19.203
The water temperature now is 42.3 ��C.

36
00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:22.403
The total sulfur content per kg of water

37
00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:25.103
is 25.7 ml.

38
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:28.903
This hot spring is a sulfur spring.

39
00:03:28.903 --> 00:03:30.503
It's cute.

40
00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:34.103
It's effective for skin disease, arteriosclerosis,

41
00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:36.003
-beautiful skin and rheumatism -What kind of doll is it?

42
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:38.503
-as well as neuralgia... -It's a Goemon Ishikawa doll!

43
00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:41.603
When it comes to baths it's Goemon Ishikawa, right?

44
00:03:41.603 --> 00:03:44.403
Wasn't he was boiled in an iron pot and executed?

45
00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:47.503
If ingested it may also have medicinal effects

46
00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:51.303
against... diabetes...

47
00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:52.603
gout...

48
00:03:52.603 --> 00:03:58.703
constipation...

49
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:07.503
Goemon is totally steamed up.

50
00:04:07.503 --> 00:04:09.603
It seems that the moving part wore out

51
00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:11.903
and water leaked inside.

52
00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:14.103
Can you fix it overnight?

53
00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:17.403
Yes, since I brought the parts necessary.

54
00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:19.603
This time I'll make them more sturdy and durable.

55
00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:20.903
Hey.

56
00:04:20.903 --> 00:04:22.803
You're not finished cleaning yet?

57
00:04:22.803 --> 00:04:25.403
It's already after 1 pm.

58
00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:27.203
In about another 10 minutes.

59
00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:30.403
I tell you! I wanted to try bathing in all five spas

60
00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.603
here before I shoot the film, and yet...

61
00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.703
Well, you can take a bath

62
00:04:34.703 --> 00:04:36.003
even after we finish the shoot.

63
00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:41.803
Aren't you actress Ms. Mishio Natori?

64
00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.803
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:43.803 --> 00:04:44.903
Just as I thought!

66
00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:46.403
You played the role of the lover

67
00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:49.003
of the very first Masked Yaiba, right?

68
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:51.303
You were very cute.

69
00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:55.303
You were always kind to everybody.

70
00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:57.403
"Mishio Natori (28)" -I guess I did play a stupid role

71
00:04:57.403 --> 00:05:00.403
like that some time in the past.

72
00:05:00.403 --> 00:05:02.703
But, that's a story of the past.

73
00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:05.203
I wish you wouldn't remind me of it.

74
00:05:05.203 --> 00:05:07.403
She somehow seems different from before.

75
00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.303
She used to always be smiling.

76
00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:11.103
Is she a snob?

77
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:13.703
Sorry, kids.

78
00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:16.203
She's just concentrating on her role now

79
00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:18.103
and is a bit annoyed.

80
00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:20.003
"Junsaku Tanzawa (34)" -Even I, as manager

81
00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.603
find it hard to talk to her.

82
00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:25.703
A role? Are you filming a drama or something here?

83
00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:29.103
She did say something about filming a while ago.

84
00:05:29.103 --> 00:05:30.503
Actually...

85
00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:34.003
It's a movie that'll be released next year.

86
00:05:34.003 --> 00:05:35.803
A supreme masterpiece

87
00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:37.503
of the Bloody Smoke Hitman series.

88
00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.803
"Ganji Tetsuyama (67)" -Titled Scarlet Wellspring!

89
00:05:39.803 --> 00:05:41.303
Of course the scriptwriter is,

90
00:05:41.303 --> 00:05:43.403
yours truly, Ganji Tetsuyama.

91
00:05:45.203 --> 00:05:47.203
I guess you brats don't know me.

92
00:05:48.803 --> 00:05:50.803
I know, I know.

93
00:05:50.803 --> 00:05:54.803
You're finally going to remake Scarlet Wellspring!

94
00:05:54.803 --> 00:05:58.203
What's that? Blood Smoke Hitman?

95
00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:00.303
A story about a professional killer.

96
00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:03.203
It is said that he got his name because for some reason,

97
00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:04.903
he was asked to do work in the spa district,

98
00:06:04.903 --> 00:06:08.103
and because steam is smeared with blood, people called him by that name.

99
00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:11.603
This series is that old man's debut work.

100
00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:15.303
It is a story that is separated into the young life edition

101
00:06:15.303 --> 00:06:18.303
and elderly life edition of the main character,

102
00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:21.203
who is the killer and Scarlet Wellspring is the only title

103
00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:23.003
that belongs to the midlife part.

104
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:24.703
If I remember...

105
00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:27.003
the main character quit being a hitman

106
00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:29.403
due to a certain incident

107
00:06:29.403 --> 00:06:31.503
but, decided to kill for free for the first time

108
00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:34.003
for a woman owner of an inn.

109
00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:36.903
He schemes up a perfect locked room murder...

110
00:06:36.903 --> 00:06:38.203
I think it was.

111
00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:40.103
And, the midlife part,

112
00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:42.903
Scarlet Wellspring was filmed just once

113
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.403
in black and white quite some time ago,

114
00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:47.803
but it was never remade because they couldn't find an actor

115
00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:50.203
that was suitable to be the main character.

116
00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:52.403
The youth edition and elderly edition

117
00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:54.303
were acted out by various actors

118
00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:56.703
and remade over and over by many directors though.

119
00:06:58.103 --> 00:07:00.503
And...

120
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.603
"Unpei Terado (33)" -I, the perfect image of the

121
00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:05.703
middle aged hitman appeared.

122
00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:08.603
You're here too, Mr. Terado.

123
00:07:08.603 --> 00:07:12.703
Yes. I heard the heroine already arrived on site,

124
00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:16.103
so I ditched the manager and flew over.

125
00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:18.903
Before the film staff arrives tomorrow...

126
00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:20.403
If only a little bit, I was thinking of becoming intimate

127
00:07:20.403 --> 00:07:22.303
with the beautiful heroine.

128
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:29.203
I won't have you doing things to our actress without permission.

129
00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:31.203
Besides the role you're playing

130
00:07:31.203 --> 00:07:34.303
is that of a grief-stricken middle-aged man,

131
00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:36.303
exhausted by the business of killing.

132
00:07:36.303 --> 00:07:40.303
Not that of a skirt-chasing pervert with undisguised lust, right?

133
00:07:40.303 --> 00:07:42.603
Yeah, I know.

134
00:07:42.603 --> 00:07:44.003
That it's a completely different story

135
00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:46.103
from the pompous showoff you

136
00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:48.203
played in the youth edition.

137
00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:50.003
I see.

138
00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.703
I thought you looked familiar.

139
00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:55.603
You're the actor, Mr. Junsaku Tanzawa!

140
00:07:55.603 --> 00:07:57.703
Yes.

141
00:07:57.703 --> 00:08:00.703
You were great as the hitman.

142
00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:03.803
You should do the midlife edition too!

143
00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:05.403
Hey, hey...

144
00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:09.803
No. I've taken a break from acting for personal reasons.

145
00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:13.203
But you could be dragged back into acting again.

146
00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:15.903
Being that the cast could be completely changed

147
00:08:15.903 --> 00:08:18.703
on a whim by our great scriptwriter here.

148
00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:21.703
Yes, true.

149
00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:25.203
I already have two or three actors in mind as your substitute.

150
00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:28.003
Depending on your performance a change could occur.

151
00:08:28.003 --> 00:08:29.503
What?

152
00:08:29.503 --> 00:08:32.703
Of course, that goes for you too, Ms. Natori.

153
00:08:32.703 --> 00:08:34.103
I'm not surprised.

154
00:08:34.103 --> 00:08:36.903
Well... Take a slow nice bath in the spa.

155
00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:39.003
Cleanse your body well, and perform your role

156
00:08:39.003 --> 00:08:41.503
as the woman owner of the inn as best you can.

157
00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:44.203
There is a romantic sexy "wet" scene too, you know!

158
00:08:46.103 --> 00:08:48.303
What's a "wet" scene?

159
00:08:48.303 --> 00:08:49.303
What?

160
00:08:49.303 --> 00:08:51.403
I think she's going to take a bath?

161
00:08:51.403 --> 00:08:54.903
I see, if so, she'll get wet.

162
00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:57.503
Well, I guess I'll leave it at that.

163
00:09:03.703 --> 00:09:05.803
Is something wrong with his leg?

164
00:09:05.803 --> 00:09:08.203
Yes. He seems to have injured his tendon

165
00:09:08.203 --> 00:09:10.003
a few years ago.

166
00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:12.203
He's been walking that way ever since,

167
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:15.403
according to a documentary TV program.

168
00:09:15.403 --> 00:09:17.503
Now that we've come all this way,

169
00:09:17.503 --> 00:09:20.103
we should try the specialty of this hot spring inn

170
00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:22.903
and take a dip in the open-air bath on the lake, okay?

171
00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:24.603
What's that?

172
00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:26.203
Literally, an open-air spa

173
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:30.003
with a great scenic view built on a lake!

174
00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:33.503
They only have it here, and at the Hawaii Hot Spring in Tottori!

175
00:09:33.503 --> 00:09:37.003
Awesome!

176
00:09:37.003 --> 00:09:40.503
But, why is the women's bath bigger?

177
00:09:40.503 --> 00:09:42.503
It seems they switch the men and women's

178
00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:44.603
bath after the cleaning at noon.

179
00:09:44.603 --> 00:09:45.803
See you!

180
00:09:45.803 --> 00:09:46.803
Okay!

181
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:48.003
See you later!

182
00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:57.203
It looks crowded.

183
00:09:57.203 --> 00:09:59.403
The women's side is filled too.

184
00:09:59.403 --> 00:10:00.803
It can't be helped.

185
00:10:00.803 --> 00:10:03.403
Let's come back first thing in the morning.

186
00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:06.003
In the morning the men's bath is larger.

187
00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:09.703
And it'll be nice taking a dip while watching the sunrise.

188
00:10:09.703 --> 00:10:11.403
-Okay! -I guess so!

189
00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:15.003
It's no wonder it's cold,

190
00:10:15.003 --> 00:10:17.003
since we're atop of the lake exposed to the wind.

191
00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.103
Let's hurry back to the room.

192
00:10:23.903 --> 00:10:27.703
So you've finally decided to do it.

193
00:10:27.703 --> 00:10:29.603
The open-air bath on the lake

194
00:10:29.603 --> 00:10:31.903
with the morning sun shining down.

195
00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:35.403
Sounds great, just great.

196
00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:37.003
The man playing the lead role?

197
00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.503
If you don't care for him,

198
00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:40.003
we could make a switch.

199
00:10:54.503 --> 00:10:56.303
What's wrong, Mishio?

200
00:10:56.303 --> 00:10:59.003
I think I heard something crack.

201
00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:01.503
Is anything wrong?

202
00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:02.803
It's nothing!

203
00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:04.103
Leave me alone!

204
00:11:18.203 --> 00:11:21.403
Why me?

205
00:11:21.403 --> 00:11:23.503
It's the manager we saw yesterday.

206
00:11:26.303 --> 00:11:27.803
You're an early bird, aren't you?

207
00:11:27.803 --> 00:11:29.803
It' still 4:30 am.

208
00:11:29.803 --> 00:11:31.403
Bug you, brat.

209
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:40.903
I'm back.

210
00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:42.903
What took you so long, Conan?

211
00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:46.003
How long is it going to take you to buy drinks?

212
00:11:46.003 --> 00:11:48.803
It's because you made me go buy the drinks all alone.

213
00:11:48.803 --> 00:11:51.103
And, telling me to buy different kinds too.

214
00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:54.603
It's your fault for being weak at playing stone, paper, scissors.

215
00:11:54.603 --> 00:11:56.403
The man who was smoking the pipe yesterday

216
00:11:56.403 --> 00:11:58.103
is already heading for the bath.

217
00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:00.003
-What? -See, over there.

218
00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:02.803
He's crossing the wharf.

219
00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:05.303
It's supposed to start at 5 am in the morning, right?

220
00:12:05.303 --> 00:12:07.603
It's 4:43 am right now.

221
00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:09.603
It's a violation.

222
00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:11.303
Let's go too.

223
00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:16.503
I guess we'll let Dr. Agasa sleep.

224
00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.603
I guess so. Since he was repairing until late last night too.

225
00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:22.603
What?

226
00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:25.803
How come that gramps get to go and we don't?

227
00:12:25.803 --> 00:12:28.903
Well, that man is an honored guest

228
00:12:28.903 --> 00:12:30.603
so he gets special privileges.

229
00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:35.003
But, it's only 10 more minutes to 5 am.

230
00:12:35.003 --> 00:12:37.703
Right. I guess we can let them in.

231
00:12:37.703 --> 00:12:39.603
All right!

232
00:12:39.603 --> 00:12:42.303
Hey! Running is dangerous!

233
00:12:48.003 --> 00:12:50.103
It's been three days since I last took a bath.

234
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:54.303
Wash your body clean before going into the tub.

235
00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:55.403
Understood.

236
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:02.703
The clothes of that old man is nowhere in sight.

237
00:13:17.003 --> 00:13:18.303
What's the matter, Ayumi?

238
00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:21.703
Don't tell me that something happened inside?

239
00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:23.203
Not you guys!

240
00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:24.203
What?

241
00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:26.903
What?

242
00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:28.803
Why...

243
00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:32.203
is that old man in the women's bath?

244
00:13:32.203 --> 00:13:33.803
Is it an accident?

245
00:13:33.803 --> 00:13:37.203
No. This is homicide.

246
00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:39.503
Moreover...

247
00:13:39.503 --> 00:13:41.003
A locked room murder!

248
00:13:51.108 --> 00:13:52.508
Is something wrong?

249
00:13:52.508 --> 00:13:54.008
How should I know.

250
00:13:54.008 --> 00:13:57.008
I came to take a bath at this open-air stall on the lake,

251
00:13:57.008 --> 00:13:59.408
but those children won't let me through.

252
00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:02.408
That's because we were told not to let anyone through.

253
00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.808
By Conan.

254
00:14:04.808 --> 00:14:08.508
Hey, is he dead?

255
00:14:08.508 --> 00:14:10.108
Yes.

256
00:14:10.108 --> 00:14:11.308
He's not breathing.

257
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.308
No way.

258
00:14:13.308 --> 00:14:16.508
You called the police, didn't you?

259
00:14:16.508 --> 00:14:17.508
Yes.

260
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.908
Mr. Tetsuyama.

261
00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:23.508
Why is he...

262
00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:25.308
-Mr. Tetsuyama! -Don't touch!

263
00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:27.308
Mr. Tetsuyama!

264
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:31.308
The cause of death is acute subdural hematoma

265
00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:33.108
due to a violent blow on the back of the head

266
00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:35.208
in addition to cerebral contusion.

267
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.608
The estimated time of death

268
00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:38.408
is around 5 am this morning.

269
00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:41.608
The lather on the sole of the victim's feet

270
00:14:41.608 --> 00:14:45.108
and the residue of lather on the tile at his feet.

271
00:14:45.108 --> 00:14:47.608
In addition, judging from the bar of soap

272
00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:50.908
on the other side of his feet.

273
00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:52.208
It seems to have flown there...

274
00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:53.308
He seems to have accidentally stepped

275
00:14:53.308 --> 00:14:55.108
on it when coming out of the tub,

276
00:14:55.108 --> 00:14:56.608
slipped and fell.

277
00:14:56.608 --> 00:15:00.108
Then hit his head on the rocks around the tub.

278
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.008
I guess it's safe to say that this is an accidental death.

279
00:15:03.008 --> 00:15:05.408
But, isn't it strange?

280
00:15:05.408 --> 00:15:07.208
This is the women's bath, you know?

281
00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:09.708
This brat again.

282
00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.508
I thought it strange too, but...

283
00:15:12.508 --> 00:15:14.808
This old man headed for the open-air bath

284
00:15:14.808 --> 00:15:16.808
at a little after 4:30 am,

285
00:15:16.808 --> 00:15:18.708
and the surroundings was still dark,

286
00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:21.608
so he just probably just mistook the women's bath for the men's.

287
00:15:21.608 --> 00:15:26.308
We came here after this old man came here too

288
00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:28.808
but we could clearly read the character

289
00:15:28.808 --> 00:15:31.208
on the curtain as being women or men.

290
00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.108
Then, you met them too, didn't you?

291
00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:36.108
The two employees who were at the entrance

292
00:15:36.108 --> 00:15:38.708
going from the main building to the wharf.

293
00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:40.908
Those two said that the only one

294
00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:42.408
who passed the entrance

295
00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:45.208
before you children came was

296
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.008
this old man.

297
00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:50.808
If you're the ones who came after the old man,

298
00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:52.208
and found his dead body,

299
00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:54.508
what else could it be but an accident?

300
00:15:54.508 --> 00:15:56.508
But, take a look

301
00:15:56.508 --> 00:15:59.708
at the collarbone of the old man.

302
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:01.308
There's a pool of water there.

303
00:16:02.808 --> 00:16:04.708
See, by his belly button too

304
00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:06.108
Right.

305
00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:09.708
If he fell hard enough to die from hitting his head,

306
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.308
then any water that was left

307
00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:12.808
on his body would've flown off, right?

308
00:16:12.808 --> 00:16:14.308
True.

309
00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.508
Maybe after the old man fell down somebody

310
00:16:17.508 --> 00:16:21.508
splashed water on him and tried to wash something off.

311
00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:24.408
Wash off... what?

312
00:16:25.508 --> 00:16:27.708
I see, blood!

313
00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:30.108
The unnatural spray of blood that splattered on his shoulders and back,

314
00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:31.808
when he was initially struck.

315
00:16:31.808 --> 00:16:33.008
After hitting his head against the rock

316
00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:34.708
by the spa in order to finish him off,

317
00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:36.208
the killer washed the blood off

318
00:16:36.208 --> 00:16:40.208
to make it look like an accident.

319
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.808
Hey, hold it!

320
00:16:41.808 --> 00:16:43.808
When you found the body,

321
00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:46.308
there was no one else here except for you,

322
00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:48.208
kids, was there?

323
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:49.208
No.

324
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.008
I didn't hear a loud sound like somebody

325
00:16:51.008 --> 00:16:53.508
jumped into the lake either.

326
00:16:53.508 --> 00:16:58.208
Which means that this outdoor spa on the lake...

327
00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:00.408
is completely sealed off!

328
00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:04.408
An impossible crime, right?

329
00:17:04.408 --> 00:17:06.908
That's why we have to solve that mystery first.

330
00:17:06.908 --> 00:17:09.308
Yeah, that's right.

331
00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:10.408
Hey!

332
00:17:10.408 --> 00:17:13.408
Don't spout off pretending to be a police detective, you brat!

333
00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:16.608
Hey! Call the forensics back here!

334
00:17:16.608 --> 00:17:19.108
We're going to thoroughly re-investigate this case again!

335
00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:20.508
Yes, sir!

336
00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:22.108
That hurt.

337
00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.808
And, Conan...

338
00:17:24.808 --> 00:17:26.108
How was it?

339
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:27.808
You saw, didn't you?

340
00:17:27.808 --> 00:17:29.008
See what?

341
00:17:29.008 --> 00:17:32.108
You know... "that", "that".

342
00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:34.508
Ayumi screamed really loud, right?

343
00:17:34.508 --> 00:17:35.908
Yeah, I saw.

344
00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:37.008
I thought so...

345
00:17:37.008 --> 00:17:38.208
You saw?

346
00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:39.908
Yeah, I sure did.

347
00:17:39.908 --> 00:17:41.408
It's natural because after all,

348
00:17:41.408 --> 00:17:42.708
everybody comes here to take a bath.

349
00:17:42.708 --> 00:17:45.208
Totally naked and exposed.

350
00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:47.408
Naked and...

351
00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:48.708
Exposed?

352
00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:50.008
How dare you!

353
00:17:50.008 --> 00:17:52.308
Conan, you dumb, dumb!

354
00:17:52.308 --> 00:17:53.408
What?

355
00:17:53.408 --> 00:17:55.208
You guys saw too, didn't you?

356
00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:56.508
The dead body of the old man.

357
00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.808
What?

358
00:17:57.808 --> 00:17:59.408
Just what are you guys talking about?

359
00:17:59.408 --> 00:18:02.308
So... if it's the dead body of that old man,

360
00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:04.208
we saw him too.

361
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.708
Just a little bit after the police came.

362
00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:11.208
No way. You guys didn't come inside.

363
00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:12.808
We saw from outside!

364
00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:14.708
What?

365
00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:18.408
You see, we went pass this corridor

366
00:18:18.408 --> 00:18:21.408
and slipped by beside the outdoor ventilator of the ventilation fan

367
00:18:21.408 --> 00:18:24.508
then climbed over this fence.

368
00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:26.608
See, you can see, can't you?

369
00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:33.108
Hey, you brats, where the heck did you...

370
00:18:33.108 --> 00:18:36.408
The veranda here is connected to the corridor outside.

371
00:18:38.008 --> 00:18:39.008
What?

372
00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:40.508
Moreover, taking into consideration

373
00:18:40.508 --> 00:18:42.908
this glass window has no lock.

374
00:18:42.908 --> 00:18:44.308
I see.

375
00:18:44.308 --> 00:18:46.508
If the culprit hid in a blind spot of the corridor

376
00:18:46.508 --> 00:18:51.308
before the outdoor spa closed the night before at 11 pm,

377
00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:54.608
after he killed the old man who came along early in the morning,

378
00:18:54.608 --> 00:18:56.708
he could've gone through the corridor

379
00:18:56.708 --> 00:19:00.408
from the veranda and mingled within the crowd

380
00:19:00.408 --> 00:19:01.708
that couldn't make it inside.

381
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.108
That's right.

382
00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:06.008
Why not start by picking out guests

383
00:19:06.008 --> 00:19:08.808
who came here to the outdoor spa on the lake alone,

384
00:19:08.808 --> 00:19:11.808
without telling anyone?

385
00:19:11.808 --> 00:19:14.308
The killer could be among those guests.

386
00:19:14.308 --> 00:19:16.108
Yes.

387
00:19:18.108 --> 00:19:24.608
So, the ones who came to this outdoor spa alone without telling anyone

388
00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:26.608
turned out to be only you three,

389
00:19:26.608 --> 00:19:31.108
who happened to be connected with the late Mr. Ganji Tetsuyama.

390
00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:34.708
Well, the rest of the guests were mostly family

391
00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:38.208
and the only ones who stayed over alone

392
00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.108
were Mr. Tetsuyama and you people.

393
00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:43.008
While taking out your personal belongings

394
00:19:43.008 --> 00:19:45.608
tell me where and what you were doing at around 5 am,

395
00:19:45.608 --> 00:19:48.908
the estimated time of his death?

396
00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:51.308
Let's start with the heroine of the movie

397
00:19:51.308 --> 00:19:53.908
that Mr. Tetsuyama wrote the script for,

398
00:19:53.908 --> 00:19:56.408
Ms. Mishio Natori.

399
00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:58.408
I don't know what you're trying to get at

400
00:19:58.408 --> 00:20:00.008
but the only things I have with me

401
00:20:00.008 --> 00:20:03.308
is this pouch with make-up inside and a towel.

402
00:20:03.308 --> 00:20:05.708
My room key is at the front desk.

403
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:08.208
I was told to leave it with the front desk

404
00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.208
before going to the outdoor spa.

405
00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:13.408
I just got up at about 5 am.

406
00:20:13.408 --> 00:20:15.708
And I came here at about 5 am

407
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.008
because I was told that I could take a bath

408
00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.108
while watching the sunrise.

409
00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:22.408
I like hot springs.

410
00:20:22.408 --> 00:20:25.108
And, your relationship with Mr. Tetsuyama,

411
00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:28.408
was it just one between a scriptwriter and an actress?

412
00:20:28.408 --> 00:20:30.808
-Yes. -Don't lie.

413
00:20:30.808 --> 00:20:35.208
It seemed Mr. Tetsuyama was making passes at you.

414
00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:37.008
There's rumor going around

415
00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:41.008
that you got the heroine part this time by becoming the great his lover.

416
00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:44.208
What? I got the part because of my acting expertise!

417
00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:47.008
I'm not you, who had to beg for a role

418
00:20:47.008 --> 00:20:49.408
to get to become a candidate for the starring role.

419
00:20:49.408 --> 00:20:53.208
Candidate? It's been decided that I play the leading part!

420
00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:57.908
And? Lead actor, where and what were you doing at around 5 am?

421
00:20:57.908 --> 00:21:00.208
I was sleeping at that time.

422
00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:03.908
I came here to take a bath at a little before 6 am.

423
00:21:03.908 --> 00:21:05.808
The only things I have on me are a towel,

424
00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:08.508
cigarettes and my room key.

425
00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:11.608
Didn't you leave your room key at the front desk?

426
00:21:11.608 --> 00:21:13.608
Too much hassle.

427
00:21:13.608 --> 00:21:14.908
I also brought my key along with me

428
00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:17.208
instead of leaving it at the front desk.

429
00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:18.908
Because I just went to look for her,

430
00:21:18.908 --> 00:21:21.808
since she didn't return to her room for quite some time.

431
00:21:21.808 --> 00:21:26.308
So, all I have with me are my room key, wallet and cell phone.

432
00:21:26.308 --> 00:21:29.508
At around 5 am I was watching TV in my room.

433
00:21:29.508 --> 00:21:32.208
Watching TV at 5 am. You're an early riser.

434
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.508
Yes.

435
00:21:33.508 --> 00:21:35.708
I was actually up at about a little pass 4 am.

436
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:37.008
And I went to the front desk around 4:30 am

437
00:21:37.008 --> 00:21:39.008
to get some loose change.

438
00:21:39.008 --> 00:21:42.508
Did you need the loose change to buy canned coffee?

439
00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:46.008
You're an early bird, aren't you?

440
00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:48.008
It' still 4:30 am.

441
00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:49.608
Bug you, brat.

442
00:21:51.308 --> 00:21:54.208
I saw you at around 4:30 am in front of the vending machine, right?

443
00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:55.708
Yes.

444
00:21:55.708 --> 00:21:58.708
Which means Manager Tanzawa,

445
00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:03.308
you couldn't have hidden yourself here all night to ambush

446
00:22:03.308 --> 00:22:05.108
and murder Mr. Tetsuyama.

447
00:22:05.108 --> 00:22:06.908
Murder...

448
00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:08.608
Wasn't it an accident?

449
00:22:08.608 --> 00:22:10.208
Are you serious?

450
00:22:10.208 --> 00:22:14.508
Yes. Although I can't say for sure yet.

451
00:22:16.008 --> 00:22:18.608
The killer is among the three.

452
00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:26.108
The one who killed Mr. Tetsuyama.

453
00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:49.808
If so, the culprit is...

454
00:23:49.808 --> 00:23:51.708
the woman right here!

455
00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:55.608
The culprit got too absorbed in his role,

456
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:57.508
and forgot completely

457
00:23:57.508 --> 00:24:00.208
that he had hidden the conclusive evidence

458
00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:03.408
inside his own pocket.

459
00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:06.808
The killer is here...

460
00:24:06.808 --> 00:24:09.108
right in front of my eyes.

461
00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:13.008
Next Conan,

462
00:24:13.008 --> 00:24:16.908
"Yukemuri Locked Room Scenario (Part 2)"

463
00:24:17.835 --> 00:24:20.135
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:20.135 --> 00:24:21.835
"Ring".

465
00:24:21.835 --> 00:24:24.035
Look after your rear end next week.

466
00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:25.135
Just what do you mean?
