1
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.840
I've gathered everyone together, just like you asked.

2
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.240
This is the perfect place, too.

3
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.340
I manage this property now.

4
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.640
It used to be some kind of research facility.

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.640
No matter how loudly we shout here, no one will hear us.

6
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.540
"Toichiro Azuma (44)" -So, have you figured out who tried to kill me?

7
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.440
Which one of these three is it?

8
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.740
Of course I know who tried to kill you, Mr. Azuma.

9
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.040
There's no mystery Kogoro Mouri cannot solve.

10
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.440
All truths will be revealed!

11
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.740
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

12
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.840
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

13
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140
Thanks to our viewers, we've reached 900 episodes!

14
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.640
The old man's a little different today.

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.840
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.939
"Solving Mysteries in a Locked Room"

19
00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:20.239
Mr. Azuma came to my office yesterday evening

20
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.539
and said someone was trying to kill him.

21
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.539
A threatening phone call?

22
00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.639
Yeah. They said they'd kill me.

23
00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.339
I'm sure they were just trying to intimidate me, though.

24
00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:39.639
But, sir, there's a chance they were serious.

25
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.039
As you can see, Kasai's worried about it,

26
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.539
so I thought I'd ask you to determine who called me.

27
00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.139
"Haruhiko Kasai (32)" -I believe it's one of these three.

28
00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.139
We think they may resent the president.

29
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.239
I see. You have a list of suspects.

30
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.639
Could you fill this out, please?

31
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.939
Now that The Great Detective Mouri has taken our case,

32
00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.239
it's as good as solved.

33
00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.039
I hope you're right.

34
00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.439
The next day, or in other words, today,

35
00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.939
I decided to begin my investigation.

36
00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.939
Mr. Azuma has been pressuring me

37
00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.039
"Benkichi Yamanami (52), Office Worker" -to sell this property.

38
00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.639
My wife who was against it died in an accident the other day,

39
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.939
so I've decided to let it go.

40
00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.239
But I realized something.

41
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.439
Mr. Azuma may have killed my wife.

42
00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.239
What? So you stabbed him?

43
00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:53.539
I told you, that wasn't me.

44
00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.839
"Fukunishi Auto Repair, Inspections"

45
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.539
I didn't do it,

46
00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.539
but I understand how they feel.

47
00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.639
"Mitsuru Kitao (26)" -That Azuma jerk stole the land my dad left for me.

48
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.539
Him, too.

49
00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.739
What's going on here?

50
00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:15.739
Is it possible your father sold the property to Mr. Azuma?

51
00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:18.939
Then where did the money from the sale go?

52
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:22.839
I see.

53
00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.539
But, Ms. Tomurai,

54
00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.439
it's true that you resent Mr. Azuma, isn't it?

55
00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.639
Yes.

56
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.739
"Kana Tomurai (30), Waitress" -My father killed himself

57
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:33.439
after Azuma tricked him out of the property

58
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.339
that had been in our family for generations.

59
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:41.039
Murderers always get their comeuppance eventually.

60
00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.439
It's true that all three of you are suspicious

61
00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.439
but there's no damning evidence.

62
00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.939
That's when the threat was turned into reality.

63
00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.239
"Toto General Hospital"

64
00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:57.139
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.839
It's because I left your side.

66
00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.639
It's not your fault.

67
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.139
But...

68
00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.339
It happened when I sent Kasai shopping.

69
00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.439
It's like they were waiting for me to be alone.

70
00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.239
It was someone wearing a ski mask.

71
00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.239
What did the police say?

72
00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:24.439
I haven't told the police.

73
00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.539
What?

74
00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.139
I don't want to get the police involved.

75
00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.339
I conduct a lot of shady business.

76
00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.739
But this is attempted murder!

77
00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:38.739
Are you saying you can't solve the case without the police,

78
00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:40.239
you incompetent detective?

79
00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.039
Hurry up and figure out which of the three of them did it!

80
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.039
If I pay them enough, I'm sure they'll stop.

81
00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.739
I went to the place where Mr. Azuma was attacked.

82
00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.739
"Repairs in progress"

83
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:56.439
The security camera in the parking lot was undergoing repairs,

84
00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.939
so I couldn't review the moment of the crime.

85
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.539
Darn it! I know it was one of you!

86
00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.539
Confess already!

87
00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:07.939
Now...

88
00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:10.639
Later I went to your office

89
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:14.739
and spoke with a clerk named Ms. Suematsu.

90
00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:17.239
"Sueko Suematsu (21)" -But Mr. Mouri didn't ask me

91
00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:19.639
about those three.

92
00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.339
They don't have any problems.

93
00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.539
They're very close

94
00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:29.239
and always whispering secrets to each other.

95
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.239
That made me realize their motive.

96
00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:39.139
Mr. Kasai, it seems you've committed

97
00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.039
a lot of crimes as Mr. Azuma's right hand man.

98
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:45.739
You can't conduct business without getting your hands dirty.

99
00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:48.139
But the situation changed.

100
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.039
Your beloved sister

101
00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:54.039
was unofficially offered a job at a first-class bank.

102
00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:58.239
I thought we were just making small talk.

103
00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:00.839
If your crimes came to light,

104
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:05.339
your sister would lose the offer.

105
00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.539
Fearing that, you tried to kill Mr. Azuma, who knew your secret.

106
00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:11.739
-I... -It was you?

107
00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:12.939
No way!

108
00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:15.639
You did this?

109
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:18.439
Darn it! Because of you...

110
00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:20.439
No! It wasn't me!

111
00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.139
You were captured on the security camera's footage.

112
00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:25.139
But you just said

113
00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.239
you couldn't review it because it was undergoing repairs.

114
00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:31.639
The parking lot camera was.

115
00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:36.039
Later I went to a nearby convenience store

116
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.139
to check their camera.

117
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.939
This is Mr. Kasai.

118
00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.839
He's buying the things Mr. Azuma asked him to get.

119
00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:49.539
What's this?

120
00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.239
A ski mask...

121
00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:58.939
Then what about these guys?

122
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:06.939
The three of them had nothing to do with this case...

123
00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:11.039
This is it! The so-called...

124
00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:13.439
Sleeping Kogoro.

125
00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:16.339
Mr. Azuma was attacked by Mr. Kasai,

126
00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.339
but there was someone who ordered him to do it.

127
00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.539
What do you mean?

128
00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:32.639
If Mr. Kasai had always planned to killed Mr. Azuma,

129
00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:36.639
he would've killed him in secret instead of threatening him.

130
00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:39.639
He had plenty of chances.

131
00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:43.939
In other words, Mr. Kasai isn't the one who made the threat.

132
00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:48.239
But since Mr. Kasai attempted to kill Mr. Azuma, it's natural to assume

133
00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:50.039
he didn't choose to do it,

134
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:53.239
but was ordered to do it by someone else.

135
00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:55.339
When you consider Mr. Kasai recommended

136
00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:58.639
hiring me to investigate the case,

137
00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.939
he must have received the order after that.

138
00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:04.439
Perhaps Mr. Kasai was threatened late last night,

139
00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:08.039
"I'll expose all the crimes you've committed."

140
00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:11.039
"Your beloved sister will go down with you."

141
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:16.239
"If you want to protect your sister, kill Mr. Azuma."

142
00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:22.539
Isn't that right, Benkichi Yamanami?

143
00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:25.939
When I went to question you,

144
00:10:25.939 --> 00:10:29.439
you had an expensive ballpoint pen.

145
00:10:29.439 --> 00:10:33.139
It belonged to Mr. Kasai.

146
00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:35.339
When you threatened him last night,

147
00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:38.139
you likely picked it up after Mr. Kasai dropped it.

148
00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:44.439
Surely you don't suspect me because we happen to have the same pen.

149
00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:46.639
This is why I didn't want to do it!

150
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.039
Shut up!

151
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:50.339
In order to keep your hands clean,

152
00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:55.039
you manipulated Mr. Kasai and made the threatening call.

153
00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:01.239
By making the threat, you directed suspicion towards yourselves,

154
00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:05.539
so Mr. Kasai could kill Mr. Azuma during that resulting opportunity.

155
00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:09.939
You saw through my deception, Kogoro Mouri.

156
00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:12.639
All I have now is my last resort!

157
00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:24.939
It was all a lie, Mr. Mouri.

158
00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:26.739
I see.

159
00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:28.639
"Prank Show Successful! Nichiuri TV"

160
00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.539
Our prank show was a huge success!

161
00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:35.439
Our goal this time was for you to find the culprit behind a fake crime.

162
00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:38.439
And see the astonished face you made

163
00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:42.739
when he threatened to blow himself up.

164
00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:45.339
We're all paid actors.

165
00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:48.539
They were all acting according to script.

166
00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:50.639
A prank show?

167
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:53.639
That explains everything.

168
00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:56.239
You're not surprised, Mr. Mouri?

169
00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:59.339
I thought something was up

170
00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:02.439
when Mr. Azuma refused to notify the police.

171
00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.039
Mr. Yamanami and Mr. Kitao's strange behaviors also make sense

172
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:13.439
when you realize they were playing to hidden cameras.

173
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:17.039
Impressive, Mr. Mouri!

174
00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:20.539
We're a small theater troupe.

175
00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:26.639
This job was given to us by Nichiuri TV's Ms. Tomurai.

176
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.339
She's the one who wrote the script.

177
00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:32.739
Normally we do comedies,

178
00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:35.839
so this serious performance was exciting for us.

179
00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:39.939
But since you suspected we were up to something,

180
00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:42.539
you can't call this a huge success.

181
00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:45.239
No, it was.

182
00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:47.139
I hope you're right.

183
00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:50.039
-Now let's get out of here. -It's over.

184
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.839
We're getting grilled meat tonight, right?

185
00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.739
Who is she?

186
00:12:54.739 --> 00:12:57.939
Huh? The door won't open, Ms. Tomurai.

187
00:12:57.939 --> 00:13:02.339
Huh? I can't get the bomb off.

188
00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:04.139
Excuse us, staff?

189
00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.439
Could someone get this off him?

190
00:13:06.439 --> 00:13:08.839
There's no point in calling them.

191
00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:11.939
We're the only ones here.

192
00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:20.039
This is when the real show begins!

193
00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:34.906
The story about filming a prank show was a lie.

194
00:13:34.906 --> 00:13:37.806
We were never filming or recording in the first place.

195
00:13:37.806 --> 00:13:42.106
And naturally, I'm not an employee of Nichiuri TV either.

196
00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:48.106
It's locked.

197
00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:51.606
I can't have you escaping and calling the police.

198
00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:55.206
Darn it. There's no service.

199
00:13:55.206 --> 00:13:56.806
Of course not.

200
00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:59.406
This building blocks phone signals.

201
00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:05.106
I've been searching for the perfect place for two months,

202
00:14:05.106 --> 00:14:07.906
so I could execute this detective.

203
00:14:07.906 --> 00:14:09.406
Execute?

204
00:14:09.406 --> 00:14:12.206
What's wrong with her?

205
00:14:12.206 --> 00:14:14.606
Darn. I won't let her kill him.

206
00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:17.206
Crap! My shoes are out for maintenance!

207
00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:21.906
You just sit there quietly and watch,

208
00:14:21.906 --> 00:14:24.806
if you don't want your friend to blow up.

209
00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:29.906
I installed the same detonator

210
00:14:29.906 --> 00:14:34.306
on the dynamite wrapped around you.

211
00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:37.806
You mean this isn't a prop?

212
00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:40.706
Darn! What should I do?

213
00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:58.306
Please do something, Mr. Mouri!

214
00:14:58.306 --> 00:14:59.706
Save us!

215
00:14:59.706 --> 00:15:01.706
Mr. Mouri...

216
00:15:01.706 --> 00:15:05.006
Move. You'll get caught in the crossfire.

217
00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:13.606
You said you'll execute me,

218
00:15:13.606 --> 00:15:15.806
but what have I ever done to you?

219
00:15:15.806 --> 00:15:17.606
Who are you?

220
00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:21.306
Why don't you guess?

221
00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:24.006
Aren't you the world's greatest detective?

222
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.206
You have a strong grudge against me.

223
00:15:27.206 --> 00:15:30.006
You have a gun and explosives.

224
00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:31.806
You could've surprised me

225
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.006
or thrown a bomb into my office,

226
00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:37.806
but instead you went through the trouble of writing a script

227
00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:40.606
and having me solve a mystery.

228
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:44.406
It was so I'd become the Sleeping Kogoro.

229
00:15:44.406 --> 00:15:47.306
In other words, you don't hate the Ordinary Kogoro.

230
00:15:47.306 --> 00:15:50.806
You hate the Sleeping Kogoro.

231
00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:55.906
And you spent two months preparing.

232
00:15:57.006 --> 00:15:58.206
Two months?

233
00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:03.006
Murderers always get their comeuppance eventually.

234
00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:07.106
Are you Takashi Utsubo's...

235
00:16:07.106 --> 00:16:09.706
Impressive, Sleeping Kogoro.

236
00:16:09.706 --> 00:16:12.406
Of course I swore revenge.

237
00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:15.106
If not for your meddling detective work,

238
00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:17.806
Utsubo wouldn't have gone to jail.

239
00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:20.006
He wouldn't have died!

240
00:16:20.006 --> 00:16:22.906
I see. You're Utsubo's...

241
00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:28.806
Utsubo was a good man.

242
00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:30.806
He was handsome and intelligent.

243
00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:34.806
But he used his intelligence the wrong way.

244
00:16:35.906 --> 00:16:39.706
Six months ago, Utsubo disguised a murder

245
00:16:39.706 --> 00:16:43.306
as a suicide using a clever trick.

246
00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:46.706
I solved the case as the Sleeping Kogoro,

247
00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:49.706
and Utsubo was imprisoned for murder.

248
00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:53.106
"Takashi Utsubo (33), Criminal"

249
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.406
Two months ago,

250
00:16:58.406 --> 00:17:00.606
Utsubo suddenly fell ill.

251
00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:03.606
He died in prison.

252
00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:07.106
You took Utsubo from me forever!

253
00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:09.706
Isn't your anger completely unjustified?

254
00:17:09.706 --> 00:17:11.006
Shut up!

255
00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:14.506
I did suspect something,

256
00:17:14.506 --> 00:17:18.906
but I didn't realize there was another plot behind it.

257
00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:24.106
I had to execute you while you were the Sleeping Kogoro.

258
00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:26.106
I feel a little sorry for you,

259
00:17:26.106 --> 00:17:27.906
but killing a detective

260
00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:32.206
while he's proudly laying out his reasoning

261
00:17:32.206 --> 00:17:34.706
is the ultimate irony.

262
00:17:34.706 --> 00:17:37.906
Watch this, all of you.

263
00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:39.906
I trapped you in here

264
00:17:39.906 --> 00:17:42.406
so you could tell the world

265
00:17:42.406 --> 00:17:46.106
about the great Kogoro Mouri's final moments.

266
00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:48.706
Goodbye, Sleeping Kogoro.

267
00:17:48.706 --> 00:17:51.306
Say hello to Utsubo for me.

268
00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:54.306
Stop!

269
00:17:55.406 --> 00:17:58.406
Don't shoot him!

270
00:17:58.406 --> 00:18:01.406
Please! Don't shoot!

271
00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:05.406
Move! If you get in the way, I'll shoot you too!

272
00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:07.306
You'll shoot a child?

273
00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:12.406
You wouldn't shoot a child, would you?

274
00:18:15.006 --> 00:18:16.406
You're right.

275
00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:20.406
Kid, if you don't move,

276
00:18:20.406 --> 00:18:22.606
I'll blow up that man over there.

277
00:18:24.106 --> 00:18:25.206
But...

278
00:18:26.506 --> 00:18:30.806
I know! Make her laugh.

279
00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:31.806
What?

280
00:18:31.806 --> 00:18:33.606
Once she laughs,

281
00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:37.206
I'm sure she'll feel stupid about trying to get revenge.

282
00:18:39.006 --> 00:18:42.706
In that case, there's that thing for our next performance.

283
00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:45.406
That's hilarious. All right.

284
00:18:50.106 --> 00:18:51.706
You're wasting time.

285
00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:56.106
I don't have time for your stupid acts.

286
00:18:57.806 --> 00:18:59.006
It didn't work.

287
00:19:02.106 --> 00:19:05.206
Now, move.

288
00:19:05.206 --> 00:19:09.206
No matter how much you stall, I won't give up.

289
00:19:09.206 --> 00:19:11.106
No one's coming to save you.

290
00:19:11.106 --> 00:19:12.606
A cockroach!

291
00:19:12.606 --> 00:19:14.606
Mouse! Snake!

292
00:19:14.606 --> 00:19:18.006
Centipede! Hornet!

293
00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:20.706
I don't know what to do if Pops dies.

294
00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:23.306
I won't be able to go to school.

295
00:19:23.306 --> 00:19:26.206
I won't be able to eat anymore.

296
00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:31.706
Please don't kill him.

297
00:19:31.706 --> 00:19:35.206
His family will be so sad, too.

298
00:19:36.506 --> 00:19:39.406
Don't you have family, too?

299
00:19:39.406 --> 00:19:41.506
Regain your humanity!

300
00:19:41.506 --> 00:19:43.906
You'll regret shooting him!

301
00:19:43.906 --> 00:19:46.106
It's not too late!

302
00:19:46.106 --> 00:19:50.006
Throw away your gun and detonator, okay?

303
00:19:50.006 --> 00:19:53.706
Please don't kill him.

304
00:19:55.806 --> 00:20:00.406
Please don't kill him.

305
00:20:04.106 --> 00:20:05.906
Please...

306
00:20:05.906 --> 00:20:07.606
Get up.

307
00:20:10.606 --> 00:20:14.306
There's nothing I hate more than sob stories.

308
00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:15.706
It's crude.

309
00:20:21.306 --> 00:20:23.506
That should be enough.

310
00:20:25.206 --> 00:20:26.506
She's going to shoot!

311
00:20:26.506 --> 00:20:30.806
She's going to kill Pops!

312
00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:35.106
Pops! Pops Kogoro!

313
00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:45.206
No, you don't!

314
00:20:51.206 --> 00:20:54.506
You'll never get your way!

315
00:20:55.606 --> 00:20:57.806
You brat!

316
00:21:00.006 --> 00:21:01.406
Move! Let go!

317
00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:03.306
Darn it!

318
00:21:07.906 --> 00:21:09.106
Gosh.

319
00:21:09.106 --> 00:21:12.906
What's everyone screaming about?

320
00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:15.206
What's going on here?

321
00:21:17.706 --> 00:21:20.006
I'm out of time.

322
00:21:20.006 --> 00:21:21.406
Kid.

323
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:26.506
Your protests, jokes, and tears.

324
00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:31.206
You were buying time to fill that bottle with water.

325
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.306
Well, yeah.

326
00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.106
Hey.

327
00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:36.706
What's this talk about buying time?

328
00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:39.006
Well...

329
00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:42.006

We're saving your life, Mr. Mouri!

331
00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:20.506
Hey, we could turn this into a play.

332
00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:23.506
I'm saved.

333
00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:26.106
I'll be the dynamite man.

334
00:23:26.106 --> 00:23:28.406
You never learn.

335
00:23:30.206 --> 00:23:32.406
I want to play the detective.

336
00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:35.106
You wouldn't have to move.

337
00:23:35.106 --> 00:23:37.006

346

I don't like it!
