1
00:00:04.353 --> 00:00:07.253
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:10.193
Today is alibi destruction.

3
00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:11.723
Use someone and you'll pay!

4
00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:14.193
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:16.313
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:18.473
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.441
The Akaoni Fire Festival Murder Case.

8
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:05.051
When are we going
to find any clues

9
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.351
about those men in black?

10
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.681
You said that if I made
old man Mori famous

11
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:16.941
he'd get more clients and then
maybe we'd find out about them...

12
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.901
He got more clients, didn't he?

13
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:24.311
Yeah, but we haven't heard
anything about those guys...

14
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.641
Just be patient.

15
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:31.641
Act hastily and they
might find out about you.

16
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.441
If that happens--

17
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:34.331
I know.

18
00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:38.051
It might put Ran and
the old man in danger!

19
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:40.811
Wait quietly for now.

20
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:44.351
A detective needs
patience too, you know.

21
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.261
Say, what kind
of experiment is that?

22
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.721
Oh, this? It's a--

23
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:02.011
Now do you know what kind?

24
00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:05.951
Yeah. A dangerous one.

25
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.211
What a lousy situation.

26
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:16.041
Huh?

27
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:19.501
It's old man Mori. What's he doing?

28
00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:28.681
Excellent choice, sir.

29
00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:32.141
Could I have your address, sir?

30
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.231
Hey!

31
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:39.401
What are you up to?

32
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.071
Shh! I'm working!

33
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:45.141
Oh, are you following
that guy around?

34
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.141
Hey, now!
What if he notices me?!

35
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:49.811
Get outta here, kid!

36
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:53.311
Go tell Ran I won't
be home for dinner!

37
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.631
Don't mind me!

38
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:03.841
Gimme a break.

39
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:14.771
Akaoni Village Fire Festival
Sunday, November 10th

40
00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:55.431
Talk about an easy job!

41
00:04:55.431 --> 00:04:59.141
Half a million yen just for
watching someone for three days!

42
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.651
Some jobs really
rake in the dough!

43
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:06.571
That's because everyone
admires your great detective work!

44
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:13.031
Even I'm amazed at how
I've solved one case after another!

45
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:16.251
I solved them all.

46
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.141
Come to think of it,
your job's been going well

47
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:21.581
ever since Conan-kun came!

48
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:27.011
Maybe he brought
some good luck with him!

49
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.091
That's silly...

50
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.801
Ran. How long are we gonna
take care of this twerp?

51
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:35.511
Are his parents
still in the hospital?!

52
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:40.261
Actually, when I visited
Professor Agasa yesterday...

53
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:43.811
They did get out of the hospital,

54
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.931
but then they suddenly
got transferred overseas...

55
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.941
They left yesterday!

56
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:51.411
Eh? They just left
Conan-kun behind?!

57
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:56.181
They said they'll send
for him once they settle in.

58
00:05:57.181 --> 00:06:00.351
So we're taking
care of him again?

59
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.311
What was I supposed to say?

60
00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:03.881
He has nowhere else to go...

61
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.491
So basically, you've been abandoned.

62
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:09.141
Whatever.

63
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:13.471
If I ever talk to his parents, I'll have
to charge them for his upbringing...

64
00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:14.511
Hey, now.

65
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.641
At 8:00 pm today,
a man's body was found

66
00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:23.441
under the burning tower
of the Akaoni Fire Festival.

67
00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:25.731
According to his personal effects,

68
00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:28.611
the body was that of
42 year old Negishi Masaki-san.

69
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:30.031
What?!

70
00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:32.811
--are investigating this
as a possible murder--

71
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.781
This is the guy!

72
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:39.261
What is it, Dad?
Did you know him?!

73
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:41.181
Not just that;

74
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.251
I was with him
for three whole days!

75
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.041
Three days?!

76
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:47.211
You can't mean--

77
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:51.471
That's right. He's the guy
I followed around until yesterday...

78
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:54.811
...Negishi Masaki-san!

79
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:04.811
Dad sure is taking a long time
to give his statement.

80
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:06.351
It's to be expected--

81
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.231
he was with the
guy up until yesterday.

82
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:14.071
The police don't get
many witnesses like him!

83
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.371
What kind of case is it?

84
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:21.701
Come on, old man!
I can't wait to find out!

85
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:25.911
Right. Got it.

86
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:27.751
Half a billion yen?!

87
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.851
Yes. The late Negishi-san
had a life insurance policy

88
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.761
worth half a billion yen.

89
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:35.471
Doesn't it seem strange?!

90
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.471
Why would he give
all that insurance money

91
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:43.271
to an ordinary friend like you,
Abe Yutaka-san?!

92
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:49.011
And you're the one
who hired me to trail him!

93
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.111
Why would he give you
the insurance money?!

94
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:54.281
It was a game.

95
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:55.491
What?!

96
00:07:56.141 --> 00:08:00.311
We had been friends
since college.

97
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:03.811
When we went
drinking one day, he--

98
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:07.431
We're not young anymore...

99
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:11.761
Wanna bet on who lives the longest?

100
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:13.461
Sounds interesting!

101
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:19.011
How does half a billion yen sound?

102
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.431
...and I accepted his invitation.

103
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:25.351
So you both took out
500-million yen policies.

104
00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:29.611
I had no idea the bet would
last only three months...

105
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:32.571
Then why did you
have Mori-kun trail him?

106
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:36.471
No big reason, really.

107
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:39.141
He recently told me

108
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:43.041
that he thought someone
was out to kill him.

109
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:44.751
Out to kill him?!

110
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.141
I thought he was joking at first,

111
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:50.641
but he wasn't acting quite normal,

112
00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:54.211
so I had Mori-san
watch him for a few days.

113
00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:56.761
Isn't that right?

114
00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:01.931
Well, I have work to do.

115
00:09:01.931 --> 00:09:05.641
I run a small business,
so I'm actually quite busy.

116
00:09:07.811 --> 00:09:11.811
Please find Negishi-san's
killer as quickly as possible.

117
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.991
I'll contact you the instant we do!

118
00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:21.201
I look forward to it, Detective.

119
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.141
He's the only one
I can see as the killer,

120
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:30.921
but he has an alibi.

121
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.401
An airtight one, at that.

122
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:40.471
Something's fishy!
He's definitely the killer!

123
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:42.471
Half a million yen!

124
00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:45.351
Just to follow a guy for three days!

125
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.141
That's way too much!

126
00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:49.931
And his confident attitude!

127
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:52.311
I'm not too fond of that, either!

128
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:55.011
Then why can't they arrest him?

129
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.311
His alibi is perfect!

130
00:09:57.311 --> 00:10:02.991
And I was the one
who verified it for him!

131
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:10.311
The body was found on Sunday night,
during the Fire Festival.

132
00:10:10.311 --> 00:10:13.641
I was on his tail the entire time

133
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:16.551
until the night before.

134
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:20.311
In other words,
the crime took place

135
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:23.811
between late Saturday
night and Sunday evening,

136
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:25.511
when the flame tower was lit.

137
00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:30.721
Then the person you suspect
must've done it during then...

138
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.511
Nope.

139
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:38.231
He was on a company trip to Kyushu

140
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.901
from Saturday morning
until this afternoon!

141
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:45.431
Then why are
you so fixated on him?

142
00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:49.871
My detective's intuition...

143
00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:51.461
Oh...

144
00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:53.721
His alibi, huh?

145
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:00.801
One Week Later

146
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:01.921
Damn it!

147
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:04.381
What's wrong, Dad?

148
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:08.351
That damn Abe got
Negishi-san's insurance money!

149
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:11.811
He got the half-billion
yen just like that!

150
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:15.471
I'm going to destroy
his alibi, no matter what!

151
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:18.231
What are those?

152
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:22.391
The schedule and
pictures of his Kyushu trip.

153
00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:25.741
I asked Inspector Megure
to let me borrow them.

154
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:28.781
There has to be a clue
in one of these photos.

155
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:32.971
Just you watch!
I, the great Mori Kogoro-sama,

156
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:35.751
will expose his trick!

157
00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:38.341
Dad's on fire!

158
00:11:39.101 --> 00:11:41.051
Let's just hope
he doesn't burn out.

159
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:46.761
But Dad, couldn't he have come back
on short notice on a domestic flight?

160
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:51.271
Yes, it's very possible.
But his alibi has no holes.

161
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:57.851
Especially during the
time the murder occurred.

162
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.811
He played mahjong with his
employees all Saturday night.

163
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.641
Sunday afternoon,
he toured the city on bus.

164
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:05.761
He has pictures to prove it, too.

165
00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.451
These photos!

166
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:14.971
The only time he was alone was when
he took a two hour nap Sunday afternoon.

167
00:12:14.971 --> 00:12:20.311
It would be impossible to go to
Gunma and back in that amount of time.

168
00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.101
What's so funny?

169
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:26.011
These photos are weird!

170
00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:27.181
Weird?

171
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.301
See, look!

172
00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:33.111
He's by a clock in every one!

173
00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:34.391
Now that you mention it...

174
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:37.101
He must really like clocks!

175
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:38.971
That's not normal.

176
00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:43.181
It's almost like he took
these to prove his alibi.

177
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:45.601
And the kid's right--

178
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:46.781
Wait a minute.

179
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:51.351
It seems like whenever
I'm stuck on something,

180
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:54.201
he'll say something
that gives me a hint...

181
00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:00.581
What's in this envelope?

182
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:02.041
Oh, those are--

183
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:05.211
--from when I followed the guy--

184
00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:06.721
Uh oh! They're mixed up!

185
00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:10.931
who got killed!

186
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:12.551
Dad!

187
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:16.261
Are you alright, Conan-kun?

188
00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.731
Did he give you a boo-boo?

189
00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:20.521
Gimme a break.

190
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.731
Guess he is just a stupid kid.

191
00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:32.261
Say, are you sure this
is the guy who was killed?

192
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:33.491
His body was all burned up...

193
00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.311
Yeah, it was definitely him.

194
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.291
His driver's license
was lying right next

195
00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:42.461
to the flame tower at the fire festival.

196
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:47.201
The teeth even
matched his dental records.

197
00:13:48.681 --> 00:13:49.811
That's strange.

198
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:52.801
Criminals normally hide their crimes;

199
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:56.431
it's far too intentional for the
body to be hidden under the fire

200
00:13:56.971 --> 00:14:02.061
and an easily-understood
clue to be lying nearby!

201
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:06.011
Only one person stood to
gain from the body's discovery:

202
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.351
Abe, who would get
the insurance money.

203
00:14:09.351 --> 00:14:12.321
The old man's right--
he's the only possible person!

204
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.911
But he has an airtight alibi!

205
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:21.851
No, there has to be something
that will destroy his story!

206
00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:30.056
T-This is it!

207
00:14:40.738 --> 00:14:41.818
This photograph!

208
00:14:44.198 --> 00:14:47.698
That's strange.
The Negishi-san I saw...

209
00:14:48.528 --> 00:14:49.748
...was right-handed!

210
00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:52.578
Could it be?!

211
00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:57.458
Conan-kun?

212
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:02.718
Just as I thought!

213
00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:05.388
These are from
Thursday and Friday.

214
00:15:06.028 --> 00:15:08.138
And these are from Saturday!

215
00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:12.068
The old man followed Negishi-san

216
00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:14.318
from Thursday to Saturday.

217
00:15:14.318 --> 00:15:18.148
His body was found on Sunday night,

218
00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:23.278
so the murder took place between
Saturday night and Sunday evening.

219
00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:25.778
But Abe Yutaka was in Kyushu

220
00:15:25.778 --> 00:15:30.698
from Saturday morning
until Monday afternoon.

221
00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.748
His alibi is flawless!

222
00:15:33.148 --> 00:15:37.028
But if my theory is correct,
then it's actually--

223
00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:42.668
Mind your own business, twerp!

224
00:15:43.488 --> 00:15:46.488
Look away for a second
and he causes trouble!

225
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:50.848
Don't hit Conan-kun just
because you can't solve the case!

226
00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:53.738
Abe Yutaka is
clearly responsible for this!

227
00:15:53.738 --> 00:15:55.268
He even has a motive!

228
00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:56.768
Motive?

229
00:15:57.358 --> 00:16:00.898
His business was
300 million yen in debt.

230
00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:05.398
He used the insurance
money to pay it off

231
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:09.698
and plans to escape
overseas with the rest of it!

232
00:16:09.698 --> 00:16:11.028
Overseas?!

233
00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:15.248
He left someone in charge of the company,
saying that he was going on a trip.

234
00:16:15.528 --> 00:16:19.458
And his plane
leaves at 9:00 tonight!

235
00:16:19.858 --> 00:16:23.458
9:00?! That leaves
us only three hours!

236
00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.168
We can't let him leave the country!

237
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.138
My only chance now is to corner
him and make him confess!

238
00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:36.068
There's no time! First, I need
to get them to the airport!

239
00:16:36.068 --> 00:16:38.808
Alright! I'll use that method!

240
00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:45.068
Eh? You destroyed
Abe's alibi, Inspector?!

241
00:16:45.068 --> 00:16:47.738
Yes. I'm on my way to the airport.

242
00:16:48.568 --> 00:16:52.198
I'd like you to come too!

243
00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:55.408
Excellent! I'll see you there!

244
00:16:57.238 --> 00:17:00.628
Alright, now to use
the old man's voice...

245
00:17:04.818 --> 00:17:08.988
Hello, Inspector Megure!
This is Mori Kogoro!

246
00:17:09.488 --> 00:17:12.138
New Tokyo International Airport

247
00:17:12.528 --> 00:17:15.558
Listen! Don't get in my way!

248
00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:17.078
We won't!

249
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.768
You come every single time!

250
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:23.488
It sure is crowded.

251
00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:26.228
Just finding the Inspector
is going to be tough...

252
00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:29.258
Which flight is Abe's?

253
00:17:29.258 --> 00:17:30.988
I think it was--

254
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:35.358
Oh no! They're about
to start boarding!

255
00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:38.908
It's dangerous,
but I'll have to lure him out!

256
00:17:42.108 --> 00:17:48.648
Paging Abe Yutaka-sama,
bound for Seattle

257
00:17:48.648 --> 00:17:50.858
on Flight Number 99...

258
00:17:50.858 --> 00:17:55.508
...Negishi Masaki-sama is waiting
for you in the main parking lot.

259
00:17:56.148 --> 00:18:00.558
Again, Abe Yutaka-sama,
bound for Seattle

260
00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:03.198
on Flight Number 99--

261
00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.858
What's going on, Dad?!

262
00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:07.818
Hey!

263
00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:09.898
Inspector Megure!

264
00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:12.148
Sorry I'm late!

265
00:18:12.148 --> 00:18:17.868
Never mind that! How did you
destroy Abe's alibi?!

266
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:21.208
You said you found out how.

267
00:18:22.358 --> 00:18:24.668
Huh? Where did Conan-kun go?

268
00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.298
That was clever of you, Mister.

269
00:18:32.298 --> 00:18:33.948
Who's there?!

270
00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:38.598
Negishi-san actually died
Friday night, didn't he?

271
00:18:38.598 --> 00:18:42.848
That's right. The day before
you left on your trip.

272
00:18:43.318 --> 00:18:48.898
Then you had Detective Mori follow a
fake Negishi-san around the following day...

273
00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:50.738
Where are you?!

274
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:54.108
...to make us think
he was alive until Saturday.

275
00:18:54.528 --> 00:18:59.118
You checked the date of the festival
in advance, and just as you planned,

276
00:18:59.118 --> 00:19:02.198
his body was found
on Sunday night.

277
00:19:02.198 --> 00:19:05.628
With his precise time
of death indeterminable,

278
00:19:05.628 --> 00:19:08.568
Detective Mori's statement put it

279
00:19:08.568 --> 00:19:12.568
between Saturday night
and Sunday evening.

280
00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:13.858
Damn you!

281
00:19:13.858 --> 00:19:17.968
Then you returned Monday afternoon,
as if nothing had happened.

282
00:19:18.528 --> 00:19:20.638
Thus, your alibi was created.

283
00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:23.478
Well? Am I right?

284
00:19:23.478 --> 00:19:25.188
A kid?!

285
00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:29.778
I heard the policemen
talking about the case

286
00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:32.858
and I tried applying
my own kind of logic!

287
00:19:33.818 --> 00:19:36.948
Your mistake was the substitute
you chose for Negishi-san!

288
00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:40.358
You might've fooled the detective,

289
00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:42.778
but there's no fooling the camera!

290
00:19:42.778 --> 00:19:46.668
Your actor was left-handed,
unlike Negishi-san!

291
00:19:47.198 --> 00:19:50.318
Give yourself up. This place
is crawling with police.

292
00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:01.398
Well done, my boy!

293
00:20:01.398 --> 00:20:06.728
I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed
Negishi Masaki's killer.

294
00:20:06.728 --> 00:20:10.688
But I won't be turning myself in.
I'm going to live it up overseas!

295
00:20:11.818 --> 00:20:16.148
Eh? But I'll tell everyone
that you confessed.

296
00:20:17.448 --> 00:20:21.898
Nobody'll believe you, kid.

297
00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:27.198
But they might believe you!

298
00:20:27.198 --> 00:20:30.748
I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed
Negishi Masaki's killer.

299
00:20:33.048 --> 00:20:34.418
You little brat!

300
00:20:34.698 --> 00:20:36.808
You have no idea what it's like

301
00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:40.758
to have your business
on the verge of bankruptcy!

302
00:20:43.148 --> 00:20:45.698
He got what he deserved!

303
00:20:45.698 --> 00:20:51.228
He was stupid enough to take out
such a huge insurance policy!

304
00:20:51.698 --> 00:20:53.688
He had no idea I'd kill him!

305
00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:08.208
And you were stupid
enough to let me kill you, too.

306
00:21:08.858 --> 00:21:11.498
You're the stupid one!

307
00:21:11.948 --> 00:21:14.708
I was gonna let you off
easy if you turned yourself in!

308
00:21:15.068 --> 00:21:16.708
But now you've gone too far!

309
00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:24.218
I'll smash in that
rotten head of yours!

310
00:21:44.328 --> 00:21:45.738
What the heck?!

311
00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:51.238
I, Abe Yutaka, was indeed
Negishi Masaki's killer.

312
00:21:52.528 --> 00:21:55.238
Who on earth did this?!

313
00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:37.188
He's one lousy bastard
to use me like that!

314
00:23:37.738 --> 00:23:41.698
I'm glad they found
the fake Negishi-san too!

315
00:23:41.698 --> 00:23:44.858
Yeah. Apparently Abe asked him
to wander around all day

316
00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:47.158
for no specific reason.

317
00:23:47.648 --> 00:23:52.618
What bothers me is what
Abe said afterwards...

318
00:23:53.238 --> 00:23:56.748
It was the kid! He did this!

319
00:23:57.358 --> 00:23:59.708
The only kid around then was--

320
00:24:02.148 --> 00:24:05.968
Oh yeah, right!

321
00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.898
It ain't easy being a kid.

322
00:24:22.028 --> 00:24:22.788
Water?

323
00:24:30.028 --> 00:24:31.448
Ran!

324
00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:36.118
Looks like these might
be random murders...

325
00:24:36.718 --> 00:24:38.358
On the next Conan--

326
00:24:38.358 --> 00:24:42.168
"The Wealthy Daughter
Murder Case (Part 1)."

327
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.200
Next Conan's Hint:

328
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:01.204
Next Conan's Hint:
Power failure.

329
00:25:01.204 --> 00:25:02.771
Power failure.
