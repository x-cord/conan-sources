1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.140
You're...

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.640
The detective kid.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.940
Shinichi Kudo?

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.540
What? No way!

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.740
What brings you here?

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.140
-Shinichi Kudo? -Shinichi Kudo?

7
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.440
Kudo? You mean that famous high school detective?

8
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.240
What?

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.740
So, he wasn't dead.

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.040
It can't be...

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.140
No way.

12
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.740
I got rid of that kid some time ago.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.540
See. You have nothing to complain about now, do you?

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.940
Hurry and give me the film.

15
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.940
Gin.

16
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.240
Gin killed him with a poison drug.

17
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.440
What is going on?

18
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.240
Hey.

19
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Will you grant me

20
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.640
just one favor?

21
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.940
Detective kid, long time no see!

22
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.640
Sorry for saying this after you've made your grand appearance

23
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.440
but this case has already been solved!

24
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.740
The one who shot Mr. Fukuura

25
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.940
from the top of the mast that you're standing right now

26
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.040
when he was just about to give out the hint to the quiz,

27
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.140
is the one who sneaked out of the cabin, the party hall,

28
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.640
and came out to this dark deck

29
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
as well as the one who was able to place the card of the devil

30
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.140
on the arrow of the bow gun that was fired...

31
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.140
can be none other than

32
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.540
the one who has no alibi at that time

33
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.340
on top of not having the card of the devil on him,

34
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.440
Mummy, who's right here with me!

35
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.940
Where in my deduction am I off track?

36
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.440
Hey! Come on, say something!

37
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.640
Oh, excuse me.

38
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.240
I got a bit of a cold and my throat's...

39
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.940
A cold?

40
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.340
So...

41
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.740
You mentioned his alibi and his card, is that right?

42
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.140
The killer probably

43
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740
pick-pocketed Mummy's card

44
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.840
in order to frame him as the killer.

45
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.440
The killer pick-pocketed?

46
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.740
If you insist that Mummy's not the killer

47
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.540
the only probable deduction is either he dropped it,

48
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.740
or somebody stole it from him!

49
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740
After all, the card is specially made

50
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.140
so that there's only one card for each person!

51
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.340
Yes.

52
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.040
Whether the killer knew was aware of this or not,

53
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.240
he stole it from Mummy,

54
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.840
inside the toilet!

55
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
In the toilet?

56
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.040
Hey, is that right, Mummy?

57
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.740
Beats me.

58
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.440
He, himself says he doesn't know,

59
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.340
so that's out!

60
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.440
Well, it's not surprising that he doesn't remember.

61
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.040
The killer probably

62
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.940
went into the toilet compartment next to the one Mummy went inside

63
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.740
and injected an anesthetic or something with a syringe

64
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.340
from the space of the partition of the toilet.

65
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.640
After Mummy sucked the vapor in and passed out,

66
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.340
the killer probably snuck in from the top part of the partition

67
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.140
and pulled the card out,

68
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.540
taking it from Mummy.

69
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.740
Hey!

70
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.340
Where do you have such evidence!

71
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.940
I have no such evidence.

72
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.640
I just mentioned

73
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.640
the easiest way possible to carry out the murder.

74
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.540
Besides, I believe that the anesthetic and syringe

75
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.740
are already inside the sea.

76
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.540
Just what do you think you're talking about?

77
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.440
Don't tell me you're going to say you don't know who the killer is!

78
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.940
Right?

79
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.540
There is indeed only one person

80
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.840
who could be the killer though.

81
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.440
Detective Mouri.

82
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.840
What?

83
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.040
The one who killed Mr. Fukuura

84
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.640
as well as tried to put the blame on Mummy

85
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.340
is none other than

86
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.940
you!

87
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.240
Werewolf!

88
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.240
What?

89
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.540
Werewolf?

90
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.040
Your head must've dulled from your cold.

91
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.540
We all saw Werewolf come out of the toilet,

92
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.940
as well as just before Mr. Fukuura gave out the quiz!

93
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.940
While on the contrary,

94
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.540
Mummy wasn't seen by anybody!

95
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.140
Just what are you talking about?

96
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.740
When I came out of the toilet,

97
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.840
you were watching me!

98
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240
What?

99
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.040
Are you doubting my memory?

100
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.140
I was here too,

101
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.740
when the quiz was just about to be announced,

102
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.540
right near you!

103
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.740
Hey,

104
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.340
don't tell me that you're going to say that

105
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.740
you weren't the Mummy but the Invisible Man?

106
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.740
Frankenstein has the key that will unravel the mystery.

107
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.240
Why?

108
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.440
Won't you tell us why,

109
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.940
you were acting your role as a monster

110
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.640
even inside the toilet?

111
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.940
As well as what you were surprised at right afterwards.

112
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.040
It's a well-known thing among we horror fans that

113
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.540
if there is anyone within the party grounds that is sending e-mails,

114
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.740
that person is a movie staff that is judging to see

115
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.140
whether they should give us a chance to appear in the movie or not.

116
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.240
That's why I knew right off the bat that he was a staff member.

117
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.740
So, I followed him to sell myself,

118
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.840
and kept acting my role until he came out.

119
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.140
But the one who came out of the toilet that he went in was...

120
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.640
Werewolf?

121
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.540
What? You mean Mummy was Werewolf?

122
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.540
Hey...

123
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.840
Then, don't tell me that...

124
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.940
That's right.

125
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.140
The killer not only wanted to put the blame on Mummy

126
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.940
who was asleep in the toilet,

127
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.240
he also put something else on Mummy

128
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.940
which is his own werewolf's mask!

129
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.040
He probably cracked the mirror in the toilet

130
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.640
to keep Mummy from finding out what happened.

131
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.440
He doesn't have to look into the mirror

132
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.540
to realize that he's not wearing his original mask, does he?

133
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.740
I mean he's wearing something like this!

134
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.940
Since Mummy was originally wrapped up in bandage,

135
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.240
and moreover, if he was put to sleep.

136
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.540
It's no wonder that he didn't realize what had happened.

137
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.740
On top of that, the mask covers and hides everything from neck down,

138
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.840
so even if the color of the necktie changes, it's hard to tell.

139
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.440
Besides, both of them were wearing white gloves

140
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.440
and their outfits are more or less similar.

141
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.040
So I don't think anyone would've suspected anything.

142
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.540
But their physiques are similar

143
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.140
and they hold the same card of the devil,

144
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.740
both of them are reticent,

145
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.240
and they end up in the compartment next to each other.

146
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.040
Doesn't everything fall too much in place?

147
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.240
The only coincidence here is probably the pattern of the card.

148
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.840
The killer was waiting for the right person

149
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.540
to come to the toilet.

150
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.540
There were a lot of passengers who didn't speak a word

151
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.740
because they wanted to sell themselves as monsters.

152
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.240
So, as for piercing the card with the arrow,

153
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.240
the killer probably thought it up right on the spot.

154
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.240
The person that would be suspected as the killer

155
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.740
would be someone that didn't have his card.

156
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.640
He probably made light of it,

157
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.540
thinking that no one would figure out who the real killer was.

158
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.240
But...

159
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.340
when Sonoko called,

160
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.140
Werewolf came out of the toilet!

161
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.440
If he was drugged to sleep,

162
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.940
how come he came out at such great timing?

163
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940
Before he came out of the toilet,

164
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.940
you heard something, didn't you?

165
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.140
Oh, I see!

166
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.140
The howling of the wolf!

167
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.740
It seemed that he was playing the howling using a tape recorder.

168
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.940
If he turned the switch on from the toilet compartment next door.

169
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.640
Mummy would be surprised and wake up!

170
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.840
Yeah.

171
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.740
The speaker was probably attached

172
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.640
behind the mask.

173
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.940
The killer attached a wiretap with the speaker

174
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.540
and put the mask on Mummy so that he would react swiftly

175
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.840
to the voices of the people around him.

176
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.840
Even if someone were to talk to him,

177
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.540
Mummy would think that Werewolf was being talked to

178
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.940
because the howling is heard at close range.

179
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.140
I see.

180
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.340
I thought it was strange because each time he heard howling,

181
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.940
he was looking here and there.

182
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.240
That's how Werewolf gave everyone the impression that

183
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.240
he was at the party hall and created his alibi,

184
00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.540
then he went up on deck

185
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.140
and fired the arrow from the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura

186
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.640
who was on top of the mast!

187
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.040
Then he used the howling to guide him

188
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.040
to where Mummy was among the crowd

189
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.340
and tore off the mask within the crowd

190
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.440
and put it back on himself.

191
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.640
Then he went back inside the crowd of people.

192
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.240
I guess that is how the story goes.

193
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.140
Right, Werewolf?

194
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.740
Am I wrong in any way?

195
00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:47.047
I don't know if you're a high school detective or what

196
00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.947
but you can sure blabber on, can't you?

197
00:10:49.947 --> 00:10:53.947
I put this mask on Mummy, you say?

198
00:10:53.947 --> 00:10:58.347
Do you have proof that I did it, or what?

199
00:10:58.347 --> 00:11:00.847
If it's something that points in the direction that you're the killer,

200
00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:02.947
yes.

201
00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:04.847
I have two!

202
00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:10.047
One of it is this!

203
00:11:10.047 --> 00:11:11.647
The hint of the quiz

204
00:11:11.647 --> 00:11:15.347
about there's a human among the monsters here.

205
00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:18.247
Rooster?

206
00:11:18.247 --> 00:11:20.747
Hey, where'd you get that?

207
00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:23.447
It was tied to a rope here.

208
00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:27.047
I think that Mr. Fukuura with the spotlight on himself

209
00:11:27.047 --> 00:11:29.047
was going to do this!

210
00:11:31.247 --> 00:11:32.847
What?

211
00:11:32.847 --> 00:11:34.447
Suspend it upside down?

212
00:11:34.447 --> 00:11:35.847
Upside down?

213
00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:37.347
The opposite of a rooster is...

214
00:11:37.347 --> 00:11:38.747
"Retsoor"?

215
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:40.347
"Sterroo"?

216
00:11:40.347 --> 00:11:43.647
"Terroos"?

217
00:11:43.647 --> 00:11:46.247
Just what kind of hint is that supposed to be?

218
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.647
"Retsoor"...

219
00:11:48.647 --> 00:11:49.847
I get it.

220
00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:51.047
What?

221
00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:55.147
Roosters are also called cock,

222
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.647
and he's holding it by the tail.

223
00:11:56.647 --> 00:11:58.747
It is said that long ago, all kinds of liquor

224
00:11:58.747 --> 00:12:00.847
were made by stirring them with the tail of the cock.

225
00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:03.047
Therefore, the drinks have been called cocktails since then.

226
00:12:03.047 --> 00:12:05.247
That's the origin of the word cocktail.

227
00:12:05.247 --> 00:12:06.347
What?

228
00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.747
You mean "cocktail" is the hint?

229
00:12:08.747 --> 00:12:10.547
Detective Mouri.

230
00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:12.647
You also drank it too, didn't you?

231
00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:14.747
That cocktail.

232
00:12:14.747 --> 00:12:16.447
I'm a beer drinker!

233
00:12:16.447 --> 00:12:18.247
I would never drink...

234
00:12:21.347 --> 00:12:24.947
Come to think of it, I was looking for Werewolf and...

235
00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:28.947
Hey, boss! What's up?

236
00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:30.247
Bartender.

237
00:12:30.247 --> 00:12:33.247
Can you give me the same thing he's drinking?

238
00:12:33.247 --> 00:12:35.147
I did drink it

239
00:12:35.147 --> 00:12:36.647
now that you mentioned it.

240
00:12:36.647 --> 00:12:38.247
If I remember correctly it was...

241
00:12:38.247 --> 00:12:41.347
A cocktail called Silver Bullet!

242
00:12:41.347 --> 00:12:42.747
We were given instructions

243
00:12:42.747 --> 00:12:45.447
by Mr. Fukuura to drink it at the bar of the party hall!

244
00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:46.747
Which means

245
00:12:46.747 --> 00:12:50.047
you rushed out of the toilet like that back then because...

246
00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:51.347
You fell asleep in the toilet

247
00:12:51.347 --> 00:12:54.347
and still didn't drink the cocktail?

248
00:12:54.347 --> 00:12:56.047
Yes!

249
00:12:56.047 --> 00:12:57.947
That's a coincidence,

250
00:12:57.947 --> 00:12:59.947
because I drank it too.

251
00:12:59.947 --> 00:13:01.347
What?

252
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.647
You didn't!

253
00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:06.047
It was Mummy who you had put your mask over!

254
00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:09.347
It's just as Shinichi had deduced!

255
00:13:12.047 --> 00:13:14.847
Stop putting on airs, brat!

256
00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:17.647
I'm the only Werewolf here!

257
00:13:17.647 --> 00:13:20.447
And Werewolf!

258
00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:23.347
Did you really drink that cocktail?

259
00:13:23.347 --> 00:13:25.747
You, who wanted to sell your act as Werewolf,

260
00:13:25.747 --> 00:13:28.447
and appear in the movie?

261
00:13:28.447 --> 00:13:30.947
Yeah, to pep me up.

262
00:13:30.947 --> 00:13:32.747
Or, are you saying that

263
00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:35.647
Werewolf is not supposed to drink liquor?

264
00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:39.647
You really drank Silver Bullet?

265
00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:40.947
Shut up, persistent brat!

266
00:13:40.947 --> 00:13:42.847
I drank it!

267
00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:44.547
Silver Bullet?

268
00:13:46.747 --> 00:13:48.147
Hey, no way.

269
00:13:48.147 --> 00:13:49.647
Silver Bullet?

270
00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:50.947
Silver Bullet, that's...

271
00:13:50.947 --> 00:13:53.847
-Yeah. -Werewolf would never drink it.

272
00:13:57.747 --> 00:14:02.147
Yes. The name of the cocktail was Silver Bullet.

273
00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:05.647
Just as the name goes, a silver bullet.

274
00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:08.847
It's the only weapon in the movie

275
00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:12.647
that is capable of killing the Werewolf.

276
00:14:17.647 --> 00:14:20.647
It's a thing that any horror fan would know.

277
00:14:20.647 --> 00:14:23.847
And a cocktail with that name

278
00:14:23.847 --> 00:14:26.347
is also used to ward off evil.

279
00:14:26.347 --> 00:14:30.047
Mr. Fukuura probably intended to use this cocktail as a hint

280
00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:32.447
and lure people to the bar

281
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:34.447
then later ask the bartender

282
00:14:34.447 --> 00:14:37.247
who drank what kind of liquor

283
00:14:37.247 --> 00:14:41.947
and have everyone answer that Mummy who ordered Silver Bullet

284
00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:44.647
was the human among the monsters.

285
00:14:44.647 --> 00:14:46.547
Because no monster would go out of their way

286
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:49.447
to order liquor to ward off evil.

287
00:14:49.447 --> 00:14:52.247
Isn't that right, Werewolf?

288
00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:55.147
Well...

289
00:14:55.147 --> 00:14:58.847
Since the bartender heard nothing beforehand from Mr. Fukuura,

290
00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.647
he seems to have served Detective Mouri the same liquor, though.

291
00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:07.347
If Mr. Fukuura was the one who did the makeup for Mummy,

292
00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:08.647
it's most likely that

293
00:15:08.647 --> 00:15:11.747
the answer is under the bandage.

294
00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:13.247
The bull's eye mark

295
00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.147
indicates that you're the answer!

296
00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.347
Excuse me.

297
00:15:21.447 --> 00:15:23.747
Here it is!

298
00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:25.647
It says "human".

299
00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:27.447
"Human"

300
00:15:35.647 --> 00:15:39.247
And? What about the other evidence?

301
00:15:39.247 --> 00:15:41.047
Even a marksman at the bow gun

302
00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:43.947
could never pierce a person with an arrow poked

303
00:15:43.947 --> 00:15:46.247
with a card through it.

304
00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:48.047
Of course, he wouldn't be able to do it

305
00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:50.047
from on top this unstable rope too.

306
00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:52.147
In order to make sure he kills his target,

307
00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:56.547
he needs to climb up here and fire at his target at point blank.

308
00:15:56.547 --> 00:16:01.447
The traces of Werewolf having come up here back then is here.

309
00:16:01.447 --> 00:16:04.047
What?

310
00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.647
The traces of pieces of glass

311
00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:08.247
that are embedded into the soles of your shoes

312
00:16:08.247 --> 00:16:10.347
that you stepped on when you cracked the mirror in the toilet.

313
00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:14.047
If we have the forensic officers match the pieces

314
00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.847
I'm sure they will match completely.

315
00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:19.247
Now, Werewolf,

316
00:16:19.247 --> 00:16:22.847
please show us the soles of your shoes.

317
00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:27.047
And please tell us

318
00:16:27.047 --> 00:16:29.647
why you came all the way up here.

319
00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:35.247
So, please show us then, Werewolf!

320
00:16:35.247 --> 00:16:37.847
Come on and lift your foot.

321
00:16:39.447 --> 00:16:41.747
It's not me!

322
00:16:41.747 --> 00:16:44.247
It... It's not me!

323
00:16:44.247 --> 00:16:46.947
I had no intention of killing him!

324
00:16:46.947 --> 00:16:48.747
That devil is to blame.

325
00:16:48.747 --> 00:16:50.047
What?

326
00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:53.147
It's all that devil's fault!

327
00:16:53.147 --> 00:16:54.847
It's that devil's fault!

328
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.147
The one called Vermouth!

329
00:18:30.247 --> 00:18:32.247
Ms. Jodie!

330
00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:36.447
Dr. Araide, what seems to be the matter?

331
00:18:37.547 --> 00:18:40.047
That's for me to say.

332
00:18:40.047 --> 00:18:42.247
What do you intend to do with her?

333
00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.547
No! No!

334
00:18:43.547 --> 00:18:46.247
We were just taking a drive!

335
00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:48.247
Unlike you,

336
00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:51.047
I've got a lot of time on my hands!

337
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.547
Lot of time?

338
00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:54.647
Dr. Araide, it's almost time

339
00:18:54.647 --> 00:18:57.147
for the trial for the homicide case, isn't it?

340
00:18:57.147 --> 00:19:00.147
You've got to testify as would be expected of a good citizen!

341
00:19:00.147 --> 00:19:01.347
And tell everyone that

342
00:19:01.347 --> 00:19:03.647
the home helper, Hikaru Yasumoto,

343
00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.547
is the one who pulled the trigger

344
00:19:05.547 --> 00:19:07.147
and killed your father

345
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:10.047
which is a hidden fact.

346
00:19:10.047 --> 00:19:12.447
Ms. Hikaru pulled the trigger?

347
00:19:12.447 --> 00:19:14.247
No use playing dumb with me!

348
00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:18.947
Detective Mouri told me the facts about everything!

349
00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:20.947
Just what are you talking about?

350
00:19:20.947 --> 00:19:24.447
The killer of the case back then was my stepmother.

351
00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:27.447
And, besides, he died of electrocution,

352
00:19:27.447 --> 00:19:29.347
not bullet wounds!

353
00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:36.347
Did you say Vermouth?

354
00:19:36.347 --> 00:19:39.347
Are you saying that you killed Mr. Fukuura

355
00:19:39.347 --> 00:19:41.747
because that character called Vermouth asked you to do so?

356
00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.847
Hey!

357
00:19:43.847 --> 00:19:45.547
No.

358
00:19:45.547 --> 00:19:49.147
It's true that I had a grudge against Mr. Fukuura

359
00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:52.547
because he concluded the Unlucky Days series

360
00:19:52.547 --> 00:19:54.947
that I loved more than anything else just like that

361
00:19:54.947 --> 00:19:57.447
and started this kindergarten-style

362
00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.947
Phantom Ship Captain series.

363
00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:05.347
So, I wrote about this on the BBS of a certain Internet site

364
00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.147
saying that I wanted to work off my grudge.

365
00:20:07.147 --> 00:20:11.947
Then, this person called Vermouth contacted me.

366
00:20:11.947 --> 00:20:14.747
She said that she'd tell me how to kill him and prepare the weapons

367
00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:16.947
if I'd like to carry it out.

368
00:20:16.947 --> 00:20:19.547
What do you make of the life of a person,

369
00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:22.647
carrying out murder on a motive like that?

370
00:20:22.647 --> 00:20:26.447
Of course, I refused at first!

371
00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:28.047
But, after that...

372
00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:30.447
pictures of my family and I that were taken secretly,

373
00:20:30.447 --> 00:20:32.847
along with tapes of wire-taped telephone conversations,

374
00:20:32.847 --> 00:20:37.347
as well as documents with my daily actions written to minute detail...

375
00:20:37.347 --> 00:20:40.947
A whole cardboard box was delivered to me!

376
00:20:40.947 --> 00:20:43.547
I was told that if I refused or reported it to the police,

377
00:20:43.547 --> 00:20:46.447
either my family or I would die.

378
00:20:46.447 --> 00:20:49.347
Everything I received implicated this!

379
00:20:53.647 --> 00:20:57.347
His cause of death was electrocution and not by a gun?

380
00:21:03.447 --> 00:21:04.647
What are you getting at?

381
00:21:04.647 --> 00:21:06.747
Sorry.

382
00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:09.347
The trigger I was referring to just now was

383
00:21:09.347 --> 00:21:11.847
the electricity breaker.

384
00:21:13.347 --> 00:21:17.647
The killer is the one who rigged everything to commit the murder

385
00:21:17.647 --> 00:21:19.947
but the one who actually lifted the breaker

386
00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:22.447
and triggered the murder

387
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:26.147
is Hikaru Yasumoto who knew nothing at all.

388
00:21:26.147 --> 00:21:28.547
Therefore, in order not to hurt her feelings,

389
00:21:28.547 --> 00:21:31.047
the killer and the police got together

390
00:21:31.047 --> 00:21:33.947
and made up a fake record of investigation!

391
00:21:33.947 --> 00:21:37.347
It said that the method of killing was something else.

392
00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:41.747
Well, it's only natural that you don't know about this!

393
00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:45.347
Because this wasn't written on the investigation report

394
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:48.947
that you stole from the police.

395
00:21:48.947 --> 00:21:54.647
It was to learn the case and successfully testify in court

396
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.347
and keep existing as Dr. Araide.

397
00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:00.947
Am I wrong?

398
00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:02.847
Who are you?

399
00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:09.047
"A secret makes a woman, a woman".

400
00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:10.447
Do you remember?

401
00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:14.547
These are the final words you left behind with me.

402
00:22:14.547 --> 00:22:16.447
And the words I kept repeating

403
00:22:16.447 --> 00:22:19.347
so I don't forget them.

404
00:22:19.347 --> 00:22:22.847
The words of the one who killed my father.

405
00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:24.147
Isn't that right,

406
00:22:24.147 --> 00:22:25.847
Chris Vineyard?

407
00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:38.147
Rather...

408
00:22:38.147 --> 00:22:39.847
The other name that you go by...

409
00:22:56.347 --> 00:22:57.847
Vermouth!

410
00:23:53.053 --> 00:23:55.053
Who are you?

411
00:24:05.453 --> 00:24:07.653
It's a secret. A secret.

412
00:24:07.653 --> 00:24:10.253
I can't tell you.

413
00:24:10.253 --> 00:24:15.653
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

414
00:24:15.653 --> 00:24:18.053
Daddy's glasses.

415
00:24:18.053 --> 00:24:19.853
I'm sorry.

416
00:24:19.853 --> 00:24:22.253
Daddy. What's the matter?

417
00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:24.653
Is he already asleep?

418
00:24:24.653 --> 00:24:28.953
He promised to read me a story before going to bed and yet...

419
00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:32.453
Then, will you stay by your father until he gets up?

420
00:24:32.453 --> 00:24:33.653
Okay!

421
00:24:43.453 --> 00:24:46.453
Then, you set fire to my house

422
00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:48.853
and burned everything down to ashes.

423
00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:52.453
All of what my father, as an FBI agent,

424
00:24:52.453 --> 00:24:54.953
gathered behind closed doors,

425
00:24:54.953 --> 00:24:57.353
the investigation data on all of you.

426
00:25:02.753 --> 00:25:04.953
But, I was saved

427
00:25:04.953 --> 00:25:06.553
because after that...

428
00:25:06.553 --> 00:25:09.053
I remembered that there was no more orange juice

429
00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:11.653
that father always drinks upon getting up

430
00:25:11.653 --> 00:25:16.153
and since he was lying down from exhaustion from afternoon

431
00:25:16.153 --> 00:25:18.153
taking care of my mother who wasn't feeling well.

432
00:25:18.153 --> 00:25:21.753
I wanted to be of help and went out shopping.

433
00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:25.553
Oh, so you're the little girl I saw back then!

434
00:25:25.553 --> 00:25:27.353
I really went all out looking for you,

435
00:25:27.353 --> 00:25:29.553
because all that was left from the remains

436
00:25:29.553 --> 00:25:31.853
were the bones of your parents.

437
00:25:33.453 --> 00:25:36.453
My father's colleagues protected me.

438
00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:41.053
They applied for the witness protection program for me.

439
00:25:41.053 --> 00:25:44.953
That stupid system of changing the name and address of a witness

440
00:25:44.953 --> 00:25:46.353
whose life is in danger in order to protect that person

441
00:25:46.353 --> 00:25:48.453
under a different identity.

442
00:25:59.653 --> 00:26:02.053
It must've been really restricting, right?

443
00:26:02.053 --> 00:26:05.753
To live away from your hometown, as a different person.

444
00:26:05.753 --> 00:26:07.653
You went through hard times, didn't you?

445
00:26:10.853 --> 00:26:12.253
And?

446
00:26:12.253 --> 00:26:17.253
You took after your father, and came after me?

447
00:26:17.253 --> 00:26:22.053
FBI agent Jodie Starling?

448
00:26:22.053 --> 00:26:25.753
Just as expected of a witch with a thousand faces, Vermouth.

449
00:26:25.753 --> 00:26:27.953
With your ability of disguise, you can sneak in anywhere

450
00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:32.753
and check on things to your heart's content.

451
00:26:32.753 --> 00:26:37.953
I'm amazed that you saw through the disguise of Dr. Araide.

452
00:26:37.953 --> 00:26:39.453
It's obvious.

453
00:26:39.453 --> 00:26:43.853
Despite of not having that bad of an illness,

454
00:26:43.853 --> 00:26:48.153
you keep frequenting Araide Hospital with no makeup.

455
00:26:48.153 --> 00:26:53.153
You were planning to kill him and become him!

456
00:26:53.153 --> 00:26:55.553
Then you mean that...

457
00:26:55.553 --> 00:26:59.553
the time his car passed right before me with his family

458
00:26:59.553 --> 00:27:00.953
and crashed through the guard rail

459
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:03.053
eventually sinking into the sea...

460
00:27:04.953 --> 00:27:07.153
was all set up by you?

461
00:27:07.153 --> 00:27:08.353
Yes!

462
00:27:08.353 --> 00:27:09.453
I made it look as if he died of an accident

463
00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:12.453
before you got to kill him.

464
00:27:12.453 --> 00:27:15.253
Because if the car was left at the bottom of the sea

465
00:27:15.253 --> 00:27:18.453
and if nobody knew that he was dead,

466
00:27:18.453 --> 00:27:20.453
it would make it easier for you to go around

467
00:27:20.453 --> 00:27:22.553
acting as Dr. Araide.

468
00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:23.553
Of course,

469
00:27:23.553 --> 00:27:28.553
the people in the car were my colleagues equipped with air pumps.

470
00:27:28.553 --> 00:27:33.153
The real Dr. Araide is living in peace in a place far away.

471
00:27:33.153 --> 00:27:35.853
Then just as we expected,

472
00:27:35.853 --> 00:27:37.453
you established yourself in Araide Hospital

473
00:27:37.453 --> 00:27:40.453
and began checking on something.

474
00:27:40.453 --> 00:27:41.653
It was obvious what you waiting for

475
00:27:41.653 --> 00:27:47.053
the moment we snuck into your room in that hospital.

476
00:27:47.053 --> 00:27:50.053
A picture was poked all over with darts.

477
00:27:50.053 --> 00:27:54.553
The picture of a girl in her 20's with reddish brown hair.

478
00:27:54.553 --> 00:27:58.453
You were planning to find her and get rid of her!

479
00:27:59.753 --> 00:28:02.453
Now I have a question!

480
00:28:02.453 --> 00:28:06.653
The picture of the woman you were trying to get hold of and kill

481
00:28:06.653 --> 00:28:09.053
and this girl that looks just like her.

482
00:28:09.053 --> 00:28:10.653
Of course the witness protection program

483
00:28:10.653 --> 00:28:12.153
will be applied to her but...

484
00:28:15.153 --> 00:28:17.653
Is she really the woman in the picture?

485
00:28:19.753 --> 00:28:21.153
There's still more!

486
00:28:21.153 --> 00:28:25.253
The two pictures that were below her picture,

487
00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:28.653
with the words Cool Guy and Angel that are written on the pictures.

488
00:28:28.653 --> 00:28:31.053
That boy is unmistakably sharp,

489
00:28:31.053 --> 00:28:35.453
but he's more a "kid" than a "guy," isn't he?

490
00:28:35.453 --> 00:28:39.053
Yes. That boy called Conan.

491
00:28:39.053 --> 00:28:42.853
Until that boy left the girl's side,

492
00:28:42.853 --> 00:28:45.553
you didn't do anything.

493
00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:50.253
Inside the bus that was jacked too.

494
00:28:50.253 --> 00:28:51.953
Please don't!

495
00:28:51.953 --> 00:28:54.553
It's just the mischief of a child, isn't it?

496
00:28:54.553 --> 00:28:57.953
Will tell me why you went all out to protect that boy

497
00:28:57.953 --> 00:29:00.753
to the point of almost risking your own life?

498
00:29:06.753 --> 00:29:09.453
If she didn't come around,

499
00:29:09.453 --> 00:29:12.553
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

500
00:29:12.553 --> 00:29:15.053
So...

501
00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:18.053
Nab that person called Vermouth too!

502
00:29:18.053 --> 00:29:19.153
And?

503
00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:21.453
So that name Vermouth, that sounds like the name of some liquor

504
00:29:21.453 --> 00:29:23.253
is probably a fake name, right?

505
00:29:23.253 --> 00:29:25.153
Do you know the person's identity?

506
00:29:27.153 --> 00:29:28.953
You haven't seen that person yourself, either?

507
00:29:28.953 --> 00:29:30.553
No.

508
00:29:30.553 --> 00:29:32.953
Then, what about the receipts of the things

509
00:29:32.953 --> 00:29:35.753
that you received that she used to blackmail you?

510
00:29:35.753 --> 00:29:38.453
Well...

511
00:29:38.453 --> 00:29:41.253
What? No way!

512
00:29:41.253 --> 00:29:42.853
You threw them away?

513
00:29:46.053 --> 00:29:49.253
The address is probably a phony one too.

514
00:29:49.253 --> 00:29:50.553
I guess for now...

515
00:29:50.553 --> 00:29:54.253
until we arrive at the harbor, we'll have to keep him tied up somewhere.

516
00:29:54.253 --> 00:29:56.853
So now, the case is closed.

517
00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:08.153
Come on.

518
00:30:08.153 --> 00:30:10.053
Will you tell me?

519
00:30:19.053 --> 00:30:20.553
Okay!

520
00:30:20.553 --> 00:30:23.153
I'll tell you.

521
00:30:23.153 --> 00:30:24.753
That's...

522
00:30:34.053 --> 00:30:35.553
Don't move!

523
00:30:42.153 --> 00:30:43.753
Gosh.

524
00:30:43.753 --> 00:30:46.253
What a dangerous thing you have there.

525
00:30:46.253 --> 00:30:50.353
Did you get permission from the police in Japan?

526
00:30:50.353 --> 00:30:52.953
We'll request joint investigation

527
00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:56.653
from the police here after we nab you!

528
00:30:56.653 --> 00:30:59.353
Of course, I'm willing to take full responsibility for this.

529
00:30:59.353 --> 00:31:03.753
But before that I have something I want to ask you!

530
00:31:03.753 --> 00:31:07.153
And what may that be?

531
00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:11.453
Why don't you...

532
00:31:16.453 --> 00:31:18.853
Why don't you age at all?

533
00:31:27.353 --> 00:31:29.953
You caught my attention because of what you said

534
00:31:29.953 --> 00:31:33.953
in front of my mother's coffin.

535
00:31:33.953 --> 00:31:38.353
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

536
00:31:40.653 --> 00:31:42.953
I was really excited and started investigating,

537
00:31:42.953 --> 00:31:44.953
then sure enough, there was a perfect match.

538
00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:47.853
Remember back when you killed my father

539
00:31:47.853 --> 00:31:49.753
making it look like he committed suicide.

540
00:31:49.753 --> 00:31:52.053
You picked up his glasses trying to replace it

541
00:31:52.053 --> 00:31:55.453
because of the way it lay unnaturally on the floor.

542
00:31:55.453 --> 00:31:58.153
The fingerprints that were on the lens of the glasses

543
00:31:58.153 --> 00:32:01.853
and yours matched perfectly!

544
00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:03.853
But, I had my doubts.

545
00:32:03.853 --> 00:32:06.753
You were too young to be a suspect of an incident

546
00:32:06.753 --> 00:32:08.653
that had happened 20 years ago.

547
00:32:08.653 --> 00:32:10.453
I didn't think it possible at first,

548
00:32:10.453 --> 00:32:13.453
but when I matched your prints with a certain person's,

549
00:32:13.453 --> 00:32:17.253
I got results that made a shiver go up my spine.

550
00:32:17.253 --> 00:32:22.353
You're the one and the same as your mother, Sharon Vineyard!

551
00:32:22.353 --> 00:32:25.553
And, I finally found the witness

552
00:32:25.553 --> 00:32:28.853
that could explain the mystery

553
00:32:28.853 --> 00:32:31.853
of what was keeping you from being arrested!

554
00:32:33.753 --> 00:32:37.553
You guys! Come out and hold this woman!

555
00:32:38.453 --> 00:32:40.953
When I get custody of you from the Japanese police,

556
00:32:40.953 --> 00:32:42.753
I'll make you spit it out.

557
00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:44.153
You'll tell me everything.

558
00:32:44.153 --> 00:32:47.053
Well, even if you insist on saying nothing,

559
00:32:47.053 --> 00:32:48.653
she will eventually.

560
00:33:10.853 --> 00:33:13.653
Thank you, Calvados.

561
00:33:15.253 --> 00:33:17.353
Don't kill her yet.

562
00:33:17.353 --> 00:33:20.453
I've still got something I want to ask her.

563
00:33:23.753 --> 00:33:25.253
Why?

564
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:27.753
You all staked out here

565
00:33:27.753 --> 00:33:31.353
and figured you lured me out but...

566
00:33:31.353 --> 00:33:34.953
I came here once already two hours ago,

567
00:33:34.953 --> 00:33:37.253
disguised as you.

568
00:33:37.253 --> 00:33:39.953
And this is what I said in your voice.

569
00:33:39.953 --> 00:33:45.153
This is it tonight! Come back tomorrow!

570
00:33:45.153 --> 00:33:46.953
Didn't you realize?

571
00:33:46.953 --> 00:33:50.353
There was another reason as to why the papers of the cases

572
00:33:50.353 --> 00:33:53.353
that Detective Mouri was involved in were stolen.

573
00:33:53.353 --> 00:33:55.053
All of the documents were stolen

574
00:33:55.053 --> 00:33:59.753
so that the papers we actually needed would not be specified,

575
00:33:59.753 --> 00:34:02.853
however, all of the documents were sent back to the MPD in one batch

576
00:34:02.853 --> 00:34:05.653
because I wanted you people to think that my stay in Japan

577
00:34:05.653 --> 00:34:08.753
had something to do with Detective Mouri

578
00:34:08.753 --> 00:34:12.853
so that you would stake out the detective agency.

579
00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:16.853
Which as a result, it would help me figure out who the FBI agents are.

580
00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:19.453
Just as expected, I figured out how many of you there were,

581
00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:20.853
the place you were all staying

582
00:34:20.853 --> 00:34:23.253
and the way you were all communicating.

583
00:34:23.253 --> 00:34:27.053
I also knew that you were trying to trap me here.

584
00:34:27.053 --> 00:34:31.253
Then, you knew that we snuck into your room too?

585
00:34:31.253 --> 00:34:34.753
Yes. I was just playing dumb.

586
00:34:34.753 --> 00:34:36.553
I thought that if you saw that picture,

587
00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:41.753
you would find her for me.

588
00:34:41.753 --> 00:34:46.353
But you surprised me twice already.

589
00:34:46.353 --> 00:34:49.453
The first is that you are the girl

590
00:34:49.453 --> 00:34:51.753
that I met 20 years ago.

591
00:34:51.753 --> 00:34:52.953
The other is that

592
00:34:52.953 --> 00:34:56.353
you knew what went on behind the scenes regarding Dr. Araide.

593
00:34:56.353 --> 00:34:58.153
How did you get information on it

594
00:34:58.153 --> 00:35:01.053
when nothing about it was spoken to anyone?

595
00:35:02.153 --> 00:35:04.853
I didn't hear about it from anyone.

596
00:35:04.853 --> 00:35:06.453
I was asked to do so by someone.

597
00:35:06.453 --> 00:35:10.353
To corner you and disclose your identity,

598
00:35:10.353 --> 00:35:13.453
and in turn for doing so, she said that she would trust me.

599
00:35:13.453 --> 00:35:16.253
This girl over here.

600
00:35:16.253 --> 00:35:19.553
Oh, I see.

601
00:35:19.553 --> 00:35:21.453
She said so.

602
00:35:29.853 --> 00:35:31.753
Anyway, let's hear the whole story

603
00:35:31.753 --> 00:35:33.353
when we get to the police station!

604
00:35:34.753 --> 00:35:37.853
He solved the case in such a short time!

605
00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:40.753
Just as expected of Shinichi Kudo!

606
00:35:40.753 --> 00:35:42.153
Fantastic!

607
00:35:45.153 --> 00:35:46.453
It's nothing...

608
00:35:46.453 --> 00:35:47.853
The reason I got to solve it right away

609
00:35:47.853 --> 00:35:51.853
is because I used the same trick as the killer.

610
00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:53.253
Just what does that mean?

611
00:35:53.253 --> 00:35:54.453
What?

612
00:35:54.453 --> 00:35:58.253
The same trick that Werewolf over there used!

613
00:35:59.653 --> 00:36:03.553
So, this is it, for our re-encounter after 20 years.

614
00:36:03.553 --> 00:36:07.153
It's time to say goodbye.

615
00:36:07.153 --> 00:36:09.553
Come on and smile

616
00:36:09.553 --> 00:36:12.453
because you're going to get to see your father in heaven.

617
00:36:26.653 --> 00:36:27.653
What?

618
00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:31.553
The same trick as Werewolf used?

619
00:36:31.553 --> 00:36:35.553
The killer put a mask over the victim, who was already disguised.

620
00:36:35.553 --> 00:36:38.353
Which means he double disguised the victim.

621
00:36:38.353 --> 00:36:41.953
Don't you only have bandages wrapped around you?

622
00:36:41.953 --> 00:36:44.553
Just what do you mean by that?

623
00:37:05.253 --> 00:37:08.453
Don't tell me that you're...

624
00:37:11.053 --> 00:37:12.253
Yeah.

625
00:37:12.253 --> 00:37:15.353
So this...

626
00:37:15.353 --> 00:37:16.953
is what I mean!

627
00:37:16.953 --> 00:37:18.753
What?

628
00:37:18.753 --> 00:37:21.453
You're...

629
00:37:21.453 --> 00:37:24.953
Heiji Hattori?

630
00:37:27.653 --> 00:37:29.853
Cool kid?

631
00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:34.253
Conan Edogawa.

632
00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:35.953
A detective!
