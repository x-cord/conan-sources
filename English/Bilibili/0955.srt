a traditional insect hunting outfit, but...

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.910
What are you trying to catch with that giant net?

7
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910
I wanna know too.

17
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.710
That's right. I'm going insect man hunting.

That was kind of a creepy sound.

That's the cry of an insect man!

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.510

Isn't that kind of a lot of trouble too?

"An Accurate History of the Village Operated Insect Man Ranch Incident"

74
00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:12.267
Once upon a time, about one year ago,

75
00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:16.867
an important Japanese government official came to this village.

76
00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:21.367
He said, "I shall build a casino and public bath

77
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.667
in the forest surrounding this village."

78
00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.367
The adults of the village were overjoyed.

79
00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:29.667
But the village mayor was strongly opposed.

80
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:32.767
He opposed the idea because in the forest

81
00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.967
was the grave of Princess Gaga,

82
00:06:35.967 --> 00:06:38.867
who loved all insects in the world.

83
00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:47.067
However, the important Japanese government official

84
00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:48.967
ignored the village mayor's protests

85
00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:50.767
and went to inspect the forest.

86
00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:52.267
And then...

87
00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:56.867
He fell victim to Princess Gaga's curse

88
00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:59.267
and was attacked by a giant moth!

89
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.567
The frightened official fled

90
00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:05.667
and the plans to construct the casino

91
00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:08.067
and public bath were put on hold.

92
00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:14.267
The village mayor decided to build an insect man ranch instead.

93
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.567
The insect man ranch is an amusement park

94
00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:20.867
where children dress in insect costumes.

95
00:07:20.867 --> 00:07:25.867
The village mayor paid for these costumes out of his own pocket.

96
00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:27.267
-I see. -I see.

97
00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:30.767
When the children heard the news, they were overjoyed.

98
00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:33.567
But the adults of the village were strongly opposed.

99
00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:36.967
The village mayor decided to give up on his plan.

100
00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:38.867
How sad.

101
00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:43.167
But later, after retiring from being the village mayor,

102
00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:45.667
he bought up the forest with his retirement pay,

103
00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:48.167
put up "Do Not Enter" signs,

104
00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.967
and began construction with bulldozers.

105
00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:54.567
What? Isn't that where we just were?

106
00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:55.867
Yes.

107
00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:57.467
That's when...

108
00:07:57.467 --> 00:08:00.967
the former mayor came to this restaurant.

109
00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:05.367
"Kabutoya Restaurant" -The moment he ordered our famous katsu bowl,

110
00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:09.667
the former mayor suddenly died.

111
00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:11.167
-What? -What?

112
00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:13.367
The story's moving too fast!

113
00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:16.767
But this is a work of non-fiction.

114
00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:19.167
It may be non-fiction, but...

115
00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.167
-Right? -Right?

116
00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.567
But then!

117
00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:22.767
Unbelievably,

118
00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:24.467
a map showing the location of Princess Gaga's treasure

119
00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:27.467
was found in the former mayor's pocket.

120
00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:29.567
We told you, you're moving too fast.

121
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:33.067
You need to establish more foreshadowing.

122
00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:35.167
I can't follow the story.

123
00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:40.467
The truth was, the former mayor was excavating the forest

124
00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:43.267
so he could keep Princess Gaga's treasure all for himself.

125
00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:44.867
Really?

126
00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:47.067
When the adults of the village heard this,

127
00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:49.167
they became obsessed with Princess Gaga's treasure

128
00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.867
and they began excavating the forest.

129
00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:56.467
Meanwhile, the children who the former mayor betrayed

130
00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:59.667
were unable to give up on their dream of an insect man ranch,

131
00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.567
so they wear insect costumes,

132
00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:07.367
while the adults remain obsessed with Princess Gaga's treasure,

133
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.767
do an admirable job

134
00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.167
by looking after things in their absence, if I say so myself.

135
00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:14.667
"The End" -And they lived happily ever after.

136
00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:16.067
How?

137
00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:18.367
There's nothing happily ever after about that.

138
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:22.667
Is that picture-story really true?

139
00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:24.167
Yes, of course.

140
00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.367
After all...

141
00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:28.367
"Accurate History" -It's an accurate history.

142
00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:32.967
I'm kind of hungry.

143
00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:35.467
I know. Let's have some of the famous katsu bowls

144
00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.167
that appeared in the picture-story.

145
00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:40.167
-Yeah. -I want an eel bowl.

146
00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:42.467
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:45.267
As you can see, there are no adults here.

148
00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:48.067
That kind of dish is beyond what we can prepare.

149
00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:50.967
What can you serve, then?

150
00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:54.267
We can boil instant ramen.

151
00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:57.467
Free of charge, of course.

152
00:09:57.467 --> 00:10:00.567
Fine, then. I'll have ramen, then.

-Me too. -Me too.

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:04.367
What about you, Conan?

155
00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:06.467
Huh? Oh.

156
00:10:06.467 --> 00:10:08.667
I'm not hungry yet

157
00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.667
so I'm going to go for a walk.

158
00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:14.767
Then we'll have three ramens, please.

159
00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:16.167
Coming right up!

160
00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:19.167
That's three orders of ramen!

161
00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:25.967

162
00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:29.267
"Mayor of Kuronosu Village retires."

163
00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:32.667
Something's not right.

164
00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.767
Did the mayor really say

165
00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:37.467
he'd open an insect man ranch

166
00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:40.567
so he could keep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?

167
00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:41.967
Not only that, but he even paid for costumes

168
00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:45.567
for the village's children out of his own pocket.

169
00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:47.867
Then there's the cursed giant moth

170
00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:50.767
that chased the government official away.

171

178

Costumes?

179
00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:16.267
That's it. Maybe...

Excuse me!

"Mitsuo Seta (10)" -Huh? Oh, welcome.

184
00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:35.967
I'd like to see a record of deliveries made to the late former mayor.

185
00:11:35.967 --> 00:11:40.267
That should be in those records over there.

186
00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:41.667
Thanks.

187
00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:49.567
One year ago...

188
00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:50.567
Found it.

189
00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:53.267
"Kuronosu Village Mayor, Halloween Moth Costume" -I knew it.

190
00:11:53.267 --> 00:11:56.467
In other words, the late former mayor

191
00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:58.767
wore this moth costume

192
00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:02.067
and waited for the officials to come inspect the forest.

"Chosuke Murano, Mayor"

194
00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:05.867
Yes...

195
00:12:05.867 --> 00:12:07.667
Moth!

196
00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.167
It's the curse of Princess Gaga!

197
00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:18.167
So the mayor was behind Princess Gaga's curse.

198
00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:21.767
Was it really to keep her treasure to himself?

199
00:12:21.767 --> 00:12:23.067
Excuse me.

200
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:28.067
What did you think of my cicada impression?

201
00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:30.667
Nice.

203
00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:50.134
"Kabutoya Restaurant" -Thank you!

204
00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:56.834
Dressing like this is kind of exciting.

205
00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:58.934
-What? -Me too.

206
00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:03.334
-Huh? -Dressing like this is kind of exciting.

207
00:13:06.034 --> 00:13:08.234
In that case, me too.

208
00:13:08.234 --> 00:13:12.134

Do you work at this clinic?

211
00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:25.334
Yes.

Of course not.

But...

220
00:13:46.134 --> 00:13:49.734
I might accidentally mention something while examining you.

221
00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:51.734
Besides, you're kind of cute.

222
00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:56.834
"Chono Clinic" -What? It was cancer?

223
00:13:56.834 --> 00:13:59.134
The former mayor died of cancer?

224
00:14:00.234 --> 00:14:02.934
That's right. It was pretty advanced too.

225
00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:04.334
I heard from Daddy that

226
00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:07.134
he had only a year left by the time he retired.

227
00:14:07.134 --> 00:14:08.734
Did he know?

228
00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:10.734
Of course he knew.

229
00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:19.034
You've got a lot of cholesterol in your brain from thinking too hard.

230
00:14:19.034 --> 00:14:20.934
You'll need a shot.

00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:22.034

Wait for me!

241
00:14:49.234 --> 00:14:54.334
The former mayor knew he didn't have long to live.

242
00:14:54.334 --> 00:14:57.034
So why did he spend his retirement pay

243
00:14:57.034 --> 00:15:00.034
to keep Princess Gaga's treasure to himself?

244
00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:03.434
He even distributed costumes to the children

245
00:15:03.434 --> 00:15:06.934
and lied about opening an insect man ranch.

246
00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:08.334
Wait a minute.

247
00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:12.334

250
00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:26.134
What happened?

251
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.634
Well, I put on this spider costume,

252
00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:32.134
so I thought I'd practice making spiderwebs,

253
00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:34.134
but then I slipped.

254
00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.734
Help me.

255
00:15:36.734 --> 00:15:38.134
Give me a second.

"Kuronosu Village Office" -Fly...

257
00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:40.634

-Fly. -Mosquito.

Fly...

260
00:15:45.434 --> 00:15:47.734

I'm Morio Kusuda, 11 years old.

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:54.134
My father works at this village office.

263
00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:57.734
Do you know if there's a book here on the village's history?

264
00:15:57.734 --> 00:15:59.434
About that...

265
00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:01.234
It's in bookshelf over there.

266
00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:03.834
It contains the grade school teacher's research

267
00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:06.834
on the village's history.

268
00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:07.834
Found it.

269
00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.634
"History of Kuronosu Village" -This is it.

270
00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:13.934
-Did you find it? -Yeah.

271
00:16:15.034 --> 00:16:17.134
According to legend,

272
00:16:17.134 --> 00:16:18.834
the grave of the noble Princess Gaga

273
00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:21.534
once existed in the forest surrounding the village.

274
00:16:21.534 --> 00:16:25.734
It was a large keyhole-shaped tomb.

275
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:30.934
It's not here.

276
00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:33.734
Huh? What's not there?

277
00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:38.134
There's no mention of Princess Gaga's treasure.

278
00:16:38.134 --> 00:16:42.434
Then why did the mayor buy up the forest?

279
00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.634
What was the construction work for?

280
00:16:44.634 --> 00:16:49.534
And then there's the treasure map the mayor had on him when he died.

281
00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:53.434
Did you hear something?

282
00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:56.234
I heard something coming from the village shrine.

283
00:16:56.234 --> 00:16:58.634
Help, Conan!

284
00:17:06.534 --> 00:17:08.134
I told you

285
00:17:08.134 --> 00:17:12.834
it was dangerous to enter an off-limits forest!

286
00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:14.534
But Mitsuhiko the dragonfly...

287
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:18.434
-What? -It's only natural for an insect person

288
00:17:18.434 --> 00:17:21.434
to want to enter the forest.

289
00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:23.334
Ayumi the ladybug is right.

290
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.734
Thank you, Genta the praying mantis.

291
00:17:25.734 --> 00:17:28.634
Mitsuhiko the dragonfly, there's something wrong with you.

292
00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.134
What?

293
00:17:32.734 --> 00:17:34.534
Genta! Ayumi!

294
00:17:41.434 --> 00:17:43.234
This is bad!

295
00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:44.334
Wait...

296
00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:46.934
Why are they wearing costumes?

297
00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:49.834
You kids dressed as insect people

298
00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.434
so you could steal Princess Gaga's treasure, didn't you?

299
00:17:52.434 --> 00:17:54.034
No!

300
00:17:54.034 --> 00:17:59.134
We just wanted to enjoy the forest as insect people.

301
00:17:59.134 --> 00:18:01.134
Liar!

302
00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:02.934
Where are you kids from?

303
00:18:02.934 --> 00:18:05.634
Beika-cho.

304
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.434
The city? Then you can't be trusted!

305
00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:10.534
-No! -You're perverts!

306
00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:15.234
Genta the praying mantis.

307
00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:17.234
What is it, Mitsuhiko the dragonfly?

308
00:18:17.234 --> 00:18:19.934
I don't think that makes them perverts.

309
00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:21.934
What are they, then?

310
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.534
Do you know, Ayumi the ladybug?

311
00:18:24.534 --> 00:18:27.634
I think it's called pre...

312
00:18:27.634 --> 00:18:30.334
Yes, it begins with pre...

313
00:18:30.334 --> 00:18:35.334
-Pre? -Pre?

314
00:18:35.334 --> 00:18:37.534
Prejudiced.

315
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.334
Yes, that's it!

316
00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:40.434
Conan!

317
00:18:40.434 --> 00:18:41.734
You idiots!

318
00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:44.534
There's another one! Get him!

319
00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:46.134
Guys, run!

320
00:18:48.334 --> 00:18:49.534
Don't let them escape!

321
00:19:06.734 --> 00:19:07.734
This way!

322
00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:23.634
Come down from there!

323
00:19:23.634 --> 00:19:25.434
Or do you want us to drag you down?

324
00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:26.834
What should we do?

325
00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.334
Conan?

326
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.534
Hey.

327
00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:30.934
What should we do?

328
00:19:30.934 --> 00:19:33.634
We can't escape.

329
00:19:33.634 --> 00:19:37.134
I see. So that's how it is.

330
00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:39.234
Everyone, calm down and listen to me!

331
00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:42.234
Princess Gaga's treasure doesn't exist!

332
00:19:42.234 --> 00:19:44.534
-Impossible! -Don't lie to us!

333
00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.034
To prove it,

334
00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:47.334
there's no mention of the treasure

335
00:19:47.334 --> 00:19:50.934
in the village's historical documents!

336
00:19:50.934 --> 00:19:54.034
Then why did the mayor buy up the forest?

337
00:19:54.034 --> 00:19:56.134
To make an insect man ranch.

338
00:19:56.134 --> 00:19:57.134
What?

339
00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:01.434
The mayor tried to build the insect man ranch

340
00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.734
that you all opposed by himself.

341
00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:06.634
But then he learned he wouldn't live to see its completion

342
00:20:06.634 --> 00:20:10.134
because he had cancer.

343
00:20:12.034 --> 00:20:15.434
So the mayor came up with a plan.

344
00:20:15.434 --> 00:20:17.934
He spread the rumor that he was trying to keep

345
00:20:17.934 --> 00:20:21.834
Princess Gaga's non-existent treasure to himself

346
00:20:21.834 --> 00:20:25.734
and made sure the fake treasure map

347
00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:28.534
would be discovered after his death.

348
00:20:28.534 --> 00:20:33.134
Were there detailed excavation instructions written on the map?

349
00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:36.934
Yeah, almost obnoxiously detailed.

350
00:20:36.934 --> 00:20:42.334
And that's the result of following those obnoxiously detailed

351
00:20:42.334 --> 00:20:43.634
excavation instructions.

352
00:20:53.934 --> 00:20:57.434
The mayor didn't just leave behind the treasure map

353
00:20:57.434 --> 00:20:59.834
and excavation instructions.

354
00:20:59.834 --> 00:21:06.034
That's the tomb of Princess Gaga,

355
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:08.334
who loved all insects.

356
00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:13.034
They were plans to build a keyhole-shaped tomb.

357
00:21:13.034 --> 00:21:17.534
He probably left it up to you to fulfill his dream

358
00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:21.034
of building an insect man ranch.

359
00:22:56.934 --> 00:22:59.534
"Chono Clinic"

Yeah.

00:23:18.634 --> 00:23:20.434
Anyway, Genta...

That outfit...

Just how much do you like it?

368
00:23:26.634 --> 00:23:30.034
Doesn't it seem strange for an insect man

369
00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:31.734
to be carrying a bug catching net?

370
00:23:31.734 --> 00:23:33.034
No.

371
00:23:33.034 --> 00:23:35.434
It's very strange.

372
00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:38.734
There's nothing strange about it. After all...

373
00:23:38.734 --> 00:23:40.434
-After all... -After all...

374
00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:43.434
After all, insect men...

375
00:23:43.434 --> 00:23:45.734
-Insect men... -Insect men...

376
00:23:48.634 --> 00:23:51.634
Insect men go people hunting!

377
00:23:51.634 --> 00:23:53.234
-What? -What?

378
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:58.134
"Next Episode"

379
00:23:58.134 --> 00:24:00.834
It seems the victim Eiji Kadowaki

380
00:24:00.834 --> 00:24:05.034
was abusing his mother Yasuko daily.

381
00:24:05.034 --> 00:24:08.334
There's no domestic violence in our family!

382
00:24:08.334 --> 00:24:11.734
That's just an irresponsible rumor!

383
00:24:11.734 --> 00:24:14.834
What? Their son was killed?

384
00:24:16.134 --> 00:24:18.334
But I didn't do it!

385
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:24.234
Next Conan, "The Mystery-Solving Water Taxi (Part 1)"

386

The bug episode is over already?

389
00:24:30.477 --> 00:24:32.577
-Why? -Vermin vermend!

390
00:24:32.577 --> 00:24:33.877
One eel bowl.
