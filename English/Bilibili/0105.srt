1
00:00:01.238 --> 00:00:04.738
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.738
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:10.108
Today is the mansion solution!
There's more than just a code here!

4
00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:11.778
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.778
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.148
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:03.901
The old guy received a letter from
someone named Nakamura Misao,

8
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.571
asking him to solve the strange
mysteries of an inherited mansion.

9
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.771
The mansion really
was full of mysteries.

10
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:17.251
One handrail post by the front
door had a tiger sculpture on it.

11
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.001
The other post had strange holes in it.

12
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.761
The house was filled with clocks.

13
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:27.511
One clock had had
something removed from it.

14
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.351
At exactly 11:00, all the
digital clocks in the house rang.

15
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:36.851
The VCR's timer was
set for exactly one minute.

16
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:41.691
All the digital clocks
had a crack in the same spot.

17
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.031
It all seems to have been
set up to convey something.

18
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:52.641
What's more, someone
seemed to be hiding in the attic!

19
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:55.111
File 'Goblin'

20
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:56.581
ln the desk was a file filled with newspaper clippings
File 'Goblin'

21
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.651
ln the desk was a file filled with newspaper clippings

22
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:04.011
about the Goblins, a bandit gang that
had disappeared ten years ago.

23
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.261
Demon, the name of the Goblins'
leader, was found on a golf bag.

24
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.901
Even stranger was
the mirror affixed to the desk

25
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:18.351
and the hole in the wall
directly below the cuckoo clock!

26
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.401
And what came out of
the cuckoo clock at 1:10...

27
00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:28.591
...were ghastly goblin figures!

28
00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:33.641
Where is the key to
solving these mysteries?!

29
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:41.151
"The Case of the Mysterious
Bandit Mansion (Part 2)."

30
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:46.071
Demon figures from the cuckoo clock...

31
00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:47.721
Demons aren't animals!

32
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:50.681
What are such creepy things doing there?

33
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.351
Those aren't just demons.

34
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.981
They're definitely the goblin figures

35
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:59.391
the Bandits of the Wind
used to leave behind!

36
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.191
But why three of them?!

37
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:07.481
Oh, that's it! That's the
weird thing I saw the other day!

38
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.111
What?

39
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.361
L-Look!

40
00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:15.081
There are letters on each of their heads!

41
00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:22.671
Oh! What are these?!

42
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.571
The far right demon has "R"...

43
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:30.881
The middle one has "N"...

44
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:37.021
And the left demon has "L"...

45
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.941
If the "L" and "R" mean "left" and "right,"

46
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:48.821
what does the "N" in the middle mean?

47
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.241
North?

48
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:57.501
It stopped.

49
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.981
When did those demons start crying out?!

50
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:10.231
At exactly 1:10.

51
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:14.721
1:10... That's another "110"...

52
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:17.391
But it's strange.

53
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:22.941
When I saw those earlier, it was at 10:50!

54
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:29.731
Not 1:10, but 10:50?

55
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:31.841
Does that mean--

56
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:37.401
Hey! Don't tell me those figures were...

57
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:39.241
Those figures?!

58
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:41.301
What did you say?

59
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:43.371
Oh, nothing!

60
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:47.331
Ah.

61
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:52.801
Now I see what's going on here!

62
00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:58.921
But I still can't figure out

63
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:03.891
what these strange signs and
tricks Monjiro-san left behind mean!

64
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:09.631
The digital clocks and
VCR all went off at 11:00...

65
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:13.901
The significant marks on
all of the digital clocks' panels...

66
00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:19.471
The cuckoo clock that
suddenly went off at 1:10...

67
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.411
And the three goblins
that came out of the clock...

68
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:28.791
...and the L, N, and R that
were engraved on their foreheads...

69
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.301
What is the key to answering
all these mysteries?

70
00:06:35.971 --> 00:06:37.011
That's it!

71
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:38.971
What's what?

72
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:43.141
Didn't you notice it while looking
for animals around the house?

73
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:45.681
I thought something was missing!

74
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:47.971
A lion!

75
00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:52.901
I didn't see any at all! They should
be really easy to design, too!

76
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:58.551
Don't be stupid! There were
two big lions on the front door!

77
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.321
Oh? There were?

78
00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:05.541
Seriously, if he collected all
these animals, he wouldn't forget lions.

79
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.421
The lion is the king of the animals!

80
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:10.061
King?

81
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.301
What's going on?

82
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.301
What is it, Conan-kun?

83
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:25.501
Nothing! I just remembered
something funny!

84
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.981
Weird kid.

85
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:35.051
If I'm right,
it's truly a unique code!

86
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:36.421
But, wait.

87
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:44.671
If so, the letter O or the number 0
should've come out of the clock!

88
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:48.911
But L, N, and R came out.

89
00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:55.301
Could the cuckoo clock's code
be separate from the digital clocks'?

90
00:07:56.761 --> 00:07:58.221
If so...

91
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:03.421
1:10... 110...

92
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:06.391
The L, N, and R on their heads...

93
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:09.801
A trio of goblins...

94
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.681
Trio... Three...

95
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:17.531
Triplets... Triplets?

96
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:19.781
The L, N, and R are triplets!

97
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:21.701
Wait a minute!

98
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.331
Could it be?!

99
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.771
Could it be?!

100
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.261
Ah! I've got it completely figured out!

101
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.801
Conan-kun? Where are you?

102
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:44.971
Conan-kun!

103
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:49.391
Sheesh! Where did you go?

104
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:52.421
Where's your dad?

105
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:56.231
In the study, still figuring out the code.

106
00:08:57.221 --> 00:08:59.471
At this rate, it's going to get dark soon.

107
00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:03.161
Rushing won't help.

108
00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:06.281
But...

109
00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:12.341
The answer might come
if we think hard into the night!

110
00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:31.027
I can't figure it out.

111
00:09:31.027 --> 00:09:34.707
The digital clocks
all went off at 11:00 a.m.

112
00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:41.257
There's a crack on all the digital
panels after the digits "110"...

113
00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:47.867
And the cuckoo clock
rang at 1:10. Another "110."

114
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.907
They're all 110!

115
00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:53.187
What does 110 mean?!

116
00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:57.657
Is it the emergency
police number after all?

117
00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:02.357
Hey. Maybe it's time
we give up and go home?

118
00:10:02.777 --> 00:10:04.777
But it's strange.

119
00:10:04.777 --> 00:10:08.277
It would've made more sense
to set the digital clocks to 1:10, too.

120
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.867
Hey, Dad.

121
00:10:11.617 --> 00:10:13.987
Dad! Earth to Dad!

122
00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:18.127
Shut up! If you wanna
go home, then go home!

123
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:23.837
Don't get mad at me!

124
00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.927
I guess it's late enough now.

125
00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:37.367
110... 110... 11...

126
00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.767
That's it! Stripes!

127
00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:43.357
"11" refers to a striped pattern!

128
00:10:43.697 --> 00:10:48.567
So if we check all the zebras
in the house, we'll find something!

129
00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:53.287
But wouldn't he
have chosen 11:11 instead?

130
00:10:53.867 --> 00:10:57.457
Plus, tigers have stripes, too.

131
00:10:58.027 --> 00:11:01.917
Yeah. There are striped cats, too...

132
00:11:02.237 --> 00:11:05.377
Say, which are stronger, zebras or tigers?

133
00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.567
Eh? Tigers, right?

134
00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:10.347
Then tigers are the ♪1 animal?

135
00:11:10.567 --> 00:11:13.557
Lions are probably ♪1, little boy.

136
00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:16.367
Oh! Lions are?

137
00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.817
No wonder they're
called "king of all sixty beasts"!

138
00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:20.667
Sixty?

139
00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:24.277
You're dumb. They're "king of all 100 beasts."

140
00:11:24.637 --> 00:11:26.247
[In Japanese, "100 beasts" sounds like "110,"]
King of 100 beasts?!

141
00:11:26.247 --> 00:11:28.457
[and "king" sounds like the letter "O."]
Eh? King of 110?

142
00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:33.837
King of all 100 Beasts' [110 + O]

143
00:11:33.997 --> 00:11:35.797
That's it! I've figured it out!

144
00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:42.677
This "1100" is a code referring
to the king of all the beasts: the lion!

145
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.327
The mark between the zeroes

146
00:11:47.327 --> 00:11:51.267
was trying to tell us to think
of them as separate words!

147
00:11:51.267 --> 00:11:55.647
Checking the lions
will solve this mystery!

148
00:11:56.497 --> 00:12:00.647
B-But I don't see any lions...

149
00:12:00.997 --> 00:12:05.827
Monjiro-san probably got rid
of all unrelated lions in the house

150
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:09.077
to keep them from distracting us!

151
00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:13.327
So that's why some things
seemed broken or scraped away!

152
00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:15.537
Yup!

153
00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:19.967
Then are the lions in question
the ones on the front door?!

154
00:12:19.967 --> 00:12:24.677
Yes! We should find something
if we check them out!

155
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:32.287
Nothing seems strange about them.

156
00:12:32.287 --> 00:12:34.017
It would seem not.

157
00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:37.827
Besides, how do you
explain that cuckoo clock?

158
00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:43.697
"King" in Japanese
starts with the letter "O."

159
00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:49.327
T-True. "LNR" doesn't
fit with the "king" thing.

160
00:12:49.827 --> 00:12:52.997
Could it have meant something else?

161
00:12:52.997 --> 00:12:54.827
That only appeared in the cuckoo clock.

162
00:12:56.457 --> 00:12:58.667
It isn't out of the question...

163
00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:03.667
...but then what? Is there
yet another way to read 110?

164
00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:07.177
It's 1:10, so if you split the 1 and 10...

165
00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:11.517
One, "i," ten, "to"...

166
00:13:11.517 --> 00:13:15.597
One, ten... One, "to"... "Hi," "to"...

167
00:13:16.077 --> 00:13:17.457
Hitou
Hitou? [secluded hot spring]

168
00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:17.687
Hitou

169
00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:19.497
Ito
Ito? [thread]

170
00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:19.527
Ito

171
00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:21.397
ltou? [person's name]
Itou

172
00:13:21.577 --> 00:13:23.147
Yeah, Itou!

173
00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:28.497
Did Monjiro-san know
anyone named "Itou-san"?!

174
00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:29.327
I don't know...

175
00:13:29.327 --> 00:13:32.367
Then how about a
Naitou-san or a Saitou-san?!

176
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.707
What's so funny?!

177
00:13:37.207 --> 00:13:43.877
It's neat! Changing the first letter
makes completely different names!

178
00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:47.337
What's so neat about that?!

179
00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:52.077
Come to think of it, those
goblins had letters on their heads.

180
00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.307
They all looked the same, too.

181
00:13:55.077 --> 00:14:00.267
The L, N, and R on their heads...
And they looked the same?

182
00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:07.417
Three similar words that start
with L, N, and R, followed by 110?

183
00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.447
Yes!

184
00:14:14.747 --> 00:14:17.037
That's it!

185
00:14:18.077 --> 00:14:25.747
The cuckoo clock code was saying
to put L, N, and R before "ight"!

186
00:14:25.747 --> 00:14:29.007
It was saying, "Light! Night! Right!"

187
00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:35.427
Something will happen if we shine
a light on the right lion at night!

188
00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:37.097
Amazing, Dad!

189
00:14:37.497 --> 00:14:40.477
But you just shone light on it.

190
00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:43.977
Yeah, huh?

191
00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:50.157
Huh? What could that be?

192
00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:54.617
See? Right behind the right lion!

193
00:14:54.617 --> 00:14:56.117
What now?

194
00:14:56.617 --> 00:15:00.537
It's not very obvious,
but it looks like it opens up.

195
00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:07.207
It does!

196
00:15:07.957 --> 00:15:12.387
I see! If you shine the light through here--

197
00:15:12.707 --> 00:15:13.817
Huh?

198
00:15:17.037 --> 00:15:18.727
T-This is--

199
00:15:19.457 --> 00:15:23.287
Hey, Ran. Close the door
and shine the light through here.

200
00:15:23.287 --> 00:15:24.077
Right!

201
00:15:31.537 --> 00:15:33.737
The light is reflecting!

202
00:15:34.327 --> 00:15:37.697
Oh! There's a mirror in the post!

203
00:15:37.997 --> 00:15:40.617
Let's just follow the light!

204
00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:54.597
It goes inside the mansion
through a hole in the wall!

205
00:15:54.997 --> 00:15:57.557
That's the hole in the study!

206
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.517
Alright! To the study!

207
00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:04.517
Did you find anything?!

208
00:16:05.077 --> 00:16:09.647
Just keep shining the
light with the door closed!

209
00:16:09.647 --> 00:16:12.127
Eh? Still?

210
00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:18.077
What's that sound?

211
00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:31.877
It's a bird this time!

212
00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:35.257
Ah!

213
00:16:36.047 --> 00:16:40.017
The light from outside
reflects off the mirror on the desk

214
00:16:40.017 --> 00:16:43.037
and shines on the
cuckoo clock from below.

215
00:16:43.037 --> 00:16:43.827
Is there a photometer inside?

216
00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:45.727
Photometer = light detector
Is there a photometer inside?

217
00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:52.647
It must be set up to only work
at night, so the sun won't set it off.

218
00:16:54.287 --> 00:16:56.277
There's something on the bird...

219
00:16:58.327 --> 00:16:59.997
A wristwatch?

220
00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:04.417
Oh! That must be a present
our grandfather left for me!

221
00:17:04.417 --> 00:17:08.167
It sure is fancy, though!
It's covered with gems!

222
00:17:08.787 --> 00:17:12.277
If these are premium jewels,
it could be worth billions of yen!

223
00:17:13.327 --> 00:17:16.847
Of course! After all...

224
00:17:17.827 --> 00:17:21.037
...it's probably a stolen item that
Demon, the leader of the Goblins,

225
00:17:21.037 --> 00:17:23.117
secretly held on to!

226
00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:27.517
Demon, the leader of the Goblins?

227
00:17:27.827 --> 00:17:30.477
The person who
lived here: Monjiro-san!

228
00:17:30.477 --> 00:17:33.667
The figures that came
out of the cuckoo clock

229
00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:38.707
looked just like the goblin figures
the bandit gang always left behind,

230
00:17:38.707 --> 00:17:42.197
and it looks like he received a
golf bag with the alias "Demon" on it!

231
00:17:42.577 --> 00:17:48.167
And I don't think either of them are
the Misao-san who sent the letter.

232
00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:51.617
After all, the letter said this:

233
00:17:51.617 --> 00:17:54.337
"I haven't been here long
and don't know the house well.

234
00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:57.257
I figured I wouldn't
discover anything on my own."

235
00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:02.427
Yet, they knew how to open the old door,
and they live here together.

236
00:18:02.427 --> 00:18:09.367
Plus, he thought the cuckoo
came out at 10:50 instead of 1:10.

237
00:18:09.367 --> 00:18:14.187
This is because he
didn't see the clock directly.

238
00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:20.987
Instead, he looked through the hole
and saw the clock in the mirror!

239
00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:26.707
In short, when Misao-san mentioned
being watched by someone...

240
00:18:27.327 --> 00:18:29.037
...that was referring to these two!

241
00:18:30.167 --> 00:18:33.167
Besides, I think
Misao-san is a woman.

242
00:18:33.617 --> 00:18:34.917
What?

243
00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:37.997
Here! Look at the
stamp on this letter!

244
00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:42.327
See the lipstick on the underside?

245
00:18:45.037 --> 00:18:48.147
Oh! She licked it
when sticking it on here...

246
00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:51.937
But I'm sure you had
this all figured out already!

247
00:18:52.827 --> 00:18:55.167
Oh, uhh, yeah...

248
00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.647
So, does that mean--?!

249
00:19:03.497 --> 00:19:05.407
Impressive.

250
00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:10.077
We're the remnants of the Goblins.

251
00:19:10.077 --> 00:19:14.627
We came to get the last
treasure our boss had held on to.

252
00:19:14.627 --> 00:19:16.327
Held on to?

253
00:19:16.327 --> 00:19:22.497
Yeah, when we disbanded,
he gave us almost everything we stole,

254
00:19:22.497 --> 00:19:27.137
but he kept the most
valuable items all for himself.

255
00:19:27.137 --> 00:19:30.597
And those would be
the jewels on this watch?

256
00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:34.827
He finally kicked the bucket,
so we decided to scour this house

257
00:19:34.827 --> 00:19:39.817
he used to hole up in...
but there was someone already here.

258
00:19:40.117 --> 00:19:44.777
I assume it was the real Misao-san,
who's locked in the attic now?

259
00:19:44.777 --> 00:19:49.867
Yeah. When we tossed her
up there, she just kept wailing on

260
00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:54.417
about how some great detective
would be here soon to get us.

261
00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:58.997
And then you showed up
at the perfect time,

262
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:04.427
so I pretended to be her to
have you solve the code our boss left.

263
00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:07.427
Now hand over the watch.

264
00:20:08.117 --> 00:20:11.437
Hand it over quietly and I won't kill you.

265
00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:16.227
Here you go.

266
00:20:17.897 --> 00:20:18.777
B-Bastard!

267
00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:28.037
What was that just now?

268
00:20:28.617 --> 00:20:31.287
Don't move! Move and I snap her neck!

269
00:20:31.287 --> 00:20:32.697
You idiot!

270
00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:34.247
Don't do that!

271
00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:48.847
A-A heel drop...

272
00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:52.307
That scared me!

273
00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:55.267
It did?

274
00:20:55.667 --> 00:20:58.477
Alright! Let's contact the police!

275
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:32.407
After we contacted them,
the local police rushed to the scene.

276
00:22:32.847 --> 00:22:36.827
Still knocked out, the criminal
duo was carried into ambulances,

277
00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:40.747
and Misao-san was rescued
from the attic, safe and sound.

278
00:22:40.747 --> 00:22:46.717
Just as I thought, she was the
girl in the photo with Monjiro-san.

279
00:22:47.887 --> 00:22:49.677
I see.

280
00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:52.467
So this was in the cuckoo clock?

281
00:22:52.467 --> 00:22:59.267
Monjiro-san probably made
the watch for you out of stolen jewels.

282
00:22:59.267 --> 00:23:02.967
Nobody will know about
it if you don't say anything...

283
00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:06.397
But stolen goods are
stolen goods. I can't accept it.

284
00:23:07.017 --> 00:23:10.017
Besides, my grandfather
has already given me

285
00:23:10.017 --> 00:23:12.117
something more valuable than jewels.

286
00:23:12.117 --> 00:23:13.277
Huh?

287
00:23:13.927 --> 00:23:17.187
The mysteries scattered about this mansion.

288
00:23:18.347 --> 00:23:23.207
For a mystery writer like me,
it's the greatest present!

289
00:23:23.207 --> 00:23:24.327
Oh...

290
00:23:25.517 --> 00:23:28.927
Still, it's a waste...

291
00:23:28.927 --> 00:23:30.677
It's all right.

292
00:23:30.677 --> 00:23:36.217
Who knows, maybe it was
actually meant for whoever found it!

293
00:23:36.217 --> 00:23:38.267
Then it's for me?!

294
00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:40.017
Dad!

295
00:23:40.427 --> 00:23:44.267
I don't think so, old guy.

296
00:23:44.267 --> 00:23:50.027
That was most definitely a watch
Monjiro-san made for Misao-san.

297
00:23:51.057 --> 00:23:54.097
Look closely at the watch face.

298
00:23:54.097 --> 00:23:59.097
It's stopped at 3:30.
330 can be read as "Misao."

299
00:24:11.997 --> 00:24:12.997
Nakai-san!

300
00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:21.887
That's--!

301
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:32.757
On the next Conan--

302
00:24:32.757 --> 00:24:35.547
"The Scoop Photograph Murder Case."
