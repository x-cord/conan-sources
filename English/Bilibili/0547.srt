1
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:13,782
What? You're Kaneyama's punk friend?

2
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,582
"Onda Kazuyoshi (48)" -Did he tell you to make me come...

3
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,982
"Game Software Company President" -to a place like this?

4
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:19,282
"Oomine Ryosuke (24)" -Shut up!

5
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,782
Cut out your blabbering and give me all the money you got!

6
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:26,782
I'm paying Kanayama salary like I should.

7
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:28,682
But that's only chicken feed.

8
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:30,982
You should paid the equal amount of money

9
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:32,382
that is right for the work.

10
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:35,482
What you guys are doing is none other than mugging people.

11
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,082
I'm reporting you to the police!

12
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,482
What's wrong?

13
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:45,682
You're a 4th dan in Judo

14
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:49,582
and was even a candidate for the Olympics, weren't you?

15
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,782
Try sticking me out to the police!

16
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:55,382
You made a lot of dough

17
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:58,182
from the game software made by Kanayama, didn't you?

18
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:02,082
You can't even handle a computer yourself, and yet...

19
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:03,782
you go ahead and make a profit of 20 billion yen.

20
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,582
What does Kanayama get, just a mere 100,000 yen?

21
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,482
Talk about ridiculous!

22
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,782
No, you see the company

23
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:14,382
also invested quite a lot to the development of the game.

24
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:17,382
Shut up! Miser!

25
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,282
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

26
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,582
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

27
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,282
A kidnapper that's a bit dense.

28
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:04,482
Held as hostage, what goes with my fate?

29
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,082
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,882
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,882
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:54,788 --> 00:04:00,588
"Two Days with the Culprit (1st Day)"

33
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:05,988
"Mix Mall"

34
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:10,088
"Cream Heaven"

35
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:13,388
We're lucky to have you around!

36
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:16,588
Yes, really. Thanks to you, Conan.

37
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,088
We get to eat the Dragon Mountain Parfait of Creamy Heaven...

38
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,488
"Kid's Service for those..." -with a 20 percent discount.

39
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,388
"who bring along an elementary student" -We're sure lucky.

40
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,888
I'm unlucky

41
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:29,988
because I wanted to watch the soccer game on TV.

42
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,088
The toy department is over there!

43
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,188
Don't go too far!

44
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:40,388
Just come back before we finish eating!

45
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,588
Yes, that's right.

46
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:56,388
There's probably no doubt that it's Oomine.

47
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:59,188
It seems that he's taken a child hostage.

48
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,988
Please save Kayoko.

49
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,488
Please.

50
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:05,388
We give you our word that we'll save her.

51
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:09,588
The girl that's been taken hostage is 5 years old Kayoko Yuuki.

52
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,288
Yes, we'll be careful.

53
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:15,788
Because it seems as if he's armed with a gun.

54
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,988
Please come along with us, Mrs. Yuuki.

55
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,588
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,488
A child's been taken hostage.

57
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:29,288
The kidnapper's armed with a gun.

58
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:40,488
If the kidnapper tries to escape from the shopping mall...

59
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,188
he could only do so by car.

60
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:58,488
Ran, that brat would never get lost.

61
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,088
True.

62
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,788
Inspector Megure?

63
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:05,688
This is Mrs. Natsumi Yuuki, the mother of Kayoko

64
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:08,088
that is being held hostage.

65
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:10,188
If he were to get hold of a car,

66
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,588
it would be a place where people wouldn't see him.

67
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,388
Like behind a pillar,

68
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:18,188
and some place far away from the entrance.

69
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,188
It's Kayoko that's being held hostage.

70
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:45,688
I'm borrowing your car!

71
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:48,688
What are you doing?

72
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:59,088
Here we go!

73
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,588
Stay still.

74
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,688
Kayoko!

75
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,088
There he is!

76
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,088
Oomine is in the parking lot!

77
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,388
Come, hurry!

78
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,488
You brat!

79
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:21,688
Conan?

80
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,388
Darn.

81
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:27,488
Okay... you're fine now!

82
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,188
Oomine! Throw your gun down and turn yourself in!

83
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,688
You can't get away!

84
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,388
Don't dare move, you brat!

85
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,988
First I've got to check if he's armed with a gun,

86
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,288
or it's too dangerous for me to do anything.

87
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,188
Oomine's in the parking lot!

88
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:00,988
All of you block the entrance and exit!

89
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,688
I wonder what it is?

90
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:11,988
Talk about junk driver!

91
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,688
Halt! Police!

92
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,688
Out of the way! Stupid!

93
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:29,688
It's dangerous, please get out of the way!

94
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,388
Conan?

95
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,688
The life of the hostage is top priority!

96
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,588
-Copy? -Yes, sir!

97
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:52,888
Dad! Conan's in big trouble!

98
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,888
Junk driver!

99
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:02,388
You're a hostage, so stop acting so haughty, brat!

100
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:03,488
Up ahead!

101
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:04,788
What?

102
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,488
And, the next news is...

103
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,188
That's...

104
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,888
Is it Oomine?

105
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,488
How dare he...

106
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,288
Inspector Megure!

107
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,588
Chiba?

108
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,888
We've safely rescued Kayoko.

109
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:35,288
However, please stay calm.

110
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,488
Conan's being...

111
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:40,388
Conan's being held hostage!

112
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:43,288
I found out quite a while ago!

113
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,488
You guys hurry up and come over here and join us!

114
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,188
It looks like he got away, did he?

115
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,888
Yes, looks like he did.

116
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,188
Last night, the president of a company,

117
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:58,588
Mr. Kazuyoshi was found murdered in a park in Shibuya ward.

118
00:09:58,588 --> 00:09:59,988
The prime suspect is

119
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:02,488
Ryosuke Oomine, 25 years old.

120
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:03,888
-Idiot! -He is now on the wanted list.

121
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:05,988
-I'm still 24! -Oomine seems to have

122
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,888
taken a boy hostage at the shopping mall in Haido cho,

123
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,188
and is now on the run.

124
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,288
There's strong possibility that

125
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:16,288
he is armed with a gun...

126
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,188
Are you a murderer, mister?

127
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,888
Yeah, did it bugs you?

128
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:27,288
Of course it bugs me. Give me a break.

129
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:29,188
Did you said Conan's been kidnapped?

130
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:32,888
I'm sorry, despite me being with him...

131
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:35,388
Which way did his car go?

132
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,588
I'd advise you not to get involved this time.

133
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,288
Inspector.

134
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,788
Oomine who kidnapped Conan

135
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:45,988
is a punk who loiters around the Shinjuku area.

136
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,088
He has a record and has been arrested twice

137
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:50,388
on charges of mugging, battery and assault.

138
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,988
Mr. Onda who was murdered

139
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:54,588
is the president of a major game software company,

140
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,188
a successful man who has an annual income of a several million yen.

141
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,588
But, he was plagued with money trouble

142
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,688
because he paid his employees extremely low salaries

143
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:06,088
and failed to pay his suppliers as well.

144
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,788
Oomine had heard of President Onda's

145
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:13,188
dictator-like actions from his colleague, Mr. Kanayama

146
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,688
who was working at the company.

147
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,988
It seems that Oomine was angered at Onda's ways

148
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:22,388
and tried to take money from him,

149
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,988
but inadvertently shot him.

150
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,788
All of what happened

151
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:30,288
was found in the surveillance camera set up in the park.

152
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:36,488
It is very likely that Oomine is still armed with a gun.

153
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,988
Leave everything to us this time.

154
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,988
We've already set up cordon too.

155
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,788
Conan.

156
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,627
We're staying here for a while.

157
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,827
Let me go home already.

158
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:14,027
You don't need me anymore.

159
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,527
If I let you go,

160
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,427
you're going to tell the officers about me, right?

161
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,427
No, I won't.

162
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:21,727
I know you'll tell them!

163
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:24,927
Do I look like I'll do something like that?

164
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,627
Yep.

165
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,327
I'll have to check

166
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,127
whether he has a gun on him or not.

167
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,927
After that, I either grasp the chance to knock him down or flee.

168
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,027
He abandoned the car here?

169
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,427
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:51,327
He's either hiding somewhere around here

171
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,027
or used this place as a relay station and fled.

172
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:56,327
-Search the vicinity thoroughly! -Yes, sir.

173
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,327
"Mouri Detective Agency"

174
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:02,327
Just what're you doing at a time like this?

175
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,827
Dad?

176
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:10,227
In the papers about 2 months ago, I'm sure that

177
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:14,527
there was an article special on Mr. Onda's company.

178
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,527
Here!

179
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,727
What do you want to search for?

180
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,927
About a man called Kanayama,

181
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:24,827
an employee working under President Onda, as well as Oomine's friend.

182
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,327
"OnDack Co."

183
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,827
"Seiichi Kanayama"

184
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,727
This sure is convenient!

185
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:39,127
We changed our line to wireless (Musen ran) too last month.

186
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:43,627
Musen Ran? Your name's Mouri Ran, isn't it?

187
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,327
"Game Programmer: Seiichi Kanayama, Age:24"

188
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,627
"32nd Games Awards winner."

189
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:53,227
"Youngest programmer." -He developed this many game software?

190
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:56,127
This guy sure is a genius game developer.

191
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,727
Dad.

192
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:02,827
Conan will be okay, won't he?

193
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,427
Of course.

194
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,327
"No signal"

195
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,827
Darn.

196
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:15,127
I won't connect.

197
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,227
Okay, I guess I'll do it.

198
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:20,227
I'm scared!

199
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,627
Wait!

200
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,327
-What? -A mouse!

201
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:28,527
There's no mouse here.

202
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,527
He doesn't have a gun.

203
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:36,527
Cut it out, you...

204
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,427
If he doesn't have a gun...

205
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,927
Come.

206
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,327
It should be this room.

207
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,727
Why do you have so many keys on you?

208
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,127
Stop asking questions at a time like this.

209
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:27,827
What's that sound?

210
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,327
Hurry up and get inside.

211
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:35,327
Bingo. I can get outside from there.

212
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,127
Back then...

213
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:54,727
Do you know the person that fired the gun?

214
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,127
Of course not.

215
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:58,627
Then, who was it?

216
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:01,127
How did he know you were there?

217
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,127
And besides, why did he fire the gun?

218
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,227
How should I know?

219
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:08,227
Hurry up and come.

220
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:20,627
It seems that the guy gave up.

221
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:23,227
He gave up quite easily.

222
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,627
Besides, what was that explosive sound?

223
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,027
Why didn't you say anything?

224
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:41,927
The guy that just passed by is a police officer, right?

225
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,727
Since you're a hostage,

226
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:47,027
if you see an officer, you'd try to ask for help, right?

227
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,027
Really?

228
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:49,927
That's only natural, right?

229
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:53,227
But why did you risk getting shot to protect me?

230
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:56,527
You could've fled alone.

231
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,427
That's true.

232
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:00,427
That's only natural, right?

233
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:01,627
I guess.

234
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:04,527
Are you really a murderer?

235
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:09,227
I'm the one who shot him, so there's no doubt about it!

236
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:12,927
You don't look like that kind of a character, though.

237
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,527
Will you lend me your cell phone?

238
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:17,027
-Why? -Quick!

240
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,927
Doc.

241
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:51,727
You're Mr. Seiichi Kanayama, aren't you?

242
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:55,527
"Seiichi Kanayama (24)" -Famed detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

243
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:58,227
It took you more time then I expected.

244
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:01,627
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

245
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,027
Did you go shopping?

246
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:07,027
I went to the convenience store.

247
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:11,027
Well, rather than standing here and talking,

248
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:13,527
please come over to my room.

249
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:17,727
You've got a lot of things you want to ask me, don't you?

250
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,727
Yes. I guess so.

251
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,927
"Unit 202, Seiichi Kanayama"

252
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,127
The child that Oomine took hostage

253
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,627
is the boy staying at your place, isn't he?

254
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,727
Oomine hasn't been arrested yet

255
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,427
and I guess as the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

256
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:37,527
you'd like to find Oomine yourself, wouldn't you?

257
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:42,727
If so, he would first come to my place.

258
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,627
That's the only natural way to think, right?

259
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:49,027
You seem to be Oomine's colleague.

260
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,327
He was my classmate during my intermediate school days in Morioka.

261
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,827
And, I used to meet him now and then, even after coming to Tokyo.

262
00:18:56,827 --> 00:19:00,027
Oomine tried to take money from Mr. Onda for you

263
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,427
and ended up doing what he did.

264
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:05,627
As to that, I do feel bad.

265
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:10,127
Because I did bad mouth the president.

266
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,927
I said that he only paid cheap salary despite making a big profit.

267
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,227
Just because he was strong at judo, he was tyrannical

268
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:19,727
and resorted to violence for almost everything.

269
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,027
The president was really sly.

270
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,327
He used to take millions of yen.

271
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,427
I developed the game software

272
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:29,327
and yet my annual salary was only 3 million yen!

273
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:34,627
Excuse me.

274
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:38,427
"Missed call from Oomine" -I haven't been answering.

275
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,427
That mark looks familiar, doesn't it?

276
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:45,127
Well, he calls. Just answer.

277
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,427
What's this?

278
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:52,227
You mean the police didn't come to the apartment?

279
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,327
Don't be silly.

280
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,327
Aren't you the one who tempted Oomine

281
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,627
to commit the crime, Momoko?

282
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,127
"Momoko Uemiya (24)" -Why would I, the president's secretary

283
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,827
do something like that?

284
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,427
You used to call him "daddy"

285
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,327
and sucked a lot of cash out of him, didn't you?

286
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:10,727
You mean you're sulky because I brushed you off?

287
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:13,027
Well, who cares.

288
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:14,827
Why don't you work rather

289
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,327
doing chat from the company.

290
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,127
That's none of your business!

291
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:22,227
I think you should suspect Momoko.

292
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,827
She's Mr. Onda's secretary.

293
00:20:24,827 --> 00:20:26,827
Is there anyone else?

294
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,027
Well...

295
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:31,027
"OnDack Co."

296
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:34,427
"Satoshi Kanda" -The vice president, Mr. Kanda.

297
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:38,527
"Satoshi Kanda (32)" -Because he was being bullied by the president.

298
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,827
Bullied? In other words, power harassment?

299
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,627
If I were him, I would've quit the company long ago.

300
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,827
Well, if there were to be an accomplice,

301
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:51,427
I think this is about it.

302
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:56,027
There's another major figure left, isn't there?

303
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,927
You, Mr. Kanayama.

304
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:11,227
Hey, watch your step.

305
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:17,927
Did you hear something just now?

306
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:18,927
Over that way.

307
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,927
You go around from that side.

308
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,227
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,227
I can't afford to make him get caught just yet.

310
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,027
Hurry and hide.

311
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,827
Quick.

312
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:02,927
That was dangerous!

313
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,427
Is that you, Dr. Agasa?

314
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:07,527
What brings you here?

315
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,727
Oh, well, you see...

316
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:13,927
An emergency. I'm very much in a rush.

317
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,927
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,327
So, I've got to go. Bye.

319
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:29,827
No need to worry anymore.

320
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,627
Thank you, Doc.

321
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,527
You're a life saver.

322
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:38,827
Right, nothing will be solved if he gets caught now.

323
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:42,927
I have a feeling there's something more behind this case.

324
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:10,927
"Next Episode" -Ran! Are you've been taken hostage too!

325
00:24:12,027 --> 00:24:15,427
-Dad! -Renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

326
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:19,327
has captured the murderer Ryosuke Oomine!

327
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:23,627
Mr. Oomine may have been used by someone.

328
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:27,527
There's blood on.

329
00:24:28,527 --> 00:24:31,027
Quiet! Or I'll blow this kid up!

Five, six, seven, eight,

nine.(The word "Nine" sounds like the sound of window wiping in Japanese)

335
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,547
-What are you doing? -Wiping the window.
