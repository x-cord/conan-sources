1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,340
The gem, the Blushed Mermaid that Thief Kid is after

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,540
was supposed to be exhibited on the Bell Tree Express.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,240
Although this was postponed,

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,140
it ended up being exhibited in another place.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,140
I came to the Great Suzuki Museum

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,240
along with Sonoko, Ran and Sera.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,740
Like always, Advisor, Jirokichi Suzuki and Inspector Nakamori

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,540
had flawless security measures awaiting Kid.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,740
However, when the time that Thief Kid warned he would come arrives,

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,440
the carpet is pulled up,

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,840
and the instant the gigantic aquarium is blinded from view,

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,540
the turtle with the gem attached to it

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,040
vanishes in the blink of an eye.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,540
I don't get it.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,140
All sides were surrounded by hard glass,

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,240
plus the ceiling and both sides

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,840
were covered with special alloy.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,340
Just how on earth could he have stolen it

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,840
in such a short time

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,640
when the aquarium was blinded from view with that carpet?

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,740
No.

22
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,640
The trick of putting the card in the aquarium is easy.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
All that needs to be done is to roll the card up

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,840
and tie it with a string that melts in the water.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,940
Then pull the fishing line

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,840
that is tied to the string through the card,

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,040
put a pebble at the tip of the line.

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
And hang it on to the lighting.

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,740
Then if it is rigged to fall using a remote controller,

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,140
the card that had fallen will go through the wired net,

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,640
while the string melts in the water

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
and the card opens up, displaying the message on the card.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,140
Well, if it were Sera, Sonoko, Pops and Inspector Nakamori,

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
who were able to get near the aquarium

35
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,340
after they got wrapped up in the carpet?

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,140
And if it were somebody among the riot police

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,240
that were standing in front of the aquarium to begin with,

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,640
they would've probably been able to directly put the card inside.

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
But back then...

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,440
the one who made the most suspicious move was...

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,940
Ran.

42
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,240
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,940
are slashed by the light of deduction.

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,740
The mystery of the diamond that totally disappears.

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,840
Who is the one Thief Kid disguises himself as...

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,240
His name is Detective Conan!

49
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:05,811
"Thief Kid and the Blushed Mermaid (Part 2)"

50
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:10,211
Inspector Nakamori!

51
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,111
Something that looks like a winch

52
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,611
was found from the lighting!

53
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,811
There are traces of thin string-like objects

54
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,811
having been embedded on the ceiling and walls.

55
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,411
I see.

56
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,511
The perp tied the fishing line that was connected to the winch,

57
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,211
passed it through the pillar of the lighting

58
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:25,811
and attached it along the ceiling and walls,

59
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,911
and tied to the carpet.

60
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,111
When those were pulled,

61
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,811
the carpet which had been cut into shape, came up too.

62
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:36,411
And this IC recorder was also found near the winch.

63
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:40,011
Three, two, one.

64
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,911
That's the recording of his voice counting down

65
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,711
just before the turtle disappeared along with the gem.

66
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:44,711
What?

67
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,511
He rigged it so that the fishing line

68
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,811
would be severed in keeping with the voice.

69
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,711
He sure knows what he's doing!

70
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,211
Hey, you...

71
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,811
You seem to be siding with Kid,

72
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,411
but don't tell me that you're...

73
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,911
Oh, no.

74
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,711
I'm just a bit amazed at the way he does things.

75
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,411
Hey! Take off your clothes!

76
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:07,011
-Huh? -I'll check you from head to toe.

77
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,911
Give me a break.

78
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,111
Inspector Nakamori.

79
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,311
Maybe we should give up and get everybody out of here.

80
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,311
Huh?

81
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,011
We drained out the water from the aquarium

82
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,711
and check every nook and cranny yet,

83
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,011
we still can't find anything.

84
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:24,111
It seems that everybody here's already gone through a body check,

85
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:27,111
but neither the gem nor the turtle has been found, right?

86
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,211
Darn! Hey! How is it on that side?

87
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:32,011
We've finished checking this side too!

88
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,211
No turtle, no gem!

89
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,611
But, Ran's still not finished...

90
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,911
She'll be fine.

91
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:42,211
Because Ran'll be able tell if it's authentic or not.

92
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:45,011
Right?

93
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,211
Yep.

94
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:50,411
So, it could be that Kid's not around anymore after all.

95
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,711
Yeah, he's really a mysterious person, isn't he?

96
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:56,011
To disappear along with the gem just like magic.

97
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,911
Talking of magic,

98
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:01,711
I saw a magic similar to this on TV the other day.

99
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:02,711
What...

100
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,811
It was on air with the magic

101
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,611
that I performed at noon today.

102
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,311
The coin that the magician brought close to a glass bottle,

103
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,311
went right through the glass

104
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:14,311
and dropped inside it.

105
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,511
Maybe that magic has something to do

106
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:19,011
with how Thief Kid carried out his magic this time?

107
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,211
Yep! I'll bet!

108
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,411
I think you should tell Inspector Nakamori

109
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,311
of how that magic was performed, no?

110
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:29,311
So you say...

111
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,211
You know if I do that, you'll be in a fix and yet.

112
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,611
Right? Sir Kid.

113
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,111
Wrong, I'm...

114
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,311
I won't tell anybody.

115
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,011
I was watching after all, you know.

116
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,411
Just before the carpet flipped up,

117
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:48,411
you secretly backed away from us.

118
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,411
Huh?

119
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,411
You did that because you knew that

120
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,811
the carpet was going to be pulled up

121
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,911
and you backed off so that you wouldn't be involved, right?

122
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,711
No!

123
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,711
It was because just then you asked me what time it was,

124
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,111
so I tried to check it with my cell.

125
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,511
But the moment I opened my cell,

126
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,311
the display went black.

127
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,311
Really?

128
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,711
Is that really true, Ran?

129
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:12,511
Yeah.

130
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:16,011
So, I thought that the wave was weak,

131
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,111
and walked about two or three steps over to the window.

132
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,011
That's when the carpet suddenly...

133
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:22,911
Rather, you were following me from behind back then too,

134
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,711
weren't you Conan?

135
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,511
You had a wondering look on your face.

136
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,811
Conan!

137
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,811
Don't tell me that...

138
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,711
Uncle Jirokichi!

139
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,111
Was the clasp of the gold necklace

140
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,811
that was attached to the gem rusty?

141
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,611
Yeah, because it was made of iron.

142
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,811
Well, I was thinking of changing it

143
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:48,811
to a real gold clasp later though.

144
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:52,811
That is, after the turtle shed and the gem came off.

145
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,211
I see.

146
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,811
So, that's the story.

147
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,211
Kid didn't steal the gem.

148
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:01,811
He just made it vanished from everyone's view.

149
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:04,611
He manipulated the hearts of people...

150
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,611
With expertise.

151
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:13,311
Moreover, he hasn't realized that he had made a big mistake

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,311
and is still disguised as that person.

153
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:22,511
It is past closing time,

154
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,511
those still left in the building,

155
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:27,911
please leave the premises.

156
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,411
Hey, did you hear that?

157
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,511
Huh?

158
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,011
Didn't you hear a strange moaning sound in the toilet?

159
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,111
Not really.

160
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,711
Maybe somebody was trying to pass his bowels or something?

161
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:41,511
Well it seems that Kid has left,

162
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,111
so let's get going too.

163
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,211
Yeah.

164
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,911
Go on, get everybody and everything out of here!

165
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,611
The aquarium was searched thoroughly,

166
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:15,611
and everyone here went through a body check.

167
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:17,111
Still no one had it,

168
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:22,011
this means that Thief Kid had taken the turtle

169
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:25,611
with the gem on its back outside this museum.

170
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,211
This is an undisputable fact.

171
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,511
There is no further reason

172
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:31,111
for the police to remain here.

173
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,511
But, we've got to at least find a clue

174
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:36,011
as to how Kid stole that turtle with the gem attached to it

175
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:37,511
outside of this aquarium.

176
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,011
Come now...

177
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,911
It's already past 10pm,

178
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:43,011
so why don't we call it a day for now,

179
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,411
and start the search again at a later date?

180
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:47,411
Good idea. I'm starved too.

181
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,211
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep and...

182
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,711
Hey, Conan! We're leaving...

183
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,811
Well, I guess Sonoko could serve as detective too.

184
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:11,111
Sonoko?

185
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,611
Are you okay, Sonoko?

186
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:15,111
I'm fine.

187
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,411
I just felt a bit faint

188
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,611
because everyone here is so off the point.

189
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,411
Because nobody realizes...

190
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,811
that the turtle that is carrying the Blushed Mermaid

191
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:27,411
on its back wasn't stolen,

192
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:31,411
but rather, simply just vanished out of your sight.

193
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:44,403
The turtle that is carrying the Blushed Mermaid

194
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,103
on its back wasn't stolen,

195
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,303
but rather, simply just vanished out of your sight.

196
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,803
Vanished from sight?

197
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,203
Yes. As proof of that...

198
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,503
Come on, brat, show it to them.

199
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,103
Okay!

200
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:02,203
Hey, Pops, you've got a lighter, don't you?

201
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,203
Huh?

202
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,903
Yeah. It's only a 100 yen lighter, though.

203
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:07,203
Can you try dropping that lighter

204
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:10,303
from right above here into the aquarium?

205
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:13,303
Huh? I tell you...

206
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:16,203
What do you expect to get out of doing this?

207
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,603
Huh? It's not coming down.

208
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:23,703
What's going on?

209
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:26,203
It's stuck...

210
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,603
Why?

211
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,003
Magnet.

212
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,703
Huh...

213
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:32,903
Magnet?

214
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:39,103
Right. I think that plate's made of strong magnet.

215
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,303
That type of 100 yen lighters

216
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:44,903
are surrounded by iron where the igniter is.

217
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:50,003
But, even if this were to be a magnet,

218
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,803
it doesn't solve the mystery

219
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:53,803
of how the turtle with the gem disappeared, does it?

220
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:55,403
Right.

221
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:59,203
That turtle couldn't have attached itself to the magnet.

222
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:00,703
As for the decoration around the gem,

223
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,803
the necklace was gold,

224
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,803
and gold doesn't stick on to magnet.

225
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,103
If it were to stick on in any way,

226
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,803
it would only be to the clasp of the necklace.

227
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,403
Oh my, I think there were a lot of gems stones

228
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,703
attached to the belly of the turtle too, though.

229
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,903
Hey... that's diamond.

230
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,203
If they were all synthetic diamonds,

231
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,303
I guess they would all stick.

232
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:21,703
Huh?

233
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,503
The iron that is inside the solvent that is used

234
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:26,103
when making synthetic diamonds,

235
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,403
during the process of crystallization,

236
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:30,803
may be taken in as an inclusion at times.

237
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,703
Huh? Inclusion...

238
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:35,203
You're great, Sonoko!

239
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:37,703
Well, the turtle is in the water,

240
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,303
so it's impossible to fix it in place

241
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,303
only by using magnetic force,

242
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:41,503
but at that time I think it would've been possible

243
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:44,503
to at least lure it over to the back side of the plate.

244
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:46,203
Lure it over?

245
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:48,703
That would've been enough.

246
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,503
Right, Pops Kogoro?

247
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,303
Huh...

248
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:55,103
Please tell them what happened to your lighter.

249
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:00,003
It's not only the magnet.

250
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,903
There's a whole lot of adhesive stuff

251
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:03,903
on the glass part in back of the plate.

252
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,303
Adhesive stuff?

253
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:07,903
Yeah. If the turtle gets stuck here,

254
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,203
I don't think it'll be able to move.

255
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:12,203
But, how was the turtle put there?

256
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:13,603
Food!

257
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,703
-Food... -Huh?

258
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,803
Right!

259
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,403
If you sprinkle a little iron sand on the food,

260
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:22,503
so that the turtle will stick onto the back of the plate,

261
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,303
the turtle will float up along the glass

262
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,903
from the bottom of the aquarium to eat it,

263
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:29,003
since turtles have a keen sense of smell.

264
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:33,103
Thus, it'll fall right into the trap that Kid had set up.

265
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,303
The chandelier was probably rigged

266
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:37,403
to sprinkle the food,

267
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:39,603
and when the carpet was used to hide the aquarium,

268
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:42,203
this trick was launched.

269
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,703
The body of the turtle is about ten centimeters.

270
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,303
Which means the size of the plate would be enough

271
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,103
to hide the body of the turtle,

272
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,603
so that it couldn't be viewed from the front.

273
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:56,003
In other words, he was among the men

274
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,103
who assembled the aquarium.

275
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,503
Just as would be expected of the magician under the moonlight.

276
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:02,803
He's pretty good.

277
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,403
This is no time to be amazed.

278
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:07,203
Huh? Hold it a second.

279
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,903
If the turtle was stuck behind the plate,

280
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:11,703
why isn't it there now?

281
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,803
We drained the water out and looked all over for it.

282
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,803
Somebody secretly tore it off

283
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:18,303
and is hiding it in his pocket.

284
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:19,903
Ridiculous!

285
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,003
We body checked everybody here already, you know?

286
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,803
There's just one person

287
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:27,403
that wasn't body checked.

288
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,803
Are you talking about me?

289
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,803
Come to think of it,

290
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,903
you seem to have bigger breasts than my daughter.

291
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:37,203
Ran's breasts are authentic!

292
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,203
She isn't hiding anything!

293
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,703
The person who's hiding something is...

294
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:43,503
the person who before the body check got his cheek pinched

295
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,903
confirming that he wasn't Kid in disguise.

296
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,403
You, Uncle Jirokichi.

297
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,203
If it were you, Uncle, who in order to check

298
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,603
if the turtle with the gem really disappeared,

299
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,903
had the wire net of the aquarium opened

300
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:03,103
and got on the ladder to look inside it,

301
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,003
you could've torn off the turtle with the gem

302
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,103
that was stuck to the glass

303
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:09,703
and hide it into the inner pocket of your top, no?

304
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:11,703
Your body would've blocked it from view,

305
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,203
so that the people behind couldn't see it.

306
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,003
So, I'm searching you!

307
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:28,603
There's the turtle!

308
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:34,203
Thank God. It looks okay.

309
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:35,903
Then, are you the Thief Kid?

310
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,703
No! I can explain.

311
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:40,303
Explain?

312
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:41,803
Just what do you have to explain?

313
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,903
The reason is Thief Kid's card

314
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,303
that was stuck on the floor at Uncle's feet.

315
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:51,503
I think this is what was written on the card.

316
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:52,503
It's hard to believe that

317
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:54,503
a turtle covered with synthetic diamonds that stick to magnets

318
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:58,703
is really carrying the genuine Blushed Mermaid on its back.

319
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:00,603
The name of the turtle comes from the sea God

320
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,803
in Greek mythology, Poseidon.

321
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:05,803
But if its owner were an Italian actress,

322
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,803
it's most likely that she would've named it

323
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:10,103
after the sea God Neptune, of Roman mythology.

324
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,603
If you don't want anyone to know

325
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:14,103
that you bought such a fake turtle with a gem on its back

326
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,903
at such a high price,

327
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:19,603
it's best that you retrieve it secretly.

328
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:22,503
Is that so?

329
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,303
Yeah, this is that card.

330
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:27,803
It's more or less as Sonoko has said.

331
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,403
That's why you kept repeatedly telling us

332
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:32,903
to get everything and everybody out.

333
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,703
I felt sorry for the turtle in my pocket.

334
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,303
And? Where's Kid?

335
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:39,703
I wonder.

336
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,003
Everything was rigged to be moved

337
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:44,003
by using a remote controller from a distance.

338
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,603
And, you were probably operating it amidst the crowd

339
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:48,403
that avalanched to the entrance.

340
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:49,903
I'm sure that Kid's skipping home tonight

341
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:53,203
looking all smug about it.

342
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:57,203
But, you're fantastic, Sonoko.

343
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:59,303
It's been a while since you've been a Deduction Queen.

344
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:01,503
Well, sort of...

345
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,503
I don't remember a thing, though.

346
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:06,003
Could it be that if I work my right brain too much,

347
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:08,803
my left brain passes out?

348
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:12,503
You go on ahead.

349
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:15,303
If you're going to the restroom, I'll go too!

350
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:17,203
But...

351
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,603
Don't you think your deduction a while ago,

352
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,303
wasn't sufficient?

353
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:23,403
Ever if it were possible to hide the body of the turtle

354
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:25,903
behind the plate using that trick,

355
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:29,703
the long necklace that was attached to the gem

356
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:32,303
would've hung down out of the plate.

357
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:35,903
I think that Kid himself also had a strong magnet.

358
00:17:36,603 --> 00:17:39,903
So, he used the magnet to stick

359
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,403
the claps of the necklace against the glass,

360
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:44,503
spun it right around then let it go.

361
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:45,603
In this way, I think he stuck it

362
00:17:45,603 --> 00:17:48,303
onto the magnet of the plate and hid it.

363
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,803
But when did he do something like that?

364
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,303
When else than the time he hid the aquarium

365
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:54,903
from everybody's view using the carpet.

366
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:58,403
That's probably also when he stuck the card

367
00:17:58,403 --> 00:17:59,903
at Uncle Jirokichi's feet.

368
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:01,803
Since the people who were wrapped up

369
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:03,803
in the carpet were in a mess,

370
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,403
even if Kid were to be among them,

371
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,803
or was doing something,

372
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,703
no one would've suspected him, see.

373
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,703
Oh, I see.

374
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,103
As proof of this,

375
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:13,903
the moment Ran opened her cell phone,

376
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:17,003
didn't it go pitch black?

377
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,903
As for the cell phones that fold in half,

378
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:21,403
there are phones that open and close using magnets.

379
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,203
So, I think that back then,

380
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,703
there was someone holding a strong magnet nearby.

381
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,803
That's why I think Ran's phone mistakenly thought that

382
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:31,803
it was closed after detecting the strong magnet

383
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:34,003
and the liquid crystal display switched off, no?

384
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:38,503
But back then the people who were near Ran were...

385
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:43,203
Me, Sonoko and you...

386
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,603
Thief Kid.

387
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:02,203
Hey, what was that sound?

388
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,703
It came from the men's room next door, didn't it?

389
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,403
I wonder if something happened?

390
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:08,503
Hey...

391
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,303
That was...

392
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:15,803
When did you realize it was me?

393
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:18,203
It was the magnet that I mentioned just a while ago.

394
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:20,103
When Ran opened her cell phone,

395
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:23,703
the one closet to her at that time was you.

396
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,103
Back then, you were holding the magnet

397
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,803
in your left hand, weren't you?

398
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:32,103
Well, unless you pinched gramps Jirokichi's cheek to start with,

399
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,403
and proposed that everyone get into groups

400
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:35,603
and do a body check,

401
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:38,203
this trick wouldn't have worked out.

402
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,303
But, thanks to all of that,

403
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,903
I was convinced that you were Kid.

404
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:46,803
Our physique is quite the same, I think, though.

405
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:49,103
You were surprised when Ran and Sonoko asked you to join them

406
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,503
when doing the body check,

407
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,703
and you thinking that you were older than them

408
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:55,903
was because you thought that Sera-san

409
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,203
was a boy from the year above, right?

410
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,403
Since normally they'd call a boy in their own class

411
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,403
with the honorific kun,

412
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,203
not Sera-san.

413
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,603
Are you saying...

414
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,303
Don't tell me she's a girl?

415
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:11,503
Yeah.

416
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:15,603
Well, I owe you one in the Bell Tree Express incident,

417
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,603
and you didn't steal anything this time either,

418
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,003
so I guess I'll let you go.

419
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,203
I mean, I would.

420
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,503
Huh? What do you mean?

421
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,503
Why you how dare you use the stun gun on me?

422
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:45,003
Come to think of it, her underwear was really low-rise.

423
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,003
Sera, your underwear...

424
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,203
You're totally exposed!

425
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,203
Darn.

426
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:11,403
Well, at least I got this back.

427
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,703
But, how did you end up being caught

428
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:17,203
in the men's room?

429
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:18,403
Huh?

430
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,503
Well, you see...

431
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:45,703
What? You went into the men's room

432
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,903
because the ladies room was crowded?

433
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,203
No joke?

434
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,703
But, I wanted to do my thing quickly.

435
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,503
I don't look like a girl to begin with anyway.

436
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:58,103
So I can't blame Kid for making a mistake.

437
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:59,803
That reminds me.

438
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:03,103
Didn't you say something about that hat?

439
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,103
Yeah.

440
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,603
I wanted to ask you

441
00:23:05,603 --> 00:23:09,103
if you saw a suspicious man when you picked this up.

442
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:10,303
Not really.

443
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:14,103
Is it your favorite?

444
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,403
Yeah, my older brother who passed away,

445
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,603
used to wear hats like this all the time.

446
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,203
So, I'm copying him and...

447
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,203
But...

448
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,603
as to this hat that you picked up,

449
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,303
it seems that it's molded into the shape

450
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,103
that he used to leave behind on hats.

451
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:36,103
Although something like that is never possible.

452
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:52,803
"Next Episode"

453
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,003
This is...

454
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:55,303
Huh?

455
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,503
A dying message?

456
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:01,403
The perp is a person whose name starts with the character Na.

457
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:02,803
Please let me help.

458
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:05,203
I want to help in the investigation however I can.

459
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:08,803
Huh? Nana was killed?

460
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,203
No problem at all.

461
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:13,203
We've already arrested the perp.

462
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,203
Okay. Now everything's fallen in to place.

463
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,603
Next Conan,

464
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:21,503
"A Mail of Happiness Brings Misfortune"

465
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:38,903
Next Conan's Hint:

466
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,703
"Right and Left"

467
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:42,703
You sure got beat up this time.

468
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:44,703
The women around you are all strong, aren't they?

469
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,503
Now you know.
