1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
"Nihonbashi"

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,740
Confirmed M.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,040
His cell phone is ringing.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,540
Hello, Mouri's here.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,240
Yeah, Nihonbashi Post Office.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
I got it!

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,840
The man on the phone told me

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,640
to pick up the stuff at the post office.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,840
And, he says I gotta make it there in 5 minutes.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,040
Let me through.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,140
M is going south down Chuo Boulevard.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,140
I came to get my stuff that's supposed to be here.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,240
Yes, sir, I.D. please.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,040
This case started 5 days ago.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,340
The culprit designates pops?

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,440
Cherry blossom viewing on a boat turns out to be a surprising case.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,640
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:10,395
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 1)"

23
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:14,895
Bye! See you. Take care.

24
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,195
The employees of a company called New Image

25
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,995
that exclusively handles import of American cars,

26
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:22,595
are attacked one after the other

27
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,095
and are seriously injured.

28
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:31,495
And the president of New Image receives a threatening call.

29
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,695
24,000,000 yen?

30
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:35,995
You must be kidding.

31
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:42,095
I see.

32
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:46,395
So, 24,000,000 yen is the amount that fits just right into the briefcase.

33
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,895
Hey, Conan.

34
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,195
What're you doing in a place like this?

35
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,395
I went to the department store with Ran,

36
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:57,395
but happened to see pops running by.

37
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,295
Mr. Mouri is on duty right now,

38
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,495
so don't bother him, okay?

39
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:01,495
Okay.

40
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:07,995
Miwako. Did I keep you waiting?

41
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:08,995
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,595
I sure did.

43
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,195
I mean, it's your treat today, okay?

44
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:16,095
What? I mean, I always treat you, don't I?

45
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,995
Did you say something just now?

46
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,795
No, I didn't.

47
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,195
So shall we get going, then?

48
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:25,195
I guess so.

49
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,795
Put the money in this briefcase.

50
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,095
Throw away your cell phone.

51
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,695
I'll contact you with this transceiver.

52
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,595
Get on the Hanami Cruise Liner departing

53
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:46,495
at 05:45 pm from the foot of Nihonbashi.

54
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,195
Dispose of the microphone you're using to keep in touch with the police.

55
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:55,195
M is headed again north on Chuo Boulevard.

56
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,195
Roger.

57
00:04:58,795 --> 00:04:59,795
Conan.

58
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,695
This is the memo that pops threw away.

59
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:04,495
I think it has something to do with your job.

60
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,895
Thank you. Be careful and go home.

61
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,795
Directions from the culprit are written on this memo.

62
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:14,995
Inspector Megure.

63
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,895
According to the culprit's memo,

64
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:19,595
they're going to be making contact using a transceiver from now on.

65
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:23,395
It says for him to get on a cruiser from Nihonbashi.

66
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:26,195
Well, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

67
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,495
Are you Mr. Ishida?

68
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,695
Yes.

69
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:33,695
We thought you weren't going to come anymore.

70
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:35,195
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:41,195
I'm sorry everyone, for making you wait.

72
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:43,495
Okay, since everyone's on board,

73
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,195
we'll start off.

74
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,795
The cruiser that M is on board has departed.

75
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,295
Sir.

76
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:03,695
The boat that just left is a cherry blossom viewing cruiser, isn't it?

77
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,595
Where is it going?

78
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:09,495
That's going to Sumida River then to Ooyoko River.

79
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,495
Would you like a pamphlet?

80
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,095
Thank you.

81
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:15,295
"Spring Cherry Blossom Viewing Cruise"

82
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,095
But, inspector...

83
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:23,695
Why did the culprit designate me to bring him the money?

84
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,095
The thing is, I don't really know.

85
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,695
Don't you have any idea why?

86
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,195
No, not at all.

87
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,995
He's also demanding that the police pull out completely.

88
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,295
He saying that if we ignore his demand,

89
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,395
the life of the employees are at stake.

90
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:42,295
Since I got ready the 24,000,000 yen that he's demanding,

91
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,295
so I'll leave it to you now.

92
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,995
I can't afford to endanger the lives of my employees.

93
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:48,495
I understand.

94
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,595
You can count on me, Kogoro Mouri.

95
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:01,195
We will be entering Sumida River in about 10 minutes,

96
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,695
but the waves will be getting rough

97
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:05,195
so please take care not to fall off.

98
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,295
See, take a look at that.

99
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,095
Wow, it looks like something that would come out in the movies.

100
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:19,395
Tokyo viewed from the river is quite nice too, isn't it?

101
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,895
Sendai bori that is up ahead is called so

102
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:25,595
because the Sendai clan in the old days made it.

103
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,095
Is that right?

104
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:35,495
The cruiser that M is on board sailed under Minato Bridge just now.

105
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,395
The culprit's planning to get the money somewhere along the river.

106
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,595
Keep your eyes open.

107
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,595
Roger.

108
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,595
The waves of the transceiver

109
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,195
works only in a range of at most, 100 meters.

110
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,895
The culprit should be somewhere in this range.

111
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,095
Sato, where are you now?

112
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,795
We're waiting right across Eitai River.

113
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:55,795
We confirmed with the cruiser company

114
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:59,695
and found that it's supposed to go from Sumida River to Ooyoko River.

115
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:02,995
You two go on ahead to Ooyoko River.

116
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:03,995
Roger.

117
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,995
Wow. How wonderful.

118
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,495
Amazing.

119
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:15,895
It's about time you start working for me.

120
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,995
That cruiser is headed for Oojima water gate

121
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,795
and will be going into Ooyoko River.

122
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:25,295
Then, put the briefcase on the roof of the cruiser.

123
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:27,695
Put it in the center so that it doesn't fall.

124
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:30,895
Then, go back to your seat and wait for the next contact.

125
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:42,495
It's not rolling anymore.

126
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,495
Ooyoko River is a canal, that's why.

127
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:48,795
A local feudal lord made this by order of the Edo Shogunate.

128
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,095
Amazing.

129
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,095
That brat...

130
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:04,195
Don't you get in my way, brat!

131
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,595
Lower your head!

132
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:10,195
That was close!

133
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,095
During high tide, water level rises, that the bridge gets so low,

134
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,195
we can't go under it even on this cruiser.

135
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:18,695
I see.

136
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,695
Well, I guess you don't bow so often or lower your head really low

137
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:23,395
and turn it into a good experience while you're at it.

138
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,395
What did you say?

139
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,895
The briefcase is on the roof.

140
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,595
It's impossible to pull the briefcase

141
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,995
up from the bridge in this crowd people.

142
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,195
Besides...

143
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:54,695
With so many surveillance cameras all over the place, the more so.

144
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:13,695
Did you wait long?

145
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:18,395
That was close.

146
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,995
M has entered Heikyu River.

147
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,995
The briefcase is on the roof of the cruiser.

148
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,495
What? Keep your eyes on the cruiser!

149
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,595
Roger!

150
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:57,095
I'll go get the car.

151
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,595
The briefcase is gone!

152
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,146
The briefcase is gone!

153
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,346
Conan? What brings you here?

154
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,846
The briefcase is gone!

155
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:58,146
-What? -What?

156
00:11:58,146 --> 00:12:00,446
Bad news! We've got to contact the inspector.

157
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,646
Darn!

158
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:07,446
Pops!

159
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:10,246
Pops! We've got trouble!

160
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,046
Shut up! Don't bother me!

161
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:14,646
The briefcase on the roof is gone!

162
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:15,646
What?

163
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,446
It's gone! It's gone! It's gone! It's gone!

164
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,846
Hey, look out, sir!

165
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:27,046
The briefcase is gone!

166
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:31,846
Mr. Mouri!

167
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,446
How'd he do it?

168
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:39,646
How on earth the culprit take the briefcase?

169
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,246
"Mouri Detective Agency"

170
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:50,946
In other words,

171
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:53,746
you got instructions over the transceiver?

172
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:57,346
To put the briefcase on the roof after entering Ooyoko River?

173
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,346
Yes...

174
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,446
Yes.

175
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:04,846
You got nothing, no directions, after that?

176
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:05,846
No.

177
00:13:07,846 --> 00:13:12,146
And, by the time you realized it, the briefcase was gone?

178
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:15,146
Yes, sir. Because he told me to go back to my seat

179
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,246
and wait for further contact.

180
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,646
What a shame.

181
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:20,246
And, Conan...

182
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:23,346
When did you last see the briefcase?

183
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:24,946
Well...

184
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:27,946
Over here. Totomi Bridge here.

185
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:32,646
The last we saw of it was Shiomi Bridge here.

186
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:38,346
And you realized that the briefcase was gone at Hamazono Bridge here.

187
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:42,846
In other words, the culprit would have had to take the briefcase

188
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:45,546
from somewhere between Heikyu Bridge and Hamazono Bridge.

189
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:48,646
Mr. Mouri, was there anything you noticed?

190
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,146
I'm very sorry.

191
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,646
It seems like I've caught a cold

192
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,746
That's obvious.

193
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:58,846
Oh, right.

194
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:02,746
Bback then, I heard a metallic sound of something banging onto steel.

195
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,046
A metallic sound?

196
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,846
If I remember correctly, somewhere around here...

197
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,446
I think it was a small bridge.

198
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:15,246
There were two small boats anchored under the bridge.

199
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,146
Were there people on the boats?

200
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,246
No, no one.

201
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:22,546
I heard the sound when the skipper veered the cruiser to the right

202
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,146
to avoid the boats and sailed under the bridge

203
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:27,846
What was that?

204
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,646
Maybe we hit a bridge?

205
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,046
No way.

206
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:33,246
If so the cruiser should sway more.

207
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,846
I see.

208
00:14:35,846 --> 00:14:38,346
That was probably Shigure Bridge.

209
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:41,246
When we were watching from Shiomi Bridge,

210
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,646
Heikyu Bridge was in sight,

211
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,546
but there were no boats.

212
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:48,946
Besides, Ishihama Bridge just ahead of Shigure Bridge

213
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:51,146
has a water gate right behind it.

214
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,846
I don't think you'll get the impression of it being a small bridge.

215
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,346
I see.

216
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,946
The next bridge is already Hamazono Bridge

217
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,846
so I'm sure that there's no doubt that the metallic sound

218
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:03,846
was heard at Shigure Bridge.

219
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:06,646
But, I wonder if that metallic sound

220
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,946
has anything to do with the case we're dealing with now?

221
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:10,946
Inspector Megure.

222
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:14,346
This was found near the water of Heikyu Bridge.

223
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:16,746
That's...

224
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:20,246
Mr. Mouri,

225
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,946
is this the briefcase?

226
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,746
No mistake, that's it!

227
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,546
Open it and confirm the inside too.

228
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,146
May take a look?

229
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:42,746
Pops, the cloth of the lid of the briefcase is ripped.

230
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:43,946
What?

231
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,446
According to forensics,

232
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,846
just as Conan has mentioned,

233
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,846
the inside of the lid has been ripped off,

234
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,246
and further inside,

235
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:54,646
there seems to be a trace of something having been rigged onto it.

236
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:55,646
What?

237
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:58,146
Then, does that mean that the culprit used whatever it was

238
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:00,346
that was rigged on to it, to take the briefcase?

239
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:03,546
No, we don't know that yet...

240
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,346
Mr. Mouri?

241
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,746
Dad.

242
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,946
Inspector.

243
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:13,446
I've figured out how the culprit had taken the briefcase.

244
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,546
Mouri.

245
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:16,846
He's not nasal anymore?

246
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,046
Rats.

247
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,946
It flashed upon me, that my nose suddenly unplugged.

248
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,646
Never mind that, but inspector...

249
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,546
The culprit probably used a strong magnet.

250
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,246
Magnet?

251
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,046
The characteristic of Ooyoko River

252
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:34,146
is that the water level greatly changes during high and low tide.

253
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:37,546
The distance between the bridge becomes very narrow.

254
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,346
The culprit probably checked the time

255
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,946
that the water level rises beforehand

256
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:47,446
and rigged a strong magnet onto the lid of the briefcase.

257
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:49,646
By doing so, when the cruiser sails

258
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:51,946
under the extremely narrow space of the bridge...

259
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,246
Wait a minute.

260
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,946
There are many bridges,

261
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:59,146
so there's no way of telling which bridge it would attach too, no?

262
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:04,946
No. So the culprit used an electromagnet

263
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:07,046
that would generates magnetic force at his convenience.

264
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:11,546
The electromagnet that is made by wrapping

265
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,846
a coil around a magnetic material generates magnetic force

266
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:16,146
only when electric current is applied to the coil.

267
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:19,346
The culprit probably embedded in the lid of the briefcase

268
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:21,946
an iron bar wrapped with coil and a battery.

269
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:26,646
Then, he installed a remote control switch that enables remote operation.

270
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,446
Finally, after everyone left,

271
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,146
he switched off the power and retrieved the briefcase.

272
00:17:57,046 --> 00:18:00,246
Okay! Based on Mouri's deduction,

273
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,846
re-investigate the vicinity of Ooyoko River and Heikyu River.

274
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:04,946
-Yes, sir. -Yes sir.

275
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,746
Geez, dad...

276
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:13,446
Your cold will get worse if you sleep in a place like this.

277
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:17,446
I wonder why the culprit designated pops?

278
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:18,946
I wonder...

279
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:22,646
The papers of the cases that pops handled are still here, aren't they?

280
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:25,646
Yeah, I think they're filed.

281
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,746
Maybe we'll be able to figure something out by looking at those files.

282
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:36,146
Maybe that culprit is somebody who has a grudge against dad?

283
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,546
Could be.

284
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:54,546
Is anything wrong, Ran?

285
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,846
No, it's nothing.

286
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:00,246
I was just thinking that if it were Shinichi,

287
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:03,146
he would immediately solve a problem like this.

288
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,646
Don't worry.

289
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,746
I'll solve it for you.

290
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,446
Just as would be expected of a member of the Youth Detective Squad.

291
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:15,746
Then, shall we solve it, the two of us, in place of dad?

292
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:16,746
Yes.

293
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,646
The keyword is New Image.

294
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:24,546
I'm sure that it has something to do with New Image and pops.

295
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:29,446
"Mouri Detective Agency"

296
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,846
I found it.

297
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,446
Isn't this it?

298
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:51,146
This.

299
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,946
Satoshi Nishizawa, 32 years old.

300
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:58,846
Mechanic engineer for New Image, an import car dealer.

301
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:02,546
There is a request from Kaori Ida, 37 years old,

302
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:06,046
to find the person who has been stalking her.

303
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:07,446
As a result of the investigation,

304
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,446
it becomes apparent that the stalker is Nishizawa.

305
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:12,746
There was a court order prohibiting him from going close to her.

306
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:15,946
Thus, he was fired.

307
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:18,446
This is a case of 2 months ago.

308
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,646
What's his address?

309
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,646
Fukagawa, Koto ward.

310
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,546
Isn't this near Ooyoko River?

311
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,546
Yes.

312
00:22:58,946 --> 00:22:59,946
This way.

313
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:06,346
It's that apartment, isn't it?

314
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:07,346
Yes.

315
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:15,346
Mr. Nishizawa. Are you in?

316
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:16,946
Mr. Nishizawa!

317
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:21,546
It seems he's not in.

318
00:23:21,546 --> 00:23:22,546
Yes.

319
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:26,946
It's open.

320
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:33,046
Mr. Nishizawa, aren't you home?

321
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,846
Mr. Nishizawa!

322
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:41,646
Conan.

323
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,746
No, Conan.

324
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:55,046
You shouldn't go into other people's houses without permission.

325
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,846
Wait, Ran.

326
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,146
Look.

327
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,146
It's all the way up to the brim of the bath tub.

328
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,946
Nishizawa committed suicide.

329
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:17,246
Even if it may not be something too convenient for you?

330
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:20,246
I can see it wasn't an easy job. So, keep it.

331
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:23,646
Well, I'm sure we'll eventually come up with an answer.

332
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,546
But, no yellow flower looks to be in sight.

333
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:28,246
I have someone in mind.

334
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:29,546
You mean Nishizawa didn't do it

335
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:31,346
and he didn't commit suicide?

336
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,646
Next Conan,

337
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:36,846
"Sumida River Night Cherry Blossom Route (Part 2)"

338
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:54,546
Next Conan's Hint:

339
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:56,946
"Flower viewing boat".

340
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:58,446
Dad, are you okay?

341
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:00,446
I guess he'd like to run to see cherry blossoms,

342
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:01,846
but the only thing that's running is his nose.
