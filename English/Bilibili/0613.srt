1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.540
Talking of names.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.740
There's a strange story regarding our names.

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.140
About your names?

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.640
I heard that the birth mother

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.440
of the late Shinichi who died in Tokyo,

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.540
was ordered to change his name just before

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.340
she was about to register his birth.

8
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.740
Just before?

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.640
Yes. At first, his name was the kanji character read Hitoshi.

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.040
Why was his name changed?

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240
If I remember correctly,

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240
Shinichi told me that it was because

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.640
father said that the name Hitoshi was too simple and changed it.

14
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.640
It's true that there are only a few number

15
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940
of strokes in the Kanji Hitoshi, so it's simple but...

16
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.040
And if Takako were a boy,

17
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.940
the kanji character "kou" and "ki"

18
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.040
would've been applied.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.340
If Yoshiya were a girl, his name would've been Yuka

20
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.440
with the kanji characters "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

21
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.540
If Tomoaki were a girl, his name would've been Chiharu

22
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.140
with the kanji characters "knowledge" and "spring"

23
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.440
Are the names really those that Chairman Tsunechika chose?

24
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.340
Yes. The late Keiji, Miwako and Saki all said the same thing.

25
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.940
There seems to be some kind of secret behind the names.

26
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.140
-Yes. -But is it true that

27
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.840
the story about the culprit being among us, the adopted children,

28
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.640
and that the person is using the demon dog

29
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.740
to eradicate the bloodline of the Inubushi family?

30
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.240
We don't know that for sure yet

31
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.440
but it's for sure that someone is using a trick

32
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.140
to commit serial murders!

33
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.840
We've already got hints as to the demon dog trick

34
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.940
that's being used too!

35
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.440
What's with this piece of cloth?

36
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.340
It was on the ground near the place Tomoaki

37
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.740
was attacked by the demon dog!

38
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.440
There are no burnt remains or smell of oil

39
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.540
but it's for sure that it was used for something.

40
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.140
If you had such evidence on you,

41
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.340
why didn't you take it to the police right away?

42
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.440
Ta... Takako.

43
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.040
We... we were just about to take it to the police.

44
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.940
And, Miyuki.

45
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.240
The kettle was left boiling on the portable stove, you know!

46
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.340
Oh, I'm sorry!

47
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.540
I was planning to go right back, you see.

48
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.240
Okay, I guess it's time for us to go eat dinner.

49
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.540
I guess so. Before eating,

50
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.640
I'd like to ask the guys who were back at the house

51
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.440
what they were doing too.

52
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.540
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

53
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.040
You must be true to yourself.

54
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.540
The mystery is completely solved in.

55
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.640
The last chapter of the demon dog series.

56
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

57
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

58
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

59
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.790
The previous head of the household of the Inubushi family,

60
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.290
Tsunechika died five years ago,

61
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.790
and the present head, widowed Satomi is bed-ridden.

62
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.090
If she passes away, the vast estate

63
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.390
will be inherited by the eight adopted children.

64
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.890
However, the adopted children

65
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.690
die bizarre deaths one after the other.

66
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.090
Could it be the curse of the demon dog engulfed in flames

67
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.790
that is attacking the Inubushi family?

68
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.090
And the demon dog finally appears in front of our eyes.

69
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.990
What is the identity of the monster engulfed in flames

70
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.490
that attack humans?

71
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.890
Who on earth is the one that is manipulating the demon dog?

72
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.990
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

73
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.990
"(Princess Chapter)"

74
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.190
Hey, Ran. Can you solve this problem?

75
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.990
"Wear glasses and think it out" is the hint, right?

76
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.390
What're you guys doing?

77
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.990
We're watching a rerun of a quiz program

78
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.090
that is aired late at night.

79
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.990
It's pretty interesting.

80
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.890
Why don't you go to bed? It's after 01:00 already.

81
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.090
The bed is made in the guest room, right?

82
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.490
But, figuring that the demon dog is nearby somewhere.

83
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.990
We're too scared to sleep!

84
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.590
Come on.

85
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.790
Can you decipher this code then?

86
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.090
If you do, I'll hit the sack for you!

87
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.390
Maybe Conan can decipher it! He's wearing glasses besides.

88
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.190
This means that the katakana character of "glasses" (megane).

89
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.890
You change the "me" of this code to "ne".

90
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.390
The cat in the attic!

91
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.090
I see! Megane means glasses,

92
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.490
so you gotta change "me" to "ne" and read it.

93
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.590
I see.

94
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.290
So, this is what the trick of the demon dog was about.

95
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.690
If so, the culprit is...

96
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.590
It couldn't be anyone else but that person.

97
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.890
What? You mean, mother?

98
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.790
She collapsed?

99
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.190
Yeah. It seems that she tried to get out of under the covers.

100
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.390
Since Takako heard a strange sound in the corridor,

101
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.790
she went inside the room

102
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.190
and found Satomi lying on the floor in front of the drawer?

103
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.390
-Yes. -It was just when I left to go to the restroom.

104
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.690
I wonder how something like this could've happened.

105
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.690
Something's on the floor.

106
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.990
They're the beads from the prayer beads.

107
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.990
Tears.

108
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.890
Hey.

109
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.190
She holding on to eight beads.

110
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.590
Only the fourth bead from the top is a small bead.

111
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.890
Eight. Beads. Dog.

112
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.690
I see. It's that story.

113
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.990
In other words, Satomi knew...

114
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.790
Who among the people here was the serial killer!

115
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.790
Hey. Kazuha.

116
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.090
Kazuha!

117
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.290
What's up?

118
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.490
Will you go to the restroom with me?

119
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.490
Okay!

120
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.190
Geez. You're not a kid,

121
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.390
so can't you go to the restroom alone or what?

122
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.290
But, I was attacked by the demon dog in the yard here, you know.

123
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.990
If you think that it may appear in the house this time,

124
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.290
it's scary, right?

125
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.190
By the way, how come you're awake yourself, Pops?

126
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.490
I'll bet you're concerned too, dad?

127
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.290
After all you saw the demon dog too.

128
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.690
Sort of.

129
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.790
The glasses kid and the young detective from Osaka

130
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.490
seem to be fast asleep, though.

131
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.790
Of course!

132
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.290
They were saying something like

133
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.390
they've figured out who the culprit is so...

134
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.390
They've...

135
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.690
they've figured out who the culprit is?

136
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.890
You mean they've figured out the culprit

137
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.590
that is among the adopted children?

138
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.290
Yes, although they didn't tell us who it was.

139
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.990
They seemed to have come up with a clue

140
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.390
after hearing about the names of the adopted children!

141
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.190
Heard about the names?

142
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.090
Like Miyuki's name used to be Tamaki.

143
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.190
If Takako were to be born a boy, her name would've been

144
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.190
using the kanji characters "think" and "season".

145
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.390
If Yoshiya were born a girl, his name would've been Yuka,

146
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.390
using the kanji characters of "Yuten Temple" and "flower".

147
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.390
If Tomoaki were a girl,

148
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.890
his name would've been meaning "know spring", pronounced Chiharu.

149
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.490
Oh, and Shinichi who died in Tokyo

150
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.790
seems to originally have been named "Jin"

151
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.690
using only one kanji character.

152
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.290
Oh.

153
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.090
I wonder if it has something to do with the prayer beads

154
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.290
that Satomi was holding firmly a while ago, after all?

155
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.290
She was holding prayer beads?

156
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.290
It seems she deliberately got out of bed

157
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.890
and was holding the prayer beads that she took out of the drawer!

158
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.790
On top of that, the string seems to have been cut

159
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.390
and there seems to have been only eight beads on the string.

160
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.390
Eight beads?

161
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.390
Maybe it's some kind of fortunetelling or something?

162
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.090
But, I wonder if there was any type of fortunetelling

163
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.290
that used eight beads?

164
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.390
No. It's not fortunetelling, but rather, a story.

165
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.990
A story?

166
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.590
Eight beads and a demon dog

167
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.990
and judging from the names of the people here in the family,

168
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.890
the only possibility is the "Eight Dog Chronicles"!

169
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.290
Eight Dog Chronicles?

170
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.790
What's that?

171
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.490
Is it a story that'll help us find something?

172
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.490
You mean you don't know?

173
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.990
It's a famous novel of large volume that was

174
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.490
written by Bakin Takizawa, a great writer in the Edo Era!

175
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.990
Attacked by the enemy, Yoshizane Satomi,

176
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.890
who saw the fall of the castle before his eyes,

177
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.590
tells his beloved dog Yatsufusa,

178
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.890
"If you get me the head of the enemy Shogun,"

179
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.690
"I will give my daughter Princess Fuse to you."

180
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.790
Hearing this. Yatsufusa raids the enemy quarters

181
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.190
and really brings back the head of the enemy Shogun.

182
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.290
Princess Fuse, after saying,

183
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.690
"Be it a dog, a Monarch should always keep to his words,"

184
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.490
"goes along with Yatsufusa and confines herself into the mountains."

185
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.290
This is how the first part of the story goes.

186
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.390
What? What's with the dog?

187
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.490
I guess it's cursed.

188
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.090
Exactly!

189
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.290
The fact is, Yoshizane became the castle lord

190
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.790
after killing the treacherous retainer

191
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.590
who killed the original lord of the castle.

192
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.490
When Tamazusa, the wife of the retainer who was killed,

193
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.590
was to be beheaded she left behind the following words.

194
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.390
"Even if I were to perish, my soul will remain as a ghostly spirit"

195
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.190
"and curse the Satomi family for generations to come!"

196
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.090
Which means that the dog was cursed

197
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.690
by this person called Tamazusa?

198
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.490
Yeah. The curse that was placed on Yatsufusa vanished

199
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.490
thanks to the sutra that Princess Fuse kept reading for him but...

200
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.090
And... And?

201
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.790
What happened to the princess and dog after that?

202
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.390
Yoshizane orders his vassal,

203
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.490
"Get rid of the cursed dog and rescue Princess Fuse."

204
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.690
However, Princess Fuse who tries to protect Yatsufusa,

205
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.690
loses her life.

206
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.190
At that time, eight beads from the prayer beads

207
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.690
that the princess had on her, flew to the heavens.

208
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.890
Then, eight warriors with the names of a dog

209
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.890
from various districts caught the beads,

210
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.090
and each of them started off with their checkered lives from then on.

211
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.390
That's the way the Eight Dog Chronicles go.

212
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.090
But how do the names connect?

213
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.790
Each of the eight beads had one kanji character inside it.

214
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:24.090
Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

215
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.890
"Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei"

216
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.190
These Jingihakou kanji characters that you see here!

217
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.790
But, those kanji characters aren't included

218
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.990
in the names of the people of the Inubushi family!

219
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.490
Shinichi's name used to be "Jin" read Hitoshi,

220
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.490
but it seems to have been changed because the name was too simple.

221
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.190
It's not because it was too simple.

222
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.890
He avoided it because he didn't like, what you see is what you get!

223
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.190
If you add the person radical

224
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.090
to the two horizontal lines in the character "ichi",

225
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.290
it will make the kanji character "Jin".

226
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.590
True.

227
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.890
I see! So, it's not what it actually looks like

228
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.390
but he divided the kanji character into parts

229
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.390
and included them in the names!

230
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.490
In Takako's name, the top radical of the kanji character of "kou"

231
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.890
and the kanji character "ko" were combined

232
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.790
to make the kanji character "kou".

233
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.990
In case she were to be a boy, the name Kouki

234
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.690
has the same kanji parts in it!

235
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.590
Then, in Yoshiya's case, the radical and the last flick stroke

236
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.790
in the kanji character "ya"

237
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.090
combines to make the kanji character "rei".

238
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.990
In Tomoaki's name, the hikari in his name was removed

239
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.490
to make the kanji character "chi".

240
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.390
In the case of the late Keiji, the kanji character derived would be "chu",

241
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.590
Miwako, "gi",

242
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.590
Saki, "shin",

243
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.090
and Chairman Tsunechika, "tei".

244
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.990
Then, Satomi is called "princess"

245
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.990
because by combining the kanji character "woman"

246
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.890
that is at the bottom of "sato" and "mi",

247
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.090
the kanji character "princess" is made, right?

248
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.990
Right! I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika

249
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.990
loved Eight Dog Chronicles,

250
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.790
so he inserted the characters inside the beads,

251
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.790
to the names of his children!

252
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.890
But what about Miyuki?

253
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.790
I wonder what character it is?

254
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.190
It seems the name she had before she was adopted

255
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.190
was read "Miyuki" but written with one kanji character.

256
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.390
Then, there's no mistake who the culprit is.

257
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.190
If you remove the top most horizontal line in the

258
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.490
kanji character "Miyuki Tamaki"

259
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.990
and combine it with the name she previously had...

260
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.290
It becomes "Tamazusa"!

261
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.390
That's the name of the ghostly spirit that cursed the Satomi family

262
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.290
-in the Eight Dog Chronicles! -What?

263
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.790
Oh, no!

264
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.090
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

265
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.990
who is manipulating the demon dog

266
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.490
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

267
00:13:30.637 --> 00:13:32.937
Are you saying that Miyuki is the serial killer

268
00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.737
who is manipulating the demon dog

269
00:13:34.737 --> 00:13:36.937
and attacking the people of the Inubushi family?

270
00:13:36.937 --> 00:13:39.637
Yeah. She's probably reenacting the role of Tamazusa

271
00:13:39.637 --> 00:13:42.337
and each time she kills an adopted child,

272
00:13:42.337 --> 00:13:44.037
she leaves a round thing behind at the

273
00:13:44.037 --> 00:13:45.737
site of the crime as proof of what she did.

274
00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:47.437
That can't be!

275
00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:49.837
Miyuki is a nice person.

276
00:13:49.837 --> 00:13:51.537
Just because she's a nice person,

277
00:13:51.537 --> 00:13:54.337
it doesn't mean that she's not the culprit.

278
00:13:54.337 --> 00:13:55.937
Oh, no.

279
00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:58.937
Heiji! Heiji, say something!

280
00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:01.337
Miyuki's not the culprit, is she?

281
00:14:01.337 --> 00:14:02.537
Huh?

282
00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:04.637
Heiji's not here.

283
00:14:06.237 --> 00:14:09.137
-Conan's not here either! -No joke!

284
00:14:09.137 --> 00:14:10.637
Hey.

285
00:14:10.637 --> 00:14:14.237
Didn't Miyuki tell you that she was going to do something tonight?

286
00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:18.337
She said that she was going to Satomi's room to vigil over her.

287
00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:19.937
She was going to tell Satomi not to sneak out

288
00:14:19.937 --> 00:14:21.937
from under the covers again.

289
00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:27.037
What? Miyuki's whereabouts are unknown?

290
00:14:28.137 --> 00:14:31.137
I thought that a vigil would be tough for her

291
00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:33.137
so I came into the room to take her place,

292
00:14:33.137 --> 00:14:34.937
then I found this letter.

293
00:14:34.937 --> 00:14:37.037
A letter?

294
00:14:37.037 --> 00:14:39.437
I will atone for all the crimes I've committed

295
00:14:39.437 --> 00:14:42.537
in the hut where I raised the demon dog.

296
00:14:42.537 --> 00:14:44.137
Miyuki.

297
00:14:44.137 --> 00:14:47.237
-Oh, no. -It can't be.

298
00:14:47.237 --> 00:14:48.937
Miyuki...

299
00:14:48.937 --> 00:14:50.437
She is the culprit?

300
00:14:50.437 --> 00:14:52.637
Why would she...

301
00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:08.437
Isn't that scooter Miyuki's?

302
00:15:08.437 --> 00:15:12.937
Hey. Don't tell me that gasoline is leaking from it.

303
00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:16.637
And? Who's going to go check?

304
00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:18.537
Not me!

305
00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:20.437
I'm not going either.

306
00:15:20.437 --> 00:15:23.037
Mr. Detective, you go.

307
00:15:23.037 --> 00:15:26.337
If Heiji were here, I'm sure he'd charge in there.

308
00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:30.037
True. I wonder where Conan went too.

309
00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:38.237
-What? -Demon dog? It's appeared!

310
00:15:39.537 --> 00:15:41.137
It's heading for the hut!

311
00:15:41.137 --> 00:15:44.637
Hey, if the gasoline catches fire, the hut and all will blow up.

312
00:15:47.137 --> 00:15:49.137
Conan?

313
00:15:49.137 --> 00:15:51.837
-No good! -Run for it!

314
00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:06.937
See, it's okay! There's nothing to be afraid of.

315
00:16:06.937 --> 00:16:08.937
Huh? It's not burning.

316
00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:11.537
It's just red.

317
00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:16.837
Besides, what's that cloth that's on the dog?

318
00:16:16.837 --> 00:16:20.237
-Virtual flames! -Heiji.

319
00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:21.737
Virtual flames?

320
00:16:21.737 --> 00:16:22.737
"Virtual flames" -It was used on the set

321
00:16:22.737 --> 00:16:26.037
of the TV quiz program that you guys were watching too, right?

322
00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:28.437
It's a fake flame that was created by shining red LED light

323
00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:33.037
on glossy cloth that is made to flutter in the wind!

324
00:16:33.037 --> 00:16:35.037
The same with that dog!

325
00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:38.737
The cloth is wrapped around it so that when it runs,

326
00:16:38.737 --> 00:16:40.137
the cloth flutters in the wind.

327
00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:41.537
And a red LED light was wrapped into the cloth

328
00:16:41.537 --> 00:16:45.137
to make the dog look like a demon dog engulfed in flames!

329
00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.837
If you turn the light off using a remote controller,

330
00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:49.737
the dog will vanish too, you see!

331
00:16:49.737 --> 00:16:53.137
Then, how do you explain the fire footprints?

332
00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.737
Okay, watch closely!

333
00:16:54.737 --> 00:16:56.137
A disposable lighter is rigged

334
00:16:56.137 --> 00:16:58.637
so that the place where the gas is in, is left opened

335
00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:01.137
and a piano line is attached to it!

336
00:17:01.137 --> 00:17:05.137
Which means that the thing I smelt when I fell

337
00:17:05.137 --> 00:17:07.137
was the smell of the gas of the lighter?

338
00:17:07.137 --> 00:17:10.637
Yeah, gas is originally odorless,

339
00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:12.137
so since it's dangerous left that way,

340
00:17:12.137 --> 00:17:13.937
they're made to smell like rotten onions!

341
00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:15.737
When you guys were attacked by the demon dog

342
00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:17.437
at the Inubushi residence,

343
00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:22.137
because you fell, this lighter got stuck in the ground

344
00:17:22.137 --> 00:17:23.637
and that's why the fire footprints

345
00:17:23.637 --> 00:17:25.737
were cut off only in that spot!

346
00:17:25.737 --> 00:17:29.737
But, no matter if gas is emitted, if there's no fire...

347
00:17:29.737 --> 00:17:32.037
The charcoal stove that is inside the wire netting

348
00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:34.737
on the dog's tail is what kindled the fire!

349
00:17:34.737 --> 00:17:37.237
With this on, when the dog moves on top of the lighters,

350
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:38.837
the fire will grow larger and larger.

351
00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:42.037
I'm sure that this dog wasn't attacking people

352
00:17:42.037 --> 00:17:45.037
but rather was just following the smell of the lighters

353
00:17:45.037 --> 00:17:47.237
that the culprit lined out on the ground.

354
00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:51.237
But, after we were attacked in the yard of the house,

355
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:53.837
we saw no lighters like that on the ground.

356
00:17:53.837 --> 00:17:56.037
The culprit set it up so that the dog could

357
00:17:56.037 --> 00:17:58.437
hold the edge of the piano line in its mouth and return.

358
00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:00.237
After the demon dog disappeared,

359
00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:01.437
the clattering sound that you heard,

360
00:18:01.437 --> 00:18:04.037
which looked like the fire was hopping was that.

361
00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:08.837
Running with this many lighters attached to a piano line,

362
00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:11.137
the lighters would get stuck to the bumpy ground

363
00:18:11.137 --> 00:18:13.037
and make that sound.

364
00:18:13.937 --> 00:18:16.737
But, when Tomoaki was attacked,

365
00:18:16.737 --> 00:18:19.937
his arm caught fire and he got burned, didn't he?

366
00:18:19.937 --> 00:18:23.137
Of course he got burnt.

367
00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:26.737
Because he set himself on fire.

368
00:18:27.537 --> 00:18:29.437
He did it in order to make it look like

369
00:18:29.437 --> 00:18:32.237
the demon dog was really engulfed in flames!

370
00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.237
Then, is Tomoaki the culprit?

371
00:18:35.237 --> 00:18:39.137
But, wasn't he attacked by the demon dog?

372
00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:42.837
All the dog did was pounce on its owner

373
00:18:42.837 --> 00:18:44.837
because it was happy!

374
00:18:44.837 --> 00:18:46.637
While we were in the hut checking things out,

375
00:18:46.637 --> 00:18:48.737
he lined the piano line with the lighters attached to it

376
00:18:48.737 --> 00:18:50.337
that he had hidden in his bag on the ground,

377
00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:51.937
then, he used his dog whistle

378
00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:53.737
to summon the dog that he had as a pet

379
00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:55.937
and kept in another hut!

380
00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.637
After frolicking with the dog

381
00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.037
and falling over a blind spot of the bank,

382
00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:01.737
he turned off the light of the dog and made it go home

383
00:19:01.737 --> 00:19:04.337
then set fire to his arm!

384
00:19:04.937 --> 00:19:07.437
He put the onion on the spot then,

385
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:10.037
to camouflage the smell that Kazuha smelt!

386
00:19:10.037 --> 00:19:13.537
Which means that the letter left behind by Miyuki

387
00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:16.137
that said she would atone for the crimes she committed...

388
00:19:16.137 --> 00:19:19.237
That's probably what Tomoaki wrote!

389
00:19:19.237 --> 00:19:22.537
In order to frame Miyuki up as the culprit!

390
00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.237
Then, where is Miyuki?

391
00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:27.637
She was put to sleep and in that hut,

392
00:19:27.637 --> 00:19:29.937
so we moved her to another place.

393
00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:34.137
Miyuki was looking for something over here with Tomoaki so...

394
00:19:34.137 --> 00:19:37.037
I think she was asked to go look for Satomi's medicine

395
00:19:37.037 --> 00:19:40.137
that Tomoaki said he dropped when he was attacked

396
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:42.537
by the dog or something.

397
00:19:42.537 --> 00:19:44.937
Were... were you watching?

398
00:19:44.937 --> 00:19:49.037
Yeah. I chased you from the house, so I figured it out right away.

399
00:19:49.037 --> 00:19:53.237
You took Miyuki who you put to sleep, over to the hut

400
00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:55.137
to make it look like she committed suicide

401
00:19:55.137 --> 00:19:57.737
by burning herself along with the demon dog.

402
00:19:57.737 --> 00:20:00.137
Oh, no.

403
00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:04.237
No use playing dumb!

404
00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:06.937
Because the dog will never forget its owner!

405
00:20:06.937 --> 00:20:09.137
And the reason Hachi barks at you

406
00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:12.037
is probably because you smell like this dog.

407
00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:14.937
Besides, Satomi knows all about it!

408
00:20:14.937 --> 00:20:17.237
-What? -Well, you lied saying that

409
00:20:17.237 --> 00:20:19.137
you were by her side watching over her right through

410
00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.837
to establish your alibi,

411
00:20:20.837 --> 00:20:23.137
although it was obvious that your lie would be revealed in time.

412
00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:25.937
Satomi was holding the black fourth bead

413
00:20:25.937 --> 00:20:29.337
from the top of all the eight beads.

414
00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:31.937
It corresponds to the fourth name Chi,

415
00:20:31.937 --> 00:20:34.437
when read in order of Jin, Gi, Rei, Chi, Chu, Shin, Kou, Tei.

416
00:20:34.437 --> 00:20:38.237
In other words, the person who comes fourth Chi, is you, the culprit!

417
00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.737
The traces of tears on Satomi's cheeks was probably because

418
00:20:40.737 --> 00:20:43.537
she wanted you to be the first to discover what she was doing,

419
00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:46.437
so that you could turn yourself into the police.

420
00:20:46.437 --> 00:20:51.237
It was because she didn't want you to commit anymore crime.

421
00:20:53.037 --> 00:20:57.037
I didn't want to let go of

422
00:20:57.037 --> 00:21:00.437
that castle-like Inubushi residence!

423
00:21:03.537 --> 00:21:08.237
But the inheritance tax was too high.

424
00:21:08.237 --> 00:21:12.737
That's why in order to increase the amount of inheritance, I...

425
00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:15.437
I just couldn't give up the house filled

426
00:21:15.437 --> 00:21:18.637
with memories of mother Satomi who was kinder than my birth mother.

427
00:21:18.637 --> 00:21:21.537
Not that castle.

428
00:21:21.537 --> 00:21:26.537
I just couldn't bear giving up that castle!

429
00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:53.437
Well, I did it again, good work for me.

430
00:22:53.437 --> 00:22:57.737
He spit everything out in the interrogation room!

431
00:22:57.737 --> 00:22:59.637
He said he killed the four

432
00:22:59.637 --> 00:23:02.337
because they were not cooperative to keeping the castle.

433
00:23:02.337 --> 00:23:07.137
But, didn't Shinichi give up his right to inheritance?

434
00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:08.837
He said that he wanted to make it look like

435
00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:10.237
it was the doings of Tamazusa,

436
00:23:10.237 --> 00:23:12.637
rather than killings committed because of inheritance trouble.

437
00:23:12.637 --> 00:23:14.637
He seems to have honestly thought that

438
00:23:14.637 --> 00:23:19.337
Miyuki was Tamazusa who came to destroy the castle.

439
00:23:19.337 --> 00:23:21.237
Because Satomi collapsed

440
00:23:21.237 --> 00:23:24.637
while she was out gathering mountain vegetables with Miyuki.

441
00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:26.937
Oh, no.

442
00:23:26.937 --> 00:23:30.337
I'll protect this castle!

443
00:23:30.337 --> 00:23:32.037
Miyuki?

444
00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:33.737
Because after all,

445
00:23:33.737 --> 00:23:37.037
I'm the princess of this castle, just like mother!

446
00:23:37.037 --> 00:23:39.437
Well, although unlike mother.

447
00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:42.137
You're a pretty crude princess.

448
00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:46.537
My, how rude!

449
00:23:46.537 --> 00:23:48.537
No, you're both the same.

450
00:23:48.537 --> 00:23:50.037
If you combine the kanji character "fuse" of Inubushi

451
00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:54.037
and the character "hime" (princess) in your names...

452
00:23:54.037 --> 00:23:56.937
Both are read "Princess Fuse"!

453
00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:00.737
The sound of a piano playing.

454
00:24:00.737 --> 00:24:03.637
Composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

455
00:24:03.637 --> 00:24:05.737
Air on the G string.

456
00:24:08.637 --> 00:24:11.337
Hey, we're in trouble! The culprit's still here!

457
00:24:11.337 --> 00:24:13.037
At any rate, we'd better get out of here!

458
00:24:13.037 --> 00:24:15.237
But, we've got to save that boy!

459
00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:17.937
You guys, stay close to me!

460
00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:20.237
If we split up, we don't stand a chance.

461
00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:24.137
Next Conan,

462
00:24:24.137 --> 00:24:28.175
"The Secret Played by the Diary (Part 1)"

463
00:24:29.164 --> 00:24:31.264
Next Conan's Hint:

464
00:24:31.264 --> 00:24:33.764
"Map"

465
00:24:33.764 --> 00:24:34.964
In the next episode, we will be challenging

466
00:24:34.964 --> 00:24:36.564
solving the mystery evolving around a diary at a villa

467
00:24:36.564 --> 00:24:38.018
where the sound of a piano playing is heard!
