1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,940
There was a history of calls received on Saki's cell phone

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,940
from the Inubushi family?

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,040
Yeah. About two hours before she fell off the cliff.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,640
So the more suspicious

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
the remaining for adopted children are becoming.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,740
It could be that they asked her to go out for sudden urgent shopping

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,340
delaying the time she comes home.

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,840
Then, after the surroundings get dark,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,640
they made the dog attack her, you know.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,840
Huh? Isn't it three? Miyuki has an alibi, so...

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,140
Miyuki is also suspicious!

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,840
If she were to make the dog attack,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,540
she could do so even if she's with us so long

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,440
as she blows the dog whistle secretly.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,240
After all, she was right below the cliff too!

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,840
The only one in that house that's not suspicious is

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Satomi, who's bed-ridden!

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,040
You... how come you're acting like you're in charge of this place?

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,940
Are Mr. Mouri's assistant just like Conan, or what?

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,440
Well, I guess you could put it that way.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,240
Like a keep saying, cut out that assistant stuff.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Swollen eyes touch the heart.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,340
Tears are the start of all dramas.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,040
The mystery of the footprints of the demon dog.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
Engulfed in flames and the balls left behind.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

29
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:01,685
A clan cursed by a dog, the Inubushi family.

30
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,385
After the previous head of the household, Tsunechika

31
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,185
passed away five years ago,

32
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,885
the present head of the household, Satomi is also bed-ridden.

33
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:13,285
If she dies, the eight adopted children

34
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,185
will inherit the vast estate of the Inubushi family,

35
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:20,585
but, they are dying bizarre deaths one after the other.

36
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,985
We went out to investigate the incidents,

37
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:27,685
but the fourth victim fell before our eyes.

38
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,485
Footprints of fire were found here and there

39
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:33,185
at the site of the crime.

40
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:37,785
Could it be that a demon dog engulfed in fire actually exists?

41
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,385
Are the serial killings occurring at the Inubushi residence

42
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:43,285
the doings of a cursed demon dog?

43
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,585
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

44
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:50,585
"(Footprints Chapter)"

45
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:54,085
He's cute.

46
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:58,485
Yes! It would be nice if the demon dog is this way too.

47
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,085
What's the matter?

48
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,585
What's that? Isn't something glowing over there?

49
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:14,785
Yes.

50
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:37,485
Kazuha!

51
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:43,685
Stand up! The front door's right there!

52
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:54,785
What's all the fuss about?

53
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,285
The demon dog!

54
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,585
The demon dog appeared in the yard!

55
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,485
-Demon dog? -Don't be ridiculous!

56
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,885
It would never appear inside the premises of the house!

57
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:07,585
Don't tell me it jumped over the fence and came inside.

58
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,385
That's ridiculous.

59
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:12,985
At any rate, it's dangerous,

60
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,985
so I think that you should stay inside for a while.

61
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,085
Hachi's barking.

62
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,385
I wonder if Hachi's going to be okay?

63
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:24,285
We better bring Hachi here!

64
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:27,185
Hey, girls?

65
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:34,785
No matter what angle you look at it from, it's a plain marble.

66
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:37,085
A pachinko ball, ping pong ball,

67
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,285
a round pearl and a marble.

68
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,485
What on earth does the culprit want to say?

69
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,385
It's that, that!

70
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:47,485
A dog and balls.

71
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:53,585
Hey. None of your stupid play on words again now.

72
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,985
You can say whatever you like! I'm all ears.

73
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,885
It could turn out to be a hint!

74
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:05,385
No! It's stupid so I don't think so!

75
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,585
Hey, you! Don't hold out on us! Say it!

76
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:14,085
I won't ever say it!

77
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:22,585
It's true that there are traces of the grass having burned.

78
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,285
The rope that was tied by the edge of the cliff

79
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,985
-had been cut too. -Besides...

80
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,285
The sign has also been pulled out.

81
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,085
The road sign that was beyond the forked road

82
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,085
"Inubushi Residence" -was also knocked down.

83
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:40,185
I see. If chased by a dog in the dark like this

84
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:43,685
without a road sign or a rope,

85
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:48,185
it would send anyone right over the cliff!

86
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:54,485
The problem is the demon dog that attacked, right?

87
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:56,985
There's no such thing as a demon dog!

88
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,185
This is a psychological trick!

89
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,385
It's just being made to look as if

90
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:05,385
a demon dog exists with the story of the cursed dog in the past

91
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,785
and the fire footprints!

92
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:11,385
Fluorescent paint was probably used on the dog to make it glow!

93
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:14,885
-Fluorescent paint? -Yeah!

94
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,485
Since something that usually isn't glowing was glowing,

95
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:20,085
it gave the mistaken impression that something was burning!

96
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,985
Then, what about the fire footprints?

97
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,285
There was no smell of oil, was there?

98
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:28,485
Maybe the fire was set by using a gas burner or something?

99
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,085
What is it, Kazuha?

100
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,285
It's going to take us a little mover time yet,

101
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:37,885
so if you get sleepy, don't wait for us and...

102
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,385
What?

103
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,685
The demon dog appeared at the house?

104
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:48,585
Really? Was the dog really burning?

105
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,485
Yes.

106
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,985
-Right, Ran? -Yes!

107
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:55,785
It wasn't fluorescent paint or anything!

108
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:58,085
Although the fire's gone already.

109
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:01,585
There were fire footprints left where the dog went by.

110
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:06,185
True. There are burnt remains just like we saw on the cliff.

111
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,785
And, where did that dog come from?

112
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,185
From over that side!

113
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,785
These footprints are strange.

114
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:20,785
See, judging from the space of the footsteps,

115
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:23,185
there should be some around here too,

116
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,685
but there's none here at all!

117
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,385
Besides, the ground is messed up only over here.

118
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,685
That's the place you fell, right, Kazuha?

119
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,785
Yes...

120
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:43,685
and when I fell, I smelled something strange.

121
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:46,085
What do you mean strange?

122
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:50,885
Like rotten onions or something. It had a pungent foul smell.

123
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,685
Onions?

124
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:56,885
Oh, and after we evacuated into the house,

125
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:59,285
we came right out again and saw...

126
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,385
It looked kind of alive.

127
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:06,285
Of course! It attacked after all.

128
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:11,885
Oh, no. Not the demon dog, but the burnt footprints.

129
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,185
It seemed to be hopping around while making a clanking sound.

130
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:18,685
You saw it too, didn't you, Kazuha?

131
00:09:18,685 --> 00:09:19,985
I did, I saw it!

132
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:24,285
It looked as though the footprints had souls in them!

133
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,885
It's surprising that you went outside again.

134
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,285
Despite the chances of the demon dog still being there.

135
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:32,085
Yes, but we were worried about Hachi!

136
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,585
We thought the demon dog might eat him.

137
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,085
I've figured out how the demon dog got inside.

138
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,385
The backdoor!

139
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:44,485
The door was unlocked and opened,

140
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:47,185
and there were the footprints of a dog there too.

141
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:50,285
In other words, the culprit who let the demon dog in

142
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,585
through the backdoor and into the house

143
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,985
is most likely among the four of you

144
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,685
who were in the house at that time!

145
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:02,685
Because bed-ridden Satomi couldn't have done it.

146
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,385
Ran and Kazuha.

147
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:08,985
You said you went outside to feed Hachi,

148
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,685
but who asked you to do so?

149
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,585
Miyuki.

150
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,685
Oh, but she told us that the other three people

151
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,885
refused to feed the dog.

152
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:21,385
Maybe she knew beforehand that we'd be feeding the dog.

153
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,585
Well, it's certain that

154
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:27,185
someone is keeping the demon dog near this house.

155
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,385
Right.

156
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,985
If it wasn't close by, the person couldn't make the dog

157
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:34,885
attack Ran and Kazuha all of a sudden.

158
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,585
Do you have any idea who it could be?

159
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,885
Like you heard a dog bark in the woods or something.

160
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,885
Come to think of it.

161
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,985
Miwako, the second one who died had asked me

162
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:48,185
to go check a strange hut

163
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:51,385
where she heard the barking of a dog.

164
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:55,585
But, I was scared that I didn't go inside.

165
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:56,985
What?

166
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:58,085
Where is that?

167
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:02,685
I think it was near the swamp where Miwako drowned.

168
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,385
Take us there right away!

169
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,785
-Now? -If you take us now,

170
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:09,485
we may be able to figure out the demon dog trick!

171
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,385
True.

172
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:13,185
If the culprit is among somebody here,

173
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:16,585
there was no time to get rid of the evidence.

174
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:21,685
But I'm on duty tonight and have to go back to the hospital.

175
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:25,485
After we check the hut, I'll drive you back by car!

176
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,885
It's probably frightening to walk through the forest alone

177
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,285
and go back to the hospital besides.

178
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:33,585
But... back then, I just followed Miwako,

179
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:36,285
so I'm not sure where the swamp is.

180
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,885
I'll take you to the swamp!

181
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:44,285
I know the forest by heart and it's not too far from here!

182
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,890
So, this is that swamp.

183
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,590
Is it true that there was fire around this swamp?

184
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,690
Yeah. Although it was just burned traces here and there.

185
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,190
And? Where's the hut?

186
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,990
Well...

187
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, there! That worn out hut is it!

188
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,090
Okay, so let's go raid the demon dog's nest!

189
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,690
Please watch your step!

190
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,490
This swamp seems to be made of quicksand.

191
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,290
Aren't you going?

192
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,890
Of course not! I'll wait in the car!

193
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,590
Is that so?

194
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,890
What the heck is this?

195
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,790
This place is packed with books on black magic!

196
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,890
Even a magic circle is drawn on the floor.

197
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,690
There's no mistake that someone was keeping a dog here.

198
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,890
But, who on earth could it be?

199
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,490
That someone cast a curse on the dog here.

200
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,790
Idiot! If people can commit murder by casting curses,

201
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,490
detectives will go out of business!

202
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,090
But, Ran and her friend say they saw...

203
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,790
So, like I said before that was some kind of a trick...

204
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,290
What?

205
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,090
-Don't move! -Stay still!

206
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,390
Are you all right?

207
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,190
He was just a little burned, that's all.

208
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,190
By the way, what we just saw...

209
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,090
Demon dog, wasn't it?

210
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,490
What? It came out again?

211
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,890
The demon dog appeared again?

212
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,490
Yeah. It's already the third time tonight.

213
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,290
Was the dog really on fire?

214
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,690
Isn't it some kind of a trick?

215
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,490
Yeah. We thought so too.

216
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,590
But no matter how you look at it...

217
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,590
I think it was really burning!

218
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,890
It's body was engulfed in flames.

219
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,590
Everywhere the dog walked, there were burning fire footprints.

220
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,890
Furthermore,

221
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,490
Tomoaki was attacked by the demon dog

222
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,090
and his arm was on fire, and now he has a burn.

223
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,790
Are you all right?

224
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,190
Yes, I used the first aid kit I had in my bag and treated it so...

225
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,790
But, I called the hospital to tell them

226
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,190
to find somebody else to take my place tonight.

227
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,690
Why did you get out of the car?

228
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,990
I got scared waiting by myself after all.

229
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,390
The question is this onion that was found

230
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,190
near where Tomoaki was attacked!

231
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,990
Another round thing?

232
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,790
What on earth are you talking about?

233
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,990
Come to think of it, you mentioned that

234
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,890
when you fell fleeing from the demon dog,

235
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,590
you smelled rotten onions.

236
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,490
Yes. Maybe the demon dog and onion is connected somehow?

237
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,490
And? Do the police have any idea

238
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,290
who the person manipulating that demon dog is?

239
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,790
I'm planning to call forensics in the morning

240
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,390
and check out that suspicious hut.

241
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,990
I don't think that the culprit will be caught though.

242
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,790
-What? -Why not?

243
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,890
Because we're up against a black magic magician, you know?

244
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,690
How could we just normal civilian officers

245
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,790
possibly stand up to somebody like that?

246
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,190
I mean I would really like to get of here

247
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,290
as soon as possible if I could!

248
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,690
Black magic?

249
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,090
We found it in the hut!

250
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,690
A whole lot of those books.

251
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,590
I'd like to ask you just in case.

252
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,490
At the time we encountered the demon dog,

253
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,990
all of you were in the house, correct?

254
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,190
I was on the phone right through

255
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,890
making arrangements for Saki's funeral.

256
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,590
I was chatting on the computer with my survival game friends.

257
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,990
Survival game? That survival thing?

258
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,290
Yeah. I'm an instructor at a camp nearby.

259
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,990
And I play the survival game with my friends once a month!

260
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,990
Then, you must know this forest pretty well too.

261
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,390
I guess so.

262
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,790
But, I'm not as good as Miyuki

263
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,690
who used to go pick mountain vegetables together with Satomi.

264
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,690
And, is Satomi still doing the same?

265
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,790
Yes. She was asleep in her room.

266
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,790
Oh, come to think of it, where are Heiji and Conan?

267
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,490
I haven't seen them for a while.

268
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,090
I'll bet they were shocked that they're dazed out somewhere.

269
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,790
They believed that the demon dog was a trick

270
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,690
and yet they saw it with their own eyes, you see.

271
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,390
Oh, there they are!

272
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,990
They really looked dazed out.

273
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,090
Let's just forget all the bad stuff!

274
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,390
Right! Right! In this world there are strange things

275
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,090
that you just can't understand no matter how hard you try!

276
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,790
Strange things that you just can't understand?

277
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,790
Just what are you talking about?

278
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,790
You know, like the demon dog!

279
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,390
You guys saw too, didn't you Heiji? The monster on fire!

280
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,490
Dad also said that he saw footprints of fire left behind too.

281
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,490
Yeah.

282
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,990
As for the trick of the footprints of fire,

283
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,290
from what you said about the smell of rotten onions when you fell...

284
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,290
And right after the demon dog disappeared,

285
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,390
what you said about seeing a thing on fire hopping around

286
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,890
with a clanking sound,

287
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,490
we figured out approximately what happened!

288
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,190
What?

289
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,790
The footprints of fire were always about 20m.

290
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,490
There were traces of something being dragged along too!

291
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,990
But, the thing I had to really rack my brains to figure out

292
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,990
-was the burning body. -Yeah.

293
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,190
How the culprit engulfed the dog's body in flames

294
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,090
so that the dog would pounce on Tomoaki

295
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,390
and injure him with burns with the attack?

296
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,090
If the dog were wrapped with a cloth and really set fire to,

297
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,690
there should be the burnt remains of a dog nearby.

298
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,290
If the culprit used an extinguisher or something

299
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,990
to put the fire out,

300
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,890
the equipment used should be nearby too.

301
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,590
If the culprit waited in the car for the dog to come back

302
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,490
and extinguished the fire on the bed of the car or something,

303
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,890
there should be traces of that left behind too.

304
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,090
There were no traces of tire marks nearby

305
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,690
nor any sound of an engine running.

306
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,090
Where did the dog disappear to in the first place?

307
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,090
If it were burning, when we ran over to Tomoaki,

308
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,290
we should've seen it somewhere.

309
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,990
The dog wasn't around?

310
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,190
No. It's as if it were swallowed by the darkness.

311
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,490
Swallowed?

312
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,090
Are you saying it was swallowed by the dark?

313
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,590
-Wanna eat? -What?

314
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,790
Eat?

315
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,490
Oh, I'm talking about dinner.

316
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,890
Would you like me to reheat it if you're going to eat?

317
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,290
-I'll eat! -I'm starved!

318
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,790
I'll get to it right away, then.

319
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,490
Oh, I want to ask you something.

320
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,490
Do you have something that crosses your mind

321
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,090
when you think of round things or balls?

322
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,090
Round balls?

323
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,090
The culprit is always leaving round balls

324
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,990
back at the scene of the crime, right?

325
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,790
The Inubushi family and round balls, is there a connection?

326
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,990
The thing that comes to mind

327
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,890
when I think of the word "tama" (ball)

328
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,990
is my original last name Tamaki.

329
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,290
My nickname when I was a child was also Tama-chan.

330
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,090
Tama-chan?

331
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,290
But just because of that, don't say that I'm the culprit, now!

332
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,490
I'm not called by that nickname here either so...

333
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,890
Do you know the last name of all the others?

334
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,790
No. I'm the last one who was adopted and came here.

335
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,690
Come to think of it, you're much younger

336
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,490
than anybody else here, no?

337
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,990
Yes. It seems that I came here

338
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,990
when my father Chairman Tsunechika was in his mid 50's.

339
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,490
As for my name, at first,

340
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,190
one kanji character was taken from my father's name,

341
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,890
and Chikae was supposed to be my name.

342
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,690
But mother didn't like it, so I got my present name.

343
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,090
Mother used to hate father.

344
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,390
She used to say she was deceived by a rich man

345
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,690
and then disposed of.

346
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,390
Then why did you come here?

347
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,390
You must've hated it if all she did was complain to you.

348
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,890
To be honest, I had no intention of coming here either.

349
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,290
But, a while after my mother fell ill and passed away,

350
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,990
I received a letter from my father.

351
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,190
-A letter? -It said, I'm not doing well.

352
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,690
If you're going to forgive me,

353
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,390
come to the Inubushi family and protect the princess for me.

354
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,190
The others seem to have received a similar kind of letter too.

355
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,690
-Princess... -Who is it about?

356
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,390
Isn't it about Miyuki?

357
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,690
Because she has a kanji character in her name that reads "princess".

358
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,890
Idiot! Who'd send a letter to the princess herself

359
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,590
asking her to protect the princess?

360
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,390
I didn't know who it was about at first either,

361
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,090
but after coming here, I found out

362
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,490
it was about Mother Satomi right away!

363
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,390
After all, all the helpers were calling her princess.

364
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,590
Why was she called princess?

365
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,790
I was told that father used to always call her that way.

366
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,190
Mother used to laugh and tell him to stop

367
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,390
because it embarrassed her.

368
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,490
Could it be because this house looks like a castle?

369
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,190
That's right.

370
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,790
I'm sure that Chairman Tsunechika felt like a King himself!

371
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,690
My name is written using the kanji character "kou" which mean happiness

372
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,090
and read "Miyuki"

373
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,390
but mother recommended that

374
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,390
I add the kanji character "princess" to my name.

375
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,490
It isn't read "hime" (princess) to begin with anyway.

376
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,390
Did you change your name?

377
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,990
Yes. Mother told me, "Let's both be "princess" together

378
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,090
and live in this castle smiling all the time.

379
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,990
Oh.

380
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,090
Talking about names.

381
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,390
There's a strange story regarding our names.

382
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,090
About your names?

383
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,090
The culprit is among the remaining adopted children.

384
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,290
Who on earth is the culprit that's manipulating

385
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,090
the burning demon dog and killing the adopted children

386
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,490
of the Inubushi family one after the other?

387
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,590
Mother collapsed?

388
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,490
Something's on the floor.

389
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,390
It's a bead from the rosary.

390
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,990
This is...

391
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,690
Eight beads?

392
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,990
Could it be some kind of fortune-telling?

393
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,990
No. It's not fortune-telling.

394
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,990
-Demon dog? -It's appeared!

395
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,890
Next Conan,

396
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,190
"Inubushi Castle, The Ablazed Demon Dog"

397
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,953
"(Princess Chapter)"

398
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:18,117
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:19,517
"Japanese Rosary"

400
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:21,317
Bite the burning dog!

401
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:22,417
What? How scary.

402
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,796
-Like hot dog. -Hold on.
