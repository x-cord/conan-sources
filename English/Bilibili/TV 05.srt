1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,380
The CIA has taken actions, right?

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,220
It seems like we are under their watch,

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,310
but he said not to worry.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,730
Is that Japanese reliable?

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,850
Yes.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,080
After all, he's Japan's legendary hitman.

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,000
But he's not cheap.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,790
Isn't that the saying, "Nothing can't be fixed with money," right?

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,130
Yea.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,800
This time, I'll let that guy understand

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,260
there's something in this world that's far worse than death!

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,990
I don't know anything!

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,140
I only drove the truck out of the port.

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,690
They didn't even tell me where to go!

15
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,940
Who hired you?

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,920
I've told you! I don't know!

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,130
All the instructions came over the phone!

18
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,400
Aren't you known as "The Courier Joe"?

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,470
Why would a pro like you agree to do

20
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,000
such a risky job just through one phone call?

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,380
I didn't know at all there were bombs in the truck!

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,050
Stop lying!

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,770
(Detective Conan
The Disappearance of Conan Edogawa: The Worst Two Days in History)

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,810
I'm a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

25
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,490
While visiting an amusement park with Ran Mouri,
my childhood friend and classmate,

26
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,120
I witnessed a man in black in the midst of a suspicious transaction.

27
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,810
Totally caught up in watching the deal,

28
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,200
I failed to notice his partner sneaking up behind me.

29
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,520
That man forced me to ingest a poison.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,090
When I woke up,

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,730
my body had shrunk!

32
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,970
If those guys found out that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

33
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,650
they'd come after me again

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,350
and put those around me at risk.

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,270
Listening to Professor Agasa's suggestion, I hid my real identity,

36
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,690
and came up with the alias,

37
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,040
Conan Edogawa, when pressed by Ran.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,500
In order to collect information on those people,

39
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,000
I moved in with Ran, whose father is a detective.

40
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,830
These are my current classmates,

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,250
Genta,

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,300
Mitsuhiko

43
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:45,960
and Ayumi.

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,470
They formed the Detective Boys,

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,680
and even included me into it without asking me.

46
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,460
And

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,220
this guy is Kogoro Mouri.

48
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,330
Needless to explain any further,

49
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,650
these two items are Professor Agasa's inventions.

50
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,070
He invented all sorts

51
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,410
of unique and novel tools for the shrunken me.

52
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,070
The Anywhere Ball Dispensing Belt

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,220
conveniently dispenses

54
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,760
an inflated soccer at the press

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,090
of a button.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,810
By the way,

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,920
other than the professor, there is someone else
who knows my real identity,

58
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,380
Ai Haibara.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

60
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,240
She was originally a member of the Black Organization,

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,950
but she took the same poison I had

62
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,440
when she escaped from the organization,

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,150
and her body also shrunk.

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,050
Haibara thus moved into the professor's house,

65
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,740
and enrolled in first grade with us.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,660
Even though my body has shrunk, I'm still that sharp-minded,

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,210
intelligent, and unbeaten detective!

68
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,420
Only one truth will prevail!

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,790
It's coming, Mitsuhiko!

70
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,170
Nice kick!

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,270
Here I go!

72
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,090
Go!

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,770
Ayumi-chan, look up!

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,210
Nice catch, Ayumi-chan!

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,650
We are not done yet!

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,390
Yeah!

77
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm ready!

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,990
Yesterday around 10 p.m.,

79
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,050
the police received a report that a delivery truck
driving in the residential area

80
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,590
of Haido-cho contained a large quantity of bombs.

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,190
The police investigation found

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,180
that it carried plastic explosives
that are suspected to be smuggled items.

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,400
I cracked my glasses while playing soccer.

84
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,540
I heard of that.

85
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,590
The professor is preparing a new pair.

86
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,610
It's the shoes' fault.

87
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,550
I kicked the ball too hard because of the malfunction.

88
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,640
Talk about my bad luck lately!

89
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,470
- Where's the professor?
- Disguised as cookie cans...

90
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,040
The bath's broken. He's repairing it.

91
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,500
Based on the investigation,

92
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,390
the bombs were found on a foreign cargo ship moored at the docks.

93
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,200
The place where the bombs were found

94
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,920
is pretty close from here, isn't it?

95
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,890
Yeah.

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,260
But it shouldn't be the organization.

97
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,060
They wouldn't make such a mistake.

98
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,130
Well, I hope so.

99
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,090
Sorry!

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,190
Looks like I need more time to fix the bath.

101
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,490
Eh? Use our bathroom?

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,710
Sure you can.

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,710
Why don't we all go to the bath house together?

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,260
The bath house?

105
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,060
It's nice to go to a big bath house every now and then!

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,850
Dad, are you coming with us?

107
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm too shocked to go anywhere.

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,960
Those are just rumors, you know?

109
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,170
But what if it's true?

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,600
Let's go without him.

111
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,610
Conan-kun, would you like to join us in the ladies' side?

112
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,740
Just kidding!

113
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,000
Welcome!

114
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,700
Hey,

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,260
are you done yet?

116
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,860
I need a little longer.

117
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,660
That's a nice feeling, isn't it?

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,860
Hey, Ai-chan, is there a boy you like in school?

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,460
I'll never get romantically involved with a little boy.

120
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,130
I see...

121
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,550
Hey.

122
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,130
Is that locker yours, Oji-san?

123
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,720
No...

124
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,930
Well... I guess.

125
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,570
Little boy.

126
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,310
Did you come here alone?

127
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,730
Conan-kun!

128
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,500
Do you feel lonely there all by yourself?

129
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,220
I'm doing fine!

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,060
I just met someone I know!

131
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,130
Someone you know?

132
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,390
Someone you know, too, Ran-neechan!

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,110
Conan-kun fell?

134
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,100
Yes. A man he knows drove him to the hospital already.

135
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,090
Which hospital?

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,610
I'm not sure. It should be a hospital nearby, I think.

137
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,200
Sorry!

138
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,190
I should have asked them which hospital he was going to.

139
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,120
It's alright. We'll go look for him.

140
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,530
Let's go, Ai-chan!

141
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,650
I thought we were going to the hospital.

142
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,240
That kid saw what was inside the locker.

143
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,180
You are one of us, aren't you?

144
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,510
I'm surprised you can tell.

145
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,340
I heard someone was keeping an eye on things.

146
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,320
Your fierce gaze

147
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,460
gave you away.

148
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,390
What do we do now?

149
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's ask for instructions first.

150
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,530
What are you laughing about?

151
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,470
You are also just a minion who takes orders!

152
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,170
Don't forget that I'm also helping to clean up your mess here.

153
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,230
No wonder you are known as the "Ad-libbing Tatsu."

154
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,340
It's because of your tattoo.

155
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,480
I've heard rumors about you.

156
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,990
No matter what unexpected situations you face,

157
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,100
you can think on your feet

158
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,890
and finish the job successfully.

159
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,010
The "Ad-libbing Tatsu" with a dragon tattoo,

160
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,610
you're famous in the underworld.

161
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,900
I don't know who you are talking about.

162
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,410
Hey...

163
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,370
Who are you guys?

164
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,930
Ah, you hit your head in the bath house.

165
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,750
You are Conan-kun, right?

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,980
Conan?

167
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,720
Do you know your name?

168
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,230
Name?

169
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,880
Professor!

170
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,360
How's Conan-kun doing?

171
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,730
Apparently he wasn't brought to this hospital.

172
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,710
What?

173
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
It's weird, right?

174
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,610
This is the nearest hospital available.

175
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,510
The other hospitals in this neighborhood...

176
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,470
It's from Shinichi!

177
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, I see!

178
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,240
The person he met was Shinichi.

179
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,120
He says his injuries are not severe, so don't worry.

180
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,980
Look.

181
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
(Injuries aren't severe, so don't worry.
We'll go grab something to eat together.)

182
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,010
Ah, really?

183
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,320
That's good.

184
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,830
But sending a message like this is so rude.

185
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,630
If they're having a meal, why not invite us?

186
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,900
- The number you are calling cannot be reached at the moment.
- Hello, Shinichi...

187
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,040
Fine!

188
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,720
Let's go home.

189
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,430
I gave him a powerful sleeping pill.

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,850
He won't wake up any time soon.

191
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,420
I sent a text to the girl, Ran-neechan,
who went to the bath house with him,

192
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,420
so that's settled for the moment.

193
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,560
That boy's memories seem to be in a mess.

194
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,230
If he'd forget about everything, then that would be great.

195
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,250
You are "Locksmith Maru", aren't you?

196
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,120
What's a pro burglar like you doing here?

197
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,790
I just followed directions to pick the locks here
and prepare the sleeping pill.

198
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,980
I'm going back now!

199
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
You can't do that!

200
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,160
Why?

201
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,660
Who knows?

202
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,950
The text says to wait here for orders after putting that kid out.

203
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,860
Damn it.

204
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,370
You don't know who you're working for, either?

205
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,910
The request only came over the phone.

206
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,050
You call this a "request"? Come on!

207
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,690
He's blackmailing you, right?

208
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,500
At any rate, it's best to obediently follow the instructions.

209
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,870
After being in this business for years,

210
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,810
I have this feeling that

211
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,310
whoever is directing us must be someone quite frightening.

212
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,540
Tomorrow morning, Nihorika's Prime Minister Babel will visit Japan.

213
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,630
In the press conference, the Cabinet Chief Secretary talked about
the issues that would be discussed at tomorrow's summit.

214
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,330
Because Nihorika's air attack on Arattan

215
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,600
led to a dangerous situation at the border...

216
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,690
Hey, I'm starving from shock.

217
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,370
Please hurry up and cook.

218
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,100
Just go grab something at Poirot downstairs.

219
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Anyway,

220
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,890
I'm in a terrible mood, so I'm going to bed!

221
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,520
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

222
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,780
She's becoming more and more like Eri.

223
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,110
Come in!

224
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,370
Excuse me.

225
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,050
We're closed for the day...

226
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,710
I see.

227
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,220
I'll come back tomorrow then.

228
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,270
No, no, no!

229
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,140
The policy's different for pretty ladies.

230
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,980
It's okay. You made it just in time!

231
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,210
So you want to find out if your husband's having an affair?

232
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,840
Yes.

233
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,270
He won't admit it,

234
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,170
but I don't believe him because he's been
acting very suspiciously lately.

235
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm limited in my ability

236
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,860
to investigate on my own.

237
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,670
And I don't want to interfere with my job and trouble the company,

238
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,380
so I came to seek your expertise.

239
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,760
I see.

240
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,670
Do you have any idea who he's seeing?

241
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,400
No.

242
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,820
It's just that, when I was tidying up his car this morning,

243
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,380
I could smell a woman's perfume.

244
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,940
What's your husband's occupation?

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,820
He's currently looking for a job.

246
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,400
He's having an affair while letting such

247
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,200
a beautiful wife work to support the family.

248
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,700
How unforgivable!

249
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,850
Understood!

250
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,560
Let's start our investigation at the bath house
where you last saw him!

251
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,760
Okay.

252
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,760
We must move fast!

253
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,820
And after that...

254
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,770
how about having dinner with me?

255
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,300
As expected,

256
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,560
the signal hasn't moved from the bath house.

257
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,190
This means his belongings are still there.

258
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,170
His belongings are still there?

259
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,230
So he's not even dressed?

260
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,810
Let's go.

261
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,840
What? His mother?

262
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,140
Yes, just a while ago. A woman said
she was here for her son's belongings

263
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,050
and that he was fine now!

264
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,710
It's moving.

265
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,220
This speed... She must be in a car.

266
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,110
What is it, Ai-kun?

267
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,440
Follow the signal, Professor!

268
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,110
What about you, Ai-kun?

269
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,940
Just go!

270
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,690
So, let's go over there first.

271
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,570
Good evening!

272
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,340
You are that four-eyed boy's...

273
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,720
Who are you, Onee-san?

274
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,420
Look, I'm busy. Don't disturb me!

275
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,490
I'm hungry.

276
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,540
Then go home.

277
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,790
But the professor isn't home right now.

278
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,660
But he just...

279
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,170
Then let's have dinner together.

280
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,380
Really?

281
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,170
Thank you!

282
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,580
But this will get in the way of our work...

283
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,620
It's alright.

284
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,840
There's nothing to hide anyway.

285
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,160
Let's go.

286
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,030
So this is the building where your husband used to work?

287
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,540
We're moving soon.

288
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,830
He used to work as a handyman.

289
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,900
Please come in.

290
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,350
There are lots of things to throw away,

291
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,430
so we haven't finished tidying up yet.

292
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,000
I see.

293
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,020
This place is pretty convenient for an affair, isn't it?

294
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,030
Your husband looks like an honest man, though.

295
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,010
Men having affairs all seem morally upstanding.

296
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,670
What's in your bag?

297
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,140
Hey!

298
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,250
It's for work.

299
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm a magazine editor.

300
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,940
I have to go back to work later tonight.

301
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,330
That's tough.

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,200
I've got a deadline.

303
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,290
I see.

304
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,900
He's really not here.

305
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,820
Wait a moment!

306
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,630
It's unlocked.

307
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,400
Hey!

308
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,460
Hey!

309
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,920
Don't wander around on your own!

310
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,900
The professor asked me to go home.

311
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,760
What about dinner?

312
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,620
I'll pass.

313
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,520
Ah, Ai-kun,

314
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,760
what are you doing here?

315
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,790
I was just about to ask you that.

316
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,990
I was following the signal, which led me to this building.

317
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,600
Ah, it's coming out.

318
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,330
Let me see.

319
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,220
Hey, are you done yet?

320
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,370
It's the woman at the bath house earlier.

321
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,080
Follow her!

322
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,620
Speaking of which, does working as a handyman

323
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,590
really this profitable?

324
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,460
Since you're able to move into such a high-class apartment.

325
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,960
Who knows...

326
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,040
Detective work shouldn't be too different from being a handyman,

327
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
but actually it's like night and day.

328
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,630
Ma'am!

329
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,490
Yes?

330
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,140
Did you know about this room?

331
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,640
I see, a handyman, was it?

332
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,040
Ma'am,

333
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,390
your husband probably wasn't having an affair.

334
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,610
What on earth is going on?

335
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,610
I don't know, but...

336
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,690
I have a bad feeling about this.

337
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,730
Kondo?

338
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,720
Yeah.

339
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,760
The person who gave me the truck keys warned me

340
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,730
not to make any mistakes,

341
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,270
because the person directing us is Kondo-san!

342
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,430
Kondo, you mean that legendary hitman?

343
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,460
That's just an urban legend.

344
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,950
Can you prove that this person really exists?

345
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,220
The police

346
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,400
will protect me, right?

347
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Come in.

348
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,270
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

349
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,540
What is it?

350
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,150
The number of bombs that we found did not match
the intelligence provided by the CIA.

351
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,460
What? Are you certain?

352
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,870
Yes, we've checked many times already,

353
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,750
but we're still missing a few.

354
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,990
Damn it,

355
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,510
so there are still other bombs out there?

356
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,980
What do we do now, Ai-kun?

357
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,160
I'll go take a look around.

358
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,120
Stay here, Professor.

359
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,740
You've got to be careful!

360
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
I know.

361
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,530
Prepare to move,

362
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
and bring the kid.

363
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,650
Who are you?

364
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,360
It's better for both of us if you don't know.

365
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,950
I only followed instructions to pick up the kid's belongings.

366
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,060
You guys caused this mess!

367
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,510
You even forgot this!

368
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,780
You don't know who you're working for, either?

369
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,380
I have a rough idea.

370
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,450
Who is it?

371
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,520
My work here should be done!

372
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,850
That's right.

373
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,270
All of you here are done.

374
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,300
Let's go, Kondo-san.

375
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,300
Professor! I heard gunshots.

376
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,590
Hurry and call the police!

377
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,300
Gun...Gunshots?

378
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,990
Hurry!

379
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,080
Ai-kun!

380
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,270
Follow that car!

381
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,170
Oh, okay!

382
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,630
Maybe the plan is to use the kid.

383
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,790
"Use"?

384
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,880
This Beetle behind us is really suspicious.

385
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,730
The radar isn't working!

386
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,010
It's malfunctioning again?

387
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,290
Don't get too close.

388
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,180
We can't let them find out we are tailing them!

389
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,500
Understood.

390
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,650
Where exactly are they bringing him?

391
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,160
Don't worry.

392
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,590
If they wanted to kill him, they'd have done it by now.

393
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,890
Professor!

394
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,990
What?

395
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey, that's dangerous!

396
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,070
Ai-kun!

397
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,060
It's this place, right?

398
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,280
Someone probably just mistook the sound of firecrackers for gunshots.

399
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,380
Yeah, it could be it.

400
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,490
Nihorika's Prime Minister Babel landed

401
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,590
at Tokyo Haneda Airport by government plane this morning.

402
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,490
This afternoon, the Prime Minister will visit
the Imperial Palace with his family.

403
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,700
Poor thing.

404
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,310
You'll feel better soon.

405
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,580
Mom and Dad are here for you.

406
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,910
It's alright.

407
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,890
I'll bring you breakfast.

408
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,530
I'm scared...

409
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,670
I'm going to Shinichi's before school.

410
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,500
Jeez!

411
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,940
Someone's in a bad mood today.

412
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,840
Of course!

413
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,250
I went to bed yesterday without eating anything. I'm starving now!

414
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,460
Plus, Conan-kun went off with Shinichi and didn't come back!

415
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,540
I didn't eat anything, either.

416
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,840
Will you cook something?

417
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,780
Like I said, I'm going out now!

418
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,520
Gosh! What an unfilial daughter!

419
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,280
Doesn't even pity her father for working overnight!

420
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,400
Conan-kun's really late...

421
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,800
Ai-chan hasn't arrived, either.

422
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,180
Are they not coming today?

423
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,390
Can't believe it!

424
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,770
We agreed that we'd go to Yokohama together after school.

425
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,660
Yokohama?

426
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,020
We talked about it yesterday during soccer, remember?

427
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,020
The Red Brick Warehouse is having a Kamen Yaiba exhibit,

428
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,110
and the professor will drive us there.

429
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,440
Ah, right!

430
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,680
I hope Conan didn't forget

431
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,590
to ask the professor.

432
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,810
I hope he didn't.

433
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,370
Yeah.

434
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,090
A Kamen Yaiba exhibit?

435
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,370
What do you mean?

436
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,880
Apparently the Prime Minister's children are big fans,

437
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,570
and want to go there.

438
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,350
You've got to be kidding!

439
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,590
It won't be announced as an official activity.

440
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,470
Only his wife and children are going,

441
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,240
the Prime Minister won't be accompanying them.

442
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,680
Where is it?

443
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,440
I heard that it's at the Red Brick Warehouse in Yokohama.

444
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,010
Yokohama?!

445
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,370
Yes!

446
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,070
Jeez, how troublesome.

447
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,910
Alright. Understood.

448
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,180
I'll request assistance from the Kanagawa Prefectural Police.

449
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,300
Now, go back to work.

450
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,090
Yes.

451
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,970
Can't you cook something better?

452
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,090
I'm not a cook.

453
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,230
Is it not good enough for a genius conman like you, Nana-san?

454
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,830
So you know my name.

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,660
You are the genius hacker M indeed!

456
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,660
How did you find out who I am?

457
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,380
I've just found out.

458
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,880
It's about time.

459
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,000
Here's the kid's bag.

460
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,890
To keep his family quiet, precautions have been taken.

461
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,330
What's going on? Why aren't you at school?

462
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,420
Shinichi sent another stupid text,

463
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,030
saying something about going to the Kamen Yaiba exhibit in Yokohama.

464
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,210
Look at this!

465
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,330
Yokohama?

466
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,880
It's a place named Red Brick Warehouse.

467
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,780
I'm going to check it out.

468
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,370
The Red Brick Warehouse...

469
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,640
Eh? So her husband is the legendary hitman?

470
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,280
Yes.

471
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,410
After receiving a request,

472
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,540
he'd eliminate the target

473
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,090
through careful planning

474
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,470
and dispose of the body without a trace.
He's a professional hitman indeed.

475
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,130
Information and notes related to Kondo's crimes

476
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,720
were stacked in her husband's workroom.

477
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,000
Are the articles in this kind of magazine even reliable?

478
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,940
I don't know.

479
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:40,980
Anyway, there was a new document on the table in that room,

480
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,030
containing instructions for bombs

481
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,010
and schematics of the Red Brick Warehouse.

482
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,490
Suspicious, isn't it?

483
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,760
Why not call the police?

484
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,040
We have to find some concrete evidence first.

485
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,180
Otherwise I wouldn't be able to do my job right.

486
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,230
Have you told that madam?

487
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,870
She went to the office for work.

488
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,440
I lost contact with her after that.

489
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,970
How poor she is!

490
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,430
(Injuries aren't severe, so don't worry.
We'll go grab something to eat together.)

491
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,780
Hello, Shinichi...

492
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,370
The number you are calling cannot be reached at the moment.

493
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,230
Poor me, too.

494
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,180
Why are men so selfish?

495
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,250
Gosh!

496
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,800
That's dangerous!

497
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,970
What are you doing?

498
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,320
I was in an accident.

499
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,270
Could you give me a ride?

500
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,900
Sorry, find another car.

501
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
One, two,

502
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,870
Kamen Yaiba!

503
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,840
Even though it was a rush job,

504
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,420
the images from the event are very clear

505
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,420
and the sound is fine too.

506
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,770
The remote activation was already tested at the abandoned factory.

507
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,550
It won't be long before the targets move into position.

508
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,370
And the brat carrying the bomb is just standing there obediently...

509
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,240
But I'm still a bit reluctant.

510
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,120
Is it because the targets are children from the very beginning?

511
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,170
There isn't much of a difference,

512
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,750
but having me press the switch...

513
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,510
Here they come!

514
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
15 meters to go!

515
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,020
It'll explode as soon as I press this button!

516
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,370
10 meters.

517
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,250
7 meters.

518
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,610
5 meters.

519
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,880
Conan-kun,

520
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,800
I finally found you!

521
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,920
Where's Shinichi?

522
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,020
Who are you, Onee-chan?

523
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,380
3 meters.

524
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,230
2 meters.

525
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,360
1 meter.

526
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,820
0!

527
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,840
You don't like the food?

528
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,750
No...

529
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,880
You don't love me anymore?

530
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,140
Why would you ask that?

531
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,160
You've been acting weird these days.

532
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,890
I'm a little concerned.

533
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,150
You think too much.

534
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,890
Sorry for making you worry.

535
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,900
Is it marriage blues?

536
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,640
No...

537
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,060
Sorry,

538
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,040
I have an appointment with someone.

539
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,580
Is that so?

540
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,050
I'm really sorry.

541
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:41,970
It's okay.

542
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,140
The delivery truck will arrive shortly.

543
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,990
The package will be placed in the corner ahead.

544
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,240
Take it and leave immediately.

545
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,270
What's inside?

546
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,460
You don't need to know that.

547
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,090
Anyway, there's been a small problem.

548
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,620
That truck has been tailed by the police,

549
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,160
so I need you to take the package to a safe place.

550
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,540
Is that all?

551
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,190
Yes.

552
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,730
If everything goes well, your work will be all over.

553
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,500
Are you ready?

554
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,220
Yes. 4 was all I could fit.

555
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,230
It can't fit any more.

556
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,510
Good.

557
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,790
Throw it out the window

558
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,220
at the next turn.

559
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,120
Do it without attracting attention.

560
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,160
It's out. Now what?

561
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,410
That's all.

562
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,500
Eh? So you just wanted me to move a bunch of cookies?

563
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,130
You really don't live up to your name "the Courier Joe", do you?

564
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,830
Haven't you noticed that the police have been following you?

565
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,800
Where's the package?

566
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,400
What's this?

567
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,780
I left it in a locker at the bath house.

568
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,530
That place was swarming with cops earlier.

569
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,930
I couldn't just walk around with such a suspicious package.

570
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,790
It's at the men's side.

571
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,540
How am I supposed to get in?

572
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:43,920
I didn't expect that a woman to show up.

573
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,540
You heard that, right?

574
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,660
Yes, yes. Understood.

575
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,430
You're done for today.

576
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,230
"Today"? Is there more?

577
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,950
Who knows?

578
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,000
Don't ask me.

579
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,960
Just wait for further instructions.

580
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,180
I've sent a guy to collect the package.

581
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,420
I need you to keep an eye on him.

582
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,450
Keep an eye on him?

583
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,490
Blend in with the customers

584
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,470
and see if he gets it away safely.

585
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,570
If anything happens, take care of it!

586
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,750
Why won't you let me get it myself?

587
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,990
I have my reasons.

588
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,610
I won't force you to tell.

589
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,010
That's better for both of us.

590
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,670
This is your last job, I promise.

591
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,530
One adult.

592
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:52,710
Welcome.

593
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,670
Hey.

594
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,380
Is that locker yours, Oji-san?

595
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,740
Are you okay, little boy?

596
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:36,440
Hey, you!

597
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,630
Let's take the boy to the hospital.

598
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,240
Please.

599
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,890
What are you laughing about?

600
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:59,840
You are also just a minion who takes orders!

601
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:04,570
Don't forget that I'm also helping to clean up your mess here.

602
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,560
No wonder you are known as the "Ad-libbing Tatsu."

603
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:10,700
It's because of your tattoo.

604
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,840
Hey...

605
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,700
Who are you guys?

606
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,120
Ah, you hit your head in the bath house.

607
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,110
You are Conan-kun, right?

608
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,030
Conan?

609
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,900
Do you know your name?

610
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,260
Name?

611
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,590
Where am I?

612
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,020
I don't know, either.

613
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,970
You really don't remember anything?

614
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,700
Boy, this medicine is for your head.

615
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,620
Take it and sleep for a bit.

616
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,200
Okay.

617
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,490
That's right.

618
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,390
All of you here are done.

619
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,340
Let's go, Kondo-san.

620
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,640
The kid doesn't remember anything.

621
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,150
Leaving him here should be fine.

622
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,370
Our order is to bring him with us.

623
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,650
It's not your decision to make.

624
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,040
When this is over, will you kill me too?

625
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,580
Depends on the instructions.

626
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,310
If I don't do it, I'd be silenced instead.

627
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,770
What are you being blackmailed over?

628
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,030
Nothing as major as yours.

629
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,750
I'd never think that the legendary hitman, Kondo,

630
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,370
is just a man who lets his targets go.

631
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,190
Instead of killing the targets, you secretly set them all free.

632
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,820
It must be pretty lucrative,

633
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,600
since both sides have to pay you.

634
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,950
How did you find out?

635
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,160
He told me that.

636
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,670
Probably to prevent me from being scared of you.

637
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,590
What about the kid?

638
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,400
Who knows?

639
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,300
Maybe the plan is to use the kid.

640
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,260
"Use"?

641
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,520
This Beetle behind us is suspicious.

642
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,710
He's asleep?

643
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,590
Yeah.

644
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,350
We'll have to spend the night here for instructions.

645
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:00,350
How about some wine?

646
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,750
Sure.

647
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,120
I'm surprised you can be so calm about this.

648
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,150
At this point, there's no point panicking.

649
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,110
You're awake, right?

650
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,460
I put the sleeping pill you'd thrown away inside that woman's drink.

651
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,810
She's sound asleep.

652
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,260
Don't be afraid.

653
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,950
I'll let you go.

654
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,550
So get up quietly.

655
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,230
What will happen to you, Oji-san.

656
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,690
You are used because they've got something on you, right?

657
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,490
Yes.

658
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,480
Inside the locker at the bath house

659
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,850
were bombs, right?

660
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:00,070
I saw on the news that the bombs were put into cookie cans.

661
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,210
Oji-san, do you really have no idea what they are doing this for?

662
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,110
A lot of people were given instructions,

663
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,910
but no one knows the whole plan.

664
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,630
That's why I have to find the mastermind.

665
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,730
After you get out, go to the police...

666
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,200
If I disappear,

667
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,100
you'll be suspected.

668
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,230
What's more...

669
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,630
Hello!

670
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,280
So you're that famous Kondo-san.

671
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,240
Who are you?

672
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,030
Your teammate.

673
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,240
Are you...

674
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,520
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not the leader.

675
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,310
We can watch him with this.

676
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,020
So you can go to sleep.

677
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,860
Hello? Yes.

678
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:05,690
Yeah.

679
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,480
The Red Brick Warehouse?

680
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,520
Yeah.

681
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,700
There was a ticket for an event there

682
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,360
in that kid's pocket.

683
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,650
Many kids will go,

684
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,660
so we'll bring him there and leave him.

685
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,510
He hasn't gained his memories back, right?

686
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,400
No.

687
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,290
Glad to hear that.

688
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,620
If you were told to get rid of the kid, what would you do?

689
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:36,570
He will visit the Imperial Palace with his family.

690
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,200
The next headline...

691
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:39,840
Poor thing.

692
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,510
You'll feel better soon.

693
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,960
Mom and Dad are here for you.

694
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,350
It's alright.

695
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,300
I'll bring you breakfast.

696
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,180
I'm scared...

697
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,910
You'll be safe.

698
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,390
Keep pretending you don't remember anything.

699
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,390
I know...

700
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,880
who is behind this!

701
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,850
I want to see the editor of the "Truth Dynamite" magazine.

702
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:30,230
Okay. May I ask who you are?

703
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:37,430
It's true that our magazine has published
several special editions about this person...

704
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,520
So this Kondo guy really exists?

705
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,920
Yeah, he does.

706
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:49,250
We even got a tip lately claiming to have found Kondo's whereabouts.

707
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,300
Eh? Where is it?

708
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:56,610
Well, the informant asked for a big pay

709
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,070
which I wouldn't agree to.

710
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,210
I haven't contacted him ever since.

711
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,630
Excuse me, Otani-san?

712
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,850
Have you seen our head editor?

713
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,910
No, I haven't.

714
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,980
Something happened to Kanae-chan?

715
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,200
She left a while ago, and I haven't been able to reach her since.

716
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,600
But today is our deadline.

717
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,640
It's about time.

718
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,590
Here's the kid's bag.

719
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,780
Boy...

720
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,840
Yes?

721
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,010
Ah, nothing.

722
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,490
Hello?

723
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,450
Leave the kid there, and your job is done.

724
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,890
Thank you for your service.

725
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,930
Was it worth it going out of your way

726
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,680
to threaten me?

727
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,340
Hey!

728
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,950
Stop pretending to be some legendary hitman.

729
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,870
I know you're just a fraud that lets people go.

730
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,290
People like you are only suited to running errands.

731
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,950
Don't be so smug!

732
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:49,600
Leave the kid at the event

733
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,650
and keep watching until someone finds him.

734
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,330
If the police get involved,

735
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,140
you'll be held accountable.

736
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,820
Even a small fry can complete this simple job.

737
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,470
Oji-san, I need to pee.

738
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,970
Oh, okay.

739
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,170
There's a bomb in my bag.

740
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,620
It's the remote-controlled type,

741
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,680
so the plan is probably to trigger it at a certain time.

742
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,360
How did you...

743
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,160
I didn't have any Kamen Yaiba exhibit ticket.

744
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,520
I don't know what the aim is yet,

745
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,430
but I've pretty much figured out everything else.

746
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,080
You're the famous Kondo, right?

747
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,280
I read about you in a magazine.

748
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,380
Yea.

749
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:56,720
But you're actually someone that lets your targets go.

750
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,060
That's right.

751
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,300
I knew it.

752
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,990
A while back, my father helped investigate a case
that seemed related to Kondo.

753
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,490
He told me

754
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,170
that after Kondo received a request to kill someone,

755
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,490
he would tell the target the truth

756
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,830
and receive payment from both sides,

757
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,520
pretending he had killed the target

758
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,740
while secretly letting the person escape.

759
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,740
But there wasn't any evidence.

760
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,750
You're right.

761
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,330
So, if anyone found out

762
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:35,080
that those targets are still alive,
everything would be brought to light.

763
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,970
You're being blackmailed over this, right?

764
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,040
Yeah.

765
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,520
Who exactly are you?

766
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,900
I am Conan Edogawa.

767
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,530
A detective.

768
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:47,820
A detective?

769
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,350
The real bad guy should be

770
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,880
that "Ad-libbing Tatsu."

771
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,040
Yesterday, at the bath house,

772
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:02,070
I saw a suspicious man who washed his upper body 3 times

773
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,320
and kept watching the lockers.

774
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,900
Hey, are you done yet?

775
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:11,960
I need a little longer.

776
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,140
I became suspicious, so I went to the locker room

777
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,750
and saw you sitting there reading the newspaper.

778
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,050
You weren't wet at all,

779
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,010
so I immediately sensed that something was wrong.

780
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,630
I was just wondering what it was

781
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,970
when that guy called Tatsu came in

782
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,600
and took the locker key from his pocket.

783
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:34,750
So I went to talk to him without thinking much.

784
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,660
Then I saw the cookie cans in the locker.

785
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,610
I wasn't wearing anything at the time,

786
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:43,160
but there were 3 suspicious people around.

787
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,930
The situation was unfavorable to me, so I took
my cell phone and transmitter just to be safe.

788
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,050
Transmitter?

789
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,490
Yeah! It's a sticker,

790
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,660
so you can stick it anywhere.

791
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,220
And these glasses work as a receiver.

792
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,390
There's a radar installed.

793
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,570
Little boy,

794
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,220
did you come here alone?

795
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,610
Conan-kun!

796
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,390
Do you feel lonely there all by yourself?

797
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,190
I'm doing fine!

798
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:19,230
I just met someone I know!

799
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,480
Anyway, I stuck the transmitter on his jacket,

800
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,380
and was planning to contact someone else later.

801
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,530
But I was running out of time,

802
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,890
so I intentionally slipped

803
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,900
to cause a stir.

804
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,990
And after that...

805
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,100
Are you okay, boy?

806
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,340
I was drugged

807
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,670
and lost consciousness for real.

808
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,450
Drugged?

809
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,010
Yeah.

810
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,680
It means they were planning to attack someone
in the bath house all along.

811
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,800
Probably...

812
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,100
Yes, it must've been me.

813
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,660
They put me there to keep watch

814
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:00,820
with the intention of assaulting me.

815
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,900
They were planning to kidnap you
while you were undressed and unconscious,

816
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,750
and then...

817
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:12,110
Let me be the scapegoat for all the crimes, probably.

818
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,250
But if that was the original plan, wouldn't that be a bit rash?

819
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:18,520
After all,

820
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,990
the police had already found the bombs,

821
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,520
and my presence at the bath house was just a coincidence.

822
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,500
It seems to be a last-minute makeshift plan.

823
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,060
And that's the ad-libbing, right?

824
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,430
So you think that "Ad-libber Tatsu" was the mastermind?

825
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,860
But...

826
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:40,160
He was supposed to have died at that factory.

827
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:41,610
But

828
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,820
the news only reported the discovery of one unidentified body.

829
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,250
If Tatsu's body had been found with the other man's,

830
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,960
two bodies should have been reported.

831
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,410
That's why I checked with the glasses

832
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,120
and found that "Ad-libber Tatsu"

833
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,830
was moving.

834
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,360
I know

835
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,040
who is behind this!

836
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,480
He's currently inside that house.

837
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,740
I'll buy you some time.

838
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,180
Confirm Tatsu's location and call the police, Oji-san.

839
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,890
Understood.

840
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,960
Now, the only thing left is that bomb...

841
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,320
I'll take care of that.

842
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,070
Please do.

843
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,710
Also,

844
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,450
my friends may have been captured by them.

845
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,480
Friends?

846
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,870
You have her?

847
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:47,670
Yeah. I said that I wanted to talk about her husband
and she fell for it right away.

848
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,730
She's sleeping in the room now.

849
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,580
But is this really necessary?

850
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,010
I'm a cautious person.

851
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,150
Anyway, come back here first.

852
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,820
I'm on my way now.

853
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,230
Understood.

854
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,590
Feeling a bit cold?

855
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,430
Why do I have to help?

856
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,820
I'll explain later.

857
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,000
You owe me one anyway.

858
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,830
Don't forget, I was the one who let you go last time.

859
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,240
I'm busy today.

860
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,750
I have to take care of my cat and some other stuff as well.

861
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,540
There's no one I can trust other than you!

862
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,650
You have pathetically few friends, don't you?

863
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,570
You'll be connected to voicemail.

864
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,430
She's still working?

865
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,590
Hello?

866
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,150
Seriously,

867
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,130
what on earth is going on?

868
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,050
Who are you?

869
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,800
Jeez.

870
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,140
That's dangerous!

871
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,350
What are you doing?

872
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,100
I was in an accident.

873
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,800
Could you give me a ride?

874
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,070
Calm down.

875
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,800
That boy told me everything.

876
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,480
Here they come!

877
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,320
15 meters to go!

878
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:38,140
It'll explode as soon as I press this button!

879
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,750
2 meters.

880
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,360
1 meter.

881
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,070
0!

882
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,780
It really exploded...

883
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:13,480
What did the warning say?

884
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:18,920
That there was a bomb, so we should evacuate the residents.

885
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,440
What?

886
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,080
What's going on?

887
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,090
Why didn't it explode?

888
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,060
Damn it!

889
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,810
Just give up!

890
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,770
You...

891
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:37,690
Don't move.

892
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,550
Ai-kun, are you alright?

893
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,040
Professor!

894
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,700
Can I borrow it?

895
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,870
Conan-kun,

896
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,470
are you alright?

897
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:01,600
Hello.

898
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:02,850
Everything's fine.

899
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:04,730
Your friends are safe.

900
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,250
I know who their targets are.

901
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,100
He can't be forgiven.

902
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,270
Is Tatsu there?

903
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,110
No, he's not.

904
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,010
Hey, Conan-kun!

905
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,350
Ran-neechan, what are you doing here?

906
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,820
What do you mean?

907
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,120
I'm going to look for him.

908
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,880
I came here to find you!

909
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,730
Shinichi is here too, right?

910
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,380
Where is he?

911
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,430
There's a bomb!

912
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,920
Everybody, run!

913
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,050
Ran-neechan, hurry!

914
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,640
Wait a moment, Conan-kun!

915
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,460
Everybody, run, hurry!

916
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,220
Run!

917
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,020
Ah, wait a moment...

918
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,490
Run!

919
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,890
It's dangerous here!

920
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,000
Let's go!

921
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:05,160
Where's Tatsu?

922
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,270
I don't know.

923
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,320
I really don't know!

924
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:12,000
He was supposed to come here,

925
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:14,450
but he said he had something else to do and would come later.

926
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,170
He's not coming.

927
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,920
You, too, were only used by him.

928
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,430
Once the job is done, he'll kill you, too!

929
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,140
The evidence is on the ceiling of the basement.

930
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,000
He says he wants to talk to you.

931
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,360
Idiot, look at what you've done.

932
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,010
Did you think that you'd get away with it

933
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,550
just by blowing up your workroom?

934
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,190
I'm not sure who the idiot is here.

935
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,760
The "Ad-libbing Tatsu" I know

936
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,400
is supposed to be someone who engages in smaller jobs.

937
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,400
Your fiancee is such a pretty woman.

938
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:51,020
What?

939
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:55,100
Are these two your friends?

940
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,010
Trying to quit the gang for the woman you love.

941
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:08,290
You really thought it'd be that easy?

942
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,020
There are still things I want you to do.

943
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,760
Play any more tricks,

944
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,550
or get caught by the police,

945
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,200
your fiancee dies!

946
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,490
Conan-kun!

947
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,720
Where are you, Conan-kun?

948
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,500
Conan-kun!

949
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,950
Wake up!

950
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,420
What is it?

951
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,330
Hurry up and drive!

952
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,840
Jeez, what now?

953
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,710
Was that...

954
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,540
Dad?

955
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,420
As expected,

956
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,050
this is all Kondo's doing!

957
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:55,980
That car!

958
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:01,110
Hand it over!

959
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,950
Keep an eye on them for now.

960
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:08,870
Okay.

961
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,080
And you, come with me.

962
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:21,870
It's fine,

963
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,960
there's still time.

964
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,450
Yes, I'm counting on you.

965
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,450
What's your relationship with Tatsu?

966
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,150
Actually, I was the one who found out

967
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:53,330
about your secret.

968
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,970
About a year ago, I happened to discover that revolving door.

969
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,090
you were in the middle of a job, right?

970
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,920
Hey, come here for a moment.

971
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,750
Hurry!

972
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,310
Man!

973
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:20,200
Look, over there.

974
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:29,950
Then Tatsu got interested and started investigating you.

975
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:33,190
I see, so it's that kind of relationship.

976
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,270
Got a problem with it?

977
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,830
Turn left there.

978
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:46,430
Was it also you who left the file about
the Red Brick Warehouse at my workroom yesterday?

979
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,250
Tatsu is quite smart!

980
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,430
Don't underestimate him.

981
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,070
What's going on here?

982
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,500
You are such a naughty little boy.

983
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:32,080
There are cameras everywhere around this house, you know?

984
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,760
- Is this idiot your friend?
- Hey! Where did you go?

985
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,510
That hurts!

986
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,640
What the heck is happening?

987
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,660
Hey,

988
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,240
I was just asked to give him a ride.

989
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,030
I have nothing to do with this!

990
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,060
So...

991
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,370
Shut your mouth, will you?

992
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,030
Don't shoot!

993
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:09,270
So, can you explain this?

994
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,470
Ah, that's my cellphone!

995
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:23,270
This girl...

996
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,560
She looks like...

997
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,390
Excuse me, is anyone home?

998
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,050
Excuse me!

999
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,960
Conan-kun, are you there?

1000
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:56,400
Shinichi!

1001
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:03,430
Ran-neechan, is it?

1002
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,430
Conan-kun is inside.

1003
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:11,240
Is that idiot with him, Shinichi?

1004
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,500
Anyway, do as I...

1005
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:30,800
What just happened?

1006
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,310
There are bombs in that truck.

1007
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,160
Get in and wait for orders.

1008
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:53,870
You'll get detailed instructions later.

1009
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,720
This is your last chance.

1010
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,700
Don't fail if you want to save your fiancee.

1011
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:03,920
He asked you to go back to that house on the mountain

1012
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,780
after the bombing of the Red Brick Warehouse was successful, right?

1013
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,880
He is going to silence you too, you know.

1014
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,880
Don't you try to fool me! You are wasting your time!

1015
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:35,860
Your fiance left you a voicemail on your cell phone.

1016
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,080
This might be the last time you hear his voice,

1017
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:42,400
so listen carefully.

1018
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:44,590
Hello.

1019
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,150
I'm sorry to bring it up out of the blue,

1020
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,110
but I can't see you for a while.

1021
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:53,300
Due to my previous job, I have to go to the police station.

1022
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,350
I don't know how that will end.

1023
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,940
I won't expect you to wait for me.

1024
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,020
Anyway, I just want to say

1025
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:06,190
that being able to meet someone like you
after I've led such a shameful life is really my fortune.

1026
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,780
I'm grateful.

1027
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:12,690
End of message. End of...

1028
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,300
If he hadn't met you,

1029
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:24,490
he might've stayed a criminal
and enjoyed himself for the rest of his life.

1030
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:27,270
It's a pity that you ruined that for him!

1031
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:42,970
The madam wants to know when they can leave.

1032
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,250
We're still making sure the area is safe.

1033
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,220
Please wait a little longer.

1034
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:33,070
Ready, Kondo-san?

1035
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,190
What do you want me to do?

1036
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:39,080
The car carrying the children of Nihorika's Prime Minister

1037
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:42,680
will be crossing that bridge ahead of you.

1038
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:47,450
I want you to crash into that car and cause an accident.

1039
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,920
I'll detonate the bombs.

1040
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,590
Why target the children?

1041
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,240
That's the job I was hired to do,

1042
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:01,310
to blow them up with bombs.

1043
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,310
It's just business.

1044
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,480
What's more, this request was originally meant for you.

1045
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,240
What?

1046
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,720
Since I was interested in you,

1047
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,530
I snuck into your workroom.

1048
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,420
I was shocked

1049
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:29,340
that the legendary Kondo really existed.

1050
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,260
But through thorough investigation,

1051
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,890
I found that Kondo had never killed a single soul.

1052
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:43,440
Instead, he was just a sneaky liar who set his targets free.

1053
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,640
And at that moment...

1054
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:03,080
It was a request from overseas.

1055
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,950
They'd been looking for the best hitman in Japan,

1056
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:10,780
and finally found your contact.

1057
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,840
You... accepted that request?

1058
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:18,300
Yeah. The payment was generous, after all.

1059
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:20,800
I gave them my number and accepted the request.

1060
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,570
Your meticulously compiled most-wanted criminal list

1061
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,480
was of a great help to me.

1062
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,420
Time to move.

1063
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,520
Drive straight to the bridge.

1064
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:38,650
Don't hang up.

1065
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,010
Damn it!

1066
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,110
A little further!

1067
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,070
A little further!

1068
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,860
Hey...

1069
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,740
What are you doing?

1070
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,720
Didn't I tell you to go back to the house?

1071
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,370
That guy doesn't have his cellphone!

1072
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,030
He said that he'd given it to that boy

1073
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,520
at the Red Brick Warehouse,

1074
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,130
so I gave him mine.

1075
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,870
So if you want to contact him, call my cellphone.

1076
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,870
I wanted to hurry over to tell you,
but there were so many checkpoints along the way.

1077
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:45,670
But I was just...

1078
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,350
Freeze! Police!

1079
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,160
Wh-What?

1080
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,380
Just surrender!

1081
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,710
This job's too much for you to handle.

1082
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:06,210
By the way, that whole conversation earlier
has been recorded as evidence.

1083
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,280
But how did you find this place?

1084
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,370
Hey! Who are you talking to?

1085
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,450
Hello?

1086
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,420
Hello?

1087
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,190
Hold it!

1088
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,630
You can't come here!

1089
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,400
Let me pass, please!

1090
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,180
Are you a resident of that apartment?

1091
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:30,430
No, I'm not, but...

1092
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,180
Hey, officer!

1093
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,360
He's the fiance of the female hostage.

1094
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,440
Really?

1095
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:40,620
Yes.

1096
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,800
I see, why didn't you say so earlier?

1097
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:45,800
Your fiancee is fine.

1098
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:49,380
She'll be coming down very soon. Please go ahead.

1099
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,010
Thank you.

1100
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,740
The one who planted the transmitter
on Nana was you, wasn't it, Oji-san?

1101
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,240
Yeah.

1102
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,430
Quick, call the police!

1103
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,150
There are bombs in the basement!

1104
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:13,850
What?

1105
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,050
Hey, Conan-kun,

1106
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,270
could you tell us what's going on?

1107
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:18,230
It's moving.

1108
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,100
Onii-san!

1109
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:22,700
What?

1110
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:31,610
Found it!

1111
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:34,460
Onii-san! Follow that light blue car!

1112
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:45,220
Ready,

1113
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,210
Kondo-san?

1114
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,790
What do you want me to do?

1115
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:52,160
I see.

1116
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,660
What about the bombs in the truck?

1117
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,300
I delivered them to the police.

1118
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,150
Ah, hello, is this the police?

1119
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,780
I...I found some bombs.

1120
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:08,700
Yes, hidden in cookie cans.

1121
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,650
Yes.

1122
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,150
Really? But how did you know he was here?

1123
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:20,410
Tatsu found out very quickly that my workroom had been blown up.

1124
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:24,910
I thought he should be hiding somewhere he could see my workroom,

1125
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,160
so I tried my luck.

1126
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:29,440
As expected of the legendary Kondo-san.

1127
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:30,870
Ah?

1128
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:04,470
Like I said, I don't know anything!

1129
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:06,130
A friend asked me to drive that kid

1130
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,250
to the Kamen Yaiba exhibit. That's all!

1131
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,180
Hey, kid!

1132
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,910
It's dangerous. You shouldn't be around here.

1133
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,430
Do you live nearby?

1134
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,780
Yeah! Sorry!

1135
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,170
Hey!

1136
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:45,200
Would you explain it to them?

1137
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:48,750
The police won't listen to a word I say!

1138
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:07,500
Who was that man with Conan-kun just now?

1139
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:08,580
No idea.

1140
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,490
Oh.

1141
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:17,780
So where on earth has Shinichi gone!

1142
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,400
This whole thing has been such a mess!

1143
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:24,010
Everyone, let me explain!

1144
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,560
All this was done by that legendary hitman Kondo.

1145
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,100
Speaking of which, the reason I got involved in this is...

1146
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,300
The police department believes that the smuggled bombs
discovered several days ago in Haido-cho

1147
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:43,510
are related to higher ups in the Arasen government,

1148
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,440
and will contact them through their embassy...

1149
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:46,350
Please!

1150
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,250
Let me turn back into Shinichi this time!

1151
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,020
No.

1152
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,790
Don't say that! I'm begging you!

1153
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:57,550
I can't figure out any logical excuse

1154
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,220
to explain why Ran got a text from Shinichi.

1155
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:02,020
That wouldn't change regardless, right?

1156
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:04,120
No way!

1157
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:06,530
Please, give me the antidote!

1158
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:12,200
No. I Won't.

1159
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,090
Stingy.

1160
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,590
It's for your own good.

1161
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,100
Fine.

1162
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,180
I'll just have to think of a plausible excuse then.

1163
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:24,630
Ah, and...

1164
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,260
Huh?

1165
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:27,710
Thank you

1166
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:31,820
for looking for me even though you were in such bad shape.

1167
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:35,290
It's nothing.

1168
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:41,200
Yeah, this looks terrible.

1169
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:01,150
I forget that the bath hasn't been fixed yet!

1170
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,280
What should I do?

1171
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:20,220
Even with that shrunken body, he's still doing his best!

1172
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,990
And next,

1173
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:23,530
it'll be the new year soon.

1174
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,980
I should also head for new horizons and accept new challenges!

1175
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:32,360
Coming April 2015,

1176
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,330
the Detective Conan movie -

1177
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,530
Sunflowers of Inferno!

1178
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,550
Prepare for a whole new experience!
