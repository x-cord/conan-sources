1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,240
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,340
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,040
Only a little more to go before sundown.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,140
Will Dr. Agasa be able to meet his ginkgo colored first love?

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,545
A letter of 40 years ago comes out of Dr. Agasa's room.

9
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:51,745
The letter from Dr. Agasa's first love,

10
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,445
said that she would like to meet him every 10 years

11
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,845
at the place memorable for both of them.

12
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,845
A code and numbers that seem to indicate the place

13
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,145
"The Hint Is: Animal" -were also written.

14
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:04,745
It coincidentally turns out that today is that day 40 years ago,

15
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,545
so after making deductions

16
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:07,845
we headed for the zoo.

17
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,145
Hey, look good and hard.

18
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:15,045
Yes. She's sure to be here somewhere.

19
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,645
Dr. Agasa's first love.

20
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:19,145
Hey, you guys...

21
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:22,645
Hey, I wonder what that number is?

22
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:26,145
See, the number that is written on the name plate of the animals.

23
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:29,345
-Flying squirrel! -Flying squirrel!

24
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,545
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

25
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:36,145
She seems to be waiting for someone.

26
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:48,445
"Ginkgo-Colored First Love (Part 2)"

27
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,645
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

28
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,945
Dr. Agasa, there's someone there.

29
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:55,445
She seems to be waiting for someone.

30
00:02:56,445 --> 00:03:00,645
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

31
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:03,345
See. You're meeting her after 40 years,

32
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:04,645
so go do your thing.

33
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,645
Yeah.

34
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,245
Excuse me, but are you...

35
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,145
What, it's you, Mr. Hiroshi?

36
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,945
Oh! A man?

37
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:30,445
Long time no see. How've you been?

38
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,945
Who could you be?

39
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:35,645
No, did you forget me?

40
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:39,645
You used to come to my house a lot to look at my hamster.

41
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:43,545
Don't tell me that you're Mr. Haruo Chono?

42
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:46,345
I'm so happy that you remember me.

43
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,245
You took me for someone else, didn't you?

44
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,245
Yeah...

45
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,845
Because back then you were a boy with runny nose,

46
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,445
six years younger than me.

47
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,045
Oh, come off it!

48
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,245
I guess it's not her...

49
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,845
Right...

50
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,945
And, what brings you here today?

51
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:02,045
Oh, come on, silly.

52
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,845
What else but waiting for my boyfriend to come.

53
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,345
He likes squirrels and mice too.

54
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:10,945
That's why we're meeting in front of these flying squirrels.

55
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,945
I see, wrong person again.

56
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:17,845
But, if she's somewhere in this zoo,

57
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,145
I'm sure he'll get to see her eventually.

58
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:25,045
Wait... We don't have time to be talking like that.

59
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,845
There's only a little over an hour before sunset.

60
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,145
Then, we've got no other choice

61
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:32,145
than for the Sleeping Kogoro or the noisy Sonoko

62
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,445
to solve this for us.

63
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,845
Can't you get a hold of them?

64
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:38,245
Pops is at a live, so it's impossible.

65
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:43,245
Sonoko is with Ran, so I can get a hold of her but...

66
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:45,145
Then please call her.

67
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:46,145
Because if he misses today,

68
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:48,845
he won't get to see her for the next 10 years.

69
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,045
I think it won't help to call, though...

70
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,245
Yes, hello?

71
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,745
Oh? Conan.

72
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:02,645
Yes, we're still in line to buy Fusae Brand limited edition goods.

73
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,645
Is Sonoko there?

74
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:08,645
She went off to buy hamburgers so she's not here.

75
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,545
It's okay if she's not there. Bye.

76
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,745
She's not there...

77
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,145
What?

78
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,545
No...

79
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,845
Ran!

80
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,345
Here, I bought it!

81
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,245
What? You got a phone call?

82
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:27,745
What?

83
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,845
It's your hubby, isn't it?

84
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:32,445
What? No, it was Conan! From Conan!

85
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:35,445
Honest!

86
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:38,745
Conan just called me asking for you.

87
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,545
What? What?

88
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,145
He said, it's okay if you're not around...

89
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:44,345
Do you want to call him back?

90
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,945
Never mind. Getting involved with him only brings trouble.

91
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:51,245
Besides, it's kind of unusual that you want

92
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,145
to buy brand name goods, Ran.

93
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,045
Yeah, a little.

94
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,045
I made a promise with someone in the past.

95
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,845
I promised some time ago so.

96
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,445
I think that person already forgot, though.

97
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:06,245
"Nocturnal Animals Building" -Ms. Kinoshita! Ms. Kinoshita!

98
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:08,345
Mr. Agasa is waiting for you,

99
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,345
please come to the Nocturnal Animals Building immediately.

100
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,245
She doesn't seem to be here.

101
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,645
I see. I'm sorry to bother you.

102
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,245
That was our last resort.

103
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:26,345
Dr. Agasa. Can't you remember anything yet?

104
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,745
This zoo is a memorable place for you, isn't it?

105
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:33,145
No... I've come here for the first time.

106
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:36,545
What? Didn't you come here with the girl who wrote this postcard?

107
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:40,145
No... She wanted to come here, though.

108
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:43,645
In other words, this place was not the right place to begin with.

109
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:46,045
Why didn't you tell us so to begin with?

110
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:50,245
I'm sorry. You were all trying so hard so.

111
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,145
But, you've done enough already.

112
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,145
-What? -I'm contented.

113
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,845
As for memories about her, I will keep it untouched

114
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:01,645
and beautiful as it used to be within my heart.

115
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,445
I don't want her to see my hair like this either.

116
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,445
Dr. Agasa...

117
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:06,945
Shall we head home then.

118
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,245
Here, your hat.

119
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,145
No! Don't look!

120
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:30,545
Please!

121
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:34,345
Here you go, hold it nice and tight.

122
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:35,345
Okay...

123
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:38,045
What's up, Dr. Agasa?

124
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,145
Oh, well...

125
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:43,145
I just remembered something about her hair.

126
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,745
Hair?

127
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,645
Yeah... She had black eyes,

128
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,445
but the color of her hair was different.

129
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,945
Her hair wasn't really brown.

130
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:59,445
Blonde... One of her parents was not Japanese.

131
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,545
That's why she wore her cap deeply over her head all the time.

132
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,745
She didn't want to be teased from everyone else at school

133
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:07,245
because the color of her hair was different.

134
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:09,345
When I was in Americans,

135
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:13,045
I experienced being teased because of my Asian looks,

136
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,745
so I understand how she feels.

137
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,845
Which means that you're...

138
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,645
Oh, really?

139
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,745
Yes. My mother's British.

140
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:23,245
Didn't I tell you before?

141
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,545
Ayumi, will you show me that postcard?

142
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,545
Okay.

143
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,845
Did you figure something out, Conan?

144
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:30,945
Conan?

145
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,345
If so, this code may be...

146
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,645
"The Hint Is: Animal" -The meaning of these numbers are...

147
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:40,545
Hey, Dr. Agasa! Did that girl have a pet or something?

148
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,845
Oh yeah...

149
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:46,345
They seem to have had a dog when she was little.

150
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:51,345
But, she said that after she was bitten, they had no pets.

151
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:57,045
Wait... Conan!

152
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,945
Then, don't tell me...

153
00:08:58,945 --> 00:08:59,945
Don't tell me...

154
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:05,845
I see, so that's it.

155
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,545
That's what the numbers of the code meant.

156
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:13,145
I got it, Dr. Agasa.

157
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,945
The memorable place that she's waiting for you.

158
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,745
It's a place we know very well too.

159
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:18,845
"The Hint Is: Animal"

160
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,845
It's over there!

161
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,167
"Nocturnal Animals Building"

162
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,567
What? You've figured it out?

163
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,667
The place where Dr. Agasa's first love is waiting?

164
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,967
Yeah. After it's solved, it's no big deal.

165
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,767
It's a place we all know very well too.

166
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:40,867
We know it too?

167
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,767
Where is it?

168
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,167
You go there five times a week too, Genta.

169
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,767
Five times a week?

170
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,767
I see the cake shop in front of my house everyday.

171
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,567
I go to the yakiniku shop on the corner once a month.

172
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:56,067
So? Hurry up and answer!

173
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,967
She can only wait until the sun goes down, you know.

174
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,367
Hold your horses!

175
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,467
If we speed there by car it won't even take 20 minutes.

176
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:07,167
First for the code written on back of the postcard about the place.

177
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:11,067
This 4163, 33, 6, and 0...

178
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:14,167
is like the hint says, stands for an animal.

179
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,367
What? Just what're you talking about?

180
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,067
The donkey and the flying squirrel were wrong!

181
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,467
It's not a name.

182
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,167
It's the cry of the animal!

183
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,467
Cry of the animal?

184
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:28,067
Yeah. It's the number of letters used to write how the animal cries.

185
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,867
The number of letters of their cries...

186
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:35,167
Then, what does the number six of the code stand for?

187
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,967
A cat cries "mew", so it's three letters in Japanese character.

188
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,067
Cry of cicada is seven letters.

189
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,967
That's not an animal, it's an insect.

190
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,367
A crow goes caw, so it's two letters.

191
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,767
A horse neighs, so it's four letters.

192
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,367
"Squeak" is for mice.

193
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,067
Mice?

194
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,667
Don't mices go "chu"?

195
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,667
See, it's written by the explanation

196
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,467
of the Indian Flying Fox too.

197
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,267
In English, the Indian Flying Squirrel cries squeak,

198
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:05,067
like mice.

199
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:08,267
One of her parents is not Japanese.

200
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,167
I don't know whether her parents spoke to her in English but...

201
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,867
It's exactly six letters so the possibility is high.

202
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,867
-I see. -I get it.

203
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,467
True.

204
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:24,067
But mice are not the only animals whose cry is six letters.

205
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,467
That's true, but the animal that has something

206
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,867
to do with the girl of your memory is?

207
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,367
Right! A hamster!

208
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,367
Which means that the house of the person named Mr. Chono

209
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:40,867
that you used to go over a lot to, with her is the place!

210
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,667
But the place in the code is somewhere that I go a lot too, right?

211
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,767
I don't know that person's house!

212
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,467
Besides, I already told you, didn't I?

213
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:53,267
That I went there 20 years ago but she didn't come.

214
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,767
Hold your horses!

215
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,667
Only the number six part of the code has been solved.

216
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:02,167
The 4163 and 33 animal is left!

217
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,367
I don't think there are animals that cry that long.

218
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,867
Then, what if we separate the numbers like so

219
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,867
four, one, six, three and three, three.

220
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,467
Four, one, six, three and three, three...

221
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:17,967
A dog barks, "one-one" (bow-wow)

222
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,667
so it should come out to 11...

223
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,467
Three, three sounds like "min-min".

224
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,767
It's the cry of a cidada after all.

225
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,367
Don't tell me...

226
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,167
It's a rooster and a dog.

227
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,067
The rooster cries cock-a-doodle-doo in English,

228
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:36,067
a dog, bow-wow, so the number of letters match perfectly!

229
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,167
A cook's a doodling?

230
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,667
The rooster cries "coke-kokko", don't they?

231
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,867
That's how the cries sound to Americans.

232
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,567
Then the roosters must be at elementary school

233
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,967
and the dog and the Mr. Noi's house?

234
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,067
Yes. She seems to have liked taking care

235
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,467
of the roosters at school too,

236
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,667
and the Mr. Noi's house is where you first met each other!

237
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,467
But, the zero hasn't been solved yet.

238
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,367
Are there animals that don't cry?

239
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:03,767
It's not that the animal doesn't cry...

240
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,967
There are no animals there!

241
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,667
I see! It's her house!

242
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:13,067
Her parents stopped having pets.

243
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,867
So, zero is Ms. Kinoshita's house.

244
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,667
But, where is she waiting?

245
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,967
She can't possibly wait at four places at one time.

246
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:25,467
Then try connecting the four places

247
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:27,967
in the order that they're written.

248
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:31,867
Let's see. First, it's the elementary school...

249
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,167
Noi...

250
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,467
Chono...

251
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,767
Kinoshita...

252
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,067
Elementary school...

253
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,067
Noi...

254
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,067
Chono...

255
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,867
Kinoshita...

256
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,667
Under the ginkgo lined-street!

257
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:49,067
Yeah. I'm sure she's waiting there.

258
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,967
If her feelings of 40 years ago haven't waned...

259
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:56,567
Hey, wait a second, Conan.

260
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,667
There's nobody around.

261
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:03,467
Strange. I'm sure it's here.

262
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,967
Well, it's only natural that she's not here.

263
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:09,467
After all, it's a promise we made 40 years ago.

264
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,567
Dr. Agasa...

265
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,467
It's still there...

266
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,967
See, that white car.

267
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,867
It was parked there when we went to check on the rabbits

268
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,767
this morning too.

269
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:24,067
I'm sure she was waiting in the car all the way from morning!

270
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,367
Okay, let's go check it out then!

271
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,367
Okay!

272
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,367
Hey...

273
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,867
Nobody's inside.

274
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,867
Maybe the person went out to get a bite to eat.

275
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,067
No, I don't think so.

276
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,867
The coffee from the fast food store is still steaming hot.

277
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,867
It looks to have been eaten just a while ago.

278
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,467
It's quite a lot of food.

279
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,467
There are enough to feed three people.

280
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:53,567
I hope he won't get freaked out

281
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,667
even if she's super plump.

282
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,467
What a beauty...

283
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,967
That can't be her.

284
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,867
She's too good for him.

285
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,267
Hey, Dr. Agasa, come on.

286
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:26,667
You made her wait 40 years, didn't you?

287
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:30,667
Oh, well, I don't really know if it's her yet.

288
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,867
Get on with it.

289
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,467
Excuse me...

290
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,167
Fusae?

291
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,267
A... A man?

292
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:55,967
Billy, would you mind stepping outside for a moment?#eng

293
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,567
Okay, take your time.

294
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,267
Excuse me.

295
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,667
Excuse me...

296
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,467
They sure are cute grandchildren.

297
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:17,967
Yes... I guess...

298
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,667
Excuse me, pardon me for asking...

299
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:23,367
I just happened to pass by here this morning

300
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,667
and these ginkgo trees caught my attention.

301
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,467
They were so vivid.

302
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,567
That I came back again.

303
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,367
Do you not like ginkgo trees?

304
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,667
Oh, no...

305
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,367
They're really beautiful.

306
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:46,367
What? Wait a second. She's...

307
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,967
Hey, little girl.

308
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,667
Are you waiting for somebody too, little girl?

309
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,267
Nope.

310
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,867
I forgot my umbrella so I'm taking shelter from the rain

311
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,067
until it stops.

312
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,067
Is that so?

313
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,267
Okay...

314
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,767
I'll give you my umbrella.

315
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,967
But, then you're going to get wet.

316
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,067
It's okay, because I feel like getting wet today.

317
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,467
But...

318
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,467
Let's do this then.

319
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,367
In place of the umbrella, when you grow up,

320
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:26,167
will you buy just one accessory or handbag that I designed, okay?

321
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,567
My design is this ginkgo leaf.

322
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,467
I'm not famous yet, but I'll do my best.

323
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,867
-Okay. -Promise.

324
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,167
Okay!

325
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,267
Hey, Ran!

326
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,467
What're you doing?

327
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,067
Shinichi!

328
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,067
Thank you so much!

329
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,767
If this woman is the one we saw back then...

330
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,867
She is no doubt Dr. Agasa's first love 40 years ago.

331
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,567
Okay, goodbye then.

332
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,567
Goodbye.

333
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,567
My husband's seems to be getting annoyed too, so...

334
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,067
I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,667
Well, Dr. Agasa, how was it?

336
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,667
It was her, right?

337
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,567
She's your first love, right?

338
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,567
Dr. Agasa?

339
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,567
You mean, that's all, Ms. Fusae?

340
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,867
After you waited 40 years to meet the man,

341
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:32,767
you've been looking forward to seeing.

342
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,767
Yes...

343
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:38,267
I didn't tell him who I was after all.

344
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,367
Well, although it's only natural,

345
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:44,567
it seems he already has a happy family.

346
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:46,167
Besides, if he finds out that he had made

347
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,467
a stupid woman wait for 40 years,

348
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,267
it'll probably break his heart.

349
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,967
You're really understanding about a man.

350
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,167
You haven't met for 40 years, aren't you?

351
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:02,267
When my hat was blown away here...

352
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,667
No! Don't look!

353
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,767
Because my hair is funny!

354
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,667
It's different from everybody's!

355
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:15,867
Really?

356
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,267
I like it. See...

357
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:24,967
It's just like this ginkgo leaf and pretty!

358
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:41,567
I think he forgot already though.

359
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,867
I'm sorry, Billy.

360
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,967
For making you my mother's new husband's friend,

361
00:19:56,967 --> 00:20:00,867
keep me company every 10 years for something like this.

362
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,567
Don't be. My wife would get mad at me if I refused.

363
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:07,767
After all, she's a great fan of the Fusae Brand.

364
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:11,767
But, today is the last day you'll have to do this.

365
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,067
Will you start off?

366
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,467
Are you really sure?

367
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,667
Never mind, will you, please.

368
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,867
Okay, boss.

369
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,867
I still love ginkgo leaves very much even now!

370
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,267
Excuse me, Billy?

371
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,167
What? What is it?

372
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,867
Maybe I'll ask you to keep me company again 10 years later?

373
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,067
No. I don't think it will take you

374
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,967
that long to see each other again.

375
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:56,567
It sure was a code that was forced making.

376
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,067
It can't be helped.

377
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,567
The person who makes the code is free

378
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,267
to think up whatever she wishes.

379
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:03,667
Besides, when she thought up that code,

380
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,067
she was still in grade school.

381
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:08,967
It's a cute childish code.

382
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,967
You're a kid yourself too.

383
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,967
Dr. Agasa's first love was really beautiful, wasn't she?

384
00:23:17,967 --> 00:23:19,567
Yes.

385
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,267
A gingko leaf...

386
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,967
Dr. Agasa?

387
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,167
You're looking sort of lewd.

388
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,367
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

389
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,767
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

390
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,467
-very much even now! -very much even now!

391
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:36,767
Hey, it's not nice to tease adults!

392
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,267
-Ms. Kinoshita, -Ms. Kinoshita,

393
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,467
-I still love ginkgo leaves -I still love ginkgo leaves

394
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:41,867
-very much even now! -very much even now!

395
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,567
"Next Episode"

396
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,167
A boy who lives near that house.

397
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,967
Who wears a white baseball cap?

398
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,867
-It's Keiichi! -It's Keiichi!

399
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,267
Denied everything?

400
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:01,367
Keiichi says that he didn't go out last night,

401
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,267
the night before or the night before last either.

402
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,167
Why is he hiding it?

403
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:16,367
Next Conan, "The Youth Detective Squad and Four Caterpillar Brothers"

404
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,535
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,435
"Olive leaf"

406
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:23,135
The next episode is about a kind hearted boy.

407
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:24,435
Which means...

408
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:26,335
I haven't said anything yet!
