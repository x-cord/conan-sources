1
00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.599
Adventure!

2
00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:04.599
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:05.899
The library room at school ten years ago,

4
00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.399
it is filled with memories with Ran!

5
00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:08.999
A slightly dangerous code adventure!

6
00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.299
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.899
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.999
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:02.308
"Library"

10
00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.108
"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Conan Doyle"

11
00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.008
Conan! Don't.

12
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.708
You're supposed to be quiet!

13
00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.408
Sorry.

14
00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:39.508
Besides, what bad manners yawning while you read.

15
00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:41.808
I'm sure that the "Conan Doyle" that you love so much

16
00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:45.008
is crying in his grave.

17
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:46.608
I can't help it, can I?

18
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:47.908
I've read all the mysteries that are here

19
00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:51.408
when I was in elementary school already.

20
00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:53.708
There's nothing more that I haven't read.

21
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:55.608
Really?

22
00:02:56.908 --> 00:03:01.408
This world is much deeper and mysterious.

23
00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:04.208
What was the voice I heard just now?

24
00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.508
It feels like a distant memory.

25
00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:08.308
Right, it was back then...

26
00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.508
What with that scared look?

27
00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.108
No, nothing.

28
00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:14.908
Hey!

29
00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:16.908
Kojima, just what do you think you're doing?

30
00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:19.308
Standing on books like that!

31
00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:23.208
But I can't reach the books on the higher shelf

32
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:24.908
if I don't do this...

33
00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:26.908
Teacher, help!

34
00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.108
Teacher!

35
00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:33.808
See, I told you so.

36
00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.208
Are you all right, Genta?

37
00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:37.908
Which do you want to read?

38
00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:39.808
I'll get it for you.

39
00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:42.408
Ah, let's see...

40
00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:45.808
Before that, let's put those books back.

41
00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.208
Huh?

42
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.408
It seems like something is stuck inside.

43
00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:53.508
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:56.408
Maybe it's a dead lizard or a snake!

45
00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:59.308
There are a lot of those things around nowadays, aren't there?

46
00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:19.008
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 1)"

47
00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:21.708
No.

48
00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:23.608
Come on! Don't scare me like that.

49
00:04:23.608 --> 00:04:26.408
I thought it was really a snake or something.

50
00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:28.508
This is a wallet, isn't it?

51
00:04:28.508 --> 00:04:32.308
Yes, but it looks like leather and not snake skin.

52
00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:34.008
But, who could've put it here?

53
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:35.908
And for what reason?

54
00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:40.108
Let's open it. Money could be inside!

55
00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:41.308
Goodness...

56
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.008
There's only one piece of paper inside.

57
00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:50.408
What?

58
00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.008
There's something written on it.

59
00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:55.608
What does it say?

60
00:04:55.608 --> 00:04:57.008
"Thank you."

61
00:04:57.008 --> 00:04:59.208
"Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

62
00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:02.308
How do you know?

63
00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.208
Does it really say so?

64
00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:06.408
Let's look.

65
00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:07.408
"Thank you, Ran Mouri of 1st grade class A."

66
00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:11.808
That's what's written...

67
00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:16.008
Of course. Because that's what Ran and I...

68
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:21.608
I mean Ran told me that something like that happened in the past!

69
00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:22.808
What kind of thing?

70
00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:25.908
Yeah, that she encountered a very queer

71
00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.308
and eerie incomprehensible situation!

72
00:05:29.408 --> 00:05:32.008
"Ten years ago" -It was just about ten years ago.

73
00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:33.808
Wait up, Shinichi!

74
00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:35.708
Let's not do it after all.

75
00:05:35.708 --> 00:05:37.308
I mean it's so late.

76
00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:39.208
That's why I'm telling you to go home!

77
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:42.108
If they find out you snuck out, you're going to get scolded!

78
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.008
I'll figure out its identity alone.

79
00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:47.508
I don't want you to go alone

80
00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:50.308
and be eaten by the ghost.

81
00:05:52.408 --> 00:05:53.808
Come off it!

82
00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:56.908
There's no such thing as ghosts in the world!

83
00:05:56.908 --> 00:05:59.508
But, Sonoko said she heard.

84
00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:02.108
That it appears in the library on nights when the moon is full!

85
00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:03.408
She says it groans in an eerie voice,

86
00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:06.508
this ghost wearing a strange hat...

87
00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:09.808
And tonight there happens to be full moon out there.

88
00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:11.508
Very interesting.

89
00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:15.708
Shinichi!

90
00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:22.208
So, you're coming along after all.

91
00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.708
Because...

92
00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:29.708
No good after all, it's locked.

93
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.108
Can do!

94
00:06:35.508 --> 00:06:37.608
Why is it not locked?

95
00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:42.208
I left this window unlocked before leaving school today.

96
00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.108
That security guard's not all that careful either.

97
00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:49.608
Okay, let's go to the library then.

98
00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:52.208
Oh, wait!

99
00:07:14.108 --> 00:07:15.108
Ran!

100
00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:21.508
Somebody's in the library!

101
00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:22.708
Ghost?

102
00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:33.408
It's just the security guard.

103
00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:34.908
He scared me out of my wits.

104
00:07:36.008 --> 00:07:39.308
He looks wasted today too.

105
00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:41.508
Okay, since he checked this place now,

106
00:07:41.508 --> 00:07:43.308
he won't be back here for some time.

107
00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:13.208
See, there's no ghost anywhere.

108
00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:15.708
But, there's a strange sound...

109
00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:24.708
A ghost wearing a hat is looking in from the window!

110
00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:26.108
Shinichi!

111
00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:28.708
Come off it! Take a good look!

112
00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:32.908
The hook of the curtain came off and it just looks that way.

113
00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:35.008
It's said to appear on nights when the moon is full

114
00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:36.608
because when it's brightly lit by the moon,

115
00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:39.508
the silhouette of this is clearly outlined.

116
00:08:39.508 --> 00:08:41.308
And the thing that sounds like a laugh

117
00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:44.608
is the sound of the wind coming in from the space between the window.

118
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:48.008
This is how it goes for most ghost stories once the trick is revealed...

119
00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:49.408
I guess so...

120
00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:50.608
Come on, let's go home!

121
00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:52.308
There's nothing here already.

122
00:08:54.008 --> 00:08:55.508
Do you really think so?

123
00:09:00.008 --> 00:09:01.308
Shinichi!

124
00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:06.308
Could it be that you just read the outline of the beginning of the story

125
00:09:06.308 --> 00:09:09.608
and already think that you've figured everything out?

126
00:09:09.608 --> 00:09:10.608
"Arsene Lupin, Gentleman Burglar by Maurice LeBlanc"

127
00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:13.208
This world is much deeper...

128
00:09:14.308 --> 00:09:16.808
and mysterious.

129
00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:18.408
What are you?

130
00:09:25.408 --> 00:09:27.208
Me?

131
00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:29.208
I'm your...

132
00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.308
Sibling.

133
00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:32.408
What?

134
00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:35.808
Rather, I should say, your younger brother,

135
00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.508
although we're quite some years apart.

136
00:09:40.108 --> 00:09:42.008
My younger brother?

137
00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:43.408
Cut out the stupid joke.

138
00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:45.608
Ran, get the security guard, quick!

139
00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:46.708
Okay!

140
00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:52.708
What? It won't open!

141
00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:53.908
What?

142
00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:55.008
No use.

143
00:09:55.008 --> 00:09:58.408
I've cast a spell on that door.

144
00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:00.808
And it only listens to me.

145
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.008
What'd you say?

146
00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:05.908
Hold it, I didn't come here to have it out with you.

147
00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:09.308
I came to challenge you.

148
00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:10.708
That's all.

149
00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:17.408
I'm wondering if you can find the treasure that is here.

150
00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:19.108
Treasure?

151
00:10:19.108 --> 00:10:21.508
If you find it, you win.

152
00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:24.408
I'll give you the treasure.

153
00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:25.608
On top of that,

154
00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:28.708
I'll disclose my identity to you.

155
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:32.208
You're free to take on the challenge or not.

156
00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.308
If you accept the challenge, I'll undo the spell

157
00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:36.008
and you can get out of here.

158
00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:37.208
But, if you don't accept it,

159
00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:39.508
you'll end up spending your entire life in this dark and cold room

160
00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:42.508
that sends chills up your spine.

161
00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.608
And by the way,

162
00:10:43.608 --> 00:10:46.408
I happen to love blood.

163
00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:49.108
I just can't resist red things.

164
00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:52.108
You don't scare me at all!

165
00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:56.008
We're not going to listen to a villain like you!

166
00:10:56.008 --> 00:10:58.508
What a spirited young lady.

167
00:10:59.608 --> 00:11:01.408
I accept.

168
00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:03.608
I'm saying that I'm taking on the challenge!

169
00:11:03.608 --> 00:11:05.408
I'm playing his game!

170
00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:08.108
Just as would be expected of "Shinichi Kudo".

171
00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:09.908
My "older brother".

172
00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:23.708
Shinichi.

173
00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:25.308
Why you... What do you think you're doing...

174
00:11:27.308 --> 00:11:28.808
He's gone.

175
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.108
He vanished?

176
00:11:55.317 --> 00:11:58.917
Hey, Shinichi are you really going to take on the challenge?

177
00:11:58.917 --> 00:11:59.917
Yeah.

178
00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:01.917
Because father tells me that I should never back out

179
00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:03.517
when somebody picks a fight with me.

180
00:12:03.517 --> 00:12:07.117
But, that man looked scary like the devil.

181
00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:10.717
Be it a devil or an ogre,

182
00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:13.917
I want to find out what his identity is.

183
00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:15.417
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

184
00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:17.817
As well as the answer to this code!

185
00:12:18.917 --> 00:12:22.917
But if that man casts a strange spell on you again,

186
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:25.217
you might die, Shinichi.

187
00:12:25.217 --> 00:12:26.417
Spell?

188
00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:28.517
Remember, he cast a spell on the door

189
00:12:28.517 --> 00:12:30.617
so that it wouldn't open, right?

190
00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:33.117
Come off it! Take a good look.

191
00:12:33.117 --> 00:12:35.617
There's a mop placed over there.

192
00:12:35.617 --> 00:12:37.617
A fishing line is tied onto the handle

193
00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:40.417
and passed through a hook that is suspended in air.

194
00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:42.917
Since the time we entered this room

195
00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:45.417
that guy manipulated the fishing line from behind the bookshelf

196
00:12:45.417 --> 00:12:49.517
and made the mop stop the door, so that it wouldn't open.

197
00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:51.317
And as for the other door,

198
00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:54.817
he probably locked it beforehand from the outside so it wouldn't open.

199
00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:59.317
Either way, in this dark place it's hard to tell right off the bat.

200
00:12:59.317 --> 00:13:02.617
Moreover, he said a lot of things to scare us

201
00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:04.817
but he's no wizard!

202
00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.917
He's just a klutz of a magician

203
00:13:06.917 --> 00:13:09.117
that forgot to hide the secret to his tricks!

204
00:13:09.117 --> 00:13:10.717
You're amazing, Shinichi!

205
00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:12.917
You sound just like Holmes!

206
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.617
I guess so.

207
00:13:16.317 --> 00:13:18.417
Then, Mr. Holmes?

208
00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:21.217
What does that code say?

209
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.617
I don't know what it means but...

210
00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:25.017
I think it is read as,

211
00:13:25.017 --> 00:13:29.217
"Haido no okoriwo chinmeyo" (Means let's repress the anger of Haido).

212
00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:31.417
"Okoriwo chinmeyo"?

213
00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:33.017
Is that really how you read it?

214
00:13:33.017 --> 00:13:36.717
Yeah, the word "okoru" (kanji for anger) comes out a lot in novels.

215
00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:40.617
For the word, "chin", mom has a CD entitled "Chinkonka" (Kanji for Requiem)

216
00:13:40.617 --> 00:13:41.617
"Requiem" -I asked her how it's read before,

217
00:13:41.617 --> 00:13:43.017
so there's no mistake about it!

218
00:13:44.217 --> 00:13:47.317
Maybe a grown-up can tell us what it means!

219
00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:49.217
Let's ask our dads!

220
00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:50.517
No way!

221
00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:52.817
Don't ever ask any grown-up!

222
00:13:52.817 --> 00:13:55.417
This is a match between that guy and me!

223
00:14:04.717 --> 00:14:07.417
That boy...

224
00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:09.117
Read the phrase "Ikariwo shizumeyo" (Kanji for repress the anger),

225
00:14:09.117 --> 00:14:12.917
mistakenly and read, "Okoriwo chinmeyo"!

226
00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.417
How cute.

227
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:17.817
I'll bet that boy called Shinichi was dumb!

228
00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:21.117
Give me a break. You can't read it either, can you?

229
00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:22.717
You don't have to laugh that hard.

230
00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:24.017
Hey!

231
00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:25.717
You can't help it.

232
00:14:25.717 --> 00:14:28.117
I mean he was only a first grader back then after all.

233
00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:32.617
But, that boy called Shinichi, kind of resembles Conan.

234
00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:34.417
You think so?

235
00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:35.817
And then?

236
00:14:35.817 --> 00:14:37.617
What happened after that?

237
00:14:37.617 --> 00:14:39.317
Come on tell us, quick!

238
00:14:39.317 --> 00:14:41.917
Did the two get home safely?

239
00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:45.717
Yeah, according to Ran...

240
00:14:45.717 --> 00:14:47.717
Ran!

241
00:14:47.717 --> 00:14:50.417
Where on earth did you go at this time of night?

242
00:14:50.417 --> 00:14:53.917
Well, I sort of forgot something at school so...

243
00:14:53.917 --> 00:14:55.217
Don't lie to me!

244
00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:57.717
It's Shinichi again, isn't it?

245
00:14:57.717 --> 00:14:59.617
Yes.

246
00:14:59.617 --> 00:15:00.817
Just as I thought!

247
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.517
I thought he was putting on a low profile recently but...

248
00:15:03.517 --> 00:15:06.417
I wonder how Yukiko is bringing him up?

249
00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:11.217
A liberal upbringing as would be expected of her, I'd say.

250
00:15:11.217 --> 00:15:14.017
Honey, are you going to work?

251
00:15:14.017 --> 00:15:17.617
Yeah. There was a murder at a warehouse at Haido Harbor just a while ago.

252
00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:20.217
I got a call from Inspector Megure.

253
00:15:20.217 --> 00:15:22.317
Please do be careful!

254
00:15:22.317 --> 00:15:24.017
I mean it's so dangerous these days.

255
00:15:24.017 --> 00:15:26.917
Make sure you lock the doors too!

256
00:15:26.917 --> 00:15:30.917
It seems that the flashy thief is out there having a ball too, so...

257
00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:31.917
Of course!

258
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:33.917
I mean I'm the wife of a police officer after all!

259
00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:35.417
Bye.

260
00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:37.617
Bye. Take care of Ran, Eri.

261
00:15:39.417 --> 00:15:40.617
Okay...

262
00:15:40.617 --> 00:15:42.017
I got it!

263
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:43.817
I'll give him a good lecture.

264
00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.717
I'm so sorry, Eri.

265
00:15:45.717 --> 00:15:47.017
Good night.

266
00:15:49.017 --> 00:15:53.317
So, you're not going to bed until you spit it out, Shinichi.

267
00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:57.417
Why did you take a girl with you to school at night?

268
00:15:58.517 --> 00:16:00.317
I told you already, didn't I?

269
00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:02.117
I forgot something and went to get it.

270
00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:05.517
Do you think that suffices as an answer?

271
00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:07.417
Well, no big deal!

272
00:16:07.417 --> 00:16:10.017
They both came back safely.

273
00:16:10.017 --> 00:16:12.417
But, Yusaku...

274
00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:15.117
Besides, this is not an interrogation by the police,

275
00:16:15.117 --> 00:16:18.417
so getting angry will only make him more reticent.

276
00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:22.217
First, repress your anger and deal with him calmly.

277
00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:24.017
"Let's repress your anger"?

278
00:16:24.017 --> 00:16:26.417
How do you write that word?

279
00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:27.917
"Let's repress the anger".

280
00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.217
Do you write it like this?

281
00:16:30.517 --> 00:16:31.717
What's that?

282
00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:34.017
Well, the teacher...

283
00:16:34.017 --> 00:16:36.317
It's a secret code that the teacher made.

284
00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:38.117
What a teacher.

285
00:16:38.117 --> 00:16:40.517
Giving a code with difficult kanji characters like this to first graders.

286
00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:41.717
"Let's repress the anger of Haido."

287
00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:45.417
But, she seems to be an interesting teacher who likes riddles.

288
00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:47.317
Riddles?

289
00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:51.417
It's to simple to deem that "Haido" is someone's name.

290
00:16:51.417 --> 00:16:52.417
Right!

291
00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:54.317
Shall we go to the beach or something soon?

292
00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:55.817
How nice!

293
00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.717
Haido Harbor?

294
00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:03.817
Does that code say "Go to Haido Harbor", Shinichi?

295
00:17:03.817 --> 00:17:05.017
Yeah.

296
00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:08.017
"Let's repress the anger of Haido".

297
00:17:08.017 --> 00:17:10.917
It means the place where the anchors of ships are sunk in Haido-cho,

298
00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:12.717
in other words the harbor.

299
00:17:12.717 --> 00:17:17.517
But, Shinichi, I thought last night you read it as "okoriwo chinmeyo"?

300
00:17:17.517 --> 00:17:20.617
Did I?

301
00:17:20.617 --> 00:17:22.517
But are you sure it's okay?

302
00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:26.217
After all, that man snuck into school at night

303
00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:28.717
and was waiting for you, wasn't he?

304
00:17:28.717 --> 00:17:30.517
Don't you think we should notify the police?

305
00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:31.717
He said that if I decipher this code,

306
00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:34.617
he would disclose his identity.

307
00:17:34.617 --> 00:17:36.717
We can contact the police then.

308
00:17:36.717 --> 00:17:38.517
But I'm really sorry, Doc,

309
00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:41.417
for making you come along with us so early in the morning.

310
00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:44.017
No... Rather, I'm glad you did.

311
00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:47.517
It's been a long time since I've seen you both getting along so well.

312
00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:54.017
You two used to always play together up to elementary school,

313
00:17:54.017 --> 00:17:55.717
but since you guys haven't been around much together recently,

314
00:17:55.717 --> 00:17:57.517
I got worried

315
00:17:57.517 --> 00:17:59.917
thinking that maybe you fought or something.

316
00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.917
No, we didn't.

317
00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:03.117
Right?

318
00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:05.017
Yeah.

319
00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:10.017
Look at all the police cars.

320
00:18:11.217 --> 00:18:12.917
I wonder if something happened?

321
00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:15.517
Come to think of it, dad was saying last night

322
00:18:15.517 --> 00:18:17.917
that there was a murder at Haido Harbor.

323
00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:20.517
Don't tell me that the man is the killer?

324
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:22.417
No, it can't be.

325
00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:28.217
The incident occurred about the same time you both snuck into school.

326
00:18:28.217 --> 00:18:32.517
And there was a news report saying that the killer was arrested at dawn.

327
00:18:32.517 --> 00:18:35.117
The question is why does the man that you saw last night

328
00:18:35.117 --> 00:18:38.917
want you both to come here?

329
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:42.317
-If we wait here, maybe he'll come? -No.

330
00:18:42.317 --> 00:18:45.017
I just can't resist red things.

331
00:18:45.017 --> 00:18:46.817
Red, it's red.

332
00:18:46.817 --> 00:18:48.217
Something that's red.

333
00:18:48.217 --> 00:18:49.617
What about that?

334
00:18:49.617 --> 00:18:52.117
The place where the light is on is red!

335
00:18:52.117 --> 00:18:54.217
Dr. Agasa already told us, didn't he?

336
00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:57.517
The case has nothing to do with him.

337
00:18:57.517 --> 00:19:01.017
He wouldn't have known that police cars would be here.

338
00:19:01.017 --> 00:19:03.617
Which means he was referring to something red

339
00:19:03.617 --> 00:19:04.817
that was here to begin with.

340
00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:11.817
"Fire hydrant" -The fire hydrant?

341
00:19:14.017 --> 00:19:16.617
But nobody seems to be here.

342
00:19:19.717 --> 00:19:20.917
It's flipped over!

343
00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:27.517
A code is behind it.

344
00:19:27.517 --> 00:19:29.217
Another difficult Kanji character.

345
00:19:29.217 --> 00:19:30.417
Let's see...

346
00:19:31.817 --> 00:19:33.917
"Prove that Toriya is innocent."

347
00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:36.317
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits."

348
00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:42.717
I can tell that "Toriya" means Toriya-cho,

349
00:19:42.717 --> 00:19:46.717
but prove the Toriya innocent is what I can't make out.

350
00:19:46.717 --> 00:19:49.717
I'm sure it's some kind of riddle, though.

351
00:19:49.717 --> 00:19:53.317
Does wise old man mean Komon Mito?

352
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.517
Maybe.

353
00:19:54.517 --> 00:19:56.217
Doc, if it says the guy's innocent,

354
00:19:56.217 --> 00:19:58.417
it means that he's not the culprit, right?

355
00:19:58.417 --> 00:19:59.917
Yeah.

356
00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:01.617
If he's the culprit, he's black.

357
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:04.417
My dad, often says,

358
00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:06.917
"That guy's black, he's the culprit".

359
00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:08.417
Black?

360
00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:10.917
He's not the culprit. He's not black.

361
00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:12.717
In other words, he's white.

362
00:20:12.717 --> 00:20:15.817
White...

363
00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.717
The Toriya Castle (Has the same sound as white)!

364
00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.717
Let's head off immediately to the remains of the Toriya Castle then!

365
00:20:20.717 --> 00:20:24.117
No, We're going to the floodgate near that castle!

366
00:20:24.117 --> 00:20:25.117
The floodgate?

367
00:20:25.117 --> 00:20:27.017
Not the castle?

368
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.417
The wise old man,

369
00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:31.217
just as Ran said is Komon Mito.

370
00:20:31.217 --> 00:20:32.417
"Liver" mean internal organ (Has the same sound as wits).

371
00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:34.617
"Surprise wise old man out of his wits" most probably means

372
00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:36.317
to take the center out.

373
00:20:36.317 --> 00:20:37.517
"Komon Mito" -So, by removing the two kanji words in the middle,

374
00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:39.617
"to" and "kou", from Komon Mito.

375
00:20:39.617 --> 00:20:41.517
"Suimon" (Means floodgate in kanji)

376
00:20:41.517 --> 00:20:42.517
I see!

377
00:20:42.517 --> 00:20:45.917
The kanji characters that remain are "Mizu" (water) and "Mon" (gate).

378
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:47.917
Since it's near Toriya Castle,

379
00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:49.417
it has to be the Toriya Floodgates!

380
00:20:53.517 --> 00:20:57.017
So, here we are at Toriya Floodgate.

381
00:20:57.017 --> 00:21:00.817
There's nothing red and suspicious here.

382
00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:12.017
Maybe we should've gone to the remains of the castle first, after all?

383
00:21:12.017 --> 00:21:16.217
If so, the phrase, "Prove that Toriya is innocent" would've sufficed.

384
00:21:16.217 --> 00:21:19.517
But, the flood gate was written after that.

385
00:21:19.517 --> 00:21:20.717
Which means that here

386
00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:23.317
or in between the floodgate and the castle somewhere,

387
00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:24.617
there's a red thing...

388
00:21:27.217 --> 00:21:28.417
The railroad crossing!

389
00:21:40.617 --> 00:21:41.917
Did you find anything?

390
00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:44.317
No, nothing really.

391
00:21:44.317 --> 00:21:45.517
Wait a second.

392
00:21:45.517 --> 00:21:48.517
If we find it before this alarm turns red,

393
00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:49.917
there would be no meaning.

394
00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:52.817
The place we can find something after it gets red is...

395
00:21:52.817 --> 00:21:54.117
the crossing bar.

396
00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:04.217
Shinichi?

397
00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:05.317
Did you find it?

398
00:22:06.717 --> 00:22:08.317
"Erase the mark of Okuho."

399
00:22:08.317 --> 00:22:10.317
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice"

400
00:22:10.917 --> 00:22:12.417
-"Erase..." -"Erase..."

401
00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:15.517
"The mark of Okuho."

402
00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:19.017
"Clench your teeth in solitaire with an unclear voice."

403
00:22:29.917 --> 00:22:32.617
The third code?

404
00:24:02.717 --> 00:24:05.517
"Next Episode" -It's full of kanji characters.

405
00:24:05.517 --> 00:24:08.017
"East" -This looks familiar?

406
00:24:09.217 --> 00:24:10.317
A code?

407
00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:15.917
I see! Today's a public holiday!

408
00:24:15.917 --> 00:24:19.017
Maybe this is "weathervane".

409
00:24:19.017 --> 00:24:20.617
Weathervane?

410
00:24:20.617 --> 00:24:24.317
I see! It's direction!

411
00:24:24.317 --> 00:24:26.717
I see. That's what it is.

412
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:28.517
Next Conan,

413
00:24:28.517 --> 00:24:32.717
"The Adventures of Young Shinichi Kudo (Part 2)"

414
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:50.517
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:50.517 --> 00:24:53.317
"The person who gave Thief Kid his name"

416
00:24:53.317 --> 00:24:56.417
Toriya floodgate, a flood gate case indeed.
