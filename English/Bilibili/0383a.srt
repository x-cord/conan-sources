Today we bring to all of you out there...

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.040

3
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.940
-A Christmas present! -A Christmas present!

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.340
Something to blow the cold away.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.640
The hot passion of summer!

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.540
Right. And the stage of today's episode is...

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.640
Koushien Stadium. It's show time for me!

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.440
You're not the only one, Heiji.

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.540
A challenge from an unknown culprit!

10
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.940
A time suspense that will make your hands sweaty!

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.740
You just can't miss it, not even an instant!

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.640
Detective Conan has been airing for almost nine years.

13
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.940
Which means that next year will be the 10th?

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.640
That's right. It's thanks to the support of all of you out there.

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
That's right.

16
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.340
We'll keep trying even harder from now on!

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.440
So, please watch the TV programs.

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.940

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.540
Koshien ball grounds, the dream and goal of all high school ball players.

22
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.940
The Japan summer high school ball game will start this morning.

23
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.440

Chosen from among the winners are 49 schools.

26
00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.940
In the indoor training grounds on the side of the first base,

27
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.140
the players are waiting for the game to start.

28
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340

We will commence the Japan High School Baseball Tournament!

36
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.540
The players will make entry.

37
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.140
Following Tadohara High School is Oita's Meihou High.

38
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.840
This makes the third time Meihou has gotten this far in the tournament.

39
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.940
Representing Osaka. Here's Ogane High School.

40
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.040
They're getting a big cheer from the stands.

41
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.240
Now, we will move on to the player dedication.

42
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.040
Representing all players from Toyama Minami Vocational High School,

43
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
Captain Kawakami.

44
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.640
I pledge!

45
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.940
That we the players have come here with joy and admiration in our hearts

46
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.540
upon this great stage and will compete fair and square.

47
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.640
We will give it our best and display the results

48
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.940
of the of the training we went through

49
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.740
with the sportsmanship of fair play.

50
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.140
Representing all the players here, Toyama prefecture,

51
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.740
Toyama Minami Vocational High School Baseball Club,

52
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.040
Captain Tomoya Kawakami.

53
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.640
Koshien Stadium.

54
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.740
It's the place where the chosen high school ball players gather

55
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.340
from throughout the nation to compete using their skills and strength.

56
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.340
It is the pinnacle of one's goal.

57
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.040
It is a sanctuary where the goddess smiles on the champions,

58
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.640
as well as a fighting arena where the ball game is settled.

59
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840
Yes.

60
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.240
Koshien Stadium sometimes entices the bewitched into unbelievable fate.

61
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240
Here's a hot passionate suspense in this cold winter season.

62
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.940
Today's episode is a two hour special. Heiji also appears.

63
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.440
A difficult case on a grand stage.

64
00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

65
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

66
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.940
His name is Detective Conan!

67
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.640
"High School Ball Game, Invisible Summer Devil"

68
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.940
On the same day of summer vacation,

69
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.440
the ball game finals and Takarazuka show were to take place.

70
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.440
In order to decide which we'd go to

71
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.040
Hattori and Kazuha will have a deduction match.

72
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.640
The case is one that Pops was asked to help out with.

73
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.840
The clue on hand are wooden blocks that the president

74
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.140
of the toy manufacturing company had left behind as a dying message.

75
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.140
Thanks to Hattori's subtle hint,

76
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.040
Kazuha solves the message.

77
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.140
However, it turns out that Heiji figures out who the real killer is

78
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.640
and wins the deduction match.

79
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.540
We can finally go to the Koshien Stadium.

80
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.940
Congratulations, Heiji.

81
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.940
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

82
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.540
Now, I have to practice the boola boola.

83
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.940
Kazuha, wait.

84
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.340
Kazuha, I can ask Hattori for you to go to the Takarazuka show.

85
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.340
You are the one who solved the mystery of the dying message.

86
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.540
You are actually half the winner, right?

87
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.540
Forget it.

88
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.140
What I really wanted to see

89
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.540
wasn't the Takarazuka show or the baseball game.

90
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.240
It was Heiji's smile that he shows when he solves a case.

91
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.140
It's the Koshien Stadium!

92
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.740
I'm sure that here, there and everywhere...

93
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.340
Yoko.

94
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.140
Yoko?

95
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.740
Konan High School is where the idol Yoko Okino used to go to.

96
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.040
Hey, we're not there yet?

97
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.340
Are you all right, Kudo?

98
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.940
I give up.

99
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.640
By the way, why do they call this Koshien Stadium?

100
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.040
Why not Hyogo Stadium or Kansai Stadium?

101
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.240
I think it would've been way better.

102
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.440
The year that Koshien Stadium was completed

103
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.940
was the first year of both ten signs zodiac and the Chinese zodiac.

104
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.840
It was the meeting of the monkey and the mouse

105
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.040
which comes around every 60 years.

106
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.940
So they thought it was a lucky year.

107
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.940
You sure know a lot. Don't you, Conan?

108
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.740
He knows nothing about baseball

109
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.540
and yet he's knowledgeable when it comes to things like these.

110
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.940
Well, I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.240
That's not all there is about Koshien Stadium.

112
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.940
The number of the stumps of the famous ivies growing here total 430,

113
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.840
and the dimension of the leaves total 8,000 mats.

114
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.640
Although it's an old stadium,

115
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.240
it has the capacity to hold a total of 53,000 people,

116
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.440
which is virtually equal to that of a large stadium

117
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.840
that the major leagues play at.

118
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.940
How about it? Fantastic, don't you think?

119
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.140
You're just as bad as I am.

120
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.040
It's going to start.

121
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.740
Let's do our best...

122
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.340
Top of the 1st inning,

123
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.340
position number 1 short, player Inoue is the first batter

124
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.740
for Ohgane High School.

125
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.840
Play ball!

126
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.840
Strike!

127
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.240
Strike two!

128
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.340
Strike three, batter out!

129
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.640
The starting pitcher, Sakuraba, struck out the first batter.

130
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.640
One out. The stands are cheering.

131
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.340
Sakuraba is a senior at Konan High School.

132
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.540
Here comes the windup and the second pitch.

133
00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:04.588
-Strike! -Strike.

134
00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:07.188
Ohgane High School's pitcher, Inao, with another fastball.

135
00:12:08.588 --> 00:12:11.388
Here comes the second pitch.

136
00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:13.988
Another strike.

137
00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:20.888
Three strikes for Konan High School's batter.

138
00:12:40.888 --> 00:12:41.888
Now...

139
00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:47.088
Here comes the third pitch.

140
00:12:48.388 --> 00:12:51.788
-Strike, batter out! -Three swings and an out.

141
00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:54.288
Inao presses relentlessly with his trademark style.

142
00:12:56.588 --> 00:13:00.388
Konan High School's third batter, Kikuchi is a senior.

143
00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:02.888
The crowd is on their feet.

144
00:13:02.888 --> 00:13:07.388
This being the Koushien finals, we'll see three matched consecutively.

145
00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:12.088
And now, Kikuchi faces off against Inao.

146
00:13:12.088 --> 00:13:15.288
And here comes the pitch.

147
00:13:16.288 --> 00:13:17.788
-Strike! -Strike.

148
00:13:22.688 --> 00:13:26.388
The pitcher and the catcher exchange signs.

149
00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:33.288
And now, the second pitch.

150
00:13:34.488 --> 00:13:36.388
-Strike two! -Strike.

151
00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:42.588
Now, it's two strikes. Thanks to a mean curveball.

152
00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:46.388
The next batter, Nagashima is on deck.

153
00:13:50.388 --> 00:13:52.788
Strike, batter out!

154
00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:56.988
Ohgane High School's Inao holds off Konan High School

155
00:13:56.988 --> 00:13:59.088
with some aggressive pitching.

156
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:00.088
That's the end of the 1st,

157
00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:02.888
as Ohgane High School and Konan High School switch up.

158
00:14:02.888 --> 00:14:06.088
Konan High School's Sakuraba now takes the mound.

159
00:14:08.288 --> 00:14:09.788
It is the top of the 2nd inning,

160
00:14:09.788 --> 00:14:12.988
and center number 6 of Ohgane High School,

161
00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:15.388
player Matsuda is the batter.

162
00:14:20.788 --> 00:14:22.288
Strike!

163
00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:32.988
Foul ball!

164
00:14:34.688 --> 00:14:37.088
The finals are amazing.

165
00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:44.288
Strike, batter out!

166
00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:51.088

169
00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:11.788
bringing us to two outs.

170
00:15:11.788 --> 00:15:15.588
Number eight catcher, Watanabe.

171
00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:17.788
The catcher, Watanabe steps into the batter's box.

172
00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:24.888
The pitcher Sakuraba, with the delivery.

173
00:15:24.888 --> 00:15:26.488
He pops it up.

174
00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:28.588
-It's going right... -Foul ball!

175
00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:29.688
Foul.

176
00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:45.888

End of the bottom of the 2nd inning,

179
00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:55.888
as Sakuraba from Ohgane High School

180
00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:58.188
prevents Konan High School from breaking the no-run tie.

181
00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:03.388
Bottom of the 2nd. Hitting for Konan High School.

182
00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:07.188
Third baseman, Nagashima.

183
00:16:09.888 --> 00:16:12.888
And the batter we've been waiting for takes the box.

184
00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.688
Konan High School's Nagashima.

185
00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:19.188
Listen to this.

186
00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:23.188
The roar of the cheer of the people loud enough to erase the announcement.

187
00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:25.288
By some strange coincidence, it turns out that the same players

188
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:26.788
get to compete against each other three times in a row

189
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.188
at the finals of Koshien.

190
00:16:30.588 --> 00:16:35.488
Will the victor be the winner of last year, Konan High School?

191
00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:37.788
Or will it be Ohgane High School that is aiming

192
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.488
to win the spring and summer games successively?

193
00:16:46.988 --> 00:16:50.988
The pitcher flings his arms up high

194
00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:52.888
and prepares to throw his first pitch.

195
00:16:52.888 --> 00:16:53.988
There goes the ball!

196
00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:56.588
Strike!

197
00:16:59.088 --> 00:17:00.688
Talk about strike indeed!

198
00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:04.188
Strike. Strike.

199
00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:06.388
Hey, Pops.

200
00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:09.288
What have you been looking at all this time?

201
00:17:09.288 --> 00:17:11.888
Dad. The game's over that side.

202
00:17:11.888 --> 00:17:16.088
I bet he's watching the cheerleaders in those stand.

203
00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:17.888
Pervert.

204
00:17:17.888 --> 00:17:19.088
We came all the way out here.

205
00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:22.588
So watch the game, will you?

206
00:17:22.588 --> 00:17:24.988
But...

207
00:17:24.988 --> 00:17:27.188
Sitting in right stand like this,

208
00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:30.688
it's so far that you can't really watch the game anyway.

209
00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:35.088
I thought we were going to have better seats because you invited us.

210
00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:37.488
I'm so sorry.

211
00:17:37.488 --> 00:17:39.488
I asked an acquaintance of mine who lives here

212
00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:41.988
to line up and get the tickets,

213
00:17:41.988 --> 00:17:43.988
but he seems to have overslept.

214
00:17:45.088 --> 00:17:47.488
Inspector Ohtaki.

215
00:17:47.488 --> 00:17:51.888
Besides, the game between Ohgane and Konan is super popular.

216
00:17:51.888 --> 00:17:53.888
So, unless you come really early in the morning,

217
00:17:53.888 --> 00:17:56.588
it seems to be impossible to get an infield seat.

218
00:17:57.588 --> 00:18:01.188
That's why you should buy advance tickets.

219
00:18:01.188 --> 00:18:03.588
Nagashima faces off against the pitcher, Inao.

220
00:18:03.588 --> 00:18:07.288
Here comes the second ball.

221
00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:08.688
He pops it up!

222
00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:12.488
It clears the field and goes just foul.

223
00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:15.088
Here, have some ice candy. Ice candy.

224
00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:18.388
I bought one for each one of you.

225
00:18:18.388 --> 00:18:19.488
Cold!

226
00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:20.888
Thank you.

227
00:18:20.888 --> 00:18:22.788
You're welcome.

228
00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:25.488
But are you sure it's okay, Inspector Ohtaki?

229
00:18:25.488 --> 00:18:26.688
What about you work?

230
00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:30.588
No problem. He took time off anyway.

231
00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:31.688
Right?

232
00:18:31.688 --> 00:18:32.788
Yes.

233
00:18:32.788 --> 00:18:35.888
I've been watching the game for three days since the semi-finals.

234
00:18:37.488 --> 00:18:39.488
You like Koshien, don't you?

235
00:18:39.488 --> 00:18:41.688
Of course he does.

236
00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:46.388
Mr. Ohtaki may not look it, but he used to play high school baseball.

237
00:18:48.188 --> 00:18:49.388
Right?

238
00:18:49.388 --> 00:18:52.388
Come on, Kazuha. It's no big deal.

239
00:18:52.388 --> 00:18:54.888
Oh, really?

240
00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:57.188
How embarrassing.

241
00:18:57.188 --> 00:19:02.888
Have you played on this Koshien field, too?

242
00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:04.288
No.

243
00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:05.788
Making it to the best eight for the preliminary district match

244
00:19:05.788 --> 00:19:07.788
was as far as I ever went.

245
00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:14.688
But coming here and watching them play brings back memories.

246
00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:28.988
The days when we struggled while covered with sweat and dirt

247
00:19:28.988 --> 00:19:31.288
just to after that one ball.

248
00:19:36.288 --> 00:19:41.588
And just by giving the game everything you have.

249
00:19:41.588 --> 00:19:43.588
Just what do you think you're doing, Ohtaki?

250
00:19:47.088 --> 00:19:48.088
There!

251
00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:53.288
What's the matter? Missing a ball like that, Ohtaki?

252
00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:58.988
I guess I don't have the knack for playing baseball.

253
00:19:58.988 --> 00:20:01.888
That's not true. Don't give up.

254
00:20:01.888 --> 00:20:04.088
All you need to do is practice a little more.

255
00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:08.088
Right. I'll practice even more and get better.

256
00:20:10.388 --> 00:20:12.288
Hey! Freshman Ohtaki.

257
00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:13.388
Yes, sir?

258
00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:15.688
You'll be the number seven catcher for the practice game

259
00:20:15.688 --> 00:20:17.588
against Yakushiji High School that's coming up.

260
00:20:17.588 --> 00:20:18.988
Yes, sir!

261
00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.988
Hey, fantastic. Let's give it our best shot.

262
00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:23.088
Yes.

263
00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:44.188
I wonder if I don't have the knack for baseball?

264
00:20:44.188 --> 00:20:45.988
It's not that.

265
00:20:45.988 --> 00:20:49.988
Don't give up and practice more and more.

266
00:20:49.988 --> 00:20:53.288
If you give up before doing anything, that's it.

267
00:20:53.288 --> 00:20:56.688
I was really hopeless when I started off, too.

268
00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:59.588
But I stayed after school everyday and practiced.

269
00:20:59.588 --> 00:21:03.088
Then one day, I realized that I had become captain of my team.

270
00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:04.988
You weren't a good player?

271
00:21:04.988 --> 00:21:08.288
No. I was really bad.

272
00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:09.688
Are you serious?

273
00:21:09.688 --> 00:21:13.188
Yes. So don't give up, okay?

274
00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:30.688
Hey, what's with that look of yours?

275
00:21:30.688 --> 00:21:34.188
All the underclass men don't know what to do since you look so depressed.

276
00:21:34.188 --> 00:21:38.888
Ohtaki, you're the one who lead the weak team to where it is now.

277
00:21:38.888 --> 00:21:41.188
The underclass men are the ones who are going to Koshien.

278
00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:42.888
Encourage them and make them feel that can do it.

279
00:21:44.388 --> 00:21:48.388
I have one last thing I'd like to say to all of you.

280
00:21:48.388 --> 00:21:50.488
No matter what...

281
00:21:50.488 --> 00:21:52.788
No matter what, don't ever give up!

282
00:21:52.788 --> 00:21:54.288
Yes, sir...

283
00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:06.188
So I really think,

284
00:22:06.188 --> 00:22:08.588
that the effort I put in back then was worth it.

285
00:22:08.588 --> 00:22:11.588
I feel that one should never give up.

286
00:22:11.588 --> 00:22:15.588
Really? Koshien is really a good place.

287
00:22:29.588 --> 00:22:33.588
What a worthless place this is.

288
00:22:33.588 --> 00:22:35.888
Don't you think so, Hiroshi?
