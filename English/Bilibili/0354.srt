1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,440
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,440
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,840
The client is a famous child star.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
Search for mother ends up in a hot spring dive.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:51,268
If I get married,

9
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,268
what are you going to do, Kanichi?

10
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:54,568
So, you're going to get married after all.

11
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:56,168
I try so hard to stop you,

12
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,268
but you just won't listen.

13
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,768
Dad.

14
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:00,768
Why you...

15
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:04,468
Pops...

16
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,268
Dad.

17
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:08,668
Hey, Dad, are you listening to me?

18
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,468
Shut up. Be quiet, will you?

19
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:14,368
This is Yoko's best scene, you know.

20
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:18,568
Kanichi, I will never forget you.

21
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,168
This is the scene of the beach in Atami

22
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:23,468
where Kanichi and Omiya appear in the story "Konjiki Yasha", right?

23
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,668
Just how many times are you going to watch that video?

24
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:28,468
I, Kanichi will go mad of extreme grief...

25
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,068
Hey, Ran!

26
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,968
Never mind the video.

27
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,768
Tell me why you refused Mom's invitation

28
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,168
to go eat together!

29
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:41,768
Oh, yeah. That day's inconvenient for me.

30
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:43,168
May I ask in just what way is it inconvenient for you?

31
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:44,568
Who cares?

32
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:46,768
I mean, it's not that she's dead or anything

33
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,068
and we get to see her anytime.

34
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,668
"Konjiki Yasha" was never completed

35
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:55,368
because the author died while he was still writing the story.

36
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:57,668
So the two characters in the series

37
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:01,168
lost their way to happiness forever.

38
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:02,968
In our case, we're going to see it through

39
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:06,468
and make it no matter what.

40
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:09,468
I hope you're not thinking

41
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:12,968
of trying to get Eri and me back together again, are you?

42
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,468
Of course I am!

43
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:16,568
It's only natural for kids

44
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,468
to want to live happily with both their parents, isn't it?

45
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,168
That's nonsense.

46
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:29,468
There are people who abhor even looking at their parent's faces.

47
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,168
"Kazuki Kinukawa (7), Talent"

48
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,468
And I'm one of them.

49
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,268
What's with this brat?

50
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,868
Huh?

51
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,968
You sure look familiar.

52
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,768
Are you by any chance,

53
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,868
Kazuki Kinukawa, the popular child actor

54
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:46,268
who acts in dramas and movies?

55
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,968
Yeah, I am.

56
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:51,368
You're even cuter than you look on TV!

57
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:53,968
And? What does that famous brat

58
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,568
want with our detective office here?

59
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,968
I want you to look for somebody.

60
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:02,168
A woman called Atsuko who keeps sending me

61
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:03,968
postcards like these.

62
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:09,768
"The Little Client (Part 1)"

63
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,568
It's true that all there is here is the name of the sender

64
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,468
and no address.

65
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,468
Wait a minute. Aren't these fan letters?

66
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:23,868
It's full of comments

67
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:26,668
about the dramas and movies that you acted in!

68
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,068
She seems to be a really great fan of yours.

69
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,368
She's sent you postcards

70
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:31,768
once every month from spring two years ago

71
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:33,668
to winter last year.

72
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:37,668
But all of them are stained and wrinkled up.

73
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,168
You should put these away nicely if they're fan letters.

74
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:41,568
I can't help it, can I?

75
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:45,268
They gave me the creeps, so I just kind of left them lying around.

76
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,568
Give you the creeps?

77
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:50,068
Because they're not fan letters.

78
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,168
They're postcards from my mother.

79
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,468
Your mother?

80
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,468
Yeah.

81
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,668
They're postcards from a stupid lady,

82
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,268
who abandoned me in front of the door of a church

83
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,468
as if I were a piece of trash six years ago.

84
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:06,068
I see. That's why you mentioned

85
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,668
not wanting to see your parent's face.

86
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,968
But if you want us to look for her,

87
00:05:09,968 --> 00:05:12,368
it means that you want to see her after all.

88
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:13,768
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:18,568
I just want to see the lady and give her a piece of my mind.

90
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,468
I want to tell her not to claim being my mother

91
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:23,168
at this point just because I'm famous now!

92
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,168
But it's amazing how you figured out it was your mother.

93
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,668
It doesn't say so anywhere.

94
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:31,968
I can tell.

95
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:33,068
Because the name and the handwriting on the postcard

96
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,068
are the same as they were on the memo

97
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,868
that was left with me when she abandoned me.

98
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,568
Looking for her is not going to be easy though.

99
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:41,268
The postcards are stamped from different places,

100
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,168
all the way from Hokkaido to Okinawa.

101
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:47,568
You can tell that she really likes to travel.

102
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,168
Never mind then.

103
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,068
I'll go look for another detective that will search for her.

104
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:57,068
I think that your mother's in a hotel or inn

105
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,668
some place in Atami.

106
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,268
Where is it written?

107
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,568
Look at this postcard.

108
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:05,968
There is something that looks like the hand

109
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,768
and head of a statue on the bottom part, right?

110
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,068
Doesn't this statue look familiar?

111
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,268
Now that you mentioned it, it does look familiar.

112
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:18,068
I see!

113
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,268
It's this!

114
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:23,368
It looks just like this pose

115
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,068
which means it's probably the statue of Kanichi and Omiya

116
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,168
at the beach in Atami!

117
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,768
She probably used the top part of the postcard set

118
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:32,468
which was made up of four postcards.

119
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:36,468
It could be that she used something that she bought as a souvenir too.

120
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:40,168
But there are three other postcards like it too.

121
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,668
And they're all the upper left ones.

122
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,468
If she's rich enough to travel to inns throughout Japan,

123
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,668
I think she would send all four types of postcards.

124
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,268
And I'm sure that postcards of other places

125
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,868
would be mixed among them, right?

126
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:54,168
I get it! I think your mother

127
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:56,668
didn't want you to know where she was,

128
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,868
so she sent only the postcards on the top left

129
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,068
because it's the hardest to tell from these

130
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:02,768
that it's the statue of Kanichi and Omiya.

131
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,968
She probably used postcards that remained

132
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:05,968
after everything else was sold out

133
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,768
from the shop at a hotel or an inn.

134
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,668
Then she probably gave it to the guests that came to stay,

135
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:11,968
asking them to send the postcard out

136
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,868
after they returned to their homes.

137
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:14,968
I see.

138
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,068
People from all over Japan come to hotels or inn,

139
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:19,668
so if we check the hotel roster,

140
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:20,868
we can figure out where they came from.

141
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,068
Which means your mother is

142
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,468
an employee of a hotel or an inn.

143
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:29,168
Why don't we take a drive to Atami either way?

144
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,068
Well, I don't see why not.

145
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,868
But you're going to pay the fee if we find her, right?

146
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,568
Yes, a whole lot.

147
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:40,468
Unlike that lady, I'm rich.

148
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:46,068
Come on, let's go and get it over with.

149
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:49,768
My schedule's open only today and tomorrow.

150
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,568
What a nasty kid.

151
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:54,668
You're kind of like Conan.

152
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:55,968
How dare you...

153
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:02,668
No, I have no idea.

154
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:05,868
We don't carry postcards like these here.

155
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,068
I see.

156
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,468
Thank you very much.

157
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:16,368
We came all the way to Atami

158
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:17,968
and we're sweating it out here

159
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,968
without even going to a hot spring.

160
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,568
Maybe a postcard doesn't suffice as a lead after all.

161
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,968
Ran.

162
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,268
Carry me please!

163
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,668
If you're tired, I'll piggy back you.

164
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:39,868
I want to be carried!

165
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,768
I want to be hugged, not be piggy backed!

166
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,068
Hey, you...

167
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:46,068
Talk about being spoiled.

168
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,468
-Hey. -I think this is the spot

169
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,668
where that lady had a mole.

170
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:52,668
Huh?

171
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,368
I remember going to sleep

172
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:00,068
and seeing the mole in front of my eyes.

173
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:04,168
But I was much smaller back then,

174
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,168
so maybe it was further down.

175
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,768
Hey, if it was further down...

176
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:13,768
Well, will you carry me one more time?

177
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,368
Okay.

178
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,368
You don't have to do that.

179
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:19,368
We already have an idea on where it is.

180
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,568
But I want to be sure...

181
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:24,168
You don't have to. We already know.

182
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,968
What? You used to sell it?

183
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,368
Do you mean this postcard?

184
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:31,468
Yes.

185
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,268
It was a limited product that was only sold here,

186
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:38,068
but these sets of four postcards didn't sell too well.

187
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:39,368
"Mitsu Kusano (34)" -Having no other choice,

188
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,068
"Female employee" -we divided them among ourselves

189
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,968
since we couldn't return them to the publisher either.

190
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:46,868
Amazing! It's just like you said, Conan.

191
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,768
Please excuse me for asking this inappropriate question.

192
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,768
Is there a woman

193
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:55,568
by the name of Atsuko working here?

194
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:58,868
No, there's no one by that name here.

195
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,768
Is that so?

196
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,368
By any chance, are you that famous...

197
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:09,868
Yes. I'm the famous Detective Mouri.

198
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:12,468
Kazuki Kinukawa?

199
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:13,768
Yes.

200
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:15,768
Oh, my. Just as I thought!

201
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,368
Come over here, Ms. Bessho!

202
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,868
It's Kazuki!

203
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,668
"Toshika Bessho (29), Female employee"

204
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:22,268
Hello...

205
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,868
That's strange.

206
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:29,268
She's a fervent fan of yours.

207
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,868
I wonder if she's shy.

208
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,968
So? What's up today?

209
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,568
Did you come to spend the night here?

210
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,168
Well, the thing is...

211
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:41,568
I'll bet you came to look for her.

212
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:43,268
"Yasuhiro Kamoshita (37)" -Your mother...

213
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,568
"Freelance writer" -who abandoned you.

214
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,868
Hey, who are you anyway?

215
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,868
A guest. I'm just a guest.

216
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:53,168
I'm Kamoshita, the one who reserved room 205.

217
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,568
I came here just to check things out,

218
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:56,568
but I guess it's my lucky day

219
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,568
to have the entire cast out here.

220
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:00,768
This is surely going to make a great story.

221
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:05,168
How come he knows about the kid's mother?

222
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,668
Will you be spending the night here?

223
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,168
Why don't we stay?

224
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:14,468
Maybe Kazuki's mother

225
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:17,268
is working here under a different name.

226
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:19,868
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

227
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,468
I was planning to stay anyway.

228
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:22,868
That's great!

229
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,768
Then, I can stay a while longer with Kazuki.

230
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:28,868
Okay, then.

231
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,268
Ms. Saegusa.

232
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:32,168
"Tomoka Saegusa (28)" -Please show them to room 308

233
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,568
"Female employee" -where we had a cancellation.

234
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,568
Yes.

235
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,068
This is room 308.

236
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,968
The yukata and mattresses are in the closet,

237
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,368
so help yourselves.

238
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,068
Hey!

239
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,168
Can't you be a bit more explicit?

240
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,868
Quiet. We're so busy as it is

241
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:51,268
that we can't be bothered with extra guests, you know.

242
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:53,968
Don't push your weight around just because you're a bit famous!

243
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:03,868
Is that the right attitude towards their guests?

244
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:08,468
You gave me your word, editor.

245
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:11,768
Keep a page open for me, okay?

246
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:15,168
If this isn't duff gen, the book will sell well.

247
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:18,668
Because it's about the number one kid actor,

248
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:21,468
Kazuki Kinukawa's father

249
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:25,468
being a killer.

250
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,815
I'm really full.

251
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:39,715
Thanks to you, we end up taking a bath so late.

252
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,815
You drink too much beer.

253
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,415
What's the matter?

254
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,815
Oh, it's the cap of a camera lens.

255
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,915
Could this belong to the Kamoshita guy we saw a while ago?

256
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:58,615
Now that you mentioned it...

257
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,615
I'll go give it to him.

258
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,715
I'm sure he said he was staying in room 205.

259
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:08,615
Hey, Ran! Let him be! He's so weird!

260
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,115
I tell you. She doesn't give a hoot about anything I say.

261
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:15,415
Guys and girls get to go in together?

262
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:19,515
I hope somebody's inside!

263
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:20,615
How silly.

264
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:23,215
At this time of night, I doubt anybody is inside.

265
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:27,715
Gosh!

266
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,115
Oh, good evening.

267
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:32,715
Excuse me.

268
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:33,815
Please help yourself.

269
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:35,615
Being able to take a bath with Kazuki

270
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,115
will be a memory of a life time!

271
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,415
But...

272
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,815
Quit being a prude.

273
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:45,515
Oh, I just noticed that all three of you

274
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:49,415
have such attractive moles.

275
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,615
Do you always take a bath at this time?

276
00:13:56,615 --> 00:14:01,915
Yes. We wait till all the guests are done.

277
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:05,715
By the way, where's the girl that was with you?

278
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:08,315
My daughter, Ran, went to Mr. Kamoshita's room

279
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,515
to deliver something he dropped.

280
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,015
Ran?

281
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,315
Ran!

282
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,915
Don't tell me that guy had the nerve to touch her!

283
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:24,415
Hey, what's wrong?

284
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,215
That...

285
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,415
Did he drown?

286
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,415
No. The trace on his neck

287
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,215
shows that he was strangled.

288
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,315
Hey, look. There's a cell phone on the floor.

289
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,715
What?

290
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,715
A picture seems to have been saved just a while ago.

291
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,715
Don't tell me the killer's picture is...

292
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,915
This is...

293
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:58,415
a mole on a woman's chest?

294
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,215
I see.

295
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,415
So you picked up Mr. Yasuhiro Kamoshita's camera cap in the corridor

296
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,515
and delivered it to his room,

297
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:12,215
where you found Mr. Kamoshita dead.

298
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,715
Is that right?

299
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:15,715
Yes.

300
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,715
Just as Mr. Mouri had said,

301
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,415
it seems he was strangled

302
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:24,915
with a thin string-like thing.

303
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:27,915
If so, was the body put inside the bath tub

304
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,815
to complicate our job of determining the estimated time of death?

305
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:35,715
But the killer could not deceive me, Kogoro Mouri!

306
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:36,815
Just what do you mean?

307
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:39,615
It's in this camera.

308
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,615
Inside Mr. Kamoshita's cell phone...

309
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:42,815
Wait.

310
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:46,515
I don't think you should say that yet.

311
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,815
Why not?

312
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,515
Oh, my.

313
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:54,415
You're the one who appears on TV a lot.

314
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:56,615
I'm Kazuki Kinugawa.

315
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:57,915
He came with us to this inn

316
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,115
because of some personal matter.

317
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,615
I see.

318
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,515
All right. You kids go back to the room.

319
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:05,715
Inspector Yokomizo.

320
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:09,215
According to the people of the inn,

321
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,115
Mr. Kamoshita called one of the waitresses

322
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:14,115
and said something weird.

323
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:15,515
Something weird?

324
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,215
He said, "If 20 million yen sounds familiar to you,

325
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,015
then come to my room.

326
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:22,815
If you don't, I'll disclose everything."

327
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,315
I have no idea what the 20 million yen is about,

328
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,015
but Mr. Kamoshita must've had hold

329
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:31,915
of something the waitress wanted to keep secret.

330
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:34,315
If so, it's seems like we already have the killer.

331
00:16:34,315 --> 00:16:36,915
We can look at the picture in his cell phone.

332
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:38,515
All we have to do is find a waitress

333
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:43,115
who had no alibi at the time the picture was taken here.

334
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:46,215
This is indeed a picture of the murder site!

335
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,015
See. It's shown below, isn't it?

336
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,415
It says 11:48 pm.

337
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,115
There is a mole on the chest of the woman

338
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,215
who was choking Mr. Kamoshita's neck from behind.

339
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,315
Bummers.

340
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,515
There's no doubt about it!

341
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:03,415
The killer is a woman with a mole on her chest, Mr. Mouri!

342
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:04,415
True.

343
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,615
That means the killer is...

344
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,215
The killer is my...

345
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,315
Kazuki?

346
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:34,815
Wipe yourself.

347
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,415
Kazuki, where are you?

348
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:49,115
You came to this inn to look for Kazuki Kinukawa's mother.

349
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,115
Yeah.

350
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,815
The clue to his mother

351
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,615
was that she has a mole on her chest.

352
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,415
But I didn't think that there'd be a mole

353
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,215
on the chest of this killer too.

354
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,015
It's obvious, isn't it?

355
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:01,915
I wonder if Mr. Kamoshita is the one

356
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,315
who really took this picture.

357
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,015
The picture is static

358
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,915
and conveniently, the face of the killer was not taken.

359
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:12,415
It could be that the killer took this picture deliberately

360
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,915
and rigged the time and date on it

361
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:16,615
to create an alibi.

362
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,415
I don't think so.

363
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,815
Not him again.

364
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:25,315
Because the killer had the string around the man's neck

365
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,615
and was pulling the string with both hands, right?

366
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,915
The killer couldn't have pressed the shutter

367
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,315
with both hands full!

368
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,115
Besides, if the killer took the picture,

369
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:34,315
I think she would wear some clothes

370
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:37,315
so that you can't tell if it's a man or a woman.

371
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,815
You're right.

372
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:42,515
The killer probably didn't know that a picture was being taken.

373
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,215
Right, Pops?

374
00:18:44,215 --> 00:18:45,515
Yeah.

375
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,715
Why did Mr. Kamoshita have his cell phone on him

376
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,715
when he was being attacked by the killer?

377
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,015
Maybe he was talking to somebody?

378
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,715
Then, why don't you try the re-dial button?

379
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,615
Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

380
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,415
It seems he was talking to someone

381
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:03,715
10 minutes before he took the picture.

382
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,315
"Tohto Publications"

383
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:07,515
What? Kamoshita was?

384
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:08,815
Are you serious, officer?

385
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,915
Yes. If you don't mind,

386
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,215
I'd like you to give me your name and tell me what you do.

387
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:16,515
I'm Izumiya, the editor of "Weekly Hot" magazine.

388
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:18,115
Kamoshita is a writer

389
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,515
who brings us a lot of scoop articles.

390
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:21,915
He called to tell me

391
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:23,915
that the woman with the scoop story

392
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:25,715
came to his room a little after 11:30 pm.

393
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:29,415
He said that the woman wanted to take a shower in his room

394
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,415
to wash off her sweat before the interview.

395
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:33,815
He also told me not to worry

396
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:36,215
because he'd make sure that he took a picture of the woman

397
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,715
with his cell phone.

398
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:41,115
And who is this woman with the scoop?

399
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:43,215
The mother called Atsuko, who left the kid actor, Kazuki Kinugawa,

400
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,815
in front of the door of a church when he was a baby.

401
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,215
She seems to be a devil threatening Kazuki's agency

402
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:51,915
to dish out 20 million yen

403
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:53,615
if they didn't want her to publicize the fact

404
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:57,715
that his father is a fugitive for killing somebody.

405
00:19:57,715 --> 00:20:01,015
Although the agency didn't really believe her story at first,

406
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,515
she knew the name of the church

407
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,215
as well as the characteristics of Kazuki's body in detail,

408
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:08,415
so they deposited the amount into her account.

409
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,815
Since all their dealings were carried out by e-mail,

410
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:14,415
he had no idea of what she looked like or how she sounded.

411
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:16,715
Kamoshita, who smelled that there was a scoop,

412
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,515
went to interview her in person.

413
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,915
That's why he brought up the 20,000,000 yen

414
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:25,915
to see if anybody would come up front.

415
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,515
Inspector.

416
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:32,415
The waitresses that have no alibi after 11:48 pm are here.

417
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,815
What? You are...

418
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:40,515
Hello again.

419
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,715
So? What do you want from us?

420
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,315
Did something happen?

421
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:46,415
There was a murder.

422
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,715
A man called Mr. Kamoshita, who was staying in this room

423
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,315
was strangled to death.

424
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,315
What?

425
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:53,515
-No way. -Are you serious?

426
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:59,815
I'll have to check your bodies a little bit

427
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:02,615
and see if any one of you has a mole like this on your chest

428
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,815
like the killer whose picture was taken

429
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,615
when she killed Mr. Kamoshita.

430
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:08,815
Wait a minute.

431
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:10,615
Are you telling us to strip naked right here?

432
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,915
What?

433
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:14,715
No, of course a female police will be here

434
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:17,015
and you'll be checked in another room.

435
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,715
Okay then.

436
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,815
Then hurry up and get on with it.

437
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,915
We still have work left to do.

438
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:25,415
There's no need for that!

439
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:28,215
See! I have no mole.

440
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:33,715
Hey, Ms. Bessho.

441
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,715
Right. It's not like we're going to lose anything.

442
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:41,615
Go on, Ms. Kusano.

443
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,915
They're going to suspect you if you don't.

444
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:44,915
All right.

445
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:49,715
Cool it, Pops.

446
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,015
You have a mole on your chest!

447
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,715
Take a good look, will you?

448
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:58,315
My mole is on the opposite side when compared to the picture.

449
00:21:58,315 --> 00:21:59,315
Oh, yeah.

450
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,115
Rather than checking on our moles,

451
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:03,215
why don't you go check the fingerprints on the murder weapon?

452
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:04,715
You found it, didn't you?

453
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:07,615
The black string that was in the picture a while ago.

454
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:11,615
Well, we've been looking for it for a while,

455
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,315
but we can't find it anywhere.

456
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,415
The black string that is estimated

457
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:19,315
to be over a meter long.

458
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,815
Right. The problems are the murder weapon

459
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:25,715
and that mole.

460
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,315
"Next Episode" -What? He went in?

461
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:58,215
Don't tell me you peeked into the women's bath!

462
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:03,615
I see. I get it now.

463
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:08,615
Kazuki?

464
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,315
The sound reminds me of my mother.

465
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,515
Huh?

466
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,115
So that's the story.

467
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,315
That means the most suspicious person

468
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:17,515
would be the one who tried to hide it.

469
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:21,615
Next Conan, "The Little Client (Part 2)"

470
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,342
Next Conan's Hint:

471
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,042
"Video tapes"

472
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,342
The next episode also takes place at a hot spring.

473
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,042
-Don't catch a cold! -Brush your teeth!

474
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,842
Tune in again next week!
