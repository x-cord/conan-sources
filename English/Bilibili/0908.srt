1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,870
Even in Tokyo, there are places like this.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,170
I know. It was worth coming, right?

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,670
The air's clear and the view's excellent.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,070
What a great place to drink sake.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,470
This way, please.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,870
Hey, miss. That watermill isn't working.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,770
That's right. It used to deliver water

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,970
to the wasabi farms.

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,870
Now we use it as an icehouse.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,270
An icehouse?

11
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,970
That's like a natural refrigerator, right?

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,070
Yes.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,070
It's where we keep the natural ice we serve here.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,370
Excuse me.

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,870
"Juri Matsui, Maria Suzumoto, Yuko Akiba (21)" -Are you...

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,770
"Teito University Philosophy Student" -Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,470
Yes, that's me.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,970
May I take a photo with you?

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,470
Of course. I don't mind.

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,670
Why don't I take it for you?

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,370
No, thank you.

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,070
Over here.

23
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,970
Let's line up in front of the river.

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,770
Mr. Mouri, everyone, please.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,570
Come on, Maria.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,470
Here.

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,270
Wait. Move aside.

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,370
Yuko.

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,970
Here we go.

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,070
Okay. Say "cheese".

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,470
Cheese...

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,970
When the countdown reaches zero,

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,570
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,570
Taking a commemorate photo by a cool riverbed.

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,970
Do these three women even like each other?

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,470
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,370
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:41,727
"Friendship Washed Away In The Riverbed"

40
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:47,827
Gosh! I have a blister.

41
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,127
I'm exhausted from walking so far.

42
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,027
But you said you wanted to come here.

43
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,827
Isn't that because you suggested

44
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,927
the three of us go somewhere together?

45
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,727
Now, now.

46
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,627
We came here to make up with each other.

47
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,527
Maria, do you have any band-aids?

48
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,127
Thanks.

49
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,927
Excuse me.

50
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,227
Here is your appetizer.

51
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,127
This looks delicious!

52
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:27,327
I'll take one, too.

53
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:31,727
What are they doing?

54
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,627
Dad, don't you know?

55
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:36,727
It's popular among girls these days

56
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:39,827
to upload photos made to look cute to the internet.

57
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,827
See? I do it, too.

58
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,827
Cute, you say?

59
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,627
Is there a problem?

60
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,127
I hear some birds singing.

61
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,527
I can't get the right angle.

62
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,727
Look.

63
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,427
That's cute.

64
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,827
You're trying too hard to act cute.

65
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:10,427
You never change.

66
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:11,927
How about mine?

67
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:15,927
Maria showed me a new app.

68
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,327
It's all right.

69
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,827
But using an app for photo correction feels wrong.

70
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:22,527
How about yours, then?

71
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:24,727
What do you think?

72
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,727
Getting these shadows was really hard work.

73
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,227
It feels cold.

74
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,427
Did you say something?

75
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,227
What? No.

76
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,727
Let's have the great detective judge them.

77
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,027
I agree!

78
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,427
Excuse me.

79
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,127
Could you take a look at our photos?

80
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:49,127
We're thinking of submitting them

81
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,427
to a publishing company's photo contest.

82
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:52,927
I know about the contest.

83
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,927
The winner gets a book published of their photos.

84
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,027
Yeah.

85
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,727
Could you give us some advice?

86
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:05,527
But I don't know anything about photography.

87
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,927
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:09,427
Do you think that's good enough to win?

89
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,227
Don't make me laugh.

90
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,227
I'll be back.

91
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:21,627
Oh, no. My battery's dead.

92
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:24,727
No. I'm out of storage, too.

93
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,627
Should we go now?

94
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:27,827
Yeah.

95
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:31,527
Sorry. The judging will have to wait.

96
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,127
What was that about?

97
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,827
Gosh, Dad.

98
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:52,027
Anyway, those girls sure are taking a long time.

99
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,727
It's been a while since they left.

100
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,427
Their food's getting cold.

101
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,927
She really should try it.

102
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,627
I know. Apps are so nice.

103
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:05,227
What? Yuko's still not back.

104
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,727
She was probably busy taking photos

105
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,127
and forgot to keep track of time.

106
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,827
You're right.

107
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,327
Let's start without her.

108
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,327
This fish is transparent.

109
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:20,227
It's almost too pretty to eat.

110
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:22,127
Thank you for waiting.

111
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:26,027
This is our special natural shaved ice.

112
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:31,927
How cute!

113
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,927
Let me take a picture first.

114
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,227
What is that?

115
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,527
What's wrong?

116
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,727
Over there.

117
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,127
Yuko?

118
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,127
-What? -It's an emergency!

119
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,227
Wait, Conan!

120
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,327
Get a life preserver!

121
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,227
-Dad! -Stand back, kid!

122
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:00,527
Dad!

123
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:03,927
Pops!

124
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:08,927
Hey, are you okay?

125
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,827
She's dead.

126
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,427
Ran, call the police.

127
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:17,527
Got it.

128
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,527
-What are these? -Hey, kid!

129
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,127
How many times

130
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,927
do I have to tell you to stay out of crime scenes?

131
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,627
Go away!

132
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,427
Okay.

133
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:35,127
-Yuko! -Keep it together.

134
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:38,327
Here.

135
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:48,827
Mouri, did you just happen to be

136
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,227
at the scene of the crime once again?

137
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,727
I am ashamed.

138
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,727
It's a great detective's fate.

139
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,927
In any case, why don't you explain what was happening

140
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,427
when the body came down the river?

141
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,527
Well...

142
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,827
Don't tell me you don't remember

143
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:06,927
because you were passed out drunk in the middle of the day.

144
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,927
Of course not, Inspector. You must be joking.

145
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,527
We came here to take photos.

146
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:21,927
But Yuko got a text from someone and left.

147
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,827
Since she hadn't come back,

148
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,727
we were worried.

149
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:31,427
Then some blood red water suddenly

150
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:32,827
came flowing down the river.

151
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:36,927
That was when we saw Yuko in the red river.

152
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:37,927
That's right.

153
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,327
Awakened by the scream,

154
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:44,627
I leapt into the river and pulled her out.

155
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,027
I see.

156
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:48,727
So he was asleep.

157
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,927
Hey, miss.

158
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,427
What is it?

159
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:56,127
Earlier you said you came here to make up.

160
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,527
What did that mean?

161
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:02,127
Well, you know...

162
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,027
Inspector!

163
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:07,227
I have the results of the body inspection.

164
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:09,927
The cause of death was a cerebral contusion

165
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,627
from a blow to the back of the head.

166
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:14,927
Do we know what the red stuff in the water was?

167
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,327
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:19,427
It's a fern called Azolla Japonica

169
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:23,027
that grows in lakes, right?

170
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,927
Conan, you sure are knowledgeable.

171
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,527
I saw it on TV the other day.

172
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,027
Because the plant was small, buoyant and red,

173
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,427
they look like pools of blood

174
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:36,127
in large quantities.

175
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,427
I see.

176
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,927
We also discovered what we believe

177
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:44,327
to be the victim's belongings near the watermill.

178
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:47,727
You two. Do you recognize this?

179
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,327
That belonged to Yuko.

180
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,227
There's a label on it.

181
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:54,727
On the phone... Excuse me.

182
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,327
We found this photo.

183
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,127
It's possible the victim accidentally fell here

184
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,827
while trying to take a photo.

185
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:05,927
-Let me see that. -Hey!

186
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,027
This is...

187
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:09,927
Don't do that, Conan.

188
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,527
Sorry.

189
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,027
Hey. What's wrong, mister?

190
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,627
I wanted to go to the watermill,

191
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,927
but they won't let me in

192
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,527
because of an investigation or something.

193
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:28,627
You mean the watermill converted into an icehouse, right?

194
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,327
-Yeah. What about... -Thanks, mister.

195
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,227
Like Inspector Megure said,

196
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,927
it's possible she fell accidentally.

197
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,627
But what about the photo?

198
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:42,127
"Police, Keep Out"

199
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:46,927
Officer, did my beetle come flying this way?

200
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:49,227
I didn't see one.

201
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,627
-There it is! -Wait, kid!

202
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:55,227
You're Ms. Juri Matsui, right?

203
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:58,327
I heard you were away when the incident occurred.

204
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:01,327
Am I a suspect?

205
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:06,527
No. We're just questioning everyone as part of the investigation.

206
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,327
I just went to a convenience store to buy extra storage

207
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,027
for my phone.

208
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,327
"Receipt" -Why don't you check with the store clerk?

209
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,527
They'll confirm my story.

210
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,327
I'll take that.

211
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:21,427
The three of you came here together, right?

212
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:25,327
The decision to disband our photography club was suddenly made.

213
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,127
I got into a fight with Yuko over it,

214
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,727
so we came here to make up.

215
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,627
It's cold. This must be the icehouse.

216
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:48,827
Just as I thought.

217
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,427
The waterwheel that's supposedly not in use is moving.

218
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:58,027
They put sawdust on it so that it won't melt.

219
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,427
There's no doubt about it.

220
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,927
This wasn't an accident.

221
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,727
It was murder.

222
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,627
I went to get the charger I forgot.

223
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,927
I ran into the chef on the way.

224
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,227
You can ask him.

225
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:19,527
Who decided that you should come here?

226
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:20,727
It was Yuko.

227
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:24,527
She said one of her blog's fans told her to come here.

228
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:29,427
Do you know why she went to the watermill?

229
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:33,327
She probably wanted to take photos there.

230
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:35,627
She could be so egotistical.

231
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,627
Wild roses?

232
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,027
This is...

233
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,427
I see.

234
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,027
So that's how it was.

235
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,794
Conan!

236
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,694
Where did that brat disappear to?

237
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:27,494
Inspector, do we still have to stay?

238
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,594
I'm so sad.

239
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,694
I don't want to be here anymore.

240
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:33,094
Inspector.

241
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,894
This was an accident.

242
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:39,994
Yuko wanted to win a publishing company's

243
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,594
phone photography contest.

244
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,894
That's why she stole a march on her friends

245
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:46,394
and went to take photos of the watermill.

246
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:51,494
While trying various angles with her selfie stick...

247
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,194
Conan.

248
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,494
Where have you been?

249
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,194
Sorry!

250
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:03,094
Wait, Conan!

251
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:12,294
Inspector, this wasn't an accident.

252
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,294
It was murder.

253
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:18,394
What are you talking about?

254
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:22,594
You just said it was an accident.

255
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:26,394
I was just elaborating based on a common line of thinking.

256
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:29,694
But now it's time for the great detective to shine.

257
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,594
Don't you think it's strange?

258
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:35,594
Her selfie stick was discovered in the riverbed.

259
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:39,994
But if she slipped while trying to take a photo,

260
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:43,594
she and her phone should've fallen into the river.

261
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,894
You're right.

262
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,594
In other words, the selfie stick

263
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:51,094
was placed in a way that makes it look like an accident

264
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:54,094
by the person who murdered Ms. Yuko.

265
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:55,894
What?

266
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:59,994
The killer lured her out using a free texting service.

267
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,494
I'll be back.

268
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,094
Sorry. The judging will have to wait.

269
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,394
Later, she gave her own excuse

270
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:09,594
and went after the victim.

271
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,894
After meeting her at the watermill,

272
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:15,994
the killer asked her for tips on taking good photos

273
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,694
and made the victim take selfies.

274
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:22,594
Then, she convinced Ms. Yuko to go into the watermill

275
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,594
after breaking the lock beforehand

276
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:27,394
and struck Yuko with some natural ice

277
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,294
and killed her.

278
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:31,294
In the watermill,

279
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:34,594
there were traces of sawdust being swept.

280
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:39,694
The killer must have erased their footprints.

281
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,194
After murdering Ms. Yuko,

282
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,994
the killer used a cart

283
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:45,794
to transport the body from the watermill.

284
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:49,294
Then she threw her into a pool

285
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:51,494
and left the selfie stick on the riverbank

286
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:55,594
so it would look like she fell into the water.

287
00:16:55,594 --> 00:17:00,394
The person who staged the accident and murdered Ms. Yuko

288
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,394
is among us.

289
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:06,794
Hey, listen.

290
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,894
What? Mr. Mouri did?

291
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:21,594
But Mouri, when Yuko fell into the river,

292
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:24,594
weren't the two of them with you?

293
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:25,794
That's right.

294
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,294
You also saw

295
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:30,294
Yuko float down the river with the red water.

296
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:33,694
That was the killer's trick.

297
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,994
What?

298
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,894
Officer Takagi, are you ready?

299
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,394
Takagi?

300
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:40,894
Now that you mentioned it, where is he?

301
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:47,194
Allow me to recreate that trick for you.

302
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:52,194
Ready!

303
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,594
The waterwheel spun.

304
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:16,894
Yes. The killer opened a sluice which wasn't normally used.

305
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,694
The river water swept up the Azolla Japonica

306
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,994
that had grown in the irrigation canal

307
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:24,494
and flowed into the pool.

308
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:27,994
Eventually, the water level in the pool rose.

309
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:32,894
We've been waiting a long time now.

310
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:35,294
Nothing's happening.

311
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,194
The time used

312
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:40,794
was exactly what the killer carefully calculated as part of their trick.

313
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,894
Pools are naturally formed when sections of the river curve

314
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,294
and separate from the main river.

315
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:53,294
When a body is put in a pool and water is directed towards it,

316
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,394
it will eventually flow out into the river.

317
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:57,394
The one who planned all of this

318
00:18:57,394 --> 00:19:00,694
was you, Ms. Maria.

319
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:01,794
Me?

320
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:05,194
There were tiny scratches on the body.

321
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:08,394
She probably got them from the thorns of wild roses

322
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,894
while being carried to the pool.

323
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,394
Those same scratches

324
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:15,694
should also be found on the killer's body.

325
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,194
Maria, did you...

326
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:21,494
No, Juri. These are...

327
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,494
Believe me!

328
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,094
I really didn't...

329
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:28,594
There's no point in playing dumb.

330
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:30,294
I've already noticed.

331
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,094
You weren't wearing band-aids when you first arrived,

332
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:38,294
but you were when you returned from the riverbed.

333
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,694
Inspector.

334
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,294
I had the forensics team examine the watermill.

335
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,494
They found what we believe

336
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:48,094
to be Ms. Yuko's blood on one of the blocks of ice.

337
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,694
What? Is that true?

338
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,894
Why don't you give up already?

339
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:56,694
That's just your reasoning.

340
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,594
Show me the proof.

341
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,494
Proof that I killed her!

342
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,994
You have it on you, Ms. Maria.

343
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:08,494
The gloves you wore when picking up the ice

344
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:11,194
haven't been found anywhere.

345
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:14,194
I believe those gloves must have Yuko's blood

346
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:18,194
and the sawdust from the crime scene on them.

347
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:19,994
Excuse me.

348
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:22,994
I found them.

349
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:30,194
She got what she deserved.

350
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:34,594
The three of us were college friends.

351
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:36,494
If we won the contest,

352
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:39,294
we'd have a collection of our photos published.

353
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:41,994
To leave a lasting memory of our college life,

354
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:45,194
we agreed it would belong to everyone

355
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:46,994
no matter who won.

356
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:47,994
But...

357
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:50,494
"Maria_suzu has uploaded a post."

358
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,494
"What is this? It's terrible." -But that day,

359
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:58,394
I realized the person making those comments was Yuko.

360
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,694
Yuko, thanks for waiting.

361
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:05,794
"Just go away."

362
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,594
No way. Yuko, did you...

363
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:11,794
Oh, no. Have I been found out?

364
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:14,294
But it's true.

365
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:18,094
Besides, I'm going to win the contest.

366
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:22,594
She was insulting everyone in the photography club

367
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,194
who were submitting photos

368
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:26,194
so she would win.

369
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:30,194
The next day, we were friends as usual,

370
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:33,894
but the slanderous comments didn't stop.

371
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:36,594
I couldn't take it anymore.

372
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:39,694
I tested it countless times. My plan was perfect.

373
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:42,294
I anonymously commented on Yuko's blog

374
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:44,794
so she would come here.

375
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:51,294
Why? Why didn't you tell me about it?

376
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:53,494
Aren't we friends?

377
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,594
Sorry.

378
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,494
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,494
I'm home.

380
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,794
Welcome home, Ran.

381
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:32,194
I found a shaved ice shop in the area

382
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,394
that uses natural ice.

383
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,994
Want to check it out sometime, Conan?

384
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:38,594
Sure.

385
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,594
It's not like you're penguins.

386
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,694
What's so fun about eating ice?

387
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,694
Who cares?

388
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:50,394
Pops, penguins don't eat ice.

389
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,194
"Next Episode" -A nice campground

390
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,394
was opened recently.

391
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,094
Conan and his friends are going next weekend.

392
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:02,494
I see.

393
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:04,094
All right!

394
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,194
We pitched the tent!

395
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,094
Urushibara, that's going too far.

396
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,394
What?

397
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:14,194
I could crush you anytime I wanted.

398
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:16,494
Just like Danno!

399
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,894
You jerk.

400
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,594
Next Conan,

401
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:23,794
"Mystery of the Burning Tent (Part 1)"

402
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,237
Next Conan's Hint:

403
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,337
"Chief Kuroda"

404
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:30,637
It's summer vacation!

405
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,837
I'm burning with excitement for camping!

406
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,437
It's a tent that's going to be on fire.

407
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:34,437
What?
