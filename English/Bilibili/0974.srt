1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.940
Sergeant Momosaki and
Lieutenant Yagi were murdered

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.560
one after another in the
policewoman serial murder case.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.660
It was determined that the dying messages
they left behind pointed to no parking signs.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.370
And that signified...

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.760
I had no idea Japanese road signs
were based off English ones.

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.470
England...

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.020
Japanese road signs are
based off English ones...

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.550
That's it! So that's how it is!

9
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.070
Listen, Detective Chiba...

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.360
Oh, sorry. Someone's calling.

11
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.370
Hello? Hello?

12
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.720
Hey, what are you doing?!

13
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.760
Damn! You had two phones?

14
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.920
Ch-Chiba-kun...

15
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.640
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

16
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.450
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

17
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.930
The culprit's identity is becoming clear!

18
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.280
Hurry to Patrolwoman Miike, Detective Chiba!

19
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.860
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.570
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.970
his name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:33.597
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Four)

23
00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:36.887
"Target: MPD Transportation
Department, Part Four!"
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Four)

24
00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:38.947
Target: MPD Transportation Department
(Part Four)

25
00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:40.037
Metropolitan Police Department
Haido City Station

26
00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:43.947
Hello, Sato-san? It was a week ago after all.
Metropolitan Police Department
Haido City Station

27
00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:48.017
One week ago, there was a
woman who committed suicide

28
00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:50.457
by jumping from the roof of an office
building on Second Street in Haido City.

29
00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.687
Her name was Midorikawa Aiko.

30
00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:54.787
Since she worked at the
building she jumped from,

31
00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:57.467
her colleagues were able to confirm
her identity right then and there.

32
00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:01.717
She resided in room 702
of the apartment building.

33
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.827
Left at the scene were her shoes and phone.

34
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.727
Later, a suicide note was
discovered in her desk as well.

35
00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.227
And, in fact...

36
00:04:10.427 --> 00:04:12.477
You know who the culprit is?

37
00:04:12.807 --> 00:04:16.487
You know who killed Sergeant
Momosaki and Lieutenant Yagi?

38
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:17.587
Yeah.

39
00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:20.427
The culprit is one of the traffic violators

40
00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:24.737
they arrested one week earlier, right?

41
00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:25.887
Yeah.

42
00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:29.607
They were extremely angry when they
were brought into the police station,

43
00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:31.677
so that's the lead we're following.

44
00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:36.087
They were Aono, who forgot his license
and was using his phone while driving,

45
00:04:36.087 --> 00:04:38.507
Aono Kengo
They were Aono, who forgot his license
and was using his phone while driving,

46
00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:40.797
Akamine, who was riding a motorcycle
against traffic without a helmet,

47
00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:43.257
Akamine Manji
Akamine, who was riding a motorcycle
against traffic without a helmet,

48
00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:47.097
and Shiroyama, whose inspection was expired
and forgot to wear his seat belt, right?

49
00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:49.187
Shiroyama Yuzo
and Shiroyama, whose inspection was expired
and forgot to wear his seat belt, right?

50
00:04:49.187 --> 00:04:49.517
Shiroyama Yuzo

51
00:04:49.697 --> 00:04:54.267
And most likely, both the first victim
Sergeant Momosaki was pointing at

52
00:04:54.647 --> 00:05:00.277
and the second victim Lieutenant
Yagi was facing a no parking sign.

53
00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:05.677
Do you know why signs prohibiting something
are a circle with a diagonal line?

54
00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:08.157
N-No, I don't.

55
00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:12.567
Because the shape is combination
of the letters N and O.

56
00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:15.367
In other words, it means "no" in English.

57
00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:19.297
No parking signs are a "no"
layered on top of a blue sign.

58
00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:22.217
Which means blue (ao) plus "no" is ao-no.

59
00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.047
The culprit is Aono-san.

60
00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:26.807
Blue plus no makes Aono?

61
00:05:27.207 --> 00:05:31.857
Do you really think they made a
lame pun with their dying messages?

62
00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.897
That's what I thought at first,

63
00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:37.567
but if that's the only thing you saw in
the vicinity, wouldn't you do the same?

64
00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:41.507
Dying messages can't be
noticed by the culprit,

65
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.427
but it's also not good if
no one understands them.

66
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.437
Most people don't know the
history of road signs,

67
00:05:48.437 --> 00:05:52.307
but it's likely an officer of the
Transportation Department would notice.

68
00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:54.217
It's the perfect message.

69
00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:57.097
Then there's 7155.

70
00:05:57.097 --> 00:05:57.917
Huh?

71
00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:02.677
The number Lieutenant Yagi left on her
phone that doesn't connect to anyone.

72
00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:07.807
It probably refers to road traffic
law article 71, section 5-5.

73
00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:12.117
While operating a vehicle, drivers must
not hold their phone in their hand

74
00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:14.527
or look at its screen.

75
00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:20.487
In other words, I think we can
assume it refers to Aono-san,

76
00:06:20.487 --> 00:06:22.197
who was using his phone while driving.

77
00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:28.197
We just received word from Sergeant Chiba.

78
00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:31.667
We've received information
identifying Aono Kengo

79
00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:35.207
as the suspect in the policewoman
serial murder case.

80
00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:38.567
I'm ordering the emergency
deployment of police forces

81
00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:41.207
in a wide area to search for Aono Kengo.

82
00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:45.337
He's a dangerous criminal who
has murdered two of our own.

83
00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:48.947
For the dignity of the police,
we must arrest him!

84
00:06:48.947 --> 00:06:49.847
Yes, sir!

85
00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:54.107
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:54.657 --> 00:06:55.597
Oh, but...

87
00:06:56.447 --> 00:07:00.457
It was Conan-kun who figured all of this out.

88
00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:05.337
The Sleeping Kogoro's adviser...

89
00:07:06.317 --> 00:07:08.367
I suppose I'm not surprised.

90
00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:12.257
Aono hasn't returned to his home.

91
00:07:12.777 --> 00:07:17.127
According to his neighbors, they
haven't seen him for several days.

92
00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.997
According to Aono's coworkers,

93
00:07:20.227 --> 00:07:23.877
this afternoon they told a woman who
came to ask about his whereabouts

94
00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:27.257
that he was probably at his girlfriend's
place if he wasn't at home.

95
00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:30.607
Yes, it was definitely Lieutenant Yagi.

96
00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:32.267
I confirmed her identity using a photo.

97
00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:46.487
Sato-san, look!

98
00:07:53.217 --> 00:07:54.847
It's so noisy.

99
00:07:54.847 --> 00:07:57.577
There are a lot of patrol
cars driving around.

100
00:07:58.807 --> 00:07:59.997
Of course there are.

101
00:08:00.717 --> 00:08:05.017
They're looking for the suspect
who murdered two police officers.

102
00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:12.187
So I recommend you release me
immediately and turn yourself in!

103
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:15.067
I told you...

104
00:08:17.927 --> 00:08:21.397
If you want me to release
you, just tell me already.

105
00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:24.147
She's in here, isn't she?

106
00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:28.907
That damn woman named Yumi.

107
00:08:29.057 --> 00:08:31.407
Why do you want to know?

108
00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:36.537
I'm going to tell her I found your
phone and have her come here to get it.

109
00:08:36.957 --> 00:08:40.907
Then I'll push her out the
window and break her head open,

110
00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:43.887
just like my girlfriend Aiko.

111
00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:51.757
Though she might trigger a trap
first and end up skewered instead.

112
00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.447
In that case...

113
00:08:56.877 --> 00:08:58.677
I wouldn't tell you even if I knew!

114
00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:01.927
What?

115
00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:06.937
Aono Kengo's girlfriend killed herself by
jumping off the building she worked at?

116
00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:09.437
One week ago?

117
00:09:09.437 --> 00:09:10.497
Yes.

118
00:09:10.497 --> 00:09:13.617
Apparently she couldn't take
the power harassment

119
00:09:13.617 --> 00:09:15.447
she was suffering at the hands of her bosses.

120
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:19.927
Aono received a text from his
girlfriend that said "goodbye."

121
00:09:20.377 --> 00:09:24.457
He rushed out of work, got into
his car without his license,

122
00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:30.617
and was caught by Sergeant Momosaki and
Lieutenant Yagi while he was on his way to her.

123
00:09:31.477 --> 00:09:34.967
So he resented them for stopping him.

124
00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:38.807
He believes he could've prevented his
girlfriend's suicide if that hadn't happened.

125
00:09:39.097 --> 00:09:40.977
But according to the local jurisdiction,

126
00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:44.557
she called Aono immediately
after texting him, right?

127
00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:48.627
Yes, but Aono didn't answer,

128
00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:50.817
so she left a voicemail instead.

129
00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:54.197
She was using a recording app on her phone,

130
00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.827
so they were able to confirm the
message's contents at the scene.

131
00:09:58.327 --> 00:09:59.547
Her phone, huh?

132
00:10:00.227 --> 00:10:04.667
Speaking of phones, they received a
phone call while questioning Aono,

133
00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.837
and he was extremely upset.

134
00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:07.867
Yes.

135
00:10:07.867 --> 00:10:10.967
The officers who came to help
question them heard what he said.

136
00:10:11.197 --> 00:10:13.047
You're seriously talking about karaoke?!

137
00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:16.887
Someone might die, and you're
talking about karaoke?!

138
00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:21.207
The two of them had a mutual friend named
Yumiko who they went to karaoke with.

139
00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:24.937
But both of them called her Yumi.

140
00:10:25.137 --> 00:10:26.357
Yumi?

141
00:10:26.357 --> 00:10:30.407
Did Aono hear that name then
and plan to kill Yumi-san next?

142
00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:34.947
If you're looking for someone named
Yumi among their acquaintances,

143
00:10:34.947 --> 00:10:36.067
it's certainly possible.

144
00:10:36.267 --> 00:10:38.327
Where is Yumi-san now?

145
00:10:38.327 --> 00:10:41.547
I've been calling her, but she won't answer.

146
00:10:44.907 --> 00:10:45.837
A text?

147
00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:51.697
Conan-kun just sent a message
to Takagi-san's phone.

148
00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:53.127
Conan-kun did?

149
00:10:53.127 --> 00:10:55.967
Due to certain circumstances,
I'm driving him home right now.

150
00:10:56.227 --> 00:11:00.007
Is the number I just sent
him Yumi-san's number?

151
00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:02.347
What? Yumi called you?

152
00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:05.747
I don't know if it was Yumi-san,

153
00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:09.307
but I heard four sets of a fingernail
tapping a phone seven times.

154
00:11:09.307 --> 00:11:13.857
After that, I heard a male voice say, "Hey,
what are you doing?!" before they hung up.

155
00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:15.897
I thought it might be...

156
00:11:15.897 --> 00:11:17.407
What? Wait.

157
00:11:17.407 --> 00:11:19.367
This is Miike's number.

158
00:11:19.547 --> 00:11:22.297
What? Miike, Yumi-san's subordinate?

159
00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:25.707
Come to think of it, we can't
get in touch with Miike either.

160
00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:30.247
It's possible the culprit figured
out she's a police officer

161
00:11:30.247 --> 00:11:32.457
and kidnapped her so he can lure
Yumi-san to him and murder her!

162
00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.457
What?

163
00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:36.737
If he plans to call her to him,
then he can't be that far.

164
00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:40.347
What places are nearby that the
culprit would be familiar with?

165
00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:44.767
Do you know what Aono does for work?

166
00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:46.207
Y-Yes...

167
00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:48.767
I think he was a remodeler.

168
00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:55.727
An English school, an out-of-business arcade,

169
00:11:55.727 --> 00:11:59.317
a planetarium, a sports
facility, a restaurant...

170
00:11:59.727 --> 00:12:00.697
It's no use.

171
00:12:00.697 --> 00:12:03.537
There are more places being
remodeled than I expected.

172
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:08.957
The only clue we have is the four sets
of seven taps that Detective Chiba heard.

173
00:12:09.527 --> 00:12:12.627
Damn it! Where are they?!

174
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.124
A remodeler...

175
00:12:43.124 --> 00:12:44.864
Four sets of seven taps...

176
00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.304
What does it mean?

177
00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:51.584
By the way, Chiba-kun, how
did the sound you heard go?

178
00:12:51.584 --> 00:12:54.014
I believe it was...

179
00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:58.514
Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap,

180
00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:03.644
tap tap tap tap tap tap tap.

181
00:13:04.714 --> 00:13:07.184
Huh? That sounds familiar.

182
00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:08.684
It's "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"

183
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:09.774
What?

184
00:13:09.984 --> 00:13:12.234
Twinkle twinkle little star,
how I wonder what you are.

185
00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:14.734
Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky.

186
00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:17.784
The lyrics are four phrases
of seven syllables each.

187
00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:21.654
She could only communicate using
sounds because her mouth is covered!

188
00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:25.484
The culprit works as a remodeler, and
then there's "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star!"

189
00:13:25.484 --> 00:13:28.664
In other words, she's being held in the
planetarium that's being remodeled!

190
00:13:34.944 --> 00:13:39.774
The planetarium is near the park we were
just at that was the scene of the first murder.

191
00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:43.654
Hurry!

192
00:13:50.894 --> 00:13:53.644
Damn it. You're determined
not to talk, aren't you?

193
00:13:58.574 --> 00:14:00.494
Forget it, then.

194
00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:09.624
Instead, I'll make it so
you can never speak again!

195
00:14:10.294 --> 00:14:11.624
Chiba-kun!

196
00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:19.134
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

197
00:14:19.134 --> 00:14:25.604
how I wonder what you are.

198
00:14:26.144 --> 00:14:32.184
Up above the world so high,

199
00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:38.494
like a diamond in the sky.

200
00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:44.834
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

201
00:14:45.474 --> 00:14:52.914
how I wonder what you are.

202
00:14:52.914 --> 00:14:56.694
A-A kid? What is this? Why are you here?

203
00:14:56.694 --> 00:15:01.214
I brought him here so he could distract you.

204
00:15:05.384 --> 00:15:10.924
Aono Kengo, you're under arrest for the
murders of two female police officers.

205
00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:12.904
Chiba-kun!

206
00:15:15.744 --> 00:15:18.814
22:54, suspect arrested.

207
00:15:21.574 --> 00:15:23.074
Damn it!

208
00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:25.994
Damn, damn!

209
00:15:26.984 --> 00:15:30.134
So you do have your phone with you.

210
00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:32.584
The police have been
calling you over and over.

211
00:15:34.024 --> 00:15:36.084
It's not on.

212
00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:39.854
This phone is full of memories of Aiko.

213
00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:41.844
I never let it out of my sight.

214
00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:46.814
But since that day, that moment,
I haven't looked at the screen!

215
00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:48.344
I can't look at it anymore!

216
00:15:48.804 --> 00:15:51.224
Since that moment Aiko died,

217
00:15:51.224 --> 00:15:54.474
no matter how often I look at it,
Aiko never says anything to me!

218
00:15:55.164 --> 00:15:56.994
I heard about your girlfriend.

219
00:15:57.574 --> 00:15:59.654
What happened was tragic.

220
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.994
It's your fault!

221
00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:06.034
Because you police wouldn't
let me go, Aiko is...

222
00:16:06.224 --> 00:16:10.764
Weren't you driving without a
license while using your phone?

223
00:16:11.374 --> 00:16:13.034
It's only natural that you were arrested.

224
00:16:13.404 --> 00:16:14.814
Those are the rules.

225
00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:16.794
There it is. The rules.

226
00:16:16.794 --> 00:16:19.324
They could've quickly written me a ticket!

227
00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:23.064
But they wasted my time by talking
about karaoke on the phone

228
00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:25.474
and slowed me down!

229
00:16:25.474 --> 00:16:28.514
I wanted to get to my girlfriend
to convince her not to do it!

230
00:16:28.984 --> 00:16:31.804
The police killed Aiko!

231
00:16:33.014 --> 00:16:35.844
The police didn't kill your girlfriend.

232
00:16:36.574 --> 00:16:38.364
It was a coincidence that
they received a call.

233
00:16:38.854 --> 00:16:42.404
Even if it hadn't happened,
they wouldn't have let you go.

234
00:16:42.924 --> 00:16:46.904
It was clear from your behavior
that you were out of your mind.

235
00:16:47.394 --> 00:16:49.904
They thought you needed time to calm down.

236
00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:53.904
No one can remain calm
under all circumstances,

237
00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:56.794
especially not if their
loved ones are involved.

238
00:16:57.574 --> 00:16:58.584
Not even me.

239
00:16:59.414 --> 00:17:06.134
It's the reason the policewomen
you killed did their jobs.

240
00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:09.004
So a driver like you

241
00:17:09.004 --> 00:17:13.534
who's lost their cool won't take the
life of someone else's loved on.

242
00:17:14.054 --> 00:17:15.554
You're lecturing me?

243
00:17:16.044 --> 00:17:19.854
Talk all you want, but Aiko still
died because you guys stopped me!

244
00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:23.104
If that hadn't happened,
I could've saved Aiko!

245
00:17:23.324 --> 00:17:25.304
Besides, I was calm!

246
00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:27.354
They had no reason to keep me there!

247
00:17:27.354 --> 00:17:28.094
No.

248
00:17:28.094 --> 00:17:29.724
You weren't behaving normally.

249
00:17:29.724 --> 00:17:32.364
You weren't there. How would you know?

250
00:17:32.364 --> 00:17:33.594
I do know.

251
00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:37.244
Your girlfriend left a
voicemail on your phone.

252
00:17:37.494 --> 00:17:38.744
A voicemail?

253
00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.454
I knew it.

254
00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:43.074
You haven't heard your girlfriend's message.

255
00:17:43.074 --> 00:17:46.394
No, you don't even seem to
know that she called you.

256
00:17:47.854 --> 00:17:51.014
She called you a minute after
she sent that last text.

257
00:17:51.634 --> 00:17:54.464
Because you were hurrying to your car,

258
00:17:54.464 --> 00:17:57.014
it's possible you didn't
notice she was calling.

259
00:17:57.264 --> 00:18:01.104
But you were looking at your
phone while driving after that.

260
00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:04.274
You were so preoccupied that
the police stopped you.

261
00:18:04.624 --> 00:18:10.154
You should've seen this notification
on your screen then.

262
00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:12.154
Voice Message   Missed Call
Aiko

263
00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:16.754
This important notification was visible
to you, but you didn't notice.

264
00:18:16.754 --> 00:18:19.164
I know exactly how shaken you were.

265
00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:20.894
Aiko...

266
00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:24.164
Let me hear it.

267
00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:28.174
Let me hear the message Aiko left for me.

268
00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:33.354
Aono-kun.

269
00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:36.694
Just sending a text seems bland,
so I'll tell you directly.

270
00:18:37.474 --> 00:18:39.694
Thank you for everything.

271
00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:45.304
Someone fell!

272
00:18:45.304 --> 00:18:46.674
Call an ambulance!

273
00:18:49.514 --> 00:18:50.684
Do you understand now?

274
00:18:51.414 --> 00:18:53.044
You were too late.

275
00:18:57.174 --> 00:19:00.264
You're lying!

276
00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:05.714
Aiko...

277
00:19:06.474 --> 00:19:10.594
You're Yumi-san's subordinate...

278
00:19:10.594 --> 00:19:11.424
Don't!

279
00:19:22.064 --> 00:19:23.934
How could you be so reckless?

280
00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:26.114
It's only natural! After all, I...

281
00:19:26.614 --> 00:19:27.854
I...

282
00:19:28.114 --> 00:19:31.374
Chiba-kun, you're...

283
00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:34.424
After all, I...

284
00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:40.264
I'm a police officer.

285
00:19:41.944 --> 00:19:43.144
It's only natural.

286
00:19:48.174 --> 00:19:52.134
I parked my car far away so
the suspect wouldn't notice.

287
00:19:52.404 --> 00:19:54.564
I'm going to carry you to a nearby hospital.

288
00:19:54.564 --> 00:19:55.834
Do your best to bear it.

289
00:19:55.834 --> 00:19:57.384
Okay.

290
00:19:59.384 --> 00:20:00.124
Chiba-kun!

291
00:20:00.124 --> 00:20:02.394
Sorry. Could you handle the rest?

292
00:20:07.654 --> 00:20:10.134
It should be around here somewhere.

293
00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:11.364
Beika University Hospital

294
00:20:11.364 --> 00:20:13.654
There it is. Beika University Hospital.
Beika University Hospital

295
00:20:13.654 --> 00:20:15.654
For Pedestrian and Cyclist Use

296
00:20:18.904 --> 00:20:21.644
Damn. The light's taking forever.

297
00:20:25.494 --> 00:20:27.404
There aren't any people or cars.

298
00:20:27.404 --> 00:20:28.544
Maybe I'll cross.

299
00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:31.964
You shouldn't cross.

300
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:32.964
What?

301
00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:36.454
You may think no one's
watching, but I'm watching.

302
00:20:36.454 --> 00:20:37.834
You're watching, too.

303
00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:40.934
Once you go easy on yourself and
break the rules, it becomes a habit.

304
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:44.734
Habits are hard to break even if you want to.

305
00:20:44.734 --> 00:20:47.184
Do you not even understand that?

306
00:20:47.184 --> 00:20:49.244
Y-You...

307
00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:52.934
It's not superheroes that I like.

308
00:20:52.934 --> 00:20:55.324
Don't make me say it, dummy.

309
00:20:55.704 --> 00:20:58.444
Thanks, Kamen Baiya.

310
00:20:58.714 --> 00:21:01.114
Chiba-kun, you idiot. I hate you!

311
00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:09.584
A-Are you really my childhood
friend Naeko-chan?

312
00:21:10.254 --> 00:21:11.044
You idiot.

313
00:21:13.504 --> 00:21:15.664
Took you long enough.

314
00:21:22.704 --> 00:21:25.414
The light turned green a while ago.

315
00:21:25.944 --> 00:21:27.724
Oh, right.

316
00:21:32.544 --> 00:21:36.484
Uh, oh! I forgot to return Naeko-san's
phone after I picked it up.

317
00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:43.364
Hey, while I was sleeping at Chukichi's
place, Miwako called me 54 times.

318
00:21:43.664 --> 00:21:46.574
I've been trying to call her
back, but her line's been busy.

319
00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:48.024
Did something happen?

320
00:23:19.174 --> 00:23:20.054
Yes.

321
00:23:20.054 --> 00:23:25.554
As you said, I gave all the
information I could to that boy.

322
00:23:25.884 --> 00:23:31.444
Though my information didn't do
much to help him solve the case.

323
00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:32.974
It's a minor matter.

324
00:23:32.974 --> 00:23:36.314
It's better not to have to
put out unnecessary fires.

325
00:23:36.804 --> 00:23:39.464
More importantly, how is that going?

326
00:23:41.894 --> 00:23:43.084
Nothing yet.

327
00:23:43.844 --> 00:23:47.704
Don't neglect to make your reports, Bourbon.
