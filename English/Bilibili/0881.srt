1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,610
Anyway, I had no idea

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,210
they count like this in Germany and France.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,910
Shinichi used to do that all the time.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,110
He said he got it from his mom.

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,910
Right, Mom tried to act cool by mimicking French people.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,210
Hey, kid.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,710
Is this how they count to three in Europe?

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,710
No. I saw on TV that even in Europe, there are exceptions.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,910
England is the same as Japan.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,510
They count to three

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,510
using their pointer finger, middle finger, and ring finger.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,010
I knew it. Of course.

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,310
During the Red Woman case, Sera...

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,210
That's a pretty thin bat though.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,610
Can you hit a ball with that?

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,410
She said something like that.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,710
Maybe she was thinking of cricket since that's popular in England.

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,910
Cricket bats are flatter and thicker than baseball bats.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,310
And according to American manners,

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,510
after cutting your food with a knife,

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,910
you switch your fork to your right hand.

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,810
You eat with your fork in your left hand in Japan and England.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,310
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,110
Didn't Sera say this, too?

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,910
That's how I know Conan's pretty good at football.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,210
Americans don't call soccer "football".

27
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,610
Which means Sera studied in England,

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,110
not America.

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,610
But why did she lied about going to England?

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,510
Wait a minute.

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,810
England...

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm afraid.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,910
I feel like I've been possessed.

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,610
England...

35
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,610
Who are you?

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,010
England...

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,910
One enthralled by the God of Death.

38
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,010
You're a magician!

39
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,310
That's it!

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,810
I remember now!

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,010
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

42
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,610
While looking into Sera's secret, I recalled a case on the beach!

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,310
He sees through the one and only truth.

45
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

46
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,610
His name is Detective Conan!

47
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:26,868
"The Magician of the Waves (Part 1)"

48
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:33,668
"10 years earlier..."

49
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,568
It's been a while.

50
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,668
Shuichi.

51
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,868
It's been seven years.

52
00:04:57,868 --> 00:05:00,668
You've grown, Shukichi.

53
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,068
You're starting your third year of high school now?

54
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,168
Yes.

55
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,768
Come on, say hello.

56
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,368
This is your first time meeting, right?

57
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,468
Nice to meet you.

58
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:13,768
I'm Masumi.

59
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,568
Who's the kid?

60
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,268
Have you forgotten?

61
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,868
She's your sister.

62
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,968
I sent you photos.

63
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,768
Come to think of it,

64
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:29,668
Mom had a baby bump before I left for America.

65
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,068
Unbelievable.

66
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,368
Anyway, where's Mary?

67
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:35,568
I thought you came here together

68
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,168
after she went to meet you at your hotel.

69
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,468
We had a bit of an argument at the hotel.

70
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,668
She got me with a chop.

71
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,468
Just look at this.

72
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,868
I got a few hits in though.

73
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:53,768
She's probably icing them right now.

74
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:57,268
You're the one who needs to cool his head.

75
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,468
I let you study abroad

76
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,068
because you said you wanted to study in America,

77
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,068
but now you're saying you actually went to investigate

78
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,768
the truth behind your father's case?

79
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:10,968
And on top of that, you're joining the FBI when you graduate.

80
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:14,868
You're like a child enthralled by the God of death.

81
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:19,168
I already have a green card and US citizenship.

82
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:22,468
All I need now is three years of work experience

83
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:26,368
and to pass the written and physical tests.

84
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,968
It won't be a problem.

85
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,068
I did struggle to get my driver's license,

86
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,468
since I couldn't get used to driving on the right side of the road.

87
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,068
In the country we used to live in and this place,

88
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:38,368
they drive on the left.

89
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,568
What about your living expenses?

90
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,268
Do you really expect me to send money

91
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,668
to someone who'd say something so stupid?

92
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,768
Don't worry.

93
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:49,768
I found a pretty decent job.

94
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:53,168
I'll survive until I can join the FBI.

95
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,268
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:56,268 --> 00:07:00,668
I invited you to the beach so you'd come back home.

97
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:05,568
I hope looking at this peaceful scenery

98
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:08,368
will help you cool your head,

99
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,968
and remember the words my husband said before his death

100
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:13,968
as he sent us to this safe country.

101
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:21,168
"Pretend I never existed.

102
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:26,768
I seem to have made some serious enemies."

103
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:28,068
Don't forget his message.

104
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,968
Mom, you're the one who's forgotten

105
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:37,468
that our father's body still hasn't been found.

106
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:43,568
Why don't we get some yakisoba at the beach hut?

107
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:44,668
Okay.

108
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,468
I've never met my other brother before.

109
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:56,568
Unlike Shukichi, he doesn't smile at all.

110
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,868
I want to see him smile.

111
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,368
Okay!

112
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:12,068
Shukichi, how could you let her do that?

113
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,768
It's dangerous.

114
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,668
It's no use. He won't smile.

115
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:17,768
Sorry.

116
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:21,768
Masumi said she wanted to get on top of the parasol.

117
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,768
In that case, I'll use what my PE teacher taught me.

118
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:43,168
That didn't work either.

119
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,968
Then I'll use my special technique.

120
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,168
This gets everyone in my class laughing.

121
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:51,168
"Fried Potatoes" -No one can resist laughing at this.

122
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,168
Don't play with your food.

123
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,668
Huh?

124
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:01,368
No way. This didn't work either?

125
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:02,468
Hey!

126
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:04,568
What are you doing, Masumi?

127
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:05,868
Mom.

128
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:08,068
You're a girl.

129
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:11,768
You got salt from your chips all over your upper lip.

130
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,768
Sorry.

131
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,768
Is that a popular joke in England?

132
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:18,868
-Huh? -Huh?

133
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:21,868
You're from England, aren't you?

134
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,868
In Japan, we call sliced and fried potatoes

135
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:31,768
covered in salt fried potatoes.

136
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:34,268
In America, they call them french fries.

137
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,968
Since you called them chips,

138
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:40,168
I thought you were from England, the land of fish and chips.

139
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:44,968
Anyway, have you seen my son?

140
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,468
He's a boy wearing green swim trunks.

141
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:50,968
He should be with a girl around his age.

142
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,068
No.

143
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,768
I see.

144
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,768
Gosh. Where did that kid go?

145
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,868
Sorry for bothering you.

146
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,068
It's fine.

147
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,468
Shinichi, where are you?

148
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:08,868
Safe country indeed.

149
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:11,168
Even an ordinary person like her

150
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:14,968
can tell where we're from just by the way we speak.

151
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:18,968
There's no such thing as a safe country, Mom.

152
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,068
Don't worry.

153
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:28,068
Before the men who killed Father discover who I am,

154
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,368
I'll send every last one of them to hell.

155
00:10:31,368 --> 00:10:32,868
It's totally obvious.

156
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,768
That you're a pierrot.

157
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:41,668
A clown...

158
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:44,768
I was listening to your conversation.

159
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:48,668
You travel to all kinds of countries, right?

160
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,868
As far as I know, the only people who do that...

161
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,168
are circus workers.

162
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:59,968
And when I saw your left hand, I knew exactly what you were.

163
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:05,168
I saw that mark on the back of your left wrist.

164
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:09,868
It's common among people who play the accordion.

165
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,468
Dad said that since they press the buttons

166
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:12,968
while inflating and deflating the instrument,

167
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:16,968
the belt leaves that mark on their hand.

168
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:24,568
Clowns play the accordion during circus shows all the time.

169
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:29,868
And there are all kinds of clowns at the circus,

170
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:36,368
but the only one among them that wear tear makeup are pierrots.

171
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:42,468
You still have some of that makeup under your left eye.

172
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,468
You probably forgot to wipe it off since you were in a hurry

173
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:49,968
to come to the beach, but you can't fool me.

174
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:53,568
You're a pierrot!

175
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,068
Am I wrong?

176
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:04,768
He smiled.

177
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:10,268
Sorry.

178
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:13,768
I've been to three countries,

179
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,968
but I'm not part of a circus.

180
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,768
Huh? Really?

181
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:23,168
Wouldn't that make everyone who likes to travel part of the circus?

182
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,368
Oh, right.

183
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:29,268
I'm impressed you noticed this mark left by the accordion,

184
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:35,368
but I got this playing requests for customers at a bar.

185
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,668
I make good money doing it.

186
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:40,568
And...

187
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:44,268
This mark under my left eye isn't make up.

188
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:47,768
It's a bruise I just got from my violent mother.

189
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:55,168
So, who are you?

190
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:59,368
I'm...

191
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:01,268
I'm Shinichi Kudo!

192
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,668
I'm Sherlock Holmes's apprentice!

193
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:11,668
Holmes's apprentice?

194
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:14,968
Shinichi!

195
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,468
There you are!

196
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,968
Your mom's looking for you!

197
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,068
Ran.

198
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,968
You were playing Holmes again, weren't you?

199
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,868
I wasn't playing.

200
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:29,368
I'm training to become a detective.

201
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,668
If you don't behave yourself, you'll get in trouble.

202
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:38,168
Those guys seemed really mad.

203
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,668
They should be.

204
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,268
You brat.

205
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,168
I finally found you.

206
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:50,168
You'll pay for embarrassing me earlier.

207
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,768
That was your own fault.

208
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:56,468
You tried to leave without paying for the yakisoba

209
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,768
you'd nearly finished by putting a fly in it.

210
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:03,668
If you hadn't said anything, no one would've noticed!

211
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:13,068
Sorry, but the kid's with me.

212
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,368
If you've got business with him,

213
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:17,768
you'll have to go through me.

214
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:24,768
If you don't mind having your eyes gouged out first,

215
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,968
I'll listen to anything you have to say.

216
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,168
Sorry!

217
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:35,968
Amazing!

218
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:38,068
What do you call that?

219
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,768
A finger jab.

220
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,968
It's a blinding technique.

221
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,168
It's a Jeet Kune Do technique.

222
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:50,868
Finger jab? Jeet Kune Do?

223
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,568
So cool!

224
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:59,268
Sorry, kids. But could you play with my sister?

225
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:03,568
She seems to be looking for some friends.

226
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,868
Sure.

227
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,168
-What? -What?

228
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:57,935
A car!

229
00:15:57,935 --> 00:16:00,035
Fell into the ocean?

230
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,135
Seriously?

231
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:21,635
He struck his head on the windshield

232
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:24,435
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

233
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:27,635
He must not have been wearing his seat belt.

234
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:30,335
His neck's broken.

235
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,235
He's a goner.

236
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:38,635
There's a bag in the back seat.

237
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,635
There's a bunch of brand-name watches inside.

238
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,835
They still have their price tags on them.

239
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:50,435
The window on the passenger side is open.

240
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:58,035
Looks like there was another person in the car.

241
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,535
He's back!

242
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,235
Stand back, please!

243
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:18,335
Thank you!

244
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,735
Will he live?

245
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,035
It's too late for that.

246
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,835
What's in the bag?

247
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:33,335
Clues to determining his identity.

248
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,335
Anyway, I need you to do something for me.

249
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:40,635
Remember the swimsuit shop at the beach hut?

250
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:43,135
Ask if any soaking wet customers came

251
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:46,435
to buy T-shirts, swimsuits, or sandals

252
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:49,535
after the car fell into the water.

253
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,235
There was another passenger in the car

254
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:56,735
who escaped and blended in with the crowd.

255
00:17:57,835 --> 00:17:59,035
Well?

256
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:02,135
Think you can do it, Holmes's apprentice?

257
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,635
Yes. Of course.

258
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:05,835
Here.

259
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,235
Thanks.

260
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:16,235
Did you come here alone with that boy?

261
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:20,235
No, we came with Shinichi's mom.

262
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:25,435
Could you ask her to call the police?

263
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,035
Tell them a car fell into the ocean.

264
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,235
Sure!

265
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,935
Shinichi's mom!

266
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,035
What about me?

267
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,435
What should I do?

268
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:41,035
Let me help.

269
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:46,135
Tell the man at the parking lot to stop anyone

270
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:51,035
wearing wet clothes or a swimsuit from leaving.

271
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:55,035
They could be working with some bad guys.

272
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:56,335
Can you do that?

273
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,435
Do you remember

274
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:05,435
who came to buy T-shirts

275
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,335
after the car fell into the water?

276
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:12,635
I'm not sure. There were two or three of them.

277
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:15,435
But I don't remember their faces.

278
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:18,835
Was there anyone with soaking wet hair?

279
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:21,035
Everyone's hair is wet.

280
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,435
They're here to swim.

281
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,035
I think there were three.

282
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,535
Huh?

283
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:31,635
I spent a while at this shop deciding if I should buy this shirt.

284
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,935
Really?

285
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:36,835
I play shogi.

286
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:39,135
I have a good memory.

287
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:01,035
So a car broke through the guardrail above that cliff

288
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:03,435
and fell into the ocean?

289
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,535
Yes.

290
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:08,535
And this man was the driver,

291
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:13,335
and you called the police after pulling him from the car.

292
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,935
I'm the one who called,

293
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,935
but he's the one who pulled him from the car.

294
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:24,235
Who are you?

295
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:29,035
Just a student studying abroad in the United States.

296
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:33,335
I returned to Japan and came here with my family today.

297
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,935
Anyway, is it true

298
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,835
that there was another person in the car?

299
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:43,235
That's what he said.

300
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,235
What proof do you have?

301
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,435
I simply thought there was another person

302
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:52,735
since the passenger window was open all the way.

303
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,835
The driver's seat was on the right side.

304
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:57,635
If there's only one person were in the car,

305
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:01,035
it would be strange for only the passenger window to be open.

306
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:06,035
The other person most likely opened the window

307
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:08,635
before the car filled with water and escaped,

308
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,235
blending in with the crowd.

309
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:17,835
But couldn't they have opened the door instead?

310
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:20,335
Not with that water pressure.

311
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:25,035
There's still air inside a car immediately after it sinks.

312
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,835
They couldn't open the door because of the water pressure.

313
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,735
That's why they chose

314
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:35,735
to open the window and escape through there.

315
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:39,735
So they abandoned their friend

316
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:41,935
and fled alone.

317
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:42,935
No.

318
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,635
This man wasn't wearing his seat belt at the time of the accident.

319
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,035
What?

320
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:51,035
He struck his head on the windshield

321
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:53,135
when the car crashed into the guardrail.

322
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:55,835
It broke his cervical vertebrae,

323
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:59,035
killing him instantly.

324
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:03,735
It's probably safe to assume the passenger determined he was dead

325
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,835
when they received no response after calling out to him,

326
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:10,235
so they decided to escape on their own.

327
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:14,235
But why would they pretend to be one of the crowd here?

328
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:18,235
If they were a victim of an accident, they wouldn't need to hide.

329
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,335
Probably because...

330
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:25,935
there was a reason they had

331
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:27,335
to conceal themselves.

332
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,835
"Next Episode" -I see.

333
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,735
Hey, Mr. Pierrot!

334
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,135
I brought all the customers

335
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:03,935
who went shopping after the car fell into the ocean.

336
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:08,835
It seems this man who was driving the car that fell into the water

337
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:10,735
had someone with him.

338
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:15,035
Apparently they've blended in with the crowd on the beach.

339
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,335
Case closed.

340
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:24,335
Next Conan, "The Magician of the Waves (Part 2)"

341
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:26,878
Next Conan's Hint:

342
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:29,478
"A detective's assistant"

343
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:30,978
Conan, what's your weakness?

344
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:31,978
I don't have one.

345
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,078
Shinichi.
