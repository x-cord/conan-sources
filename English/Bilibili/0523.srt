1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.540
Just as you told us to we closed off the toll gate

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.840
but, are you sure that there was a dead person

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.740
inside the moving car?

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.640
Yeah. And on top of it, the guy seems to have been strangled to death.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.140
Then, isn't the person that was in the car with him the culprit?

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.840
No, but the strange thing is

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.440
only the driver was in the car.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.040
That can't be...

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.440
How can you strangle somebody who is driving a moving car?

10
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.740
I wonder...

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.440
But, Heiji was saying that.

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.040
The corpse's body was still warm,

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.540
so the culprit is somewhere nearby.

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840
Shinichi also said that so long as the toll gate that is a kilometer away

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240
from the murder site is closed off,

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.840
we can unmistakably arrest the culprit.

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840
Heiji and Shinichi said so?

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.540
And? Where are those two?

19
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.240
They said they were going to narrow down the suspects

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.640
and disappeared into the line of cars.

21
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.440
How?

22
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.640
When there are close to 100 cars?

23
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.840
Let's see what they can do.

24
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.540
The much rumored about high school detectives...

25
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.540
Three cars.

26
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.740
There are only three suspicious cars here.

27
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740
A crisis is gracefully revived.

28
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.840
The table is turned and the mystery solved.

29
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.640
Deduction made by two. The case and love.

30
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.140
What is the real question Ran wants to ask Shinichi?

31
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

34
00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:11.237
"The Real Question"

35
00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:12.637
Three cars.

36
00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:16.237
There are only three suspicious cars here.

37
00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.837
All the other cars are in the way,

38
00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:20.137
so you can let them go on their way.

39
00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.037
Three cars?

40
00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:25.737
The condition of the corpse tells us so.

41
00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:28.537
It's an obvious fact that the victim's been strangled

42
00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:30.037
while the car was on the move.

43
00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:34.237
If so, the culprit's car must've approached the victim's car

44
00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.537
and done something.

45
00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:38.637
That's most natural, isn't it?

46
00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:41.637
No matter what kind of method the culprit used,

47
00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:43.637
what's for sure is that the culprit had to prepare beforehand,

48
00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:48.537
and get on this freeway at roughly the same time as the victim.

49
00:03:48.537 --> 00:03:49.937
I see.

50
00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:51.637
So there were only three cars

51
00:03:51.637 --> 00:03:54.737
that entered the interchange at the same time the victim's car did.

52
00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:57.037
But, is that true?

53
00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.037
I'm sure you were shown the ticket

54
00:03:59.037 --> 00:04:01.137
that was given to them at interchange,

55
00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:02.937
but nowadays there is a system called ETC (electric toll collection)

56
00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:04.637
where you don't have to get tickets

57
00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:07.637
to go through the gate, isn't there.

58
00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:12.137
The victim got on the freeway using the same interchange we did,

59
00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:15.437
the ETC device was out of order since before noon

60
00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:19.337
and only the general gate where tickets were issued was open.

61
00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:20.537
I see!

62
00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:22.837
So you narrowed the drivers down to only those

63
00:04:22.837 --> 00:04:24.837
who had the ticket of this interchange.

64
00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:28.837
Moreover, after looking at the ticket the victim had...

65
00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:33.037
We found that he got on the freeway an hour before us.

66
00:04:33.037 --> 00:04:34.337
One hour before you?

67
00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:38.037
They were probably eating at the parking area along the way or something.

68
00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:39.137
In other words,

69
00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:41.437
although they got on the freeway

70
00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:43.837
at the same time from the same interchange,

71
00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:45.937
for some reason, there were only three cars

72
00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.037
driving around the car of the victim,

73
00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.737
despite him taking an hour break

74
00:04:50.737 --> 00:04:53.637
in the parking area.

75
00:04:53.637 --> 00:04:55.737
-Right. -By the way,

76
00:04:55.737 --> 00:04:58.137
the car with the corpse of the victim in it

77
00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:01.537
is parked a kilometer ahead with its hazard lights on,

78
00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:04.337
so please call forensics and have them make a detailed investigation.

79
00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.537
Okay, shall we go over to the cars of the suspects

80
00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:08.237
and listen to what they have to say?

81
00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:10.337
Yes.

82
00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:15.437
Officer Sato, about the dinner, let's make it some other time.

83
00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:17.637
Officer Sato?

84
00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:20.637
What... What's with...

85
00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:23.037
What's with those boys?

86
00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:28.737
Why's Shinichi wearing your cap, Heiji?

87
00:05:28.737 --> 00:05:31.237
He asked me to lend it to him.

88
00:05:31.237 --> 00:05:34.037
Did you like caps, Shinichi?

89
00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:35.737
Yes.

90
00:05:35.737 --> 00:05:38.137
It somehow doesn't look right.

91
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.837
Stop bugging me and shut up.

92
00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:42.937
I'm just changing my image, you get?

93
00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:49.237
Well, the guys that are after Shinichi thinks he's dead

94
00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:53.237
so I put in on him thinking it best to keep his face hidden,

95
00:05:53.237 --> 00:05:57.137
but I wonder how long he can stay the way he is?

96
00:05:57.137 --> 00:06:00.837
Shinichi said the drug may keep for half a day.

97
00:06:00.837 --> 00:06:02.637
But, I wonder if it's true.

98
00:06:12.737 --> 00:06:14.237
These are the three drivers

99
00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:17.837
of the three suspicious cars we mentioned a while ago.

100
00:06:17.837 --> 00:06:19.137
"Riko Mizuhashi (25)" -I was just

101
00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:22.137
taking a drive on the freeway with Gunpei.

102
00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:24.837
After all, the victim Gunpei was my boyfriend.

103
00:06:24.837 --> 00:06:29.937
Taking a drive? You were driving your own car, weren't you?

104
00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:34.037
Yes, because Gunpei and I love to drive around by car.

105
00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:35.337
What's wrong with that?

106
00:06:35.337 --> 00:06:36.837
Did you both plan beforehand

107
00:06:36.837 --> 00:06:39.137
that you would stop by at the parking area?

108
00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:40.637
No.

109
00:06:40.637 --> 00:06:42.637
Gunpei said that he suddenly got sleepy,

110
00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:45.037
so he wanted to sleep about an hour.

111
00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.037
So, I had no choice and went to kill time at the restaurant

112
00:06:47.037 --> 00:06:49.737
of the parking area and woke him up when the time came.

113
00:06:49.737 --> 00:06:51.437
I see.

114
00:06:51.437 --> 00:06:55.337
Then, what were the other two of you doing in the parking area?

115
00:06:55.337 --> 00:06:57.637
"Atsuo Chuda (34)" -I got a bit hungry

116
00:06:57.637 --> 00:07:00.937
so came inside the parking area to eat.

117
00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:02.837
Then, what about you?

118
00:07:02.837 --> 00:07:04.237
My stomach...

119
00:07:04.237 --> 00:07:08.537
"Futoshi Shimodori(48)" -suddenly got queasy while I was driving, so...

120
00:07:08.537 --> 00:07:11.137
so I went to use the restroom in the parking area.

121
00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:13.837
I heard that someone seems to have died in his car,

122
00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:16.437
but we've got nothing to do with him!

123
00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:20.137
I... I think it's somebody I don't know, too.

124
00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:24.237
Liar! You both know Gunpei very well!

125
00:07:24.237 --> 00:07:25.237
What?

126
00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:27.737
You're the leader of the Black Stars,

127
00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:30.437
Gunpei's rival team!

128
00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:35.837
You're the father of Akira, one of Gunpei's team members

129
00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:38.837
who died the other day of an accident!

130
00:07:38.837 --> 00:07:40.137
Hold on.

131
00:07:40.137 --> 00:07:43.237
Is the victim Gunpei Furuki?

132
00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.437
"Gunpei Furuki (32)" -The former leader of that street racing gang

133
00:07:46.437 --> 00:07:48.337
that hangs out in western Tokyo, the Red Comets?

134
00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:50.337
Yes.

135
00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:53.737
Although he stopped dyeing his hair and shaved off his beard.

136
00:07:53.737 --> 00:07:55.937
I heard that the leader of Red Comets quit

137
00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:58.137
after feeling responsible

138
00:07:58.137 --> 00:08:00.837
for the accident that occurred.

139
00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:03.437
So, he was just taking his car out

140
00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:06.337
for a last spin.

141
00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:09.937
And yet. He came up right behind Gunpei's car

142
00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:12.237
and insistently flashed his passing lights!

143
00:08:12.237 --> 00:08:14.037
I'm sure he was venting his anger out at Gunpei

144
00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:16.437
because he never once won races on mountain roads!

145
00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:17.737
Shut up!

146
00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:19.437
That guy had the nerve to say

147
00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:21.137
he was resigning after his winning streak.

148
00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:22.937
I just kind of gave him a push from behind.

149
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:26.737
But, he refused to take the hint, so I passed him.

150
00:08:27.537 --> 00:08:29.237
Well, I guess after all he was taking a drive

151
00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:32.837
with the woman he spilt with, so...

152
00:08:32.837 --> 00:08:35.337
He tooted his horn so many times.

153
00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:38.337
That's because after he overtook Gunpei,

154
00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:41.637
I was right behind Gunpei's car.

155
00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:44.937
But, he suddenly slowed down and I almost collided into his car,

156
00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:47.237
so I tooted my horn.

157
00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.437
Then he came out to the passing lane

158
00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:52.837
as if to go after the car that overtook him,

159
00:08:52.837 --> 00:08:54.837
so I sounded my horn at him again.

160
00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:58.437
On the day of my sons funeral,

161
00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:02.737
Gunpei swore that he was going to quit street racing,

162
00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:04.637
so I got upset.

163
00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:06.437
It was right after that...

164
00:09:06.437 --> 00:09:10.337
that the car Gunpei was driving started moving strangely.

165
00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:11.937
He didn't try to overtake any car

166
00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:13.437
despite having gone into the passing lane,

167
00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:15.237
and started driving slowly scraping the side of his car

168
00:09:15.237 --> 00:09:17.637
against the guardrail.

169
00:09:17.637 --> 00:09:19.837
Thanks to my swift and accurate judgment

170
00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:21.937
of seeing that something was wrong,

171
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.937
you went in front of his car

172
00:09:23.937 --> 00:09:26.737
and slowed down in order to stop his car,

173
00:09:26.737 --> 00:09:30.137
and found the strangled victim.

174
00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:33.137
You did that because Shinichi told you to.

175
00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:37.937
So, you guys were the one who first found the body?

176
00:09:37.937 --> 00:09:38.937
No,

177
00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:41.037
she did.

178
00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:44.437
I thought that something was strange about Gunpeis car, too.

179
00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:46.237
That's why I parked my car behind him

180
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:48.037
and ran up to him right away.

181
00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:49.437
Gunpei!

182
00:09:49.437 --> 00:09:52.837
But, if what the three are saying are true,

183
00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:56.337
they wouldn't have had a chance to strangle him.

184
00:09:56.337 --> 00:09:57.537
Then,

185
00:09:57.537 --> 00:09:59.837
will you take us to where the car of the victim is now,

186
00:09:59.837 --> 00:10:01.137
Mr. Detectives?

187
00:10:01.137 --> 00:10:02.737
Sure, of course.

188
00:10:02.737 --> 00:10:04.837
I'll go too, then.

189
00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:08.537
Officer Takagi, please end the road block of the toll gate,

190
00:10:08.537 --> 00:10:10.637
and wait here together with these three people.

191
00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:11.937
Oh, yes, ma'am.

192
00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:15.537
Kazuha, you wait here with that lady too.

193
00:10:15.537 --> 00:10:18.537
We'll be right back.

194
00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:23.037
He's leaving.

195
00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:25.337
Shinichi's going to leave me again.

196
00:10:33.537 --> 00:10:35.137
See you.

197
00:11:00.837 --> 00:11:03.237
You're not the only one.

198
00:11:03.237 --> 00:11:07.337
I've got stuff that I want to ask you and say, too.

199
00:11:08.737 --> 00:11:11.137
So wait, okay?

200
00:11:13.837 --> 00:11:16.237
Shinichi.

201
00:11:18.337 --> 00:11:20.337
According to my deduction,

202
00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:22.337
the stuff you want to ask me

203
00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:26.137
is probably the same thing I want to ask you about too.

204
00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:41.837
Hey, what with all that lovey-dovey stuff!

205
00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:44.237
Oh, come off it, it's nothing like that.

206
00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:45.737
Let's hurry and go.

207
00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:47.737
I know.

208
00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:49.237
Listen, Ran.

209
00:11:49.237 --> 00:11:51.037
When Shinichi comes back,

210
00:11:51.037 --> 00:11:53.737
don't you ever let him go!

211
00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:59.137
You've got to be joking.

212
00:11:59.137 --> 00:12:01.937
Was the car really moving under this condition?

213
00:12:01.937 --> 00:12:04.037
Yes. Strange, isn't it?

214
00:12:04.037 --> 00:12:05.437
What bothers me

215
00:12:05.437 --> 00:12:06.937
are these thin lines here

216
00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:09.737
on the rim of the edge of the window.

217
00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:13.037
It seems that something was pulled from outside.

218
00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:16.837
Hey, hey, don't tell me that a string or something

219
00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:19.537
was wrapped around his neck, and pulled on,

220
00:12:19.537 --> 00:12:22.937
while the car was moving.

221
00:12:22.937 --> 00:12:24.837
Something like that is impossible, not possible!

222
00:12:24.837 --> 00:12:28.637
Yes, if you pull on it with the strong force of a car,

223
00:12:28.637 --> 00:12:32.737
before he suffocates to death, his neck bone would break.

224
00:12:32.737 --> 00:12:35.237
That's what's bothering us.

225
00:12:35.237 --> 00:12:39.537
But, I wonder why the window was fully open?

226
00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:41.337
Because he was a heavy smoker, maybe?

227
00:12:41.337 --> 00:12:45.237
See. The ashtray is full of cigarette butts.

228
00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:48.937
Maybe he had the window open to let the smoke out?

229
00:12:48.937 --> 00:12:52.337
But since he was driving on the freeway,

230
00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:53.937
I would think he'd only open the window just a little,

231
00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:55.637
so the top part would be open.

232
00:12:55.637 --> 00:12:57.737
How much is just a little bit?

233
00:12:57.737 --> 00:13:01.637
So, like I was saying... Just enough to let the smoke out.

234
00:13:08.937 --> 00:13:10.137
Holes?

235
00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:14.337
There are two holes on the very bottom of the window.

236
00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:17.437
I see.

237
00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:19.837
So, that's the story.

238
00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:21.837
I know what trick was used

239
00:13:21.837 --> 00:13:24.437
and figured out the culprit too, Shinichi.

240
00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:28.237
Hey, how come you're sweating like that?

241
00:13:30.937 --> 00:13:34.837
What? The effect of the drug may already have worn off?

242
00:13:34.837 --> 00:13:35.837
Yes.

243
00:13:35.837 --> 00:13:37.937
I can't come up with the exact figures,

244
00:13:37.937 --> 00:13:41.737
but judging from the last time the drug was given to Shinichi

245
00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:45.437
it's about time he get another attack.

246
00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:49.137
Hey, Shinichi.

247
00:13:49.137 --> 00:13:52.537
Don't tell me that...

248
00:13:52.537 --> 00:13:56.837
No kidding. An attack already.

249
00:13:56.837 --> 00:14:00.037
I may be building up resistance to the drug...

250
00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:03.937
-but it's only been 24 hours yet. -Shinichi! What's wrong?

251
00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:07.537
Well, guess Shinichi'll somehow find a way to cope with it.

252
00:14:07.537 --> 00:14:08.837
He did say that he could hold up about 30 minutes

253
00:14:08.837 --> 00:14:11.737
after the attack hits him.

254
00:14:11.737 --> 00:14:14.337
Oh, come on, you should know better.

255
00:14:14.337 --> 00:14:16.937
The effect of the drug shortening means that

256
00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:18.737
the time it takes for his body to become that of child

257
00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:21.437
after the onset of the attack is also shortened.

258
00:14:21.437 --> 00:14:23.537
I'm not sure if he can hold out for 10 minutes or not.

259
00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:25.637
Ten minutes?

260
00:14:25.637 --> 00:14:28.237
If he doesn't know about this,

261
00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:30.037
that's it for him.

262
00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:44.129
Hey, Shinichi, are you okay?

263
00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:46.129
It seems you had a cold but...

264
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:49.429
I think you should have a doctor check you after all.

265
00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:52.329
I'll do that after I solve the mystery.

266
00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:55.029
Please bring the three people here.

267
00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:57.629
You've figured out who the culprit is?

268
00:14:57.629 --> 00:15:01.529
Yes, ma'am. I'll go over there with the three right away.

269
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:05.729
I'll take you by car, so please come this way.

270
00:15:05.729 --> 00:15:08.429
Come on, let's go too, Ran!

271
00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:11.329
I'll wait here.

272
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:14.229
Shinichi said that he'll be right back too.

273
00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:15.429
I mean,

274
00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:17.729
he always disappeared on you saying so, right?

275
00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:21.129
But, I don't want to get in the way of his deduction, either...

276
00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:25.929
-Run! -Hey, wait!

277
00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:33.629
What? He was strangled to death?

278
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:36.229
You mean while he was driving on the road?

279
00:15:36.229 --> 00:15:37.229
Yes.

280
00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:40.529
Then, wouldn't it have been impossible for us to do it?

281
00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:43.329
On the contrary,

282
00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:47.329
if Gunpei is lured into taking a certain action, it's possible...

283
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:49.029
Hey, Shinichi!

284
00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:50.429
Don't talk anymore.

285
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:54.129
A certain action... Just what is that supposed to be...

286
00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:55.429
Ridiculous...

287
00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:58.629
Just what can you do when you're speeding through the freeway...

288
00:15:58.629 --> 00:16:01.429
Yes, you can!

289
00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:03.129
If you use these two little holes made

290
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.029
at the very bottom of the side mirror

291
00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:07.929
of the driver's seat.

292
00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:10.029
Holes?

293
00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:11.729
The trick's simple.

294
00:16:11.729 --> 00:16:14.329
First you put both ends of a thin and strong fishing line

295
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:18.029
through these two holes and pull them inside the car.

296
00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:20.429
Then you pass both ends

297
00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:22.529
through the space in back of the headrest.

298
00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:26.629
Then you slip one end of the line in the back of Gunpei's necktie,

299
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:29.929
which after you tie this end of the line onto the other end of the line.

300
00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:32.929
Then, all that's left to do, is to make him open the window.

301
00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:37.729
The line will be pulled and automatically choke his neck.

302
00:16:37.729 --> 00:16:39.929
There's an automatic button on the driver's seat side

303
00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:43.329
that will keep the window lowering until it's fully opened.

304
00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:48.129
But boy, just how did the culprit make him open the window then?

305
00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:52.729
All I did was tailgate from behind and overtake him.

306
00:16:52.729 --> 00:16:57.229
All I did was toot my horn after that.

307
00:16:57.229 --> 00:17:01.229
The first time was because Gunpei's car suddenly reduced speed

308
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:05.429
and the second time was because he tried to go after Mr. Chuda's car.

309
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:07.429
I've got nothing to do with

310
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:09.129
because I did nothing.

311
00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:12.729
No. You slowed down, didn't you?

312
00:17:13.729 --> 00:17:17.729
When you who were driving in front of Gunpei reduced speed,

313
00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:20.129
he slowed down too.

314
00:17:20.129 --> 00:17:22.629
Then, thinking that something was wrong,

315
00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:24.429
he went out into the passing lane

316
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:26.829
and came alongside your car.

317
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.329
Wait a sec!

318
00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.429
Are you saying I shouted for Gunpei

319
00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:32.729
to open his window at that time or what?

320
00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:34.529
Did you hear me shouting like that or what?

321
00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:35.629
No.

322
00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:37.329
You didn't have to make a sound.

323
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:41.029
All you had to do was make a panicky face

324
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:42.929
and pretend to be shouting

325
00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.429
after aligning yourself with Gunpei's car.

326
00:17:46.929 --> 00:17:48.229
I see.

327
00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:51.029
He opened the window trying to figure out what you were shouting about.

328
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.829
The only person who could've carried out this trick

329
00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:57.229
is you, Gunpei's girlfriend, lady.

330
00:17:57.229 --> 00:18:01.829
You set the trick up when Gunpei was taking a nap in the parking area.

331
00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:03.229
You probably had the key of his car

332
00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:05.529
because you were going to wake him up.

333
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:08.329
I see.

334
00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:10.729
You probably put Gunpei to sleep

335
00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:13.129
with a sleeping pill or something beforehand.

336
00:18:13.129 --> 00:18:14.729
You probably opened the holes in the window

337
00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:17.229
before going on the drive too.

338
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.529
If Gunpei had the top part of his window open all the time

339
00:18:19.529 --> 00:18:22.829
to let the smoke from his cigarette outside,

340
00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:25.429
the holes would be hidden and out of view.

341
00:18:25.429 --> 00:18:27.029
What proof do you have?

342
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:29.429
Do you have any proof that proves I did it?

343
00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:32.229
After the corpse was found, the only time you were able to be alone

344
00:18:32.229 --> 00:18:36.129
was in your car when you were heading for the toll gate.

345
00:18:36.129 --> 00:18:40.329
So, if we check your car, we should be able to find

346
00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:43.729
the fishing line that you cut and removed

347
00:18:43.729 --> 00:18:46.829
when you ran over to his car before we did.

348
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:51.829
It could be that the chloroform you used

349
00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:55.429
to make Gunpei sleep sounder

350
00:18:55.429 --> 00:18:58.229
and the bottle of ammonia that you used to wake him up

351
00:18:58.229 --> 00:19:01.729
may still be in your car and be found.

352
00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:08.929
The fishing line,

353
00:19:08.929 --> 00:19:12.629
the chloroform, as well as the ammonia

354
00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:15.029
are all in my car.

355
00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:23.629
Well, I expected to at least be questioned by the police

356
00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:28.629
but I had no idea that these two cute detectives

357
00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:31.329
would suddenly see through my trick.

358
00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:34.229
It's just as these detectives say,

359
00:19:34.229 --> 00:19:37.429
I sent Gunpei to his grave

360
00:19:37.429 --> 00:19:40.029
while he was at the wheels.

361
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:43.429
Yes, in the same way...

362
00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:46.129
Akira died at the wheels.

363
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:48.329
What? Akira?

364
00:19:48.329 --> 00:19:50.629
You mean my son, Akira?

365
00:19:50.629 --> 00:19:52.029
Yeah.

366
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:55.629
I switched from Gunpei to Akira,

367
00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:58.329
right after Gunpei lost the battle against Akira

368
00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:00.029
when driving through the mountain path.

369
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:03.729
Because I like the fastest driver.

370
00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:05.229
I see.

371
00:20:05.229 --> 00:20:08.829
That's why Gunpei set up that race battle

372
00:20:08.829 --> 00:20:10.929
on that rainy day?

373
00:20:10.929 --> 00:20:12.429
It wasn't raining!

374
00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:13.829
It was a storm!

375
00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:17.329
That was no day that a battle could be held!

376
00:20:17.329 --> 00:20:20.529
But Gunpei went and provoked Akira.

377
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.229
Just as expected, Akira's car

378
00:20:24.229 --> 00:20:27.429
slipped on the wet rainy road and fell to the bottom of cliff.

379
00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:29.829
But, weren't they both responsible for what happened then?

380
00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.429
The one who was provoked most likely

381
00:20:32.429 --> 00:20:35.129
knew of the risk he was taking too, right?

382
00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:36.529
And the one that provoked the victim

383
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:40.329
felt sorry for what he did and was planning to go straight, right?

384
00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:42.129
That guy go straight?

385
00:20:42.129 --> 00:20:43.729
You've got to be kidding!

386
00:20:43.729 --> 00:20:45.929
He's just feigning to go straight!

387
00:20:45.929 --> 00:20:47.929
I agree too.

388
00:20:47.929 --> 00:20:50.029
Once you become a street racer,

389
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:51.729
you can't quit until you die.

390
00:20:51.729 --> 00:20:54.429
That's why I stopped him!

391
00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:57.629
The cold-blooded red devil of the mountain road!

392
00:20:57.629 --> 00:21:03.329
No. I think he was full of regret.

393
00:21:03.329 --> 00:21:06.629
How the hell do you know?

394
00:21:06.629 --> 00:21:09.329
On top of the meter panel of the driver's seat side

395
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:12.329
were a lighter and cigarette, right?

396
00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:15.629
From the fact that the cigarette filter in the ashtray being damp,

397
00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:20.729
it's definite that he was smoking until the time he was strangled.

398
00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:24.529
He would've noticed as soon as he leaned over to take a cigarette,

399
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:27.529
that something was attached behind his neck.

400
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:31.529
Then, why didn't he... why didn't he cut the line?

401
00:21:31.529 --> 00:21:34.529
Probably because he had made up his mind

402
00:21:34.529 --> 00:21:39.829
to atone for what he had done by taking his own life.

403
00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:42.729
No way.

404
00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:46.529
Don't tell me that he did what he did, knowing what would happen?

405
00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:50.729
Even so, I don't feel the least bit sorry for him

406
00:21:50.729 --> 00:21:53.829
or for you who killed him.

407
00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:56.129
The choice he made of turning you into a criminal

408
00:21:56.129 --> 00:21:59.229
is more than unforgivable.

409
00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:03.529
No matter what the reason may have been,

410
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:06.229
it's a choice he should've never...

411
00:22:06.229 --> 00:22:08.729
sought to be the answer...

412
00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:10.429
Shinichi!

413
00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:12.429
Officer Takagi, call an ambulance!

414
00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:13.929
Yes, ma'am!

415
00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:17.929
-No. -Not the hospital!

416
00:22:17.929 --> 00:22:19.929
Let's go to the hospital.

417
00:22:19.929 --> 00:22:21.429
Ran?

418
00:22:21.429 --> 00:22:25.429
Let's go to the hospital and after you're well,

419
00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:27.529
you're going to have to tell me

420
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:29.929
the answer to the deduction you made, Shinichi!

421
00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:31.429
Ran.

422
00:23:57.429 --> 00:24:01.329
"Next Episode" -By the way, what do you want for dinner tonight?

423
00:24:01.329 --> 00:24:02.529
Nothing special.

424
00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:05.329
Anything that's edible is okay with me.

425
00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:07.229
I don't know what happened

426
00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:08.829
but at least when camping, I wish...

427
00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:12.129
An explosion?

428
00:24:12.129 --> 00:24:14.029
If it's the car we saw a while ago...

429
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:15.629
Why did it explode?

430
00:24:16.629 --> 00:24:19.029
This may not be a simple accident,

431
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:22.129
but rather a case of homicide.

432
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:27.429
Next Conan, "Blue Fireworks of Hate (Part 1)"

433
00:24:38.229 --> 00:24:40.229
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:42.329
"Fleece jacket"

435
00:24:42.329 --> 00:24:44.729
In the next episode, it seems like somebody's in a bad mood.

436
00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:46.429
-Who? -Can't you tell just by looking.

437
00:24:46.429 --> 00:24:47.485
See.
