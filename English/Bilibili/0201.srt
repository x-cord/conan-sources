1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,240
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,040
Today's episode features a nostalgic bonnet bus.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,940
It also carries the memory of an incident that happened many years ago.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:59,899
"The 10th Passenger (Part 1)"

9
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,399
It feels so good.

10
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,299
The air's so fresh.

11
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,299
This bus is like the ones in the old days.

12
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:18,399
I like it because it doesn't have a cooler.

13
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:22,399
Good grief. I don't understand why

14
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:24,899
anyone's actually want to ride in this rundown bus.

15
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:27,099
It's because it's old that gives it charm!

16
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,499
I've never ridden in one before,

17
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,199
that's why I'm enjoying it!

18
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,099
What do they call this type of bus again?

19
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,999
It's a bonnet bus!

20
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:39,499
There were a lot around until 30 years ago!

21
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:40,499
See.

22
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,299
The front's narrow, isn't it?

23
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,199
That's what makes it fun when we pass another bus on a curb.

24
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,899
You're absolutely right!

25
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,799
You sure know a lot, kid.

26
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,799
I read about it in a book.

27
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,099
This kid knows a lot of useless information!

28
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,299
"Takuro Yabe (32)" -You're wrong! It's not considered useless information!

29
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,199
Not to those of us that live in Kagekuwa Village.

30
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,299
The bonnet bus is a valuable tourist attraction!

31
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,899
I didn't mean it like that.

32
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,399
"Head of the Youth Association, Takuro Yabe" -My name is Takuro Yabe,

33
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,099
I'm from Kagekuwa Village.

34
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,499
Head of the youth association.

35
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:20,199
On behalf of the bonnet bus and Kagekuwa Village, I welcome you!

36
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,999
Ladies and gentlemen! Kagekuwa Village has nothing to offer

37
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:26,799
except all the nature around you!

38
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,799
Please enjoy yourselves to your heart's content!

39
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
He's very cheerful.

40
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,899
"Toko Natsume (25), Bus Guide"

41
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:42,499
Hey, Natsume. Guide the way.

42
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,199
Yes! I'm sorry.

43
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,299
Look at this huge rock, it must've fallen from up there.

44
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,899
Oh, my!

45
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,599
Is that really okay?

46
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,899
That was scary.

47
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,799
"Memorial Tower"

48
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,199
A memorial tower?

49
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,899
Hey!

50
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,799
The seat's open.

51
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:54,099
"Sokichi Okumura (60), Deputy Mayor" -Go away! That's my seat!

52
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,899
Your seat?

53
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,199
Does this bus have reserved seats?

54
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,499
Mr. Okumura, behave yourself!

55
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:01,799
Today is Sunday!

56
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,499
I know that!

57
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:06,599
We agreed at the village meeting that unless it was a weekday,

58
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,799
we would give up our seats to the tourists!

59
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,999
The village mayor and you and your group decided that for yourselves!

60
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:15,299
What do you mean?

61
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:18,599
Interesting! Force me to follow orders?

62
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,599
Go ahead, see if you can do it!

63
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,899
Get out of my seat...

64
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,799
This has been my seat for 40 years!

65
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,899
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.

66
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,999
Please take another seat.

67
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,799
What's with this bus anyway?

68
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:47,899
It gets pretty crowded.

69
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,499
That's because to the locals,

70
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,099
this isn't just a tourist attraction,

71
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,399
it's how they get around.

72
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,499
What was that?

73
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,299
What's wrong, Mr. Okumura!

74
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,299
What happened?

75
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,199
What's going on?

76
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,499
It looks like someone got sick.

77
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,199
"Mamoru Kajita (35), Bus Driver" -I'll head to the hospital right now!

78
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,299
It's no use!

79
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:29,199
It can't be...

80
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,899
He's dead.

81
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,599
Someone probably poisoned the tea in this bottle!

82
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,799
Stay in your seats!

83
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,399
No one gets off this bus until the police arrive!

84
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,599
Why we have to do that?

85
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,399
Wait a minute! I don't think that's necessary.

86
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,099
I especially mean you, Mr. Yabe! If this is a case of murder,

87
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,099
you'd be our prime suspect since you and the victim had an argument

88
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,999
and your seat is directly behind his!

89
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,199
Murder? Who are you anyway?

90
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,299
My name is Kogoro Mouri, I'm a private detective!

91
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,499
Mouri? You mean the famous private detective!

92
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,899
That means this is a big case!

93
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,499
That's right! It must be!

94
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,499
I wonder who did it?

95
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,399
"Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai (28)" -I'm at your service!

96
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,899
Patrolman Hitoshi Shinkai of the Kagekuwa station, reporting!

97
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:26,599
It will be an honour to work with the infamous private detective,

98
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:29,799
Kogoro Mouri!

99
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:33,299
You seem to be a very promising officer!

100
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:35,799
I'll be glad to be of service!

101
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,199
Thank you very much!

102
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,999
By the way, it seems you claimed this was a murder,

103
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,299
but are you sure?

104
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,399
If it is, then we have a serious situation on our hands.

105
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,799
Well, we've got to investigate it thoroughly first...

106
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,899
It's murder.

107
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,199
You again! Always sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong!

108
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,499
Look at the plastic bottle.

109
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,699
Plastic bottle?

110
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,999
You can see it's leaking.

111
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,299
I think it's from that tiny hole, it looks like a needle hole.

112
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,599
He's right!

113
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,199
Maybe they used a hypodermic needle to put the poison in?

114
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,799
All right! Let's search everyone!

115
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:12,099
Whoever has a hypodermic needle is our murderer!

116
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,499
I wouldn't know about that.

117
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,199
The windows were open

118
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,099
so it could've been tossed out at any time!

119
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:21,899
And besides, the killer could've gotten off at one of the other stops!

120
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,199
I feel a storm coming.

121
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,399
What?

122
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,399
No, it'll be bigger than a storm.

123
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,299
There's going to be a war in the village!

124
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,499
What?

125
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,599
War?

126
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,499
This is... This is terrible.

127
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:36,499
What'll we do?

128
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,499
A lot of blood's going to flow.

129
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:41,199
Blood will flow?

130
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:44,199
-What? -What on earth is happening?

131
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,599
It's scary.

132
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,699
Mr. Mouri, the hypodermic needle has been found!

133
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,699
It was on the side of the road where the bus passed!

134
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,699
There was some poison in it, but very little!

135
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:56,799
What about fingerprints?

136
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,099
Officer Shinkai!

137
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:00,599
Detective Hino.

138
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,199
"Shohei Hino (41), Detective" -You shouldn't be giving out information

139
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,399
without permission!

140
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,899
Which means, you didn't find any fingerprints, did you?

141
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,199
What?

142
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,199
If you did, you'd have taken our fingerprints

143
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:14,099
the minute you arrived, to compare them.

144
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:16,699
As a matter of fact, you're right.

145
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,599
Who are those people?

146
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,399
Sir, this is Mr. Kogoro Mouri, a very famous private detective!

147
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,999
He just happened to be on the bus.

148
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,799
With your permission, I, "Sleeping Kogoro",

149
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,999
will be happy to assist in the investigation...

150
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,499
That's ridiculous!

151
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:31,599
While you're sleeping,

152
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:35,399
I'll bet somebody else is solving the crime for you!

153
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,499
He's almost right.

154
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:40,499
Well, you can do your thing,

155
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,499
as long as you don't get in the way of our investigation.

156
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:46,599
What a rude fellow!

157
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,499
All right, let's do our thing!

158
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,499
I know you can solve the case

159
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,799
without those policemen's help.

160
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,299
You can bet on it!

161
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,999
Just watch, Detective Hino! I'll show you!

162
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,599
Mr. Mouri, I may not be much help but I'd be glad to assist.

163
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,099
You won't get away with this!

164
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,899
Committing a murder right under my nose like that!

165
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,899
I'm going to find the killer on my own!

166
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,999
Excuse me,

167
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:18,299
please wait here until the investigators get done with the questioning.

168
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,499
Of course, this is the only lodging there is in the village.

169
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,399
Officer Shinkai.

170
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,199
What do you mean we're the only lodging? That's quite rude.

171
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,199
Ms. Komai! That's not what I meant.

172
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,699
"Kinu Komai (42), Innkeeper" -I was just kidding.

173
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,499
Welcome to the Komai Inn.

174
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,299
It's a wonderful place. It has a lot of character.

175
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:39,199
Yes, I love wooden buildings! They're human friendly.

176
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,699
Thank you very much.

177
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:43,199
Besides, this place is neutral.

178
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,599
Neutral?

179
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:48,199
You're been babbling strange things

180
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,699
about storms and wars.

181
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,099
Well, you see...

182
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,699
You'll find out soon enough.

183
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,499
But for now, please follow me to your rooms.

184
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,099
You can see Mountain Fuji from this place.

185
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,399
This is great!

186
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,499
You're Conan, aren't you? Is that your room?

187
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,199
You're the bus guide!

188
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,599
You live next door.

189
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:15,799
Yes, because you get the best view of Mountain Fuji from around here.

190
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,699
Mr. Mouri! Big news!

191
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,199
-What happened? -I have big news!

192
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,199
The investigators are questioning Mr. Yabe.

193
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,199
I knew it, so he's the prime suspect after all!

194
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,199
I'm not sure about that yet,

195
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:33,399
I'm talking about where they're questioning him!

196
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,399
What do you mean?

197
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,899
They didn't take him to the district station,

198
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,199
they're doing it at the substation here!

199
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:41,199
And both the pro and con factions have stormed their way in.

200
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,899
Pro and con factions?

201
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,699
Everyone go home! The police will do a thorough investigation!

202
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,899
We don't trust them! Give us Yabe!

203
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,099
He killed the deputy mayor!

204
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,199
Yes, that's right!

205
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,999
That's not true! Yabe didn't do it!

206
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,199
He's innocent!

207
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,799
Mayor, you told Yabe to do it, didn't you? You won't get away with it!

208
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,999
Get him!

209
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,599
Stop that! I'll arrest you for interfering in police business!

210
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,099
What's going on?

211
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,699
Stop that! Everybody calm down!

212
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,299
Everybody, just calm down!

213
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,599
Move it!

214
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,799
-Uncle Mouri! -Dad!

215
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,799
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

216
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,899
Please stop!

217
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,099
I said stop it!

218
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:45,288
Yes, the crowd's breaking up

219
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:47,288
and things are settling now again!

220
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:50,588
Yes! Thank you very much!

221
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:51,588
That should do it.

222
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,388
Mr. Mouri, the police car transporting Mr. Yabe

223
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,488
has arrived safely at the district station!

224
00:12:56,488 --> 00:13:00,288
Never mind that, what's going on in this village?

225
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:04,188
Actually, nothing like this happened here until a year ago

226
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:06,988
but ever since it was decided at the village assembly that

227
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,488
the bonnet bus would be used to promote tourism,

228
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,388
the faction backing the development of tourism

229
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:15,488
headed by the mayor and Mr. Yabe

230
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,688
and the opposing faction led by the victim, Mr. Okumura,

231
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:21,688
the deputy mayor has been at each other's throats.

232
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,088
That bus had always been used by the villagers

233
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,188
as their mode of transportation.

234
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:28,888
It's a small village and everyone knows each other,

235
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:31,188
so naturally, they all started to have their own seats,

236
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:34,188
it was just the way things worked out.

237
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,788
But then it was decided that on weekends,

238
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:39,488
the seats would be for the tourists.

239
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:42,188
And Deputy Mayor Okumura and his opposing faction

240
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,688
didn't like the idea.

241
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:49,088
You're right and things got worse.

242
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,688
But, who would have thought it'd lead to murder?

243
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,988
Yabe is innocent!

244
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:57,388
I'm sorry about how I acted before,

245
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:59,288
I'm the mayor, Takehiko Funaki!

246
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,088
"Takehiko Funaki (48), Mayor" -I hear you're a famous private detective?

247
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:04,688
I'd like you to work for us!

248
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:10,588
I can assure you Takuro Yabe did not kill the deputy mayor!

249
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,688
I don't like to talk ill about the dead

250
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,488
but he had a lot of enemies!

251
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,488
Some in his opposing faction too!

252
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,488
Please find the real killer!

253
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:24,488
But it could turn out to be Mr. Yabe after all.

254
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,588
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it!

255
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:31,288
I just want things in the village back to normal as soon as possible!

256
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,288
Everyone was finally beginning to forget

257
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,788
that tragic incident seven years ago

258
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,788
and now this...

259
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:39,788
What incident seven years ago?

260
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,088
Nothing you should be concerned about!

261
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:45,288
By the way, how does a fee of one million yen sound to you?

262
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,688
One... one million?

263
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:53,288
I just want this case to be solved and things back to normal!

264
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:56,288
Well, I'll be counting on you!

265
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,188
All right! Let's start asking around!

266
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:04,788
Then I'll be your guide!

267
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,688
Excuse me.

268
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:12,688
Did the victim, Mr. Okumura always take the bus at that time?

269
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,088
Go away!

270
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:19,488
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

271
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,988
Excuse me, I'd like to...

272
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,688
Hey! What's going on in this village?

273
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,688
Actually, there're more villagers against the proposal!

274
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,888
And I guess everyone's heard

275
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:40,388
you're working for the mayor who's on the other side,

276
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,088
that's why...

277
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,588
Gosh! How can we find anything out?

278
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:48,888
Ran, you and Conan go back to the inn!

279
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:52,388
I'm going to try a little longer!

280
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,488
Don't wait for me at dinner!

281
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,188
I don't know what time I'll be back!

282
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:59,988
Officer!

283
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:01,588
What is it, Conan?

284
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:04,988
What happened in this village seven years ago?

285
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:07,688
You're curious about what Mayor Funaki said back there?

286
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:09,888
It was an accident, a bus accident!

287
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,988
A bus accident? Did it involve that bonnet bus?

288
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,988
Yes, we had it repaired.

289
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:18,788
What caused the accident?

290
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:21,788
Did anyone get hurt? Was anyone killed?

291
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:25,788
It happened seven years ago, before I got transferred here,

292
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:28,588
so I don't know all the details.

293
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,988
But I heard about two people died.

294
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,088
What does that have to do with anything?

295
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:37,588
Nothing! I was just curious!

296
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:40,488
Hey, Officer Shinkai! Come on!

297
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:42,188
Yes, sir! Right away!

298
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:46,288
The bus accident seven years ago,

299
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,488
Mayor Funaki's suspicious behaviour

300
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:51,388
and that huge fee,

301
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,388
something fishy is going on here.

302
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,188
Everything looks delicious!

303
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,088
I hope you like it.

304
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,788
It's a meal using edible wild plants.

305
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:04,588
Miss! Miss Bus Guide!

306
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,888
Conan, what're you doing?

307
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:10,088
Ms. Toko, are you home?

308
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,188
What is it, Conan?

309
00:17:12,188 --> 00:17:14,688
There's something I want to ask you.

310
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,388
You shouldn't do that from here, it's rude!

311
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,688
I'm sorry.

312
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:21,388
It's all right. What do you want to know?

313
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,388
It's about the bus accident seven years ago.

314
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,688
I'm sorry, Conan.

315
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:32,788
I only came here to work 6 months ago.

316
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,588
I heard about the accident but I don't know much.

317
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,488
I see.

318
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:41,088
But since we pass the spot it happened every day,

319
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:44,388
I'm reminded of it.

320
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,388
It's the spot where the memorial tower is!

321
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,788
Oh, that place...

322
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:50,088
That scary part of the cliff.

323
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:54,188
I heard that two of the passengers were drinking and they started fighting,

324
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:56,688
that caused the bus to lose control and they went over the cliff.

325
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,288
I'm... I'm terribly sorry!

326
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:08,088
My hands slipped. I'll bring another right away.

327
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,388
Are you all right?

328
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,388
Yes, I'm fine.

329
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,388
Ms. Toko, is something wrong?

330
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,688
It's nothing.

331
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:23,988
Well, I've got to go and prepare dinner,

332
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,688
I'll see you later, Conan.

333
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:37,388
Good grief! I don't believe this!

334
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:38,888
It's not only the con faction!

335
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:44,288
Even the ones that agree with the mayor won't cooperate!

336
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:47,988
Dad, keep your voice down, other people will hear you.

337
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:51,388
Who cares? Besides, this is neutral territory!

338
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:54,788
Why won't they cooperate?

339
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,888
According to Officer Shinkai,

340
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:59,288
although they support tourism on the one hand,

341
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,488
the tourists leave their trash behind, they destroy nature

342
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,288
and they stay up late making a racket!

343
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:07,288
They're giving the villagers a pretty bad time!

344
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,388
No wonder they'll act like that.

345
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:13,388
Yes, but that won't help me do my job!

346
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,488
It's not going to be easy if we can't get any information.

347
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:23,088
Darn it all!

348
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,388
Dad? Are you in your case solving sleep mode?

349
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:31,988
Dad...

350
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,088
What?

351
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:41,088
He's just drunk and fell asleep.

352
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:42,988
I knew that!

353
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:45,588
Conan! Tell them to clear the table!

354
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,488
And tell them to lay out our bedding too!

355
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,488
Hurry!

356
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,488
Yes!

357
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,788
It's the innkeeper.

358
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,788
Where is she going at this time with those flowers?

359
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:18,288
Conan.

360
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:20,688
Good grief, where'd he goes now?

361
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,088
Conan's shoes are gone!

362
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,088
Did he go outside?

363
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:40,688
I'm sorry...

364
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,188
It's Ms. Toko.

365
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,488
What on earth is going on?

366
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:11,488
Conan, where are you?

367
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,888
Kagekuwa Shrine.

368
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:18,888
Would he come in here?

369
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:44,688
Hey, you! What are you doing?

370
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,488
What? Conan, is that you?

371
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:50,188
What are you doing out here?

372
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:52,488
It was just playing hide and seek.

373
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:53,988
Don't scare me like that.

374
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:55,788
Did something happen around here?

375
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:59,288
Mr. Yabe was released for lack of evidence

376
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:02,288
so I figured I should let Mr. Mouri know.

377
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:08,788
That was Mayor Funaki's voice!

378
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:09,788
Conan!

379
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,088
What are you doing?

380
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,088
Ran!

381
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:01,388
"Next Episode"

382
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:02,888
Stabbed once in the chest!

383
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,088
Death was almost instantaneous!

384
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,188
You're under arrest!

385
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,288
Give it up!

386
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:11,288
What in the world happened on this bus?

387
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,788
What was that?

388
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,288
A killer is on the bus?

389
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,088
This can't be happening! The brakes don't work!

390
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:23,288
Oh, no!

391
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:24,788
Next Conan,

392
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:28,509
"The 10th Passenger (Part 2)"

393
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,348
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:33,648
"Bank passbook"

395
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:35,348
In the next episode, many questions are answered!

396
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,248
What does "The 10th Passenger" mean?

397
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:38,648
That'll be answered in the next episode too.
