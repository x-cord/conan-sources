1
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.140
The stars of today's episode are these two.

2
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.840
A cute date with many chaperones.

3
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.740
A very serious case also comes along.

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:09.425
Spit it out!

8
00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:16.725
Spit it out and relieve yourself.

9
00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:20.725
You didn't go to a class reunion, did you?

10
00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:22.325
You couldn't think of anything else to say.

11
00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:25.525
That's why you said so, right?

12
00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:27.125
No...

13
00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.725
I... I really went to a class reunion...

14
00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:32.525
Don't play dumb with us!

15
00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:35.225
Do you think you can get away with something like that?

16
00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:38.425
That's enough. Spit out the truth, Takagi!

17
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:42.625
Inspector Shiratori, we got back up info.

18
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:46.025
The thing about him going to a class reunion is a lie.

19
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:48.525
Moreover, we found this in his desk.

20
00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.225
"Ticket"

21
00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:51.625
Not only did you deceive us,

22
00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.325
but you also have something like this on you.

23
00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:54.525
That's...

24
00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.025
It seems that you've taken action

25
00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:01.925
which is against the moral of the police.

26
00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.825
Come on, and spit it out.

27
00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:08.525
Your mother in your home country is crying.

28
00:03:08.525 --> 00:03:10.625
Takagi.

29
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.225
Takagi!

30
00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:20.525
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 1)"

31
00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:27.325
"Tropical Marine Land"

32
00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:38.925
And?

33
00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:41.725
You mean you told them about today's date...

34
00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:43.625
No, I haven't said a word!

35
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:46.225
I really pulled through this time.

36
00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.525
I... I didn't say a word.

37
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.125
Really?

38
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.025
I even went out of my way

39
00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:54.225
to leave a platinum ticket in my desk.

40
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:57.025
So, I'm sure that everyone's been distracted by it by now

41
00:03:57.025 --> 00:03:59.625
and is going to stake us out at Tohto Dome.

42
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:00.825
Seriously.

43
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:03.525
I don't know why they get all heated up like that over a mere date.

44
00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.825
You must be extremely popular, Officer Takagi.

45
00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:11.225
I'm not the one who's popular...

46
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:19.025
What... what's this sharp glance that I'm sensing?

47
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:23.325
This is group D, Fukui and Kawanaka.

48
00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:25.725
We've spotted Ms. Sato and Takagi.

49
00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:28.125
Our target is currently having a friendly chat

50
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:29.625
at Cafe Aqua in area 3.

51
00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:37.125
This is group E, Horita and Saito.

52
00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.725
We've succeeded in taking a picture of them from behind the counter.

53
00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:42.425
This is group B, Oda and Miyazaki.

54
00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.625
We have taken seats behind the two.

55
00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.025
Roger.

56
00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:52.525
Remember to keep on your guard.

57
00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:55.225
Understand, our goal

58
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:58.925
is not to watch over their dating with warmth.

59
00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:02.125
Should they behave in a queer manner or make any moves,

60
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:03.925
be sure to report back to me immediately.

61
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:05.825
Speaking about queer behavior,

62
00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:08.525
Ms. Sato's been acting strange since this morning.

63
00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:10.425
-Strange, you said? -Yes, sir.

64
00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:13.825
She's not her usual dignified self, but rather...

65
00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:15.425
I don't know how to express it.

66
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:23.925
-She... she's cute. -She... she's cute.

67
00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:25.625
That's bad.

68
00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.825
Officer Takagi may resort to immoral actions.

69
00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:30.925
Officer Oda and Miyazaki,

70
00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:35.625
I want you to carry out strategy 104 in manual C immediately.

71
00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:38.225
And you know, Yumi told me...

72
00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:40.825
-Hey, did you see yesterday's paper? -Yeah.

73
00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:42.525
They specified the hideout

74
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:45.125
of a drug dealer, and still let them get away.

75
00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:48.625
The police really are no good like always.

76
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.625
Hey!

77
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.325
Stop talking nonsense.

78
00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:54.025
They didn't flee.

79
00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.125
It was misinformation to begin with!

80
00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.625
Ms. Sato, please calm down.

81
00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.725
Where are you going?

82
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:03.125
To the ladies' room. Does that bug you?

83
00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:06.425
We did it!

84
00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:09.725
We've succeeded. She's back to her usual self.

85
00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:10.725
Roger.

86
00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:13.325
Hey, wait a second.

87
00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:16.725
Takagi is taking something out of his bag.

88
00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:19.425
That's...

89
00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:22.825
a ring.

90
00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:24.125
There's no doubt about it.

91
00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.125
I'm sure he's going to give it to Ms. Sato.

92
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.525
What shall we do?

93
00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:30.925
If we're going to confiscate it, now's the time to do so.

94
00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:34.425
Please calm down. That's within assumption.

95
00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:36.225
I've already got something worked out.

96
00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:41.525
What a relief.

97
00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:45.825
What's that?

98
00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:47.825
Well, it's nothing.

99
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.225
What? What is it?

100
00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:51.125
Is it something you don't want me to see?

101
00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.225
No, I mean...

102
00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:55.825
I'll show this to you a little later.

103
00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:01.525
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

104
00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:04.925
You kids... What?

105
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.525
Dr. Agasa!

106
00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.825
What brings you here?

107
00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:14.525
Well, Inspector Shiratori sent me the tickets to come here.

108
00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:17.125
He said that it's his token of gratitude towards us.

109
00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:21.025
Inspector Shiratori did?

110
00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:25.525
But what a coincidence...

111
00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:28.525
to run into everyone in a place like this.

112
00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:33.625
The mascot of Marine Land, Marilyn brought us here.

113
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.925
So that we could take a picture together.

114
00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:37.625
See...

115
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.025
What? She's gone.

116
00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:41.725
She disappeared.

117
00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.425
Hey, Shiratori. This is Takano.

118
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:53.225
I made the kids join the two of them like you told me to.

119
00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:56.525
Roger. Please continue watching them.

120
00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:02.725
Hi, Inspector Shiratori.

121
00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:09.525
Yes, thanks to you, we've all come to Marine Land.

122
00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:11.925
Oh, the case the other day?

123
00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:17.025
What? You have something you want me to verify?

124
00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:20.725
Yes, I'm passing the area by car,

125
00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:22.625
so I'd like to see you there.

126
00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:24.225
You're coming here now?

127
00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:26.025
No, no. Say no.

128
00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:31.425
No. That's... Well...

129
00:08:31.425 --> 00:08:33.025
I tell you what.

130
00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:36.825
I'll send a fax to your residence now,

131
00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:39.325
so please call me on my cell phone

132
00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.625
after confirming it by 3 o'clock this afternoon.

133
00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:42.625
Goodbye.

134
00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.625
Hey...

135
00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:51.625
We'll have to go home now, or we won't make it in time.

136
00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:53.525
We'll take care of the children,

137
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.825
so you can leave them with us.

138
00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:57.125
Is that so?

139
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.525
I guess I'll leave them with you then.

140
00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:02.125
But Ms. Sato...

141
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.425
Don't worry.

142
00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:04.525
If the worst comes to the worst,

143
00:09:04.525 --> 00:09:06.725
we can always call Mr. Mouri or Ran.

144
00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:08.925
No, that's not what I meant.

145
00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:12.225
Neither Pops nor Ran could come today.

146
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:16.225
Pops is participating in a community baseball game

147
00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:18.525
and Ran is cheering for him.

148
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:21.425
But they could've lost the first time around

149
00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.625
and gone home already.

150
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:25.725
I don't think so.

151
00:09:25.725 --> 00:09:28.625
Because Mr. Mouri was bragging that they're a really strong team

152
00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.625
that made it to the semi-finals last year.

153
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.125
Right?

154
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.025
He was polishing his glove till it got glossy

155
00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:35.925
and he was going all out.

156
00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.225
Then, just as I thought...

157
00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:39.725
Well, everything's fine.

158
00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:42.325
The more the merrier in a place like this.

159
00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:43.925
Okay, then.

160
00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:51.525
All's well, at least for now.

161
00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:54.325
We'll just have to wait and see what happens from here.

162
00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:57.125
I'm going to take a rest,

163
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.025
so if any changes come up, be sure you let me know.

164
00:09:59.025 --> 00:10:00.525
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:04.125
I stayed up all night finishing up work that I had on my hands

166
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.225
that I haven't slept.

167
00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:10.525
And of course, be on guard for the case on the "deal" too.

168
00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:11.925
Yes, sir!

169
00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:16.025
What? 30 men to stake out on a drug deal?

170
00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:18.125
Yes, sir. According to a tip,

171
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.425
the deal is to be held at Tropical Marine Land

172
00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:23.225
by the dealer named Asakichi Yakura.

173
00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:25.525
Oh, that big shot who's on the run

174
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.125
after committing three assault cases.

175
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:30.825
Is that tip reliable or what?

176
00:10:30.825 --> 00:10:33.125
It's not misinformation, is it?

177
00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:35.225
I'm sure it's real.

178
00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:38.525
Inspector Shiratori is currently in charge at the site.

179
00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:40.325
Don't worry.

180
00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:42.625
God is on our side.

181
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:44.825
-So he says. -I see.

182
00:10:44.825 --> 00:10:46.925
If he's that confident, then...

183
00:10:46.925 --> 00:10:48.625
I guess everything will go well.

184
00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:56.225
Miwako...

185
00:11:21.825 --> 00:11:23.425
Hi!

186
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:25.225
Eels over rice!

187
00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:26.525
Yahoo!

188
00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:38.225
Hey, what kind of look is that?

189
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:39.325
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:44.625
But we were on a date and yet...

191
00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:45.725
Don't be silly.

192
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:48.125
The world's not going to end today, is it?

193
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.225
Besides...

194
00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:52.525
we can just consider this a rehearsal.

195
00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:56.325
Of when we have a family of our own.

196
00:11:57.525 --> 00:12:00.625
Ms. Sato...

197
00:12:01.425 --> 00:12:02.725
Well, you know.

198
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.125
This is Sogawa.

199
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.925
They've entered a pretty dangerous mood now!

200
00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:11.425
Inspector Shiratori!

201
00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:14.825
Inspector, please wake up! It's an emergency!

202
00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:20.025
This is not something...

203
00:12:20.025 --> 00:12:23.925
all that great, but...

204
00:12:23.925 --> 00:12:25.525
What is it?

205
00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:27.825
Well...

206
00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:28.925
What?

207
00:12:28.925 --> 00:12:31.725
What is this?

208
00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:33.525
What's in this paper bag?

209
00:12:33.525 --> 00:12:35.925
That's not mine.

210
00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:38.425
Come to think of it,

211
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:41.325
although this bag looks like mine, it seems to be a bit different.

212
00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:45.025
Hey, this is...

213
00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:48.125
a narcotic!

214
00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:49.625
What?

215
00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:02.788
It's approximately 1 kilogram in weight.

216
00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:04.588
-What? -What is it? What is it?

217
00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:05.788
What's up?

218
00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:08.388
Did you have that bag on you at all times?

219
00:13:10.088 --> 00:13:12.388
Come to think of it, I let go of it just once.

220
00:13:12.388 --> 00:13:15.588
Please wait a while more before we depart.

221
00:13:15.588 --> 00:13:18.788
Please give your belongings to the person in charge

222
00:13:18.788 --> 00:13:21.388
because there is a danger that you may drop it.

223
00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:22.888
Here.

224
00:13:22.888 --> 00:13:24.188
That's right.

225
00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:27.588
It was when I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction.

226
00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.588
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

227
00:13:29.588 --> 00:13:31.588
and took my bag.

228
00:13:31.588 --> 00:13:33.588
Let's go check.

229
00:13:33.588 --> 00:13:36.388
Maybe that person had come to get this bag.

230
00:13:37.288 --> 00:13:39.488
This is Shiratori. Is anything wrong?

231
00:13:39.488 --> 00:13:42.088
Well, it seems like something has happened.

232
00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:44.788
Ms. Sato's expression has changed into a police officer's look.

233
00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:46.088
A police officer's look?

234
00:13:50.488 --> 00:13:53.488
Inspector Shiratori sure is taking his time.

235
00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:56.388
I haven't heard a beep from my fax.

236
00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.988
"Central Information"

237
00:13:59.988 --> 00:14:01.688
What? Nobody came?

238
00:14:01.688 --> 00:14:05.788
No. No one came to deliver a bag like that.

239
00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:06.988
That's strange.

240
00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:09.288
It's already been two hours since then.

241
00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:11.888
Could it be that he has already gone home?

242
00:14:11.888 --> 00:14:15.588
Right, there's only one bag after all.

243
00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.788
Maybe he didn't want it anymore.

244
00:14:17.788 --> 00:14:18.888
Don't be silly.

245
00:14:18.888 --> 00:14:20.088
That amount of drug

246
00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:23.388
would add up to several dozen million yen.

247
00:14:23.388 --> 00:14:25.988
If he finds out that he has the wrong bag,

248
00:14:25.988 --> 00:14:28.388
he would go crazy looking around for it.

249
00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:30.588
-Several dozen million? -Several dozen million?

250
00:14:30.588 --> 00:14:32.988
The owner of the bag probably hasn't been told

251
00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:34.888
about what's in the bag,

252
00:14:34.888 --> 00:14:36.988
and is probably just a mule.

253
00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:39.188
Otherwise, it's hard to imagine he would easily leave his bag behind

254
00:14:39.188 --> 00:14:41.288
and enjoy riding an attraction ride.

255
00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:46.188
Besides, he doesn't even seem to know that the bag had been switched.

256
00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:48.288
In other words, the deal has not been carried out.

257
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.688
The deal's probably going to take place

258
00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:52.988
somewhere here in Marine Land soon, and the drug will be handed over.

259
00:14:52.988 --> 00:14:55.988
Then, we've got to find that person quickly.

260
00:14:55.988 --> 00:14:58.888
But how do we look for him

261
00:14:58.888 --> 00:15:01.088
from among so many people?

262
00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:09.588
And if the content inside the bag is heroin,

263
00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:14.288
the dealer may be Asakichi Yakura who is on the run right now.

264
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:18.688
Yes. He's a heroin dealer.

265
00:15:18.688 --> 00:15:22.688
We've also got information that he's in hiding in this area.

266
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.588
What's this thing called "Heroin"?

267
00:15:24.588 --> 00:15:27.188
You know, the American festival in October

268
00:15:27.188 --> 00:15:29.888
when everybody wears ghost and monster costumes!

269
00:15:29.888 --> 00:15:32.388
That's Halloween.

270
00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:35.688
Heroin is a narcotic drug made from morphine.

271
00:15:35.688 --> 00:15:37.188
And once you become addicted,

272
00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:39.388
you're attacked by unceasing bouts of agony

273
00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:41.688
and eventually become mentally deranged.

274
00:15:41.688 --> 00:15:43.788
It's an extremely dangerous drug.

275
00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:47.288
Anyway, the problem is how are we going to

276
00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:49.088
identify this mule.

277
00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:52.088
The only clue we have is this bag.

278
00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:55.588
Besides the paper bag with the drug, the other content include

279
00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:59.288
are a brand new sports towel and a soiled handkerchief.

280
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:01.388
Isn't there anything on the bag

281
00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:04.488
that indicates the characteristic or some kinds of habit of its owner?

282
00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:06.688
Like a scratch, blood stains and such.

283
00:16:06.688 --> 00:16:08.888
No, nothing in particular.

284
00:16:08.888 --> 00:16:11.888
Then, maybe we should just forget about it.

285
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.488
There wasn't anything really important in your bag

286
00:16:13.488 --> 00:16:16.088
that was taken away, was there?

287
00:16:17.088 --> 00:16:19.488
On the contrary, there sure was!

288
00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:21.188
The precious ring...

289
00:16:22.388 --> 00:16:24.788
I was planning to give Ms. Sato.

290
00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:27.188
You've got a clue!

291
00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:29.688
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

292
00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:32.888
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

293
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.988
He's right.

294
00:16:37.988 --> 00:16:39.788
That means that the owner

295
00:16:39.788 --> 00:16:42.188
always carried the bag on his left shoulder.

296
00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:43.688
If the owner carried it on his right shoulder,

297
00:16:43.688 --> 00:16:45.188
the hole of the shoulder belt on the right side

298
00:16:45.188 --> 00:16:46.988
should be spread out more.

299
00:16:46.988 --> 00:16:49.988
But what can you tell from that?

300
00:16:49.988 --> 00:16:52.388
Well, which side would you carry the bag on, Officer Takagi?

301
00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:54.288
I would carry it on the side that I feel comfortable with.

302
00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:56.288
On the right.

303
00:16:56.288 --> 00:16:57.588
I see.

304
00:16:57.588 --> 00:17:00.588
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

305
00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:04.488
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

306
00:17:04.488 --> 00:17:06.188
Which means

307
00:17:06.188 --> 00:17:08.888
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

308
00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:13.288
And if a large sports towel is kept in the bag,

309
00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:14.988
he could be having a job where he sweats a lot

310
00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:18.188
or somebody who does sports.

311
00:17:18.188 --> 00:17:19.388
You're right.

312
00:17:19.388 --> 00:17:21.588
But how do we search

313
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:23.288
when there are so many people here?

314
00:17:23.288 --> 00:17:25.688
If only we could have a picture...

315
00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:32.988
There were a lot of pictures pasted by the exit

316
00:17:32.988 --> 00:17:35.088
of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

317
00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:36.988
Yes, the people who got off the ride were gathering

318
00:17:36.988 --> 00:17:38.988
and looking at the pictures.

319
00:17:38.988 --> 00:17:42.788
Aren't those the service pictures that's part of the attraction?

320
00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:44.788
The ones that are taken automatically

321
00:17:44.788 --> 00:17:46.488
at the peak of excitement

322
00:17:46.488 --> 00:17:48.588
and sold to anyone who wants them.

323
00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:52.288
Come to think of it, something like a camera flash shined

324
00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:53.788
when we were riding it.

325
00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:54.988
Yeah.

326
00:17:54.988 --> 00:17:58.688
The picture may still be there if we go now.

327
00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:01.188
This is the number to my cell phone.

328
00:18:01.188 --> 00:18:02.388
Remember.

329
00:18:02.388 --> 00:18:05.088
If someone comes looking for a bag that looks a lot like this one,

330
00:18:05.088 --> 00:18:06.888
call me right away.

331
00:18:06.888 --> 00:18:07.888
Yes, madam.

332
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:12.488
Try and buy time until we get here, okay?

333
00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:13.788
I understand.

334
00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:28.788
We're the police.

335
00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:30.588
Police officers?

336
00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:34.388
What did the people who just came want?

337
00:18:34.388 --> 00:18:36.788
Well, that man seem to have his bag

338
00:18:36.788 --> 00:18:40.288
mistakenly taken away by someone else.

339
00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:41.688
The bag? Could it be...

340
00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:43.088
The one with the ring inside.

341
00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.388
That's why he looked so desperate.

342
00:18:45.388 --> 00:18:48.988
Excuse me. Did those people do something?

343
00:18:48.988 --> 00:18:50.488
What do you mean?

344
00:18:50.488 --> 00:18:53.288
Well, I heard them mentioning things

345
00:18:53.288 --> 00:18:54.788
like blood stains (same in pronunciation as "wedding" in Japanese)

346
00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:56.188
and heroin (similar in sound to "reception" in Japanese).

347
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.088
Wedding...

348
00:19:01.088 --> 00:19:05.088
reception?

349
00:19:06.388 --> 00:19:07.388
Sir...

350
00:19:10.188 --> 00:19:12.988
Shiratori! This is an emergency!

351
00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:15.988
They're getting married! A wedding reception!

352
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.188
That Takagi!

353
00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:20.588
He just might get married here today!

354
00:19:22.388 --> 00:19:23.888
Well, calm down

355
00:19:23.888 --> 00:19:25.588
and tell me what you have to say from the start.

356
00:19:27.488 --> 00:19:28.988
I see.

357
00:19:28.988 --> 00:19:31.988
So the bag with the ring in question

358
00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:35.288
was taken away by someone else by mistake?

359
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:37.288
Then, all we have to do is get a hold of that bag

360
00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:38.988
before the two get to it

361
00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:41.888
to prevent the worst from happening.

362
00:19:41.888 --> 00:19:44.288
Dispatch all the officers at the site

363
00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:47.488
and find the person who has this bag and get him.

364
00:19:47.488 --> 00:19:50.288
Of course, I will be there too.

365
00:19:50.288 --> 00:19:53.188
"50,000 Miles Under The Sea"

366
00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:56.488
There it is!

367
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.888
This is it, our picture!

368
00:19:58.888 --> 00:20:03.088
The people who rode with us are

369
00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:04.288
five other people.

370
00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:08.488
Four, if we exclude the kid in the second seat from the rear.

371
00:20:08.488 --> 00:20:10.888
But with such a small picture,

372
00:20:10.888 --> 00:20:12.888
it's hard to tell whether someone is left-handed or not,

373
00:20:12.888 --> 00:20:15.688
let alone what kind of work or sports he does.

374
00:20:15.688 --> 00:20:18.588
Oh, but the man next to Genta

375
00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:21.988
was practicing golf swings while waiting.

376
00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:25.488
He seems to be right-handed, though.

377
00:20:25.488 --> 00:20:28.488
But since there are only a few golf clubs for left-handers,

378
00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:32.488
many left-handed people may start with their right hand.

379
00:20:32.488 --> 00:20:33.888
I guess you're right.

380
00:20:33.888 --> 00:20:36.488
But the man who was behind me

381
00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:38.288
is surely right-handed

382
00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:40.988
because I saw him doing this.

383
00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:42.788
So, he plays baseball.

384
00:20:43.988 --> 00:20:47.688
Come to think of it, the man in the very back plays soccer.

385
00:20:47.688 --> 00:20:50.888
Both his legs were suntanned.

386
00:20:50.888 --> 00:20:54.088
Most people who play soccer wear long socks,

387
00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:56.788
showing just a bit of the shin guard.

388
00:20:56.788 --> 00:21:00.988
Then, the woman beside the man must be a swimmer.

389
00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:03.288
She had a white streak about 1 centimeter wide

390
00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:05.288
on the side of her eye that wasn't suntanned.

391
00:21:05.288 --> 00:21:08.488
It's probably because she's always wearing goggles, right?

392
00:21:09.888 --> 00:21:16.088
Golf, baseball, soccer and swimming.

393
00:21:16.088 --> 00:21:18.688
All of them use sports towels, don't they?

394
00:21:19.488 --> 00:21:21.688
But I can tell that the man right beside Genta

395
00:21:21.688 --> 00:21:24.188
is a really timid person.

396
00:21:24.188 --> 00:21:26.988
See. He was clinging onto Genta.

397
00:21:26.988 --> 00:21:29.588
Come to think of it, after he grabbed my shirt,

398
00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:32.088
there is a blue ink smear on it now.

399
00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:35.588
Big sister, you were taking a survey

400
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:38.588
using a blue ballpoint pen while we were waiting, right?

401
00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:39.788
Yes.

402
00:21:39.788 --> 00:21:41.988
Could you show us the survey sheets?

403
00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:45.488
"Genta Kojima"

404
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.888
Here it is. This was taken right after Genta's,

405
00:21:48.888 --> 00:21:50.588
so there's no mistake about it.

406
00:21:50.588 --> 00:21:53.488
And this person is left-handed!

407
00:21:53.488 --> 00:21:55.488
How do you know?

408
00:21:55.488 --> 00:21:57.588
See, look closely.

409
00:21:57.588 --> 00:21:58.688
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

410
00:21:58.688 --> 00:22:00.188
smeared to the right.

411
00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:02.588
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

412
00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:04.388
When he writes something sideways,

413
00:22:04.388 --> 00:22:06.988
he has to write the next character before the ink dries,

414
00:22:06.988 --> 00:22:09.488
so it inevitably gets rubbed and stained to the right.

415
00:22:09.488 --> 00:22:11.388
After that, I think that the ink that was left on his hand

416
00:22:11.388 --> 00:22:15.088
rubbed off on Genta's shirt when he clung onto Genta.

417
00:22:15.088 --> 00:22:16.988
I... I see.

418
00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:21.088
You... you're a police?

419
00:22:22.388 --> 00:22:23.888
Please announce his name on the survey sheet

420
00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:25.688
and have him come here immediately!

421
00:22:25.688 --> 00:22:27.988
He's a major witness for an investigation!

422
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:01.188
"Next Episode" -Roger.

423
00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:03.288
Let's make sure that we get to it before they do, no matter what.

424
00:24:04.388 --> 00:24:07.088
Did you have something very important inside it, after all?

425
00:24:07.088 --> 00:24:08.588
Yes.

426
00:24:08.588 --> 00:24:11.488
It's what I was planning to give you, Ms. Sato.

427
00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:14.488
A... a ri...

428
00:24:14.488 --> 00:24:17.088
What? A finger?

429
00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:20.688
Don't tell me that it's in the bag.

430
00:24:20.688 --> 00:24:22.188
That's...

431
00:24:22.188 --> 00:24:24.088
Ms. Sato!

432
00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:29.676
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 2)"

433
00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:32.615
Next Conan's Hint:

434
00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:34.715
"Sportsman"

435
00:24:34.715 --> 00:24:36.015
What is this episode about?

436
00:24:36.015 --> 00:24:37.415
It was supposed to be about our date...

437
00:24:37.415 --> 00:24:39.415
-Officer Takagi. -I'm sorry.
