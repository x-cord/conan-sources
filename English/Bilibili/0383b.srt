1
00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:04.828
Bottom of the 2nd inning, Konan High School batting,

2
00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:07.228
Nagashima in the batter's box.

3
00:00:07.228 --> 00:00:10.528
Pitcher Inao is on the mound.

4
00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:11.628
Here it comes!

5
00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:21.028
He hit towards third base.

6
00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:23.928
It's a long ball.

7
00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:26.228
Fast! The one who hit the ball is fast.

8
00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.528
The left fielder sure is taking his time.

9
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.028
I think the runner's going to make it to third base, don't you?

10
00:00:31.028 --> 00:00:33.128
Go! Go!

11
00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:35.528
Left! Left! Just what do you think you're doing?

12
00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:45.628
Nagashima rounds second and heads for third.

13
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.028
The left fielder throws it to the infiled, a fast one to third base.

14
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.828
It's a good throw.

15
00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:56.228
Nagashima is almost to third, he dives.

16
00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.128
The third baseman catches...

17
00:00:59.328 --> 00:01:02.028
-Safe! -Safe!

18
00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.628
The fleet-footed Nagashima gets a three base hit.

19
00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:10.428
No out third base.

20
00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.328
I guess them scoring a point can't be helped.

21
00:01:13.328 --> 00:01:15.728
No, you can't tell yet.

22
00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:18.628
That pitcher sure got guts.

23
00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:28.128
It's the first round of the spring preliminaries

24
00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:30.328
We are now in the 18th inning of overtime.

25
00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:32.228
This match between Teitou High School and Ohgane High School

26
00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:35.328
has had its share of ups and downs.

27
00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.528
At the bottom of the 18th with two outs,

28
00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:40.028
Teitou High School is hitting with a runner on first.

29
00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:43.028
In the batter's box is number four, Yamamoto.

30
00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:51.528
Inao faces off against Yamamoto.

31
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.128
Here's the pitch.

32
00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.128
A cell phone?

33
00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:14.928
Was it there from before?

34
00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:19.728
Maybe the man who passed by here a while ago dropped it.

35
00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:20.828
Let me see.

36
00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.428
Hello? Are you the one who dropped this cell phone?

37
00:02:27.428 --> 00:02:28.728
Yes.

38
00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.128
Then come to the right stand.

39
00:02:31.128 --> 00:02:33.728
Having fun?

40
00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:34.828
What?

41
00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:44.728
I'm asking you if this place is such an enjoyable place?

42
00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:46.328
Who are you?

43
00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:51.028
If it's okay with you, let's play an even more enjoyable game.

44
00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:54.128
It's way more fun

45
00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:56.028
-than this baseball game. -Strike!

46
00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:59.628
An exchange of lives that will make your blood stir.

47
00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:04.428
Well, it is an exchange of lives, but the one who's going to die is me.

48
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.928
You idiot! If you want to die, go and die on your own.

49
00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:12.228
Yes, I'll do that.

50
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:15.728
But I can't die alone.

51
00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:19.328
Being alone is much too lonely.

52
00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:20.828
What?

53
00:03:20.828 --> 00:03:23.228
The rule is simple.

54
00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:27.828
Each time the third, sixth, and ninth innings end,

55
00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:31.228
I'll call the cell phone that I've left somewhere on this baseball ground.

56
00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:40.428
Ball!

57
00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:45.628
I will ring my cell phone that will be the clue to where I am.

58
00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:50.428
I will be near the phone that will ring after the game ends.

59
00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:54.328
Strike!

60
00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.628
I will ring only three times.

61
00:03:56.628 --> 00:03:58.428
If you don't answer by then,

62
00:03:58.428 --> 00:04:01.428
it's three out and game set.

63
00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:05.728
Of course if you gather all the cell phones

64
00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:09.328
before they ring and find me before the game ends,

65
00:04:09.328 --> 00:04:11.328
it's your win.

66
00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:14.128
Hey, you got to be kidding. Cut out your stupid talk!

67
00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:15.128
I'm hanging up.

68
00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:18.328
You'll find out whether I'm kidding or not

69
00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:21.928
after the end of the bottom of the second inning.

70
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.428
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

71
00:04:24.428 --> 00:04:30.728
So your first clue is written in the mail of the cell phone.

72
00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:33.528
Yes, tell that to the police detective sitting next to you

73
00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:37.528
that I'm looking forward to seeing him, too.

74
00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:40.228
Okay, then. I'll talk to you later.

75
00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:41.528
Wait up.

76
00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:43.328
At least tell me your name.

77
00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:48.928
Me? I'm...

78
00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:53.928
The Demon of Koshien.

79
00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:56.428
You can call me that.

80
00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:03.828
-The Demon of Koshien? -The Demon of Koshien?

81
00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:06.428
Hey, you!

82
00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:18.628
Strike! Batter out!

83
00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:22.928
-Okay! -Okay!

84
00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:24.828
Is the bottom of the second inning finished?

85
00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:26.728
It's still one out.

86
00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:31.828
What's with you, Heiji? Aren't you watching the game?

87
00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:36.128
The strike out ball just now was a very fast ball.

88
00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:37.928
I found it!

89
00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:39.128
This is it.

90
00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:42.128
96, 7, 13.

91
00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:43.828
What's that?

92
00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:49.828
The telephone number of the whereabouts of the owner of this telephone.

93
00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:53.828
What's that? Why doesn't he come get it himself?

94
00:05:53.828 --> 00:05:55.728
I wonder what it is though?

95
00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:58.728
96, 7, 13.

96
00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:01.328
It doesn't seem like a seat number.

97
00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:02.828
Could it be some kind of code again?

98
00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:05.228
Enough of codes!

99
00:06:05.228 --> 00:06:07.128
Thanks to an odd code,

100
00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:11.428
we ended up not being able to go to Takarazuka.

101
00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:17.328
If it's 8, 1 and 2, it's the Alps stand.

102
00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:19.328
-Alps stand? -Alps stand?

103
00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:22.828
Why?

104
00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:28.528
Because 8 (hachi), 1 (ichi) and 2 (ni) is pronounced as "Heidi".

105
00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:33.528
And Heidi is connected with the Alps, right?

106
00:06:37.328 --> 00:06:39.628
So lame.

107
00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:42.728
Please, Dad.

108
00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:44.628
Oh, well.

109
00:06:44.628 --> 00:06:48.528
Mr. Ohtaki, please help us find him.

110
00:06:48.528 --> 00:06:52.528
But this is the best part.

111
00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:55.128
Don't worry. We'll be done right away

112
00:06:55.128 --> 00:06:57.828
if you come with us, Mr. Ohtaki.

113
00:06:57.828 --> 00:07:00.428
Are you going too, Conan?

114
00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:04.028
Because it sounds like fun.

115
00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:08.228
Well, don't worry. We'll give it to the owner

116
00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.128
and come right back.

117
00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:16.428
What's with him?

118
00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:19.428
He's the one who wanted to come here with us.

119
00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:20.828
Seriously.

120
00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:45.028
What? Suicide?

121
00:07:46.528 --> 00:07:48.128
Really? Heiji?

122
00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:51.128
Yes! He saying that if we don't find it

123
00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:53.828
before the end of the game, he's going to die.

124
00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:56.028
He says he'll kill someone along with himself, too.

125
00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:59.328
But maybe it's just a prank.

126
00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:02.028
I think it's most likely not a prank.

127
00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:05.828
The one who called didn't change his voice,

128
00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:10.828
and the manufacture number seal was pasted on the cell phone, too.

129
00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:13.928
It means that he doesn't mind his identity being revealed later, right?

130
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:17.228
Moreover, he's doing something like this

131
00:08:17.228 --> 00:08:19.928
knowing that you're an inspector, Mr. Ohtaki,

132
00:08:19.928 --> 00:08:22.928
which means that this man must really be desperate.

133
00:08:25.828 --> 00:08:28.428
At any rate, please use your police badge, Mr. Ohtaki.

134
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:30.928
And let us in behind the back net.

135
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:33.628
What? Why behind the back net?

136
00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:37.528
On the phone a while ago, I heard the referee call out strike.

137
00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:40.228
He could still be there.

138
00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:41.228
Right.

139
00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:48.228
No.

140
00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:49.628
Oh, no. Heiji,

141
00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:52.828
he's not going to die until the game ends, right?

142
00:08:52.828 --> 00:08:57.128
The man says he'll show proof after the bottom of the second inning.

143
00:08:57.128 --> 00:08:58.728
What?

144
00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:06.928
We're going in, Mr. Ohtaki.

145
00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:10.928
If the cheers that we heard just now was for the third out...

146
00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:12.928
Maybe he's already done something.

147
00:09:19.628 --> 00:09:21.628
No good. Just as I thought.

148
00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:23.728
The bottom of the second inning is over.

149
00:09:27.928 --> 00:09:29.228
You go down.

150
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:32.628
I'll go up. Mr. Ohtaki, please search the center.

151
00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:34.428
He's a suspicious looking man wearing a cap.

152
00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:35.728
Okay.

153
00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:03.428
Darn it! He's not here after all.

154
00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:12.328
But nothing is happening.

155
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:13.828
Nothing.

156
00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:25.903
The third inning, batter for Ohgane High School

157
00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:29.603
is number nine. Right fielder, Seki.

158
00:10:29.603 --> 00:10:32.503
Sakuraba, with the pitch.

159
00:10:32.503 --> 00:10:33.803
Here it is.

160
00:10:33.803 --> 00:10:35.303
Hit!

161
00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:37.303
Straight down the third baseline, the third baseman picks it up.

162
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.503
And a fast one to first!

163
00:10:40.503 --> 00:10:41.603
And he's...

164
00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:46.803
Out!

165
00:10:57.203 --> 00:11:01.303
A picture-perfect play by Konan High School's third baseman, Nagashima.

166
00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:05.103
Seki makes one out here at the top of the third for Ohgane High School.

167
00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:15.803
Hey, Heiji.

168
00:11:15.803 --> 00:11:17.603
What's going on?

169
00:11:17.603 --> 00:11:19.903
There's nothing happened, right?

170
00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:21.603
Strange.

171
00:11:21.603 --> 00:11:24.603
The guy who called said that he'd show evidence

172
00:11:24.603 --> 00:11:26.703
after the bottom of the second inning ends.

173
00:11:29.903 --> 00:11:32.003
Maybe it's a prank after all?

174
00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:34.803
Who'd do a thing like that at the finals of Koshien?

175
00:11:34.803 --> 00:11:36.203
Hey.

176
00:11:36.203 --> 00:11:37.403
I wonder what that is?

177
00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:42.703
There. On the other side of the freeway.

178
00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.003
What is it?

179
00:11:45.003 --> 00:11:47.603
Smoke is rising.

180
00:11:47.603 --> 00:11:49.703
It looks like fire.

181
00:11:49.703 --> 00:11:53.103
It seems to be around Tekiryokumachi.

182
00:11:53.103 --> 00:11:55.503
Mr. Ohtaki, you once told me

183
00:11:55.503 --> 00:11:57.503
that you have a superior working at the Hyogo Prefectural Police, right?

184
00:11:57.503 --> 00:11:59.503
Yes.

185
00:11:59.503 --> 00:12:01.803
Won't you please call and ask him?

186
00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:03.003
Okay.

187
00:12:23.503 --> 00:12:25.103
What?

188
00:12:25.103 --> 00:12:27.303
A bomb?

189
00:12:27.303 --> 00:12:29.303
Is that true, Mr. Kazuhisa?

190
00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:31.903
As for the details, I can't say for sure

191
00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:34.903
until I see the report of the fire-fighters after they put out the fire,

192
00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:36.603
but it seems to be so.

193
00:12:36.603 --> 00:12:40.603
A company called Takano Transport seems to have caught fire.

194
00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:43.903
According to what the neighbours are saying,

195
00:12:43.903 --> 00:12:48.103
before that place caught fire, a loud boom seems to have been heard.

196
00:12:48.103 --> 00:12:49.803
I see.

197
00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.703
Fortunately, that company was off today.

198
00:12:52.703 --> 00:12:56.303
So there seems to have been no casualties.

199
00:12:56.303 --> 00:12:59.603
They think a bomb went off because the sound

200
00:12:59.603 --> 00:13:02.303
came from a building that was supposedly empty.

201
00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:05.303
And do you know when the building caught fire?

202
00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:06.903
Well...

203
00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:08.503
Hey, Numata.

204
00:13:08.503 --> 00:13:09.703
Yes, sir?

205
00:13:09.703 --> 00:13:12.703
You know that fire that's being put out now?

206
00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:15.903
Do you know what time it started?

207
00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:20.303
I think it was about 2:40 in the afternoon?

208
00:13:20.303 --> 00:13:21.403
Just around when...

209
00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:25.103
Around when the bottom of the second inning ended.

210
00:13:26.103 --> 00:13:27.803
This looks bad, Hattori.

211
00:13:27.803 --> 00:13:31.103
If the evidence that the guy warned us about over the phone

212
00:13:31.103 --> 00:13:33.403
was that explosion that caused the fire,

213
00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:34.603
maybe the way he's going to commit suicide is...

214
00:13:34.603 --> 00:13:36.303
Moron.

215
00:13:36.303 --> 00:13:40.003
If he commits suicide with a bomb in a place like this with so many people,

216
00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:41.903
it would cause a grave disaster!

217
00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:58.203
Hey, Ohtaki.

218
00:13:58.203 --> 00:14:01.903
Come to think of it, aren't you at Koshien today?

219
00:14:01.903 --> 00:14:03.803
How do you know about the fire?

220
00:14:03.803 --> 00:14:05.603
Oh, well...

221
00:14:05.603 --> 00:14:07.503
Heiji, what do you want to do?

222
00:14:07.503 --> 00:14:09.803
Do you want to tell the police about this?

223
00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:10.903
No!

224
00:14:10.903 --> 00:14:12.503
The guy who called is saying

225
00:14:12.503 --> 00:14:15.303
that he's going to commit suicide when the ball game ends.

226
00:14:15.303 --> 00:14:19.203
We don't want to start a useless commotion here and end the game.

227
00:14:19.203 --> 00:14:21.203
Because the minute it ends, we will all be blown up.

228
00:14:21.203 --> 00:14:23.503
I think it would be better to listen to what the man has to say for now

229
00:14:23.503 --> 00:14:25.603
and solve the codes one after the other.

230
00:14:25.603 --> 00:14:28.503
Trace the three cell phones

231
00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:31.903
and arrest the man.

232
00:14:31.903 --> 00:14:34.603
Either way, we'll have to solve the codes

233
00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:36.403
before the bottom of the third inning ends

234
00:14:36.403 --> 00:14:38.603
and find the first cell phone

235
00:14:38.603 --> 00:14:42.103
that is hidden somewhere in the stands of Koshien,

236
00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:44.303
or we're finished.

237
00:14:56.403 --> 00:14:57.903
The top of the third inning,

238
00:14:57.903 --> 00:14:59.503
one out and runners on first and second base.

239
00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:02.103
There is a map of the stands

240
00:15:02.103 --> 00:15:05.203
right behind the back net of gate number eight here.

241
00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:06.603
I guess I'll go outside,

242
00:15:06.603 --> 00:15:09.503
look at the map, and use my head and decipher the code.

243
00:15:09.503 --> 00:15:14.003
The meaning of these numbers 96, 7, 13!

244
00:15:16.803 --> 00:15:20.003
I'll go borrow the radio from Pops then.

245
00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.603
We need to know how the game is progressing, or we'll be in trouble, right?

246
00:15:22.603 --> 00:15:24.503
Do so, will you?

247
00:15:30.703 --> 00:15:34.303
Position number three, Pitcher Inao.

248
00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:37.703
All right! Clean up time.

249
00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:40.103
I guess this game is going to be a long one.

250
00:15:40.103 --> 00:15:41.403
Let's go, Heiji.

251
00:15:41.403 --> 00:15:42.703
Okay.

252
00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:18.123
-Ball! -Ball!

253
00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:22.723
It's clean up, but the pitcher is not quite in control of the ball.

254
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:32.023
If the runner gets to walk, then it'll be one out with the bases loaded.

255
00:16:32.023 --> 00:16:34.723
And then comes the fourth batter.

256
00:16:36.923 --> 00:16:39.023
Heiji and the others sure are late.

257
00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:42.823
Maybe they can't find the owner of the cell phone yet.

258
00:16:42.823 --> 00:16:46.523
If so, why don't give up already and hurry on come back here?

259
00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:50.523
The man who dropped it is to blame, and not us.

260
00:16:50.523 --> 00:16:51.823
True.

261
00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:52.923
Don't worry!

262
00:16:54.523 --> 00:16:57.923
We'll find that man for sure,

263
00:16:57.923 --> 00:16:59.523
so wait a while longer.

264
00:16:59.523 --> 00:17:01.823
Conan.

265
00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:05.823
Pops, will you please lend me your radio?

266
00:17:05.823 --> 00:17:07.223
Huh?

267
00:17:08.223 --> 00:17:09.823
Searching for that man,

268
00:17:09.823 --> 00:17:12.323
we won't be able to tell how the game is progressing.

269
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.823
Okay? You'll lend it to me, right?

270
00:17:16.123 --> 00:17:17.423
Gosh.

271
00:17:17.423 --> 00:17:18.523
Don't break it.

272
00:17:18.523 --> 00:17:20.323
Here you go.

273
00:17:20.323 --> 00:17:22.223
Thank you.

274
00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:25.523
And if you see a suspicious man wearing a white cap,

275
00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:28.023
call Heiji on the cell phone, okay?

276
00:17:28.023 --> 00:17:30.523
Hey, Conan!

277
00:17:33.223 --> 00:17:34.623
They look so much alike.

278
00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:37.523
Conan's face just now...

279
00:17:38.523 --> 00:17:43.023
looked so much like him back then.

280
00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:47.323
He hit the ball! This is a big one!

281
00:17:49.323 --> 00:17:51.023
Right back! Right back!

282
00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:52.823
What? It's coming this way!

283
00:17:52.823 --> 00:17:54.323
I think the ball will make it.

284
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:57.123
Thrust forward by the beach wind, the ball flies into the right stand...

285
00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:00.723
He caught the ball!

286
00:18:00.723 --> 00:18:02.423
The runner on second base starts!

287
00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:04.223
The ball goes pass second base.

288
00:18:04.223 --> 00:18:05.923
-Safe! -Safe!

289
00:18:05.923 --> 00:18:07.923
From that fly ball to the right field to touch up

290
00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:10.323
makes for two outs with runners on first and third base.

291
00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:12.123
Although the hit looked to be a homerun,

292
00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:14.423
the ball was blocked by the beach wind

293
00:18:14.423 --> 00:18:16.323
and both wings spreading out wide over this vast Koshien of 96 meters!

294
00:18:21.923 --> 00:18:24.823
Both wings are 96 meters?

295
00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:31.223
96, 7, 13.

296
00:18:31.223 --> 00:18:34.523
Where is it? Where is it?

297
00:18:34.523 --> 00:18:38.523
I'm sure that it's indicating the seats somewhere here.

298
00:18:38.523 --> 00:18:40.723
Heiji, we'd better hurry or we'll run out of time.

299
00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:42.823
Darn it.

300
00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:45.023
Where is it?

301
00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:52.123
Heiji!

302
00:18:52.123 --> 00:18:54.223
I borrowed the radio!

303
00:18:54.223 --> 00:18:55.723
How's the game going?

304
00:18:55.723 --> 00:18:57.823
The top of the third inning just finished,

305
00:18:57.823 --> 00:19:00.023
and the score's still zero-zero.

306
00:19:00.023 --> 00:19:01.523
Three outs left.

307
00:19:01.523 --> 00:19:06.023
Hey. Do you know that is there such a wing in this ball field?

308
00:19:06.023 --> 00:19:07.223
Wing?

309
00:19:08.223 --> 00:19:09.423
Because I heard them say,

310
00:19:09.423 --> 00:19:13.123
Koshien have both wings with 96 meters on the radio.

311
00:19:20.123 --> 00:19:23.423
You really don't know a thing about baseball, do you?

312
00:19:23.423 --> 00:19:25.823
Well, they don't say both wings in other games

313
00:19:25.823 --> 00:19:27.323
so I guess it can't be helped, but...

314
00:19:27.323 --> 00:19:30.223
Kid, both wings with 96 meters

315
00:19:30.223 --> 00:19:34.223
means that the distance from the home base to the pole is 96 meters.

316
00:19:37.723 --> 00:19:41.723
Don't tell me that the first 96 code

317
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:44.423
means the seats by the end of the pole?

318
00:19:44.423 --> 00:19:46.423
But which way, Heiji?

319
00:19:46.423 --> 00:19:49.523
There are poles on both sides, the right and left.

320
00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:54.823
Then maybe the next number seven in parenthesis means something?

321
00:19:54.823 --> 00:19:58.223
-Seven... -Seven...

322
00:20:01.523 --> 00:20:03.223
Hey, this looks bad!

323
00:20:03.223 --> 00:20:05.823
It's three balls three strikes and one out!

324
00:20:05.823 --> 00:20:08.123
Kid, turn your back on me!

325
00:20:08.123 --> 00:20:09.223
Huh?

326
00:20:09.223 --> 00:20:10.923
Like this?

327
00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:12.223
I see!

328
00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:13.423
You see what, Heiji?

329
00:20:13.423 --> 00:20:18.223
The number of the outfit the boy's wearing is 55, not 7.

330
00:20:18.223 --> 00:20:20.223
Right the number on the back of the outfit!

331
00:20:20.223 --> 00:20:23.423
In high school baseball, where is the player wearing number seven?

332
00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:26.023
Number seven is left field.

333
00:20:26.023 --> 00:20:27.923
Which means, Heiji...

334
00:20:27.923 --> 00:20:31.923
In other words, it's the seat at the end of the left pole!

335
00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:35.223
Then, what about the last 13?

336
00:20:35.223 --> 00:20:38.123
Probably the seat on the 13th aisle!

337
00:20:38.123 --> 00:20:41.323
The first cell phone is there!

338
00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:47.423
It's the bottom of the third inning. The two batters of Konan High School

339
00:20:47.423 --> 00:20:49.723
struck out three times in a row and now with two outs.

340
00:20:49.723 --> 00:20:53.223
The next batter is number one left, Iwata.

341
00:20:53.223 --> 00:20:57.823
The pitcher flings his arms high in order to throw his first ball.

342
00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.623
Strike!

343
00:21:01.223 --> 00:21:03.923
Straight in high.

344
00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:07.223
The pitcher throws his second ball in good rhythm.

345
00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:08.523
Strike two.

346
00:21:11.423 --> 00:21:13.423
Outlaw, another straight!

347
00:21:13.423 --> 00:21:17.223
27, 26, 25.

348
00:21:17.223 --> 00:21:18.323
The pitcher flings up his arms.

349
00:21:18.323 --> 00:21:22.223
21, 20, 19.

350
00:21:22.223 --> 00:21:23.723
The third pitch...

351
00:21:23.723 --> 00:21:25.523
15, 14.

352
00:21:25.523 --> 00:21:26.523
He has thrown the ball!

353
00:21:26.523 --> 00:21:27.723
13!

354
00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:28.723
Over here!

355
00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.323
Strike three!

356
00:21:37.523 --> 00:21:39.423
Don't answer it! Give it to me!

357
00:21:42.223 --> 00:21:43.923
Hello? Hello?

358
00:21:45.323 --> 00:21:49.223
Hey, you! What's so funny?

359
00:21:49.223 --> 00:21:50.623
It's really interesting.

360
00:21:50.623 --> 00:21:53.723
You kids sure are interesting.

361
00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:57.523
Hang in there a while longer and entertain me, will you?

362
00:21:57.523 --> 00:22:03.323
I love to see people making futile effort.

363
00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.923
Hold it, you!

364
00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:07.823
Hey! Hello? Hello?

365
00:22:07.823 --> 00:22:09.723
Darn it! He hung up.

366
00:22:09.723 --> 00:22:11.223
Hey, look!

367
00:22:11.223 --> 00:22:14.223
The next code is on the display.

368
00:22:14.223 --> 00:22:18.723
47, 3 and 4.

369
00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:22.323
47, 3 and 4.

370
00:22:27.223 --> 00:22:31.023
Yes, futile effort.

371
00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:36.023
There is no such thing as a victory

372
00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:38.423
that can be won through effort.

373
00:22:40.923 --> 00:22:42.423
It doesn't exist.

374
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.730
It is the top of the fourth inning,

375
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.830
the batter for Ohgane High School

376
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.030
is number five, left fielder, Shigeta.

377
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.330
Shigeta versus Sakuraba.

378
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.130
The first pitch.

379
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.830
He hit the ball!

380
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.830
It's up! The left line.

381
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.630
He caught it! He caught the ball!

382
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.130
Great play!

383
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.130
That third is really fantastic!

384
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.930
Yes. He sure is.

385
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.130
At any rate, let's get with this code.

386
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.430
Before the end of the bottom of the sixth inning,

387
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.430
we've got to locate where this number 47,3, 4 indicates

388
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.430
and find the second cell phone!

389
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.830
Before that man wearing the white cap

390
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.730
uses the bomb to commit suicide.

391
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.630
But these numbers are hard to figure out again.

392
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.230
Not really. I've figured out half of it.

393
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.430
What?

394
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:07.030
Because we figured out that the first code 96, 7, 13,

395
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.330
indicated that the first cell phone was on the 13th aisle

396
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.730
at the edge of the left pole.

397
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:18.030
96 is the distance from the home base to the pole.

398
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.530
The seven in parenthesis is the number on the back of the uniform

399
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.030
and left of high school baseball.

400
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.130
The final 13 means the seat on the 13th aisle!

401
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.230
Which means that the number 3 in the parenthesis of the numbers 47, 3, 4

402
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.530
is the number on back of the uniform

403
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.530
and the last number four means the fourth aisle of a seat somewhere, right?

404
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.830
But we've got to find out where that somewhere is.

405
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.830
Number four is probably the one that indicates that.

406
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.230
There's no doubt that it's a seat by the first base.

407
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.130
In high school baseball, the player with number three is at first base.

408
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.130
But Heiji, the one wearing number three at Konan High School

409
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.230
is the third base.

410
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.730
Out!

411
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.830
He's special so you shouldn't be concerned about him.

412
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.130
But if the guy made the code in accordance

413
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.730
to this final game between Konan and Ohgane,

414
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.730
maybe it would be of some concern.

415
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.530
Okay, tell you what?

416
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:22.230
I'll go check the fourth aisle of the infield stand by first base,

417
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.030
so you go check the third base side.

418
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.030
Okay.

419
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.330
What about me?

420
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.130
After you get us into the infield stand,

421
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:34.130
wait for us at the map of the Koshien outside that we saw a while ago.

422
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.030
That place is right in the centre of the infield stand

423
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.530
of the first and third base,

424
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.930
so whether I find the cell phone or the kid does,

425
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.330
it'll be easy for us to join up.

426
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.030
Okay. While I'm waiting,

427
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.230
I'll call and ask my superior at Hyogo Prefectural Station

428
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:54.930
if the Takano Transport company that was bombed and set on fire

429
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.130
by the guy wearing the white cap had been hated by someone recently.

430
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.930
Do that will you, Mr. Ohtaki?

431
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.830
Strike!

432
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.030
Three strikes.

433
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.430
Eight strike outs in a row!

434
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:15.630
The droning ball shows no signs of weakening at all even at the finals.

435
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.830
Hey, what's with you, kid?

436
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.730
I'm just looking for something.

437
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.830
Okay, they're really going for it!

438
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.730
Will the ninth player strike out in a row?

439
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.130
Idiot! Use more balls and slow down the progress of the game.

440
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.630
What? Is that true?

441
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.730
Last month the truck of Takano Transport...

442
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.430
Huh?

443
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.130
It's a homerun!

444
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.130
In the bottom of the fourth inning,

445
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.230
thanks to the hit of the big slugger of Konan High School,

446
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.530
they've taken a one point lead.

447
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.730
No, no. I can't be watching the game.

448
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.230
-I got to find it quick. -Super batting just as expected.

449
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.430
Moreover,

450
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.830
-he's using a wooden bat and not a metal one. -47, 3 and 4.

451
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.630
-Incredible. -47, 3 and 4. What is it?

452
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.230
Metal?

453
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:31.430
Metal...

454
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.530
Metal.
