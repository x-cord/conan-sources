1
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.440
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.140
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.640
Officers always busy at work.

4
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.640
Take time out between cases for love.

5
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.799
There, that's a good boy.

9
00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.399
Grow, grow huger

10
00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:40.899
and leave the claws of flames behind.

11
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.899
Just once more.

12
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.299
Just once more and the eve will be over.

13
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.499
This rotten town will be lighted up with crimson flames.

14
00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.199
And the beautiful carnival shall begin.

15
00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.599
Ayumi?

16
00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.699
-What are you doing? -Mother.

17
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.199
-Come on, let's go home. -Okay!

18
00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:50.599
"Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 1)"

19
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.499
"Metropolitan Police Department"

20
00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.599
I see.

21
00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.999
And how did the eyes of the man?

22
00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.499
Well... He had eyes like a fox.

23
00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.999
It was like this!

24
00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.099
His eyes were slanted.

25
00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.599
Then maybe...

26
00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.999
he looked like this?

27
00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.999
His is completely different.

28
00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.299
Really?

29
00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.999
You're not a very good drawer, are you?

30
00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.499
That's no better than a child's doodling.

31
00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.999
Isn't there anyone who can draw better?

32
00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.299
It can't be helped

33
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:28.599
because Mr. Tomogawa, the one in charge is out sick.

34
00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.199
What?

35
00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.899
Excuse me.

36
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.799
But, Ms. Sato.

37
00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:36.099
Yes?

38
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.699
I don't think we can pass this sketch

39
00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.999
around to the investigation officers.

40
00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:46.199
Well, I guess it does have a sort of interesting touch to it.

41
00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.499
So what, are you two going to sketch for me instead?

42
00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
Well, I don't thinks so. I can't draw.

43
00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.299
I only draw abstract.

44
00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.299
Wait, Officer Shiratori!

45
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.299
Dirty rat.

46
00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.999
Besides, we're not really sure

47
00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.499
if the man she saw is really the arsonist yet.

48
00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.799
What? Are you saying that Ayumi is lying?

49
00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:15.899
Don't take us lightly because we're kids.

50
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.699
But it's not like you saw the guy actually cause the fire, is it?

51
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.999
-No doubt about it. -Huh?

52
00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:24.499
He was wearing a leather jacket

53
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.699
despite this hot weather.

54
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.799
He had gloves on

55
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.499
and his pants smelled of kerosene

56
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.999
as he loitered around the back alley where the fire took place

57
00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:37.099
and was grinning.

58
00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.799
It would be more difficult

59
00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:41.899
not to suspect him of being the arsonist.

60
00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.299
Well?

61
00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.999
-Right, Ayumi? -Yes!

62
00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:52.099
All right. Let's head off to that back alley

63
00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.999
and check the place out.

64
00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.699
You're going to check the site of the fire?

65
00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.599
I'll go with you.

66
00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.299
Let me take you in my car.

67
00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:04.699
Okay, but I have to stop over some place first.

68
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.299
It's on the way to the site, anyway.

69
00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.299
What?

70
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:08.599
Stop by somewhere?

71
00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.399
Today is a special day for me.

72
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.699
A special day?

73
00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.999
Your birthday or something?

74
00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.199
No.

75
00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.699
The opposite.

76
00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.199
The opposite?

77
00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:31.099
I wonder where's she's stopping over?

78
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.199
A special day...

79
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.799
I see. Now I remember.

80
00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:56.799
Today is Police Commissioner, Masayoshi Sato,

81
00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.999
Ms. Sato's father's memorial.

82
00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:01.399
The day that he died on duty.

83
00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.699
What? Really?

84
00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:04.999
Yes.

85
00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:07.399
It was exactly 18 years ago today.

86
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.299
When he was going after a robber, at this intersection...

87
00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:13.199
At this intersection?

88
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.099
Yes. He was run over by a truck this intersection.

89
00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:21.199
Unfortunately, it was raining hard that day

90
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.699
so the ambulance arrived late.

91
00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:25.499
Inspector Megure told me

92
00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:27.899
that the Commissioner died in the ambulance

93
00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.999
that Ms. Sato rode along in,

94
00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.799
with his family watching over him.

95
00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:36.399
If I remember correctly, the name of the case was...

96
00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.599
-Shushiro. -What?

97
00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.299
Right! It's Shushiro.

98
00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:44.799
The officer who was run over by the truck

99
00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:46.899
repeated that name over and over

100
00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.499
towards the person hat fled from the scene.

101
00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:50.599
Because of this mysterious name,

102
00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:52.899
this case was name "The Shushiro Case".

103
00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.999
And an all out investigation network

104
00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.499
that saw no precedent was set up.

105
00:07:57.499 --> 00:08:00.699
However, since the officer who was thought to have the key

106
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.599
to the case passed away,

107
00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:04.399
the case remained stagnant

108
00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.699
and expired 3 years ago.

109
00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.599
That's what Pops told me.

110
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:14.599
Yeah. I've seen that case repeatedly on TV

111
00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.599
so I know about it too.

112
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.499
That was close, real close.

113
00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:20.299
It was a crime that was carefully thought out

114
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.399
that the only clue was the 10 second image of the robber

115
00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:26.599
on the surveillance monitor of the bank that was robbed.

116
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:29.499
Nobody even knows how the officer who died duty

117
00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:31.199
was able to specify the criminal.

118
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.899
The case was thrown into oblivion and is still unsolved.

119
00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:37.299
But I had no idea

120
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.099
that the officer back then as Ms. Sato's father.

121
00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:42.099
It can't be helped.

122
00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:43.699
Although the name of the case

123
00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:46.399
and the name of the criminal remain in the minds of people...

124
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:49.899
Nobody except police personnel...

125
00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.899
could ever be expected to member the name of the officer

126
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:56.099
who died on duty In the case.

127
00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:58.999
Ms. Sato...

128
00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.699
Well, after all, we're not doing our job

129
00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:04.199
because we want to be remembered.

130
00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:09.799
But maybe the driver of the truck saw who the robber was?

131
00:09:11.199 --> 00:09:13.399
The robber was wearing a long raincoat,

132
00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:16.899
but we don't even know if the person was a man or woman.

133
00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.299
Even in the picture taken by the surveillance camera

134
00:09:19.299 --> 00:09:21.599
the robber was wearing a cap, sunglasses, a mask and coat.

135
00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:24.599
But the name of the criminal was know, wasn't it?

136
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:26.299
That was Shushiro?

137
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.499
There was nobody by that name

138
00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:32.399
that was capable committing the crime.

139
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.599
Well, I guess that case was bound to go unsolved

140
00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:39.299
because all the police had to go on were three clues.

141
00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.099
The picture left on the surveillance camera,

142
00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:42.399
the fact that a raincoat was worn and the name Shushiro.

143
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.099
There were four.

144
00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:46.999
The fourth clue was

145
00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:48.999
written in my father's police I.D. memo book,

146
00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:52.199
three mysterious letters written in Katakana.

147
00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:54.099
"Kan-o".

148
00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:55.599
Kan-o?

149
00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:58.099
That's a first.

150
00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:02.399
The police seemed to have kept it from being disclosed.

151
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:03.899
It was deduced that

152
00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.499
the word was deeply involved with the case,

153
00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:10.399
so my mother and I were repeatedly asked,

154
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:12.799
"Did you ever hear Masayoshi say this word?"

155
00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:14.599
And?

156
00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:16.999
I've never even heard him say it

157
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:18.899
and besides, I don't have any idea what it means either.

158
00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:21.599
When I was a child, I used to glare at the three letters

159
00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:23.399
and always thought

160
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:28.099
that if anyone ever appears and nabs "Shushiro",

161
00:10:28.099 --> 00:10:31.199
I would grant that person's every wish!

162
00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:33.699
-Huh? -Grant every...

163
00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.199
Wish...

164
00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:38.399
If I find out,

165
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.699
will you treat me to a thousand eel over rice bowls?

166
00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:41.899
Yes, of course.

167
00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:44.999
I'd like to live in the castle at Tropical Land.

168
00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:49.199
I'd like a boarding pass to the International Space Station.

169
00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:53.299
I'd like a brand name bag.

170
00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:56.899
Could I have the ticket to the next World Cup Soccer game?

171
00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:58.799
Yes.

172
00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:02.299
How frightening. They're so realistic.

173
00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:04.999
What is the matter with you two?

174
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:11.999
Oh, flowers...

175
00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:13.099
Huh?

176
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:19.599
It's been a long time since I've seen you last!

177
00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:21.699
Is it you, Miwako?

178
00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:23.999
You've really grown to be a nice woman.

179
00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:26.299
-Do you know each other? -Yes.

180
00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:29.399
He used to be on the same high school baseball team as my father.

181
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.299
He is ace Mr. Hidero Saruwatari

182
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.399
who had was a battery team with my father.

183
00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:35.199
How do you do?

184
00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:38.999
He is Mr. Shuji Kano,

185
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.699
who was known for his strong arm and swift legs.

186
00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.399
Hello.

187
00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.199
He used to be the team's reliable main batter,

188
00:11:44.199 --> 00:11:45.999
Mr. Mitsuo Inomata.

189
00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.999
And she is the beautiful, Mrs. Choko Kandori,

190
00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:51.199
who used to be their manager.

191
00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:54.399
Oh, come on! I'm a 50 year old middle aged lady already.

192
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.799
What brings you all here today?

193
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.199
It's been some time since we've all seen each other,

194
00:11:58.199 --> 00:11:59.999
so we've decided to get together for a drink.

195
00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:03.699
But before we go, we came to say hello to

196
00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:06.399
Sato who used be the captain of our team.

197
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:07.699
I see.

198
00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:10.799
He sulks if we don't ask him to come along too.

199
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.199
We're going to the pub that we always go to.

200
00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:17.699
Yes, Shiratori here.

201
00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:20.299
Oh, Inspector Megure.

202
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:21.999
Huh? Now?

203
00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:26.299
We are at 4-chome Haido-cho.

204
00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:27.399
What?

205
00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:30.299
A suspicious person who looks to be an arsonist was witnessed?

206
00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:34.999
Right! The address is 6-chome Shinagawa.

207
00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:36.599
The officer who was on patrol

208
00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.199
was questioning him when he fled.

209
00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.699
They're in the midst of pursuing him now.

210
00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:45.399
He has long hair, is wearing an hat and a gray coat.

211
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:48.299
He seems to be near where you are now.

212
00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:50.699
Leave the children to Officer Sato.

213
00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:53.499
You and Takagi head for the site on the double.

214
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:55.599
So, that's the story.

215
00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:58.099
-Let's go, Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

216
00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.399
What's up? Hurry!

217
00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:07.099
My police I.D. book...

218
00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.899
My gun...

219
00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:11.699
Oh, no!

220
00:13:11.699 --> 00:13:12.999
Officer Takagi!

221
00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:14.399
The handcuffs...

222
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:17.399
I left the handcuffs on the desk of the 1 section at the station.

223
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:18.999
Hey, hey.

224
00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.199
We've got no time to go back and get it, you know.

225
00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:23.399
Are you all right, Officer Takagi?

226
00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.699
I'm okay.

227
00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.599
If worse comes to worse, Officer Shiratori has his...

228
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.499
And besides, my fortune in the magazine,

229
00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:32.199
it said today is a super lucky day for me.

230
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:36.599
I can do without handcuffs, he's only an arsonist.

231
00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:40.499
Please be careful, dear.

232
00:13:40.499 --> 00:13:42.799
Don't worry. According to today's fortune,

233
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:44.999
I'm supposed to be super lucky.

234
00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:49.699
Huh? Father forgot to take the handcuffs.

235
00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:53.799
What? My husband...

236
00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.599
My husband was run over by a car?

237
00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:57.899
Where is he now?

238
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:05.399
It's not right. Why?

239
00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:08.499
Father is fighting for justice and yet...

240
00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:12.799
He's fighting against the bad, and yet... Why?

241
00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:15.099
You idiot.

242
00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:17.199
The word "justice"...

243
00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.299
The word "justice"...

244
00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:22.499
Officer Sato?

245
00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:24.099
Huh?

246
00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:26.699
-Are you all right? -Yes.

247
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.399
We'll be on our way, then.

248
00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:32.099
Please take care of the children!

249
00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:33.299
Wait!

250
00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:35.599
Please wait, Officer Takagi!

251
00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:38.099
-Officer Takagi. -Yes?

252
00:14:52.599 --> 00:14:56.599
These handcuffs sure are rusty.

253
00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:58.999
If you don't have your handcuffs, take those.

254
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.799
Okay.

255
00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:03.599
Those are my father's keepsake.

256
00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:09.299
I broke my handcuffs during Mr. Higashida's case

257
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:12.999
so I was using those for a while.

258
00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:14.999
They're just right as a lucky charm for you.

259
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.999
Charm...

260
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:20.799
I thought your father died on duty.

261
00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:22.499
Just take them, okay?

262
00:15:22.499 --> 00:15:24.199
Be careful, both of you.

263
00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:25.499
-Wait, Officer Sato! -Officer Takagi.

264
00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:27.099
Yes, sir?

265
00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:30.699
Bye.

266
00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:38.599
What's going on?

267
00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:43.399
Why be armed with a gun when dealing with a mere arsonist?

268
00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.499
Well, they're both officers

269
00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:47.999
of the violent crime investigation section.

270
00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:50.699
I don't see why they have to go after the arsonist.

271
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:53.299
A stabbed body was found,

272
00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:56.099
near the fourth site of the fire set by the arsonist.

273
00:15:56.099 --> 00:15:57.699
We don't have proof,

274
00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:59.999
but the victim... most likely witnessed the crime

275
00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:03.299
or tried to stop the arsonist and was stabbed.

276
00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:05.199
That's what we suspect.

277
00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:08.999
So, I want you all to stay close to me.

278
00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:10.499
Okay...

279
00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:24.029
"Shinagawa Station"

280
00:16:24.729 --> 00:16:27.329
Inspector, Shiratori here.

281
00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:29.429
We just caught the suspicious man

282
00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:32.229
who was on the run at Shinagawa Station.

283
00:16:32.229 --> 00:16:34.329
No, I'm not the one!

284
00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:36.229
However, Inspector...

285
00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:38.229
He insists that he is not the arsonist,

286
00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:41.129
but just a thief.

287
00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:45.629
I get it! So that's what it was!

288
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.429
I've solved the mystery!

289
00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:49.429
Today is my lucky day after all.

290
00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:51.129
Okay, I'm going to call Officer Sato...

291
00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:52.429
Officer Takagi.

292
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.129
Yes, sir?

293
00:16:56.429 --> 00:16:58.229
Officer Takagi.

294
00:16:58.229 --> 00:17:00.229
Where are you calling?

295
00:17:00.229 --> 00:17:04.029
Well... Nowhere, nowhere special.

296
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:06.429
I'm going to the men's room.

297
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:08.029
Where is it?

298
00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:13.429
Yes, yes! This is the one!

299
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:15.729
I was buying this toy of Masked Yaiba

300
00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:17.929
when a weird man came out of there.

301
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:27.729
Yes! Sato here.

302
00:17:27.729 --> 00:17:31.229
Oh, Officer Takagi. So, what with the suspicious man?

303
00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:34.029
What?

304
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:36.029
You've figured out the criminal of 18 years ago?

305
00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:42.329
Yes. According to my deductions, most likely...

306
00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:45.229
Listen to this. He was there.

307
00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:48.129
Today, among the people that we met...

308
00:17:48.129 --> 00:17:50.029
That person...

309
00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:54.229
What is it, Officer Shiratori?

310
00:17:54.229 --> 00:17:58.229
Officer Takagi, you are acting strange.

311
00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:02.529
Come off it. Give me a break!

312
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:16.729
Yes... That's right!

313
00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:18.529
I've figured everything out.

314
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:20.829
The true meaning of Shushiro too.

315
00:18:20.829 --> 00:18:22.629
The secret of "kan-o" as well.

316
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:27.329
Now I know why your father

317
00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:31.629
found out and was able to specify the killer.

318
00:18:31.629 --> 00:18:35.229
Although the case has already expired...

319
00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:39.229
And? Who is it? Who is the killer?

320
00:18:40.329 --> 00:18:43.629
The killer is...

321
00:18:53.529 --> 00:18:56.429
Hey, Officer Takagi?

322
00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:57.929
Officer Takagi!

323
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:04.629
Officer Takagi...

324
00:19:04.629 --> 00:19:06.829
What's wrong? Answer me!

325
00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:15.229
Officer Takagi! Answer me!

326
00:19:15.229 --> 00:19:17.829
Officer Takagi...

327
00:19:21.229 --> 00:19:23.029
Hello?

328
00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:28.929
Officer Takagi...

329
00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:32.729
Okay, please do.

330
00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:39.429
Yes, Shiratori here.

331
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.329
Oh, Officer Sato.

332
00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:44.829
The suspect was just taken to the Shinagawa Police Station.

333
00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:47.129
What? Officer Takagi?

334
00:19:47.129 --> 00:19:51.029
Yes. I was with him, just 4 to 5 minutes ago.

335
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:53.729
Then the place and time where you last saw him...

336
00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:55.729
Call headquarters and give the central command room the info!

337
00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:58.229
-What? -Officer Takagi's been attacked by someone!

338
00:19:58.229 --> 00:20:00.529
Just a while ago while he was talking to me on the cell phone!

339
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:02.729
The attacker may be the arsonist that we're after

340
00:20:02.729 --> 00:20:04.029
so please be careful!

341
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:06.729
Officer Takagi was attacked

342
00:20:06.729 --> 00:20:09.429
just when he was about to tell you

343
00:20:09.429 --> 00:20:10.629
who the killer of 18 years ago was, right?

344
00:20:10.629 --> 00:20:12.529
Then the killer is...

345
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:17.029
No, because that case expired 3 years ago

346
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:21.229
and we can't even be sure if Officer Takagi's deduction is right.

347
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:24.129
You know the four that we met at sundown...

348
00:20:24.129 --> 00:20:25.129
They were saying they were going to drink

349
00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:26.629
at the pub they usually go to.

350
00:20:26.629 --> 00:20:28.129
Where is it?

351
00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:29.929
Where...

352
00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:33.629
The name of the pub is "Nanamagari".

353
00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:35.529
It's located...

354
00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:38.129
in front of Shinagawa Station...

355
00:20:40.729 --> 00:20:43.929
If Officer Takagi said that he saw the killer of 18 years ago

356
00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:47.229
among the four that we met,

357
00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:48.229
then somebody within that group

358
00:20:48.229 --> 00:20:49.929
who was also in front of Shinagawa Station

359
00:20:49.929 --> 00:20:53.729
could've coincidentally heard his conversation with you.

360
00:20:53.729 --> 00:20:56.729
The killer may have attacked Officer Takagi

361
00:20:56.729 --> 00:20:58.629
to shut him up, right?

362
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:04.729
I'm going to head off to Shinagawa Station.

363
00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:06.729
So you all go home by train

364
00:21:06.729 --> 00:21:08.029
and come to headquarters again tomorrow.

365
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:09.829
What?

366
00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:13.029
But the one who attacked Officer Takagi

367
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:15.329
may also be the arsonist, right?

368
00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:19.129
Then, I don't see why you're not taking Ms. Yoshida's

369
00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:21.729
who's the only one who witness the criminal.

370
00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:24.029
-But... -I'll do my best!

371
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:27.429
-Me, too! -I'll cooperate, too!

372
00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:29.229
Gosh.

373
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.729
From headquarters to calling all stations.

374
00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:40.129
Officers in the Shinagawa area.

375
00:21:40.129 --> 00:21:42.229
The place is in the vicinity of Shinagawa Station.

376
00:21:42.229 --> 00:21:45.329
Details are one officer whose whereabouts

377
00:21:45.329 --> 00:21:48.529
seems to have been struck by someone or wounded.

378
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:51.829
Investigate on the double and report investigation results!

379
00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:53.229
From headquarters to calling all stations.

380
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.829
Officers in the Shinagawa area.

381
00:21:54.829 --> 00:21:57.029
The place is in the vicinity of Shinagawa Station.

382
00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:04.729
It... it can't be...

383
00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.529
To think that the killer is among the four...

384
00:22:11.529 --> 00:22:14.329
The one that killed my father is among the four...

385
00:22:25.729 --> 00:22:28.629
It's not true, right, father?

386
00:23:58.629 --> 00:24:01.029
"Next Episode"

387
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:05.329
He's the one! The bad man that I saw!

388
00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:07.229
The children are gone!

389
00:24:08.929 --> 00:24:12.129
Now you can see it clearly, can't you?

390
00:24:12.129 --> 00:24:15.029
Don't tell me that the one who attacked Officer Takagi is...

391
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:17.129
Darn it!

392
00:24:17.129 --> 00:24:21.429
So, let's toast in celebration, shall we?

393
00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:23.429
Mr. "Kan-o"?

394
00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:28.550
Next Conan, "Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 2)"

395
00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:31.747
Next Conan's Hint:

396
00:24:31.747 --> 00:24:33.647
"Romaji (Roman letters)"

397
00:24:33.647 --> 00:24:34.947
In the next episode, the case is solved.

398
00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:36.047
I'm Takagi, I'm a police officer!

399
00:24:36.047 --> 00:24:37.247
I thought you were done for?

400
00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:38.347
Oh, right!
