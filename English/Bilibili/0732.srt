1
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:04,324
We ran into the mini police car of the two women police officers,

2
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:08,624
Yumi Miyamoto and Naeko Miike on our way back from school.

3
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:13,324
Just then, Naeko gets a call on her cell phone reporting a case.

4
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,424
We rush over to the scene,

5
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:19,524
and find a corpse hanging from a chandelier there.

6
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,224
By the feet of the corpse was what looked to be a will,

7
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:25,724
and it was first thought to be suicide but...

8
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,124
I see.

9
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:34,024
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

10
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,024
The one prepared move?

11
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:40,024
If I'm not mistaken...

12
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:54,924
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

13
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,724
are slashed by the light of deduction.

14
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,024
The suspect is Yumi Miyamoto's ex-boyfriend?

15
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,024
One flash move of deduction clears the checkmated crime scene.

16
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,524
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:04,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:06,824
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,570
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 2)"

20
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,470
Inspector Megure!

21
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,770
We got a testimony of a suspicious character being seen!

22
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,770
What?

23
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,670
According to the concierge on the first floor,

24
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,970
a suspicious looking person wearing a cap, mask and glasses,

25
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,170
as if hiding his face went in and out of the condo!

26
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,570
Officer Chiba!

27
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,070
When was that?

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,770
After Mr. Itami and the housemaid left.

29
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,670
Why didn't the concierge stop him?

30
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,870
He said he thought the man was a resident

31
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,570
because he used a key to come in.

32
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,270
He also mentioned that Mr. Itami's son also came.

33
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,070
His son?

34
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,170
Yes.

35
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,970
He said it was before Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home,

36
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,870
but he's not really sure if it was before

37
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,770
or after the suspicious man came.

38
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,170
Are you by chance...

39
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,970
Sakurako,

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,570
the one who's one year below me?

41
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,370
"Sakurako Yonehara (23), Housemaid" -Chibacchi! Long time no see!

42
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,170
So the housemaid was you, Sakurako.

43
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,470
Why doesn't he remember me?

44
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,470
Come to think of it, you may not remember,

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,170
but the one who was always with you...

46
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,670
Officer Chiba! Go take a look!

47
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,270
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,470
Hey, what's with this brat?

49
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,070
Let go of me!

50
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,870
I'm not letting you go!

51
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,870
What're you guys doing?

52
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,370
What do you mean what? I caught this suspicious guy for you!

53
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm not anybody suspicious.

54
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,870
You were looking inside through the peephole of the door!

55
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,770
I was just fooling around.

56
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,770
I thought that if anyone peeped out the hole he would be surprised.

57
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,270
Besides, even if you were to look inside from the hole,

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,170
you can't see what's inside.

59
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,070
But, your hair's funny too!

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,970
This is...

61
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,070
I left my dyed brown hair as is, and this is how it ended up.

62
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,870
So you say,

63
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,670
but I'll bet you came because it bothered you.

64
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,670
Like they say, perps return to the scene of the crime.

65
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,470
Perp? What do you mean perp?

66
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,970
Is it true that he was looking inside?

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,370
Yeah.

68
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,270
After this person pushed the doorbell.

69
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,670
That voice? Is it you, Yasuie?

70
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,170
Dad.

71
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,070
"Yasuie Itami (22)" -Which means...

72
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,570
"Naganobu's son" -He's his son!

73
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,170
"Naganobu Itami (52)" -What's up?

74
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,570
"Flat resident" -Weren't you at driving school?

75
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,170
I played hooky.

76
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,470
I wanted to show you the car catalogs as soon as possible.

77
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,070
Cars my foot!

78
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,570
Do that after you find yourself a job!

79
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,870
What's with you?

80
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,770
You agreed about me taking a driver's license, didn't you, Dad?

81
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,170
You could never pass with that pudding-like hair!

82
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,870
Dad. What're you so upset about?

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,570
The cops are here too. What the heck's going on?

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,370
The fact is...

85
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,170
What? Mom committed suicide?

86
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,570
Oh, no! Why?

87
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,970
Although there's still the possibility that she was killed.

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,070
Killed?

89
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,970
Come to think of it,

90
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,470
it seems you came here once today already?

91
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,170
Yeah.

92
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,070
To show these catalogs.

93
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,270
But since there was no answer after pushing the doorbell,

94
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,370
I figured they were out shopping

95
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,570
or something so I killed time walking around and stuff,

96
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,370
then came back.

97
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,670
I see.

98
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,770
Is there anyone who can testify for you?

99
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,770
Hey, Inspector.

100
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,970
Don't tell me you're suspecting me?

101
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,770
Somebody's cell phone is ringing.

102
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,570
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,670
It was my cell phone!

104
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,970
Oh boy.

105
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,970
But, all three of you are using the same type of cell phone?

106
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,570
Yeah. This model is popular.

107
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,270
The color of the covers is different

108
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,970
so we don't mistake one for the other.

109
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,170
Talking of cell phones,

110
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,370
before finding Mrs. Itami's cell phone,

111
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,070
Sakurako you said that you heard the bedroom door close, right?

112
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,670
Yes.

113
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,170
How did you know that the sound you heard was the door of the bedroom?

114
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,570
You can't see it from the front entrance, can you?

115
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,570
All the other doors were a bit opened.

116
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,870
I thought they were closed before.

117
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,770
I went out shopping though.

118
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,770
Then, wasn't the bedroom window a bit opened too?

119
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,570
How do you know?

120
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,770
Were you with her right through while shopping?

121
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,970
No, I was in the smoking area until she finished shopping.

122
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,470
Which means you don't have an alibi either.

123
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,870
Were you at home right through, Mr. Haneda?

124
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,870
No, I was out.

125
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,870
As soon as I got home, the police woman pushed my doorbell.

126
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,470
"Shukichi Haneda (28)" -Where and what were you doing?

127
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,870
"Flat resident" -Well...

128
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,470
Hey! Come on and spit it out!

129
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,170
I can't tell you.

130
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,170
Just what are you talking about, Chukichi?

131
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,370
You're being suspected as a murderer, you know?

132
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,470
Come on, spit it out!

133
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,870
Or, you'll end up being the perp?

134
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,370
Don't worry, Yumi baby.

135
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,770
This case is already checkmated.

136
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,462
Listen, you guys!

137
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,162
It should be somewhere in this neighborhood, okay?

138
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:08,462
If you find it, show the person who is nearby

139
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:12,062
the picture that I sent you a while ago!

140
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,062
Yes.

141
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,562
-I'm counting on you, then! -Aye...

142
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,062
Yes, yes.

143
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,362
Inspector Megure!

144
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,662
I've got the result of the handwriting analysis!

145
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:22,262
Is that so?

146
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,762
Although the handwriting is pretty messy,

147
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:29,462
the will seems to have undoubtedly been written by Mrs. Chiyoko Itami.

148
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:30,662
What?

149
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:34,162
Could she have been threatened by the perp to write it?

150
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,362
No, being that messy,

151
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,862
I'm sure that the perp would've made her rewrite it.

152
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:42,762
And the housemaid was frequently displayed

153
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,662
in the surveillance camera of the supermarket,

154
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:48,562
so her alibi has been established.

155
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:52,962
However, Mr. Itami who went shopping with her

156
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:54,562
wasn't displayed anywhere.

157
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,962
Like I said, I was in the smoking area

158
00:08:56,962 --> 00:09:00,062
Which means then, that the three suspects are, Mr. Itami

159
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:03,962
and one who came here once, rang the doorbell,

160
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,562
but since there was no answer,

161
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,462
went out to kill time and came back again,

162
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:11,562
his son Yasuie and me, who was out during this time,

163
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:16,462
but would not tell you where I was.

164
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:20,162
Geez, do you know how you're making yourself look?

165
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:24,762
Like I said, I'll tell you where I was at a later time.

166
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:27,862
What? Is it something you can't say in front of me?

167
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,062
It's a woman, isn't it?

168
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:31,062
I'll bet you were meeting some woman somewhere!

169
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,762
No way!

170
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,962
Like I told you,

171
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:36,362
you're the only one for me, Yumi baby.

172
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:38,562
What a nuisance.

173
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:39,562
Inspector!

174
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,162
It's okay already,

175
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:42,962
he's the perp so hurry and handcuff him!

176
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,762
-What? -But, Yumi...

177
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:49,362
Although there are several dubious points,

178
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,862
when Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home

179
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,862
and entered the front door,

180
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:57,062
they heard the door of this bedroom close,

181
00:09:57,062 --> 00:10:01,562
and Mrs. Itami was found dead hanging here.

182
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:03,562
If the will that was found by her feet

183
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,062
is something that she herself had written,

184
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,962
there is no other possibility than this being a suicide.

185
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:10,662
The one prepared move.

186
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:14,662
That will was it, wasn't it, Mr. Haneda?

187
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:16,362
Come to think of it,

188
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,062
you were saying something to that effect, weren't you, Chukichi?

189
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:20,262
What on earth was that? Just what did you mean?

190
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:23,762
Beats me? Did I say something like that?

191
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:27,262
When one assumes a certain situation,

192
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,962
and when that assumed situation comes to be,

193
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,062
the brilliant move that is made then, is called,

194
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:34,162
the "one prepared move."

195
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,362
I saw this written on the internet.

196
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,862
It comes from shogi terminology.

197
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:40,662
Shogi terminology?

198
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:43,862
How come you know of something like that Chukichi?

199
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:47,562
By the way, was that will the "one prepared move"?

200
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:51,262
Didn't you think the he contents of that will was strange?

201
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:54,262
What was written on it was,

202
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,562
"I'm sorry to have wounded you.

203
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,962
I pray that you will get well soon.

204
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,062
Yasuie, good luck on your exam,

205
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,862
I'm sure you'll pass.

206
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,862
Please let Ichiko wear my dressy kimono

207
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:07,562
when time to celebrate Shichigosan comes.

208
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:08,862
Please forgive me for crossing over

209
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:10,362
before all of you and leaving you behind.

210
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,362
Chiyoko Itami"

211
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:13,762
What's strange about this?

212
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,662
The exam part.

213
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:22,362
Yasuie was scheduled to take a written driver's test.

214
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:26,162
It's not a test so hard as to have to pray for.

215
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,962
She was a worrier, you see.

216
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:33,362
In fact, she was really worried about our son who is graduating soon,

217
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,662
but still doesn't have a job.

218
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:39,662
Right, Yasuie is now a senior at the university.

219
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:41,362
If that will were to be something that she had written four years ago

220
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:45,562
when her son was going to take the university exam,

221
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:48,262
wouldn't everything fall into place?

222
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:51,962
Very true, four years ago.

223
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:57,062
If it were four years ago, her niece would've been 3 years old,

224
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,262
the youngest age to celebrate Shichigosan.

225
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:04,062
Mrs. Itami showed me that picture the other day.

226
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:06,962
She pointed at the girl wearing a dressy kimono and said.

227
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:11,462
"This doesn't look like a kimono made 40 years ago, does it?"

228
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:15,062
Then, don't tell me that the will was really written four years ago?

229
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,362
That's ridiculous? I showed you, didn't I?

230
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,762
This bruise by my eye.

231
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:23,162
I got this wound last night when my wife threw an ashtray at me.

232
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,962
If that's written on the will then...

233
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:26,362
Talking of wounds...

234
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:30,062
I remember you said some time ago, that you broke your leg.

235
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,262
Yeah.

236
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,662
Because my mother who was a beginner at skiing crashed into Dad.

237
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,562
She told me that because of this accident

238
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:41,562
she always ended up having to go to the annual family New Year's party

239
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,162
held in our hometown, alone by plane,

240
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:45,762
in which she almost lost her life.

241
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:48,162
So, that was four years ago too?

242
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:51,662
If that plane was about to crash,

243
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:54,462
it's not strange that she wrote the will on board the plane

244
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:58,062
to her family that she thought she would be leaving behind.

245
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,362
I see!

246
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,362
That's why the will was so messily written!

247
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:05,162
Because she wrote it on board a turbulent plane about to crash.

248
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:06,562
I see.

249
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:10,862
That's why she went out of her way to write her full name on it,

250
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:13,962
in case someone were to have found it at the crash site.

251
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:16,862
If the perp got a hold of this,

252
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,062
and used it to commit this crime four years later.

253
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:22,462
It would indeed be the "One prepared move."

254
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:25,462
It's a mystery still that when Mr. Itami and the housemaid came home,

255
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:28,462
he door of the bedroom slammed shut, though.

256
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,462
Yeah.

257
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:35,362
Maybe the perp was still hiding in the bedroom at that time?

258
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:37,562
I don't think so.

259
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,762
When I came home, I locked the front door

260
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,762
and when Conan first came,

261
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,962
the door was still locked.

262
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,562
Then why did the door?

263
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:50,362
It couldn't possibly have closed on its own.

264
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:54,762
Hey, who is it? How rough!

265
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:57,962
Is it you, Officer Chiba?

266
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,862
Hey, Conan.

267
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,862
Are you the one who just closed this door?

268
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,262
What're you talking about?

269
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,762
I just opened the front door

270
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,162
to confirm whether my friends came back or not.

271
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:12,162
And, I did leave the window of the bedroom slightly opened!

272
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,862
The heater was too hot, so...

273
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,562
When Mrs. Itami's corpse was found,

274
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:18,862
the window was a bit opened too, wasn't it?

275
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,562
-Is that true? -Yes.

276
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,962
Mr. Itami said that he feels sorry for his wife feeling cold,

277
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:26,562
so he closed it right away though.

278
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,562
That's it!

279
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:30,862
Because the front door opened,

280
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:34,662
the warm air inside the room gushed out the window,

281
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:37,562
and the bedroom door closed!

282
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,462
So, the perp, in order to make this happen,

283
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,662
left the bedroom window and door open.

284
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,662
But then, the bedroom door would slam shut

285
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:49,162
when the perp opens the front door to flee.

286
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,862
Isn't that right?

287
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:51,862
Come to think of it,

288
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,262
Mrs. Itami's cell phone was on the floor

289
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:55,862
in front of the door of the bedroom, right?

290
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:56,962
Yes.

291
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,562
Then...

292
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,962
If you stick the cell phone between the door,

293
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:02,762
won't that leave the door open?

294
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,062
See! Like this!

295
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:09,362
But, it'll stay open right through that way, no?

296
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:11,162
No good after all?

297
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,362
If legs were on the cell phone

298
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:17,262
and it moved around like an animal, it seems possible.

299
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:19,762
I see! The vibe of the cell phone!

300
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:22,962
The perp stuck the cell phone between the door,

301
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,062
left the room and called that cell phone from outside.

302
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:26,362
The cell phone that was set on vibe, vibrated when called

303
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:28,862
and dropped to the floor.

304
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,362
But, there were no history for incoming calls on Mrs. Itami's cell phone

305
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,362
that was on the floor in front of the door.

306
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:36,662
Maybe that's not your wife's?

307
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:41,662
Because although the color of the covers is different,

308
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,462
all three in the family have cell phones of the same model!

309
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:46,862
It's not strange if you were to mistake

310
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,362
your own cell phone for hers, is it?

311
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:49,662
I see.

312
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,262
If you were to take off the cover from your wife's cell phone,

313
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,662
and put it onto yours,

314
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,262
you could lie and say that it's your own.

315
00:15:57,262 --> 00:16:00,162
If you were to use that cell phone to carry out that trick,

316
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:04,262
then after switch the cover back again before turning it in,

317
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:09,262
it would look like Mrs. Itami's phone had nothing to do with the crime.

318
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:12,362
And the only person who could do this

319
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,062
is the one who had Mrs. Itami's cell phone

320
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:16,462
until it was time to turn it in to us...

321
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:20,162
you, her husband, Mr. Itami.

322
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,662
While the housemaid was shopping,

323
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:26,962
you probably went home once, strangled your wife,

324
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:30,162
hung her from the ceiling,

325
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:32,662
put the will that was written four years at her feet,

326
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,662
opened the window to the bedroom,

327
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,262
stuck the cell phone between the door,

328
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,562
and left the scene.

329
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,562
Then, you called the cell phone from outside

330
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:44,762
to use vibe to drop the cell phone from between the door,

331
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:47,862
then joined the housemaid and returned home once again

332
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:52,662
to make it look as if Mrs. Itami had committed suicide.

333
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,762
After returning home,

334
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:56,962
you didn't go straight into the bedroom

335
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,462
and discover the corpse in order to hide the fact

336
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,762
that some time had passed since the corpse had been hung.

337
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,362
Then, the suspicious character

338
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:05,562
that the concierge on first floor said he saw was

339
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,462
Mr. Itami.

340
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:11,462
He probably had change of clothes hidden in the restroom or something

341
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,962
Well, we can easily figure it out

342
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,362
if we look at your cell phone as to that.

343
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:16,562
Now that you mentioned it,

344
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,462
when I was in the smoking area of the supermarket, my phone rang...

345
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,962
Who was it?

346
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:24,162
It seemed to have been a wrong number call.

347
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,162
I found a public phone!

348
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,862
It was in front of a convenience store nearby!

349
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,462
We asked the manager the picture of Mr. Itami,

350
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,362
and he told us that he was sneakily talking on t he phone!

351
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,462
Well, since there aren't too many people

352
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:40,762
who use the public phone nowadays

353
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,462
maybe fingerprints can be found on it?

354
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,962
So she says!

355
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:50,262
But, is it true, Dad?

356
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,062
Did you really kill Mom?

357
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:58,162
I thought that luck had finally come around for me.

358
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,262
To tell the truth, I really contemplated

359
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,762
on whether or not I should carry out this murder scheme.

360
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:06,062
Until last night, that is...

361
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,862
Hey, Chiyoko!

362
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:10,262
I told you to cut out doing stocks, didn't I?

363
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:13,162
Although we're telling Yasuie that he can't have a car,

364
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:15,862
at heart we both actually want to get him one, no?

365
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,362
Just what are you talking about?

366
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,762
Our debts are ballooning too, you know.

367
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,562
I've figured it out!

368
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:25,762
God doesn't smile on me until I'm really cornered.

369
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:29,962
That's why I mortgaged this condo and borrowed money.

370
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:34,462
After that we got into an awful argument and...

371
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:37,162
When the ashtray that Chiyoko threw hit my eye,

372
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,362
I felt a flash electricity go through me.

373
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:41,662
It dawned on me that under these circumstances

374
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,862
I could use the will that I had previously found

375
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:48,462
to carry out the murder plan

376
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,162
felt that God was on my side.

377
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:58,462
Did you by any chance, know who the perp was?

378
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:00,562
I was suspicious about the will,

379
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,762
but maybe was convinced after hearing the conversation

380
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:05,462
between the father and son at the front door.

381
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:08,862
You could never pass with that pudding-like hair!

382
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:13,462
He knew what his son's hair looked like under the cap

383
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:16,262
he was wearing despite not having seen him for 2 years,

384
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,062
only because when he was hanging his wife,

385
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,062
the doorbell rang, and saw what his son looked like

386
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:22,262
after looking through the peep hole of the door.

387
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,562
But if his son had kept his cap on,

388
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,062
he couldn't have seen it, no?

389
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:33,162
The son likes peeking back through the peephole.

390
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,962
If you're wearing a cap with a brim,

391
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:40,562
you can't look into the peep hole unless you take it off, right?

392
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,162
He sure was a dense looking guy, don't you think?

393
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,562
You're talking about Yumi's ex, right?

394
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,462
I was imagining a more "host" like person

395
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,862
when I previously heard of him, though.

396
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:17,262
Well, but all's well, I'd say,

397
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:18,562
because he seems to be clever

398
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:21,862
and helped solve the case this time.

399
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:24,662
Yeah, I got kind of nervous too,

400
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:26,562
being able to make deductions along with such a famous person.

401
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:28,362
Famous?

402
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:31,562
Was there any actor by the name Shukichi Haneda?

403
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,962
See this person!

404
00:21:32,962 --> 00:21:34,062
Master of Shogi Taiko,

405
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,762
congratulations to your winning the 4 major titles!

406
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,862
Hey, it's the Master of Shogi, Taiko!

407
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,862
My mother's a great fan of his too!

408
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:43,962
But what does the master have to do with him?

409
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:45,762
Take a good look at him.

410
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:51,362
I guess you can say that the opposing rooks went well today.

411
00:21:58,362 --> 00:21:59,662
This tousled hair...

412
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:01,562
It's him!

413
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:04,662
I see.

414
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,962
The kanji character of his name resembles that of Hideyoshi Hashiba,

415
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:08,262
that's why he's called Taiko.

416
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,862
Yeah. He was actually at the Shogi tournament hall that day,

417
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:14,162
for the preliminary game,

418
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:15,562
but it seems he didn't say anything about it

419
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:18,062
because he didn't want Yumi to find out that he was a Shogi player.

420
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,062
Cut why not? A master of Shogi is awesome!

421
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:23,662
If so, what are the seven things he's collecting?

422
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:27,062
Well, when it comes to seven in Shogi...

423
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:32,562
"Many years ago"

424
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,962
Yumi, I did it!

425
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:39,962
I got the title of Shogi Master that I've been longing for!

426
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:42,162
Yumi baby.

427
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:45,162
Gee whizz! You're late, Chukichi!

428
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,262
I'm sorry, so sorry.

429
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,762
The battle took longer than I expected.

430
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:50,862
Were playing a game or something?

431
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:54,162
Oh, no, I guess you could call it a game but...

432
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:57,562
-The thing is today I... -Hey, take a look at this news!

433
00:22:57,562 --> 00:22:58,762
News?

434
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:02,062
Yokozuna Tenho won the summer tournament

435
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:05,162
and ended up winning 6 consecutive sumo tournaments.

436
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,862
He's fantastic, don't you think?

437
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,862
To keep winning for an entire year!

438
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:13,062
I guess if a prince-like person like him were to be your husband,

439
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,262
the wife would feel like a princess.

440
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,862
Don't worry,

441
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:22,262
I have no such expectations when it comes to you.

442
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:24,862
Gio, Osho,

443
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,262
Oza, Kisei, Ooi,

444
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:31,062
Ryuo, Meijin!

445
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,462
The 7 major titles!

446
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:38,962
What? Chukichi is a Master Shogi player?

447
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:40,862
Yes!

448
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:44,662
He is indeed... I'll bet you mean the master of fishing

449
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,162
or a game or something like that, right?

450
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:47,862
It's just like him...

451
00:23:58,462 --> 00:24:01,262
The groom is lying on the ground!

452
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:06,462
In other words,

453
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:11,762
we think that the same perp committed both crimes.

454
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:15,862
I see. If that's used...

455
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,162
Next Conan,
