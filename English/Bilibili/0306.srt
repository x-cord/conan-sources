1
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.740
Black entanglement also unravels.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.440
A real case at a drama shoot.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.740
The murder weapon and suspect is nearby.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.967
Pops was asked to act as substitute

9
00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.167
for doing the opening prologue of a detective drama.

10
00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:49.267
He runs into a childhood friend of his, Ruri Ujo

11
00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.167
who turned into a big name actress.

12
00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:54.167
However...

13
00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:57.967
Rurippe?

14
00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:05.467
Kogoro.

15
00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:12.367
"Invisible Suspect (Part 2)"

16
00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.867
Darn it.

17
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.267
You smoke, Kogoro?

18
00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.167
Yes. You don't smoke, Rurippe?

19
00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:32.467
Did you forget about my father?

20
00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:36.267
Oh, right. He was famous in the neighborhood as one that hated smokers.

21
00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:37.467
Right!

22
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:40.767
Thanks to him, I hate cigarettes, too.

23
00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.067
The same here.

24
00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:46.467
But in my case, my mother hated cigarettes.

25
00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.967
So, my father who was a heavy smoker

26
00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:52.867
says that he was forced to quit as soon as I was born.

27
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.767
But what if you have to smoke in dramas?

28
00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:59.567
I just hold the cigarette in my mouth at times like that.

29
00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:00.567
Right, right.

30
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.167
We push the director and producer to do it our way.

31
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:07.667
That's why you can never be any greater than you father.

32
00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.867
Kasumi.

33
00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:10.367
Well, for a certain someone

34
00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:11.767
who sells herself as a healer type actress...

35
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:17.267
it might be good for her health image.

36
00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:21.267
Kasumi.

37
00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:23.167
What's with her anyway?

38
00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.167
She's jealous of me

39
00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:27.567
because I'm talking intimately with him.

40
00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:30.467
I think she's cute, don't you?

41
00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:32.467
I see.

42
00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.067
Just like the victim Mr. Kazami was saying,

43
00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:38.367
it seems that they're going with each other.

44
00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:39.967
Which means that

45
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.267
the lover he is secretly going out with is...

46
00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:50.867
Have you already figured out who the killer is,

47
00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:52.467
Mr. Renown Detective?

48
00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.667
No, not yet.

49
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.967
Excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

50
00:03:57.967 --> 00:03:59.667
May I have a word with you?

51
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:00.867
Sure.

52
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:06.567
Conan, where are you going?

53
00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:08.467
To the men's room.

54
00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.767
Don't bother the police officers, okay?

55
00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.167
Okay!

56
00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:19.467
What is it?

57
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.867
Just what are you up to?

58
00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:22.167
Huh?

59
00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.767
I'm asking you why you're making passes at her.

60
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.667
You mean Rurippe?

61
00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:32.067
I'm not making passes. We're just childhood friends.

62
00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:34.067
Are you sure that's all there is to it?

63
00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:38.967
Is that honestly true?

64
00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:40.967
Yes.

65
00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.267
Okay then. But if you do anything funny,

66
00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:45.367
I don't care if you're a renown detective or what, I won't forgive you.

67
00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.567
Hey, hold it.

68
00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:53.767
I feel as if I've gone through this sometime in the past, too.

69
00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:57.567
If I'm not mistaken it was...

70
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.667
Hey, kid! What're you doing?

71
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:07.167
This tool box was left here in this room

72
00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:10.167
together with the golf glove and coat too, right?

73
00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.467
That's why I figured maybe there's something in here

74
00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:16.267
besides a cutter knife that is capable of slashing things.

75
00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:18.167
Playing detective is okay,

76
00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:22.467
but the police checked every nook and cranny of this tool box.

77
00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:23.667
Even this tape measure?

78
00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:25.567
Yes.

79
00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:26.867
Hey, who is it?

80
00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.967
Who bamitted in a crummy place like this?

81
00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.567
What does the "bamit" mean?

82
00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:35.167
It means to mark the floor with masking.

83
00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:36.767
It's done to indicate where the set is to be placed

84
00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:39.367
or to determine the place where the actor is to stand.

85
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:42.167
Well, I guess the shooting is going to be called off.

86
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.767
So, I'll remove this for now.

87
00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:45.067
Wait!

88
00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:48.267
Something is fishy about the masking tape.

89
00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:50.467
It's a little bloated

90
00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:53.067
and something is stuck to the tip.

91
00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:54.267
What is this?

92
00:05:56.567 --> 00:05:57.967
A wire?

93
00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:02.467
I see. I got it!

94
00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:04.167
I've figured out what the murder weapon is.

95
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.867
As well as why we can't find it.

96
00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:12.867
The room where the coat and the glove were is here

97
00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:14.567
and the scene of the crime is diagonally beyond.

98
00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:18.567
If from this room, the crime can be carried out easily.

99
00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:21.967
All I need to figure out next is who did this.

100
00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.067
Something's not right.

101
00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:28.067
I can't figure out why Ruri suddenly invites everyone to go outside

102
00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:30.967
after seeing the snow through the window.

103
00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:34.167
Oh, no! Pops!

104
00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:39.767
That brat! He's roaming around the scene of the crime again.

105
00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:40.967
Hey!

106
00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.667
Darn it.

107
00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.367
Where the heck is he?

108
00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:51.967
I see! I got it!

109
00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.167
Where is Inspector Yokomizo?

110
00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.467
He just stepped out a while ago.

111
00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.367
I see.

112
00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.567
By the way, do you guys smoke?

113
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:02.967
No.

114
00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:06.067
Oh, right.

115
00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:08.167
I'd like to see the evidence once more,

116
00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:10.967
so will you please lend me a glove?

117
00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:13.267
Yes, sir. By all means.

118
00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.967
This is the wallet and this is the cigarette.

119
00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:20.067
The coat and the glove.

120
00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.967
And this is the victim's lighter.

121
00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.667
It's out of oil.

122
00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:32.867
I've figured out the mystery.

123
00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:35.967
All I have to do now is put Pops to sleep with this anesthetic gun.

124
00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.267
Huh?

125
00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:40.767
I can't use the gun.

126
00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:45.067
I used it at the filming site a while ago.

127
00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:47.467
Bummers! What now?

128
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.867
I can't use Sleeping Kogoro.

129
00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:54.867
I've got no choice but to drop a lot of hints at Pops.

130
00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:57.667
Pops!

131
00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:01.667
There are many things that I've noticed,

132
00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.267
will you lend me an ear?

133
00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:06.667
Maybe I can help solve the case.

134
00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:09.467
I don't need anything like that anymore.

135
00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:11.767
But...

136
00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:16.767
Don't tell me that Pops already figured the case out?

137
00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:21.467
Mr. Mouri, I looked all over for you.

138
00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.967
Just where were you?

139
00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:28.267
Well, I was going around this building looking for a key to this case.

140
00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:30.467
And? Did you find the anything?

141
00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:32.367
Did you solve the mystery of the vanished murder weapon?

142
00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:34.867
Well, what I found was not the key,

143
00:08:34.867 --> 00:08:37.367
but just this kid alone.

144
00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.067
Just as I thought.

145
00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:41.167
I see.

146
00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:44.467
We'll continue to look for the murder weapon then.

147
00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:46.667
So, if you come up with anything...

148
00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:49.067
Okay, I'll let you know right away.

149
00:08:49.067 --> 00:08:50.867
Yes, please do by all means.

150
00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.867
If only I could use the anesthetic gun...

151
00:08:56.967 --> 00:08:59.267
His facial expression changed.

152
00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:00.767
It is as I thought, Pops...

153
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.767
He already figured out who the killer is.

154
00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:09.567
Rurippe, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

155
00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:12.167
No, she's not the killer.

156
00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.367
Darn it. I guess I've no choice,

157
00:09:19.367 --> 00:09:21.367
but to hit Pops on the head with something

158
00:09:21.367 --> 00:09:22.867
and make him pass out.

159
00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:24.967
I wonder if there's something I kick.

160
00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.067
They locked the door.

161
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.267
Hey.

162
00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:33.067
I can't go inside if you lock the door.

163
00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:36.467
Oh, my. What's up, Kogoro?

164
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:38.367
Why lock the door?

165
00:09:40.567 --> 00:09:44.467
Don't tell me that you're going to seduce me?

166
00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:48.567
Darn it. I can't hear what they're saying inside.

167
00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:50.567
The most I can do is get this wiretap inside

168
00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.267
from the space beneath the door.

169
00:09:55.867 --> 00:10:01.167
Or are you suspecting that I killed Mr. Kazami,

170
00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:04.367
and going to try to persuade me untill I admit I committed the crime?

171
00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:05.667
Yes, exactly.

172
00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:09.867
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

173
00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:11.667
Just as I thought.

174
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:13.467
Pops's got it all wrong.

175
00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:16.167
I have to stop him quickly.

176
00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.389
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

177
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:26.989
Just as I thought.

178
00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:28.789
Pops's got it all wrong.

179
00:10:29.689 --> 00:10:31.289
I have to stop him quickly.

180
00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:36.889
But you're not the one who's making the confession.

181
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:39.689
The one you're protecting,

182
00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:42.589
Mr. Akira Nagumo.

183
00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:44.989
Huh?

184
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:47.389
Just what are you talking about, Kogoro?

185
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:50.589
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

186
00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:51.889
You saw, didn't you?

187
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:56.189
Just before seeing the snow fall outside the window.

188
00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:57.889
What did I see?

189
00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:01.489
Back then, the staff opened the door to the room near the window

190
00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:03.789
and came out, right?

191
00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:08.289
I'm sure you saw it from the reflection on the glass door.

192
00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:10.089
Mr. Naburo was coming out from the room next door

193
00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:13.989
where Mr. Kazami was taking a nap.

194
00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:18.489
You saw the staff about to come out of the room,

195
00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:22.389
as well as the figure of the killer who rushed back into the room.

196
00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:29.189
You saw how he acted and sensed that he did something,

197
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.589
so you invited everybody to go look at the snow outside

198
00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:34.289
and tried to get everybody away from the room.

199
00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:39.189
I realized just a while ago that's what happened

200
00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:45.289
when I found Conan by the doorway of the crime scene.

201
00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:49.989
Just before I turned the corner.

202
00:11:50.989 --> 00:11:52.789
Just as would be expected of a renown detective,

203
00:11:52.789 --> 00:11:55.289
was I'd like to say,

204
00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:58.489
but you haven't found the murder weapon yet, have you?

205
00:11:58.489 --> 00:12:02.489
The knife that slashed Mr. Kazami who was taking a nap.

206
00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:06.189
Isn't it more important to figure out the mystery

207
00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:09.489
of the missing knife that has a blade about 10 centimeters

208
00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:11.189
before you go around making assumptions

209
00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:14.189
about me having witnessed the killer?

210
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:15.589
Yes.

211
00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:19.989
We were all too concerned about the blade being 10 centimeters long.

212
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:24.189
Because it's hard to believe that the blade is a small clump of steel,

213
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:26.589
no more than two centimeters.

214
00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:27.689
Huh?

215
00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.989
A cutter knife.

216
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:33.789
After the killer killed Mr. Kazami,

217
00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:38.589
the blade was folded compactly away

218
00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:42.389
and hidden inside this lighter that Mr. Kazami had.

219
00:12:43.489 --> 00:12:46.189
Pops got it right!

220
00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:49.189
But, Kogoro,

221
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:53.789
even if a blood smeared blade were to be inside that lighter,

222
00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:55.389
it makes no difference that the murder weapon

223
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.189
hasn't been found yet, does it?

224
00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:00.489
A blade of 10 centimeters means

225
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:04.389
that the knife sunk that deeply into him, doesn't it?

226
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:06.589
Unless the blade is firmly attached to the grip,

227
00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:08.789
it's impossible to poke that deeply into something.

228
00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:12.989
And I'm sure that blood would've splattered on the grip too, right?

229
00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:14.189
If that's the case,

230
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:18.789
they should've found a box cutter grip that reacted to the luminol.

231
00:13:18.789 --> 00:13:22.689
Okay. Pops, slash back at her.

232
00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:23.689
I guess so.

233
00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:25.089
See?

234
00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:26.989
Hey...

235
00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:30.089
First of all, you're going to have to look for the box cutter grip.

236
00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:32.789
-Oh, no. -Hey, Conan.

237
00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:34.989
Just what are you doing here?

238
00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:36.389
Well...

239
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:37.689
Oh, right.

240
00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:40.889
Ran, do you have something sticky like gum?

241
00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:41.989
Huh?

242
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:44.789
Sticky like gum?

243
00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:46.289
I have some gum

244
00:13:46.289 --> 00:13:48.989
that Dad wanted me to bring along to keep him from getting sleepy.

245
00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:50.289
I see!

246
00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:52.289
Masking tape!

247
00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:54.889
If you wrap the box cutter grip from the end of the blade

248
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:57.289
connected to the handle with masking tape,

249
00:13:57.289 --> 00:14:00.789
then blood won't splatter onto the grip.

250
00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:04.389
After committing the murder, the masking tape was removed.

251
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:07.789
And the tape was probably pasted onto the floor of the filming site.

252
00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:12.689
There were masking tape pasted all over the floor as indicators there,

253
00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:15.589
so it would be very inconspicuous, too.

254
00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:16.889
But...

255
00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:20.189
But why would Mr. Nagumo do something like that?

256
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:24.189
Even I, the first one to find the body could've rigged the trick, too!

257
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:25.989
I could've used snow to move everyone away,

258
00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:28.889
and committed the murder myself!

259
00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:31.789
Don't be ridiculous! You could never kill somebody.

260
00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:34.289
Darn it. She sure is a tough one.

261
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:37.889
Sorry, Conan. It seems that I left the gum in the car.

262
00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:39.889
Ran.

263
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:44.289
How do you wear brassieres?

264
00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:47.389
I never used them, so I don't know how to use them!

265
00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:52.789
Hey! Boys don't have to know how to use them.

266
00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:54.689
I guess so.

267
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:56.189
Rurippe.

268
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:58.789
You could never have committed this crime.

269
00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:00.489
Why not?

270
00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:01.889
Then, tell me

271
00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:05.889
how would you hide the blade of a cutter inside this lighter?

272
00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:07.689
I just put it inside the lid and...

273
00:15:12.089 --> 00:15:14.389
There's nothing inside the lid.

274
00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:19.789
Then, your deduction must've been wrong, Kogoro.

275
00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:23.489
Maybe you're wrong about Mr. Nagumo being the killer.

276
00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:24.989
Rurippe.

277
00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:26.989
For a lighter like this,

278
00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:31.489
you add oil to the cotton that is in here.

279
00:15:31.489 --> 00:15:33.589
First, you remove the bottom

280
00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:37.689
and take out the cotton that is inside and make space.

281
00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:40.389
Otherwise, you cannot hide the blade of the cutter.

282
00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:44.189
Since I smoke, I realized when the lighter didn't light,

283
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:47.789
it means that the cotton must've been removed.

284
00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:51.289
But since you don't like cigarettes and have never used a lighter,

285
00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:55.289
you would never even think of hiding something in a place like this.

286
00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:56.989
So, the only person that can think of something like this,

287
00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:00.689
as well as someone that you would want to protect

288
00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:04.989
is Mr. Akira Nagumo who used to be a heavy smoker in the past.

289
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:08.289
That's why I just said a while ago, didn't I?

290
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:12.089
Why would I have to protect Mr. Nagumo?

291
00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:15.089
Well, it's true that I've met him sometimes at work,

292
00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:16.989
but I'm not all that intimate with him.

293
00:16:16.989 --> 00:16:19.289
I wonder about that.

294
00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:21.189
He's your...

295
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.089
Lover, lover.

296
00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.589
Because he's your real father.

297
00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:30.489
Is that true?

298
00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:36.189
Nothing that was used to commit the murder

299
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:39.289
seems to have been prepared ahead of time.

300
00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:43.889
It was probably something that occurred on impulse.

301
00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.289
As for the cotton with oil on it,

302
00:16:46.289 --> 00:16:47.989
he probably pasted masking tape over it

303
00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:50.789
and hid it somewhere on the floor of the filming site,

304
00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:53.789
but it would probably be easily found if searched for.

305
00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:57.489
Besides, after committing the murder,

306
00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:00.289
it would be impossible to remove the cotton from the lighter

307
00:17:00.289 --> 00:17:03.089
and putting the blades of the cutter into it with gloved hands,

308
00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:06.289
with the risk of somebody walking in anytime.

309
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:10.289
So, I'm sure that we'll be able to find fingerprints somewhere.

310
00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:13.489
So, before any evidence comes up,

311
00:17:13.489 --> 00:17:15.489
persuade your father to turn himself in.

312
00:17:17.889 --> 00:17:20.189
That's right, Kogoro.

313
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:24.189
Akira Nagumo is my real father.

314
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:26.389
I was born when my mother and he

315
00:17:26.389 --> 00:17:29.489
used to be no-name actors at an acting school.

316
00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:31.889
My mother found out she was pregnant

317
00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:33.789
only after she split with my father

318
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:37.989
and started going out with my present father that you know, Kogoro.

319
00:17:39.889 --> 00:17:43.489
It never even crossed my mind

320
00:17:43.489 --> 00:17:45.289
until we acted in a film together

321
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:49.589
and he mentioned that I looked exactly like his lover in the past.

322
00:17:51.189 --> 00:17:53.889
After I heard of the truth from my mother,

323
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:58.289
I went to complain to him because he called ask to see me.

324
00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.589
I wasn't going to have him saying that he was my father.

325
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.689
Then, he broke down in tears before me.

326
00:18:06.989 --> 00:18:09.789
So, I used to meet him now and then from that time.

327
00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:16.489
A father is a father after all.

328
00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:22.089
He killed Mr. Kazami for me.

329
00:18:22.089 --> 00:18:25.589
If people found out that he's my real father,

330
00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:28.989
my whole family would turn out a mess.

331
00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:33.989
That's why, Kogoro...

332
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:36.489
I'd like you to keep this all inside you.

333
00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:40.289
Because after all, we are childhood friends.

334
00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:41.689
Please.

335
00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.989
No way.

336
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:49.589
Being that you're the one asking me to do so,

337
00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:53.889
the more I can't accept the deal.

338
00:18:53.889 --> 00:18:55.889
I don't want you, my childhood friend to be bound

339
00:18:55.889 --> 00:19:00.689
by such a painful and sad lie for the rest of your life.

340
00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:06.889
Just as expected of you, Kogoro.

341
00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:09.789
You haven't changed at all, your kind heart.

342
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:11.689
Shut up.

343
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:13.789
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

344
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:15.989
Because he was the one who called you

345
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.889
and told you that he was my real father from his side.

346
00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:20.189
No.

347
00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:23.289
Mr. Nagumo said nothing of that sort back then.

348
00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:24.389
Huh?

349
00:19:24.389 --> 00:19:27.489
Then, how did you know that we were father and daughter?

350
00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:31.689
I figured it out from how he acted back then.

351
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:33.489
The hostility I felt from him back then was not of a man who was upset

352
00:19:33.489 --> 00:19:36.689
over another guy making passes at his lover,

353
00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:38.489
but rather similar to what I felt

354
00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:39.789
when I went to introduce myself to Eri's father.

355
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:42.989
In other words, the feelings of a worried father.

356
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:48.989
Gosh. So, it's Eri after all.

357
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:51.689
I can never out beat her.

358
00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:53.189
No, not her.

359
00:19:53.189 --> 00:19:56.889
I remembered her stubborn father and...

360
00:19:56.889 --> 00:20:00.089
Hey, do you know why I was studying so hard,

361
00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:04.089
and wearing those thick lens glasses during junior high school?

362
00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:07.189
It's because I wanted to attract someone's attention.

363
00:20:07.189 --> 00:20:10.589
I was under the mistaken impression that you liked smart girls.

364
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.789
Huh?

365
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:14.689
Thirty minutes later,

366
00:20:14.689 --> 00:20:16.889
through Ruri's persuasion,

367
00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:19.189
Mr.Nagumo turned himself in.

368
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:23.889
The actual detective drama that occurred came to an end.

369
00:21:57.089 --> 00:21:59.389
So, you've met Ruri.

370
00:21:59.389 --> 00:22:01.889
She was more beautiful than she looks on TV, wasn't she?

371
00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:06.789
Huh? Did you know that she is Ruri Ujo, the actress?

372
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:08.289
Yes, of course.

373
00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:12.489
Because unlike him, I attend the class reunions.

374
00:22:13.989 --> 00:22:17.389
Right, I heard a lot about you two from Ms. Ujo.

375
00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:21.789
About Dad and you getting into a big fight over shoyu or sauce.

376
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:23.289
He got me angry

377
00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:26.589
because he used to always pour sauce over his sunny side up too,

378
00:22:26.589 --> 00:22:28.689
but just because he was embarrassed to say the same thing as I did,

379
00:22:28.689 --> 00:22:32.189
he insisted that he wanted shoyu!

380
00:22:32.189 --> 00:22:33.589
Oh, I see.

381
00:22:33.589 --> 00:22:37.489
Come to think of it, Dad always pours sauce over his sunny side up.

382
00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:42.289
He's just that dense of a person.

383
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:44.489
Then, why'd you marry him?

384
00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:48.589
It's been so long ago that I've already forgotten.

385
00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:52.089
Which gloves do you think are better?

386
00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:55.689
Let's see... I like the black.

387
00:22:55.689 --> 00:23:00.089
Oh, my. I prefer this gray one.

388
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.389
Really?

389
00:23:01.389 --> 00:23:03.289
Because it's the gray color of a mouse.

390
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:07.389
Doesn't it make you feel warm?

391
00:23:07.389 --> 00:23:08.789
Huh?

392
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:14.089
Because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

393
00:23:17.889 --> 00:23:20.089
Oh, did I say something funny?

394
00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:22.289
No, you didn't.

395
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:26.689
Hey, what's going on? What a weird kid.

396
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:31.989
"Mouri Detective Agency"

397
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:41.489
What a strange old man.

398
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:46.989
"Next Episode" -He could've been kidnapped.

399
00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:48.289
No way.

400
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:51.889
Rather with that guy, anything is possible.

401
00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:54.489
I saw a guy with a mustache at Mr. Itakura's office.

402
00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:57.489
He was a big man wearing all black outfit with a Kansai accent.

403
00:23:58.789 --> 00:24:00.489
Then, don't tell me that this is...

404
00:24:00.489 --> 00:24:04.289
Yes. This is in a case within the range of our profession.

405
00:24:04.289 --> 00:24:06.189
A homicide.

406
00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:07.989
Oh, no.

407
00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:13.489
