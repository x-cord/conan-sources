1
00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:02.424
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:04.224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:05.824
What is the dying message?

4
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:07.924
There's something we're missing.

5
00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:09.424
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:11.324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.824
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.870
While we were at the cafe with teacher, Ms. Jodie,

9
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.270
all the lights in the building went out.

10
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.370
And after the blackout,

11
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.570
the dead body holding an envelope was

12
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.070
found by an escalator near the cafe!

13
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.170
The victim was Mr. Katsunori Nakajo,

14
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.470
the manager of a detective agency.

15
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.570
His dying message as written with his own blood

16
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.470
on the envelope.

17
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.070
But, the murderer pulled the document out of it.

18
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.170
And...

19
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.070
Inspector, we've found another character written with blood!

20
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.270
What?

21
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.570
A square?

22
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.870
It also looks like a Kanji character, mouth

23
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.570
or "ro" in the Katakana alphabet.

24
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.270
But judging from the previous circle, cross and triangle,

25
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.770
is most likely to be a square.

26
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.770
Well... I'm more confused than ever now.

27
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.870
Isn't that square...

28
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.770
a little bigger than the other circle, cross and triangle?

29
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.770
"Hide, Hurry up and Abbreviate it (Part 2)"

30
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.570
Hey! Ran!

31
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.670
What?

32
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.570
We can make a character by combining two

33
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.070
of the marks-the circle, cross and triangle, can't we?

34
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.270
For a example,

35
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.070
combining the cross and the square would create

36
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.270
the word for rice field.

37
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.170
Yeah.

38
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.570
If so, this Mr. Hari is very suspicious.

39
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.470
And this last name is very unique.

40
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.870
But how about this Mr. Nawata?

41
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.870
His last name has three parts containing the same word!

42
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.070
Mr. Asai also has a unique shape of two overlapping crosses!

43
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.970
Shape?

44
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.770
Yeah, that's it! It's a shape!

45
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.770
For example,

46
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.570
think about the word "Suzu" in Mr. Suzuki's.

47
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.070
It has a round shape. So, could indicate Mr. Suzuki.

48
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.370
How rude!

49
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.970
I'm a Suzuki too!

50
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.870
There are no bad people by the name of Suzuki!

51
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.270
Oh, but...

52
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.470
Anyway, leave it to us, the police.

53
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.770
And stay away from the crime scene, okay?

54
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.270
Come on.

55
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.970
Takagi! You go ahead

56
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.670
and help Chiba search and help Chiba the upper floors.

57
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.070
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.970
I have to tell dad

59
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.270
that I'm going to be late!

60
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.970
Hello.. Chiba?

61
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.670
Where are you now?

62
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.470
The eighth floor?

63
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.170
Yeah, Inspector told me to go help you.

64
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.370
Yeah.

65
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.870
All right! Just hold on.

66
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.570
I'll be right up there!

67
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.670
All right.

68
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.470
Wait...

69
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.470
Ran, what's wrong?

70
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.070
What is it?

71
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.570
What is that "X"?

72
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.170
What?

73
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.770
You know. You said a little while ago...

74
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.170
You said it's a tease.

75
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.170
Oh, well. Yumi often puts "XXX" at the end of the mail

76
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.170
to tease me.

77
00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.870
Well, Ran, just you wait.

78
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.370
Someday, sooner or later you'll see what "X" means.

79
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.470
Right now! Tell me right now!

80
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.370
Please. Detective Takagi!

81
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.070
Ran.

82
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.970
That's...

83
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.070
Fine.

84
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.370
Ms. Mouri, is sure taking a long time to come back.

85
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.070
That brat has gone somewhere, too.

86
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.070
Oh! You mean that cool kid.

87
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.070
-He's over there! -I'm sorry.

88
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.570
Gosh.

89
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.670
Hey! Cool kid!

90
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.170
You look like an Ostrich.

91
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.070
What? An Ostrich?

92
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.170
The meaning of the circle, cross and triangle...

93
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.070
Have you figured it out yet?

94
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.470
Not, yet.

95
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.870
Not at all.

96
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.770
Well, as Ran said,

97
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.970
don't you think that those shapes

98
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.570
may be representing something else?

99
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.270
Let me see. For example,

100
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.070
the department of defense in America

101
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.370
is called the Pentagon.

102
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.570
That is because the actually building itself

103
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.470
is a pentagon.

104
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.970
In the U.S., there are many words that represent something

105
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.370
other than it's original meaning!

106
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.670
The White House means the Presidential residence,

107
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.870
while the word the Oval Office refers to

108
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.870
the official office of the President of the United States.

109
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.870
And there is another word,

110
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.070
Bureau, that originally means an office.

111
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.770
But the word as it stands alone,

112
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.270
it often means F. B. I.

113
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.770
Which is an abbreviation for the Federal Bureau of Investigation!

114
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.370
Was my advice any good to you, cool kid?

115
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.270
Yeah.

116
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.970
By the way, what did you mean

117
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.170
when you said the word, Ostrich?

118
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.370
Oh! I was talking about you, cool kid!

119
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.270
The officer caught you even though you were hiding yourself

120
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.470
behind the suitcase.

121
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.970
We, Americans, call such dorks Ostrich.

122
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.170
Once he sticks his small head into the sand,

123
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.270
the ostrich usually fails to realize what remains exposed

124
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.670
and thinks he can't be seen because he can't see!

125
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.070
There is a similar expression in Japan here!

126
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.670
That is, Hiding your head but leaving your rear end exposed!

127
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.870
Hiding the head but leaving the rear end exposed?

128
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.370
Let me see the envelope for a second!

129
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.570
Hey, you!

130
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.270
Now I see.

131
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.070
So that explains it.

132
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.770
There's no doubt!

133
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.570
Among those 31 suspects, that person...

134
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.070
is the culprit!

135
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.470
I understand.

136
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.570
We will send investigators there right away.

137
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.170
Yes.

138
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.970
Now, please don't touch the manager's computer anymore.

139
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.070
Well then...

140
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.470
What's going on?

141
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.170
Nothing.

142
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.570
The victim killed was the director of a detective agency

143
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.170
and the culprit is most likely to be

144
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.970
the embezzler of the company he was investigating.

145
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.770
So that's why I inquired at the agency,

146
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.770
just hoping to find someone who worked with him

147
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.770
and can tell us the name of the embezzler.

148
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.470
And then?

149
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.470
Unfortunately, Mr. Nakajo was working on this case alone

150
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.570
and kept it in strict confidence.

151
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.770
So none of his employees know anything about the case.

152
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.770
And our last hope is the data stored on his computer.

153
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.270
But no one can access it without the password.

154
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.970
Password.

155
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.270
That's it. That's the password!

156
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.970
The circle, cross, triangle and square.

157
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.670
Isn't that his password?

158
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.270
Yeah, I thought so too

159
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.570
and asked the agency staff to enter the password box,

160
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.270
but it failed.

161
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.870
But...

162
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.270
Of course, they tried all 24 possible combinations.

163
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.370
They couldn't make it.

164
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.370
Then, could the circle, cross, triangle, square

165
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.570
be the name of the culprit?

166
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.870
Isn't that about Quiz?

167
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.370
-What? -Japanese Quiz Show

168
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.970
often uses those marks

169
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.370
instead of answering Yes or No.

170
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.270
Oh... I see. It's like that!

171
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.970
So... Is the culprit the King of Quiz?

172
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.670
Yeah. Could be.

173
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.870
Anyway, you just stay still here and keep quiet!

174
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.670
Don't interfere in this case anymore.

175
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.070
But, if the the circle, cross, triangle and square

176
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.670
is the name of the culprit

177
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.670
then Officer Chiba could also be a suspect?

178
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.770
What?

179
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.070
Because just look at the character of Officer Chiba.

180
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.270
It looks like a cross if I hide it like this.

181
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.270
And it looks like a triangle if I hide it like this!

182
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.770
Don't you think he is also very suspicious!

183
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.270
Hide?

184
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.570
Look at that! If you look at it that way,

185
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.970
Officer Takagi could be a suspect too.

186
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.370
What?

187
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.570
Look! The word "Taka" of Officer Takagi's name!

188
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.370
It looks like both a square or a circle if I hide it like this!

189
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.070
I understand it looks like square

190
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.270
but why does it look like a circle?

191
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.470
Because there are some people who write "mouth" as a circle.

192
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.670
Dr. Agasa also often writes in that way

193
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.370
when he writes his name.

194
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.570
Dr. Agasa said it's okay to abbreviate something sometimes,

195
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.670
particularly when you're in a hurry.

196
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.970
Hide it.

197
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.270
Hurry it up and abbreviate it

198
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.870
Hey, come on! Officer Chiba and Officer Takagi,

199
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.470
both came here because I called them!

200
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.870
Both of them can't be the culprit.

201
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.570
Hey! Are you listening to me?

202
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.070
Oh, wait a minute.

203
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.970
There is someone

204
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.670
on the suspect list.

205
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.270
I think...

206
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.670
This is it!

207
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.920
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.320
There is someone

209
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.020
on the suspect list.

210
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.320
I think...

211
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.720
This is it!

212
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.020
It's Bunta Kuniyoshi!

213
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.820
Bunta Kuniyoshi?

214
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Ah, that's right.

215
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.620
Well, then how does he become

216
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.720
the circle, cross, triangle and square?

217
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.120
There appears to be no connection between those two.

218
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.220
But, if you hide the top halves of the three characters...

219
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.420
See? These characters become the symbols.

220
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.120
Oh, yes!

221
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.820
They sure are the circle, cross, triangle and square!

222
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.120
But don't you think that

223
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.620
it is difficult to look upon the character

224
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.820
Sonoko! You're...

225
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.620
The character doesn't look like a triangle when it is printed,

226
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.120
but if it were hand-written

227
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.720
and the dot are elongated,

228
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.520
then wouldn't it look like a triangle?

229
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.120
But why were the top halves hidden?

230
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.120
They weren't hidden

231
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.720
but they were removed.

232
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.220
Don't you remember that

233
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.920
the characters were written down at the edge of the envelope?

234
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.520
And that the square, which was discovered later,

235
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.620
was one size larger than any other marks.

236
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.820
This means that the three characters other than the square

237
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.720
were written across both the envelope

238
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.120
and a sheet of paper sticking out of the envelope.

239
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.420
And the murderer took the documents

240
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.820
including the sheet of paper

241
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.620
with the top halves of the three characters written on it.

242
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.420
And how about the square?

243
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.320
Well, of course, it's the "kuni" of his name.

244
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.120
If the victim had written it in a hurry

245
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.220
before the culprit noticed him doing so,

246
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.520
it is quite reasonable to think that he abbreviated it.

247
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.820
Now I've got it!

248
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.520
It's true!

249
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.120
Yeah, I've seen people

250
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.020
who abbreviate to shorthand dictation!

251
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.220
Great!

252
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.420
You're just like Jules Maigret

253
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.120
straight coming out of the novel.

254
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.720
Oh, Come on!

255
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.720
Now we know who the culprit is.

256
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.220
Let's go get him on the upper floor.

257
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.120
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

258
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.920
Oh, it's this late already.

259
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.120
I wonder where Ms. Mouri is.

260
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.720
Maybe she's asking Shinichi

261
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.120
about the meaning of the "X" on the phone.

262
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.920
Yeah! As I suggested,

263
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.620
if he gets the answer right, she may give him her special "X".

264
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.620
Well, well, I will give my cherished "X" to him.

265
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.320
Sonoko!

266
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.120
I have asked Detective Takagi

267
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.020
about the meaning of "X"!

268
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.620
I see.

269
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.920
How could you?

270
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.320
If I say that I'd give him my "X",

271
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.120
Shinichi wouldn't answer even if he knew the answer.

272
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.020
Well, I bet he doesn't know the answer

273
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.020
because he knows very little

274
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.520
about this sort of thing.

275
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.320
By the way, I wonder where is Conan?

276
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.120
What? Oh, don't tell me he is missing again!

277
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.120
That little brat is always going straying off somewhere!

278
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.720
Kuniyoshi?

279
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.520
Oh, yes. He's here!

280
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.820
Hey, Kuniyoshi!

281
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.620
What is it?

282
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.720
Sorry to bother you

283
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.520
but we have questions to ask you.

284
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.720
Could you come with us to another room, please?

285
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.920
That's...

286
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.320
No problem.

287
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.620
A shredder!

288
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.120
Okay.

289
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.320
And you're saying that...

290
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.220
"Square, circle, cross, triangle".

291
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.120
Those marks signifies my name

292
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.620
"Bunta Kuniyoshi" -if you add those missing parts to them?

293
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.820
Yes, exactly.

294
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.920
But, Inspector?

295
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.720
It seems too hasty to conclude based only on the deduction,

296
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.120
that I am the culprit. Don't you think so?

297
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.020
Yet, that is his dying message!

298
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.120
Well, look at it this way.

299
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.820
The murderer might have written those bloody marks

300
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.720
with that old man's finger,

301
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.320
trying to put the guilt on me!

302
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.120
So, if you want to grill me,

303
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.820
you go find the missing document

304
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.220
and show it to me first!

305
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.520
Let's say, if I were the culprit,

306
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.320
I wouldn't stay in this building

307
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.720
where the murder was committed,

308
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.420
but run away outside and try to burn the papers.

309
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.520
That's why you destroyed them with the shredder, right?

310
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.120
But it was much easier than a jigsaw puzzle to put together

311
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.520
because of the red marks.

312
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.220
Right, Officer Takagi?

313
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.120
Yeah.

314
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.420
Here it is.

315
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.520
Oh, you've found it!

316
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.520
Yes!

317
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.520
It wasn't too difficult to find shreds of paper with blood on it

318
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.720
and then piece them together.

319
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.420
They correctly matched the characters on the envelope!

320
00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.820
So, there is no doubt that these bloody characters

321
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.120
signify Bunta Kuniyoshi.

322
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.720
"Bunta"

323
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.820
As you've already identified the shredder,

324
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.120
if you spend a little extra time,

325
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.420
you can put the remaining pieces together, right?

326
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.420
Yes! And since we've also found the murderers cast-off gloves

327
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.120
at a rest room on the way to this office,

328
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.120
if Mr. Kuniyoshi put the papers into the shredder himself,

329
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.420
we can detect his fingerprints attached to them.

330
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.620
Circle, cross and triangle.

331
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.020
Now I see.

332
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.620
I had the nicknames of Big Mouth

333
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:43.020
and Circle, Cross and Triangle when I was in college.

334
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.220
But back then I didn't know why they called me by these names.

335
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.920
So that explains it.

336
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.320
I started embezzling from the company

337
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.920
because I really wanted to give my family a better life,

338
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.320
not one that was all mouth.

339
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.720
But once I made it, I just couldn't stop myself.

340
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.220
After all, I have a big mouth, I know it.

341
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.420
All evil comes from the mouth.

342
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.920
Oh, the police arrested the guy already?

343
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.720
Yeah, he was taken to the police just now through the back door.

344
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.820
Hey...

345
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.320
Now, you gotta tell me!

346
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.320
What's the "X" anyway?

347
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.520
Oh, do you still wanna know?

348
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.520
Yeah.

349
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.220
If you really want to know about it,

350
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.920
ask Ran!

351
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.320
Look! She's tapping out an e-mail over there.

352
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.620
So hurry

353
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:49.620
and come back!

354
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.120
Hey! What does the "X" mean?

355
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.620
Sonoko told me to ask you!

356
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.920
It's not good for you.

357
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.820
No...

358
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.120
Not good?

359
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.420
Oh, yeah! The "X" means "no good"!

360
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.720
See you then, Ms. Mouri and Ms. Suzuki!

361
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.920
Watch out for the stalker!

362
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.120
-We will, Ms. Jodie! -We will, Ms. Jodie!

363
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:46.520
Is it almost time to pick the apple?

364
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.120
Hey, Sato, Yamamoto and Kobayashi!

365
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
Are you all right, Mr. Tozawa?

366
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.320
Shut up!

367
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.620
I got a mail.

368
00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.920
It's from Ran.

369
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.520
Today, I got involved in an incident again!

370
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.020
Maybe, I must be...

371
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.120
I must be cursed!

372
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.720
I know you want to hear more about the case.

373
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.820
I'll let you know the details later.

374
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.920
So hurry and come back!

375
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.420
XXX.

376
00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.320
What's this?

377
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.920
Does this mean I am three times "no good"?

378
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.620
Can you tell me, please, Gin?

379
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.920
Do you believe in heaven?

380
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.020
You may say coldly...

381
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.220
"It's not like you to be so silly".

382
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.820
Please find the answer.

383
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:19.120
Until we exchange our glasses filled with rotten sherry.

384
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.820
I can't wait.

385
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.720
XXX.

386
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.720
Well, "X" means a kiss.

387
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.320
It's a feminine expression of affection.

388
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.020
But it could be also...

389
00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.920
a sign of hatred.

390
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.820
Sure.

391
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.520
X also means the target.

392
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.020
With the silver arrow is shot.

393
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.520
"Next Episode"

394
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.220
What? Ayumi?

395
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.220
She said she's meeting a guy called Bruce or Jackie

396
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.520
at the park!

397
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.720
Hey! You spilled something on your clothes.

398
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.220
What's this?

399
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.620
Blood stains!

400
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.020
"Next Conan"

401
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.141
"Riddle Granny Disappearance Case"

402
00:24:35.638 --> 00:24:38.038
Next Conan Hint:

403
00:24:38.038 --> 00:24:40.038
"Cat"
