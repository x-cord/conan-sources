1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,340
"Kuwanoki High School"

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
Oh?

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,140
Eimi?

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm sorry. Wrong person.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,640
She practices fencing.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,140
Oh, how cool.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,040
I wonder which way.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,940
Maybe it's faster we ask?

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,540
They'll find out that we snuck in here if we do, stupid.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,840
Hey, hey.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,340
Sonoko, I don't think we should be doing this.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,840
Yep, bummers. I'm going to be late.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,740
Sonoko!

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,540
"Eimi Chikada (17), Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student"

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,940
Eimi?

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
"Weavers' Club" -Over here!

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,540
Are you all right, Eimi?

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Her hair... How cruel!

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,440
Who did this to you?

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,040
I was suddenly attacked from behind.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,540
I didn't see the face.

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,140
You won't get away with this!

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,740
Watch out both of you!

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,340
We couldn't find the perp after all.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,940
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,440
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,940
A love consultation club receives letters of upcoming crimes.

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,540
His name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:49,236
"Welcome to the Weaver's Club"

32
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:53,936
The incident had already occurred three days ago and yesterday...

33
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,036
"Three Days Ago"

34
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,136
"Megumi Godai (16), Kuwanoki High School Second Year Student"

35
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,736
"Yesterday"

36
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:04,836
"Chie Tamai (18)" -Furthermore, there was

37
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,436
"Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student" -a warning before it happened.

38
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:09,236
"July 8, MG will suffer my wrath!"

39
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:11,436
The date was when the incident occurred.

40
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:12,736
"July 10, CT will face retribution!"

41
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:16,136
The alphabets were the initials of the victims.

42
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:20,136
The letter was delivered to the Weavers' Club.

43
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:23,836
A love advice club at the school that Eimi had opened

44
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,936
with a few of her classmates.

45
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:30,136
They took after the Juliet Club that actually existed in Italy.

46
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,036
In this day and age instead of using text mail,

47
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,036
the fact that they accepted giving advice only through postal mail

48
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:39,036
seem to have made it popular among the girl students.

49
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,936
And this morning, again...

50
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:45,636
"July 11, EC will be brought to justice!"

51
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,336
The date was today.

52
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:51,636
Initials "EC". Eimi Chikada, thinking it referred to her,

53
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:53,736
came to ask advice from Sonoko,

54
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:57,336
who she had befriended where she part-timed.

55
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,036
No way!

56
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,636
Hot red pepper and toy spiders maybe,

57
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,536
-but to cut the hair of a girl -This should do it.

58
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:07,436
-is definitely a crime! An assault! -Thanks so much.

59
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,536
Yeah, true.

60
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:11,336
Then, let's report it to the police right away.

61
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:12,936
-Wait! -Please wait.

62
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,836
I'll take care of this case... What?

63
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:19,736
I'm sorry. I just remembered this.

64
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,736
Don't tell me it's from the perp.

65
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:22,836
Show it to me!

66
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,536
"Today at sundown, TB will die!"

67
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,836
What?

68
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,036
At sundown?

69
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,736
In about two hours.

70
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:36,436
What now, Sonoko?

71
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,736
We can't be waiting for the police.

72
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,536
I'll nab the perp

73
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:43,936
and save this person with initials "TB"!

74
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,736
What's wrong, Conan?

75
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,136
No, it's nothing.

76
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:55,136
So, off we go!

77
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:58,636
Now that the case had escalated to demanding a time limit,

78
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:02,236
it could no longer be considered a mere prank.

79
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,236
However, we could not get a hold

80
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:05,836
of the personal list of the students due to privacy issues,

81
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:08,736
So we decided to go around asking the students directly.

82
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,236
If the "T" of "TB", stands for the first name of a person,

83
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:17,636
there are quite a few, such as Tae, Takako, Tamami, and Toshiko.

84
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,336
If "B" stands for the surname, there shouldn't be all that many.

85
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,336
In fact,

86
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:25,236
we were immediately able to find the names Baba, Bando and Bito,

87
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,936
but none of them could think of being a target,

88
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,636
nor did they know about the Weavers' Club.

89
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,536
Oh, no!

90
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,536
We have less than one hour to go before sundown.

91
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:40,336
Eimi.

92
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:42,836
Sonoko, don't you think it's better

93
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,236
we contact the police even from now?

94
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,536
If something happens, it could be a disaster.

95
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,136
That's true, but...

96
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:51,536
Okay!

97
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:56,636
Let me start over from scratch.

98
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:59,236
Something bothered me here.

99
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:00,536
That's...

100
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,836
Right. One of it was the hair that was stuck to the window sill.

101
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:13,436
Maybe?

102
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,436
I found it!

103
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,136
Just as I thought.

104
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:21,836
The other is...

105
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,136
that.

106
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,336
I found it.

107
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,436
"Chie Tamai, Megumi Godai" -It's the first and second victims.

108
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,336
This is...

109
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,436
"Dear Romeo"

110
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,236
Hey! Just what're you doing, kid?

111
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:45,636
Oh, no!

112
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,536
No, Conan.

113
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,636
You shouldn't read the letters of other people.

114
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:58,436
I'm sorry. I wanted to help too.

115
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,736
Eimi, who's Romeo?

116
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:16,336
"Yuto Kariya (17), Kuwanoki High School Third Year Student"

117
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,136
Oh, Romeo.

118
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,036
Why oh why art thou, Romeo?

119
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,336
Oh, my God. He ignored me.

120
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,436
Just as expected of

121
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:36,336
the most handsome valedictorian of the school, Yuto Kariya!

122
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:37,436
I've seen loads of letters

123
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:41,836
written by girls' love sick over you delivered to you.

124
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:44,536
That's only natural for you, isn't it?

125
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:50,736
-What? -Where were you an hour ago?

126
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:56,636
You cut her hair in the Weavers' Club room, right?

127
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:02,936
Just what on earth are you talking about?

128
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,236
One hour ago, I was...

129
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:07,136
"I found your cutter knife."

130
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,136
"Meet me behind the gym so I can return it to you."

131
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:14,936
It's the same handwriting as the other letters.

132
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,136
Did you go?

133
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:18,836
It's true that I lost my cutter knife.

134
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,936
It was too much trouble to buy another one, so...

135
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,136
And?

136
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:24,336
I waited about five minutes but nobody came

137
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,336
so I came back here.

138
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,636
That's it.

139
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,636
You expect me to believe that?

140
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,036
You're acting it all out alone, right?

141
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,536
In order to establish an alibi?

142
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,236
Think as you wish.

143
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:37,436
I don't need to have you guys believe me.

144
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:41,136
Is that all? I've got no time to be fooling around.

145
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:44,336
You're trying for a state university, right?

146
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,536
What? Yeah.

147
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,236
That's why you're wasting my time.

148
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,536
You're honestly a nuisance.

149
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:54,036
Scram, 'cos you get on my nerves.

150
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,028
All set, he's the perp.

151
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,728
Really, Sonoko?

152
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:14,728
He really pisses me off. What an attitude!

153
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,928
That makes him a perp?

154
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,328
His personality is the pits! He's the perp!

155
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,328
Cool it, Sonoko.

156
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,728
You didn't write letters concerning Romeo, Eimi?

157
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,528
What?

158
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:36,728
Oh, I see. Because Romeo is what the victims have in common.

159
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:41,328
No, because I'm the one who's asked for advice.

160
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:42,528
Besides...

161
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:45,728
You'd never fall for a guy like him, would you?

162
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,228
Oh, no. We don't have time.

163
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:52,228
We've got to go find proof that he's the perp.

164
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,228
I was never even worth noticing.

165
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:58,028
Hey, Sonoko. Weren't we going to look for "TB"?

166
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,328
Since we can't find "TB"...

167
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,328
Rather, it's faster to nab the perp, right?

168
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,028
I guess so.

169
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,728
I was thinking,

170
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:11,728
I wonder if "TB" is really the initials of a victim.

171
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:15,128
What?

172
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:16,828
What do you mean, Conan?

173
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:19,528
Well, the Weaver's Club

174
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:23,828
took after the Juliet Club of Italy, right?

175
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,228
Yes, that's correct.

176
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,128
Maybe the alphabet in the letters also symbolizes

177
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:33,928
the characters that appear in Romeo and Juliet?

178
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,328
The "MG" in the first letter,

179
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,828
stand for the M and G in Romeo's family name Montague.

180
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,528
The second "CT" stand for

181
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:46,028
the C and T taken from Juliet's family name Capulet. If so then...

182
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:50,428
You really know the details, don't you? Precocious brat.

183
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:53,828
That's because I checked on it a bit.

184
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,028
See?

185
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,128
It's surprising you noticed, Conan.

186
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:05,328
Both families didn't allow the love between Romeo and Juliet.

187
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:09,428
Their only concern was their family's reputation.

188
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,028
I see!

189
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,228
That's why...

190
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:16,228
Rage and atonement.

191
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,228
Right.

192
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:20,428
Which means the "EC" in the third letter

193
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:23,028
does not only refer to Eimi?

194
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:26,228
EC...

195
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:30,228
I wonder if there was such a character in Romeo and Juliet?

196
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:36,528
Maybe it's the E and C that stand for Prince Escalus?

197
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:41,228
He exiled Romeo who was accused for homicide from the domain

198
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,828
is what's written here.

199
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,528
That's why he needs to be punished.

200
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,628
I remember.

201
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:52,528
I think it was that a friend is stabbed

202
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,428
because of the brawls between the two families,

203
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:57,228
and Romeo avenges his friend's death.

204
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:00,628
That friend's name I think was...

205
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:02,228
Mercutio.

206
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,328
Right! And the one who killed him was...

207
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,628
-Tybalt! -Tybalt!

208
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,828
Right, "TB"!

209
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:12,028
In other words,

210
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:17,328
"TB will die" means Romeo will kill Tybalt!

211
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,428
So, it's him after all.

212
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:22,028
He's the perp!

213
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:25,628
Wait, Sonoko! Then, who is "TB"?

214
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:28,128
That's...

215
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:31,328
We'll find out if we ask him!

216
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,528
Wait, Sonoko!

217
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,728
The restroom, maybe.

218
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,228
Hey!

219
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,628
He was called by the course advisor?

220
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:01,728
Yep, he wasn't called directly, but was texted.

221
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,628
Maybe that's...

222
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,928
Right! The same as the memo we saw a while ago.

223
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:18,928
He's establishing an alibi!

224
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:21,528
Where's Eimi?

225
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,728
Gee, where could she have gone at a time like this?

226
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:27,728
After we figured out who the perp is.

227
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,428
Conan's gone too.

228
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,528
That brat too?

229
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:42,828
Hey, Sonoko. How did Romeo kill Tybalt?

230
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,728
How...

231
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:51,628
Yeah, like that. Like when fencing, sword against sword.

232
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,328
What?

233
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,628
I almost forgot.

234
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,128
Eimi was selected for her talent at fencing

235
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:02,128
and in the school festival stage performance of Romeo and Juliet last year,

236
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,828
acted the role of Tybalt.

237
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:08,528
Which means she's "TB"?

238
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,328
Oh, no. Eimi will be killed by Romeo!

239
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,028
We've got to hurry and find her!

240
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:18,028
Eimi!

241
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,028
Did you find her?

242
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,828
Nope.

243
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:35,328
What?

244
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,528
Sonoko!

245
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,228
Eimi?

246
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:01,628
-Don't! -Run, Eimi!

247
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:04,928
No way.

248
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:11,728
What's going on, anyway?

249
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,328
Don't tell me...

250
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:16,028
Don't tell me that you deceived us, Eimi?

251
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,628
Deceived?

252
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,228
Did you use us?

253
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:26,828
What?

254
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:28,328
I don't get it.

255
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:33,328
Explain it so I understand, Eimi.

256
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,028
It... it's come.

257
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,028
It's here.

258
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:42,428
Sonoko.

259
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:45,828
Then, let me explain it to you.

260
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:48,828
Eimi, why did we meet today

261
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:52,328
at that given place and time to begin with?

262
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,328
What?

263
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,428
That's because...

264
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:58,128
Eimi told you to.

265
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:00,128
She also told you to be on time.

266
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,928
Did you forget, Sonoko?

267
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,528
I thought so.

268
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:05,528
Sonoko?

269
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,128
Oh, that's right.

270
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:13,228
And we saw you, Eimi, being attacked.

271
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:14,328
Was it a coincidence?

272
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,528
No, not so.

273
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:20,928
You deliberately showed it to us, who came on time, right?

274
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:24,028
You acted the whole thing out yourself.

275
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:25,328
What?

276
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:41,928
You stole it from Romeo, rather Yuto Kariya, right?

277
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,628
In order to set him up as the perp?

278
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,528
But if he were the perp,

279
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:49,328
he wouldn't have left it at the site.

280
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,928
That's why, Eimi,

281
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:54,228
you couldn't help but throw it out the window.

282
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:57,328
Well, if you use it later like this,

283
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,828
it was like killing two birds with one stone though.

284
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,528
Conan found the hole made below the window

285
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:05,328
by the cutter knife in the flower bed.

286
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,928
Of course, you're the only one

287
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,528
who could've thrown the cutter knife onto the flower bed

288
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:14,228
from where you were back then.

289
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:16,228
And now again,

290
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,328
you texted Yuto Kariya so he wouldn't have an alibi.

291
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:22,728
And after trying to make it look like he killed you,

292
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:26,228
you were going to commit suicide.

293
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:27,928
No.

294
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:32,928
You wrote all four letters, didn't you, Eimi?

295
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,228
You wanted everyone to think that

296
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:40,228
the incidents were playing out the story of Romeo and Juliet as planned.

297
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:43,128
Then, you wanted to fulfill your true motive of killing yourself

298
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:46,628
by weaving everything together.

299
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,028
Why on earth, Eimi?

300
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,628
Yeah.

301
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,328
Why involve me who had nothing to do with this?

302
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,428
Why?

303
00:18:57,528 --> 00:19:00,128
You forgot, didn't you?

304
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:02,728
What?

305
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:06,228
It was only a month ago and yet...

306
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,828
I conjured up all the courage I had

307
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:14,328
and asked if you would meet me, just the two of us,

308
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:17,328
and you responded.

309
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:21,428
I waited for a long time at the place you told me to wait.

310
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:27,528
I waited because I promised I would.

311
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:31,328
But you didn't come.

312
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,128
I figured you came up with something urgent.

313
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:36,428
Something you couldn't tell anybody about.

314
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:40,928
That's what I believed, until just the other day...

315
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:48,028
I was the one being laughed at.

316
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:50,428
That day, you placed a bet with your friends

317
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:52,728
on whether I would come or not and how long I would wait for you.

318
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:59,028
It took me a while to realize what was going on.

319
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,628
Because...

320
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:04,128
Because I believed in Romeo.

321
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,228
Unforgivable.

322
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:11,828
What're you talking about?

323
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,428
Romeo my foot?

324
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,128
Getting all drunk over some fairytale

325
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:16,628
is so stupid!

326
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,828
No, Eimi!

327
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:37,928
You... you don't have to kill yourself

328
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:40,528
or much less commit a crime for a guy like him.

329
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,828
He's not worth it!

330
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:49,528
But you wanted somebody to find out.

331
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,028
That's why you came to me.

332
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:53,228
You wanted me to stop you.

333
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:56,828
Isn't that what you wanted deep down inside, Eimi?

334
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,828
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,028
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:17,928
You'll be fine. Look.

337
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:21,528
Everybody's worried about you.

338
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:25,228
"Did you find TB? Please save them."

339
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:27,228
"I'm worried about TB. I asked around, but nobody knows who it is."

340
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,428
"Did you find TB? I'm asking my friends, but we can't find them."

341
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:32,628
Even the two you got involved texted you.

342
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:37,428
"We don't want 'TB' to experience something worse than us."

343
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:43,228
And I'm the one who did all this.

344
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:46,128
If you want to go apologize, we'll go with you.

345
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,528
Right, Sonoko?

346
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:49,028
Yeah, of...

347
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,728
Of course, Eimi!

348
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:28,328
Dad.

349
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,928
You ran out of beer and snacks,

350
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:31,528
so you want me to get them for you?

351
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:32,928
How would you like to have

352
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,628
a taste of my swift and skillful deduction solving technique?

353
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:39,028
Well, but I don't remember much of it again.

354
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:40,428
You heard?

355
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:44,428
Her deductive skills don't even come close to yours?

356
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:49,328
I mean, I'm the one doing the deduction for both of you.

357
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:55,128
"Next Episode"

358
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:56,828
I need to think.

359
00:23:56,828 --> 00:24:00,528
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

360
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,728
My captured rook will shatter your offense

361
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:06,228
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.
