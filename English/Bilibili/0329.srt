1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.340
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.340
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.040
The summer camp smells of crime.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.740
The Youth Detective Squad helps out a lot.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:43.267
Oh, hello, Megumi? It's me, Ayumi.

9
00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:47.467
Megumi, about next Saturday...

10
00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.767
I have something to do,

11
00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.567
but I'm supposed to be rabbit monitor that day,

12
00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.267
so I was wondering if you could change places with me.

13
00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.067
Oh, okay! You're going out with Conan, right?

14
00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:00.067
You're going camping with Conan and the others, right?

15
00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.967
Yeah, could you...

16
00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.467
Okay, I'll change with you!

17
00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.567
But promise that you'll tell me about your trip like always!

18
00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.867
Because every time you and Conan go out together,

19
00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:11.967
you get mixed up in a case of one kind or another.

20
00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:14.367
Okay! I'll tell you everything that goes on!

21
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.467
See you! Thank you! Megumi!

22
00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.067
All right!

23
00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:23.067
I get to go camping! I get to go camping Saturday and Sunday!

24
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:25.667
Oh, no.

25
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.767
I wonder why everybody seems to treat Haibara

26
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.767
as if she were an adult.

27
00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:36.967
Everybody tends to call her by her last name.

28
00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:39.267
I guess it can't be helped because people who transfer over

29
00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.467
from other schools seem mature.

30
00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:46.767
But, friends shouldn't discriminate!

31
00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.167
"I want to call Haibara by her first name, Ai"

32
00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:57.267
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 1)"

33
00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.967
Haibara and Doc are late.

34
00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.167
I wonder what's keeping them.

35
00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:05.767
Doc's probably taking his time getting ready again!

36
00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:09.367
Okay, when she comes out, I'm going to smile naturally

37
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.467
and say good morning to her and call her by her first name.

38
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:15.667
I wonder if she'll be offended.

39
00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:21.667
Oh, but she might just greet me intimately too.

40
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.667
But, in her case, most times not...

41
00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.867
Well, it doesn't matter if she greets me the same way or not!

42
00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:28.967
After all, we're friends!

43
00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.467
Oh, Doc! You're late!

44
00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.667
It's way past departure time!

45
00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:37.667
Sorry, sorry. It took a while for us to get prepared.

46
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:41.367
It's because you didn't get everything ready before going to sleep!

47
00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:42.967
You got me there.

48
00:03:42.967 --> 00:03:45.267
What you took time doing was not getting ready

49
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.667
but cleaning up, right?

50
00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.667
The minute I take my eyes off you, there are heaps of trash.

51
00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:50.967
Oh, good morning.

52
00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:54.767
Ai... Ah...

53
00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.567
Oh, I think you look so sleepy, Haibara.

54
00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.567
Sort of. Because I'm nocturnal.

55
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:07.167
Never mind.

56
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.667
I still have a lot of time left.

57
00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.667
Camping! Camping!

58
00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.667
Let's have a happy camping trip!

59
00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:18.467
Camping today and camping tomorrow!

60
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.167
Camping! Camping!

61
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:22.567
Hey, Doc.

62
00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.467
Did you find out the meaning of that diary?

63
00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:26.267
What diary?

64
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.667
The diary of Mr. Itakura, the computer programmer,

65
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.467
who was asked by the Men in Black

66
00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:35.067
to make some kind of system software!

67
00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:39.467
The diary that had the secret dealings of the Black Organization

68
00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:44.467
were written in invisible ink on the blank page.

69
00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:46.467
The meaning of the mysterious last word

70
00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:49.667
that was written inside!

71
00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.767
Oh, you mean the words...

72
00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:58.067
"We are trying to revive the dead"?

73
00:04:58.067 --> 00:05:02.867
I have no idea what those words mean

74
00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.767
but I've found out that the woman hates cats!

75
00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.167
She hates cats?

76
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:11.467
I stopped reading then, because Ai came along,

77
00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:14.667
but there was a continuation to that diary.

78
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:17.467
"After she finished saying so,"

79
00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:20.567
"the meowing of the cat started getting louder behind her."

80
00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:23.067
"The woman started to panic a bit and hung up the phone."

81
00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:24.467
That's what was written.

82
00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:26.767
That's like knowing nothing at all.

83
00:05:26.767 --> 00:05:31.967
She could've hung up because her cat frolicked with her.

84
00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:35.267
There are also people who are allergic to cats, right?

85
00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:41.767
Only if you knew more about Haibara's father, Dr. Atsushi Miyano.

86
00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.367
Atsushi Miyano?

87
00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:47.167
I know Dr. Miyano.

88
00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.967
I think I met him once or twice at the invention announcement site.

89
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:52.867
You mean you know the mad scientist

90
00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:55.167
who was ousted from the scientific society?

91
00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.267
Mad scientist?

92
00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:00.967
Dr. Miyano was a nice and friendly man.

93
00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:04.767
He took a liking to my inventions too.

94
00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:06.667
His wife was reticent

95
00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:10.467
and you could never tell what she was thinking.

96
00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:13.567
If I remember correctly, her name was Eleina.

97
00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:16.367
Eleina? You mean his wife wasn't Japanese?

98
00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.367
Nope. They seem to have met when she was here in Japan

99
00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.867
as an exchange student from England.

100
00:06:22.867 --> 00:06:27.967
But, I had no idea that she was Ai's mother.

101
00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:33.667
I see. No wonder she looks a bit non-Japanese.

102
00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:37.967
Come to think of it, Dr. Miyano never mentioned

103
00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:39.367
what he was researching...

104
00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:41.167
Hey, look ahead!

105
00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.167
What's wrong?

106
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:52.067
Thank god.

107
00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:53.567
Be careful, will you, Doc?

108
00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.167
It's because you talked to me while I'm driving.

109
00:06:56.167 --> 00:07:00.167
What a big car!

110
00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.267
Wow, fantastic.

111
00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:04.667
It looks to be a camping car.

112
00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:08.267
It shouldn't be left in a place like this, it's dangerous.

113
00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:11.367
Nobody seems to be inside.

114
00:07:11.367 --> 00:07:13.967
How lucky. I'm sure camping would be a lot of fun

115
00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.467
if we get to come in a car like this!

116
00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:17.467
Hey, brats!

117
00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:21.367
Quit touching my car with those dirty hands of yours!

118
00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:24.867
It's our best friend's precious car!

119
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:26.367
Right, Haruka?

120
00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.267
Yes.

121
00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:29.767
But, I don't think my uncle

122
00:07:29.767 --> 00:07:33.967
who lent me the car would mind them just touching it.

123
00:07:33.967 --> 00:07:36.567
You're kind to kids, aren't you?

124
00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:40.867
You blasted me when I smoked in the car and then...

125
00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:43.567
You smoke too much, Reiji!

126
00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:46.767
That's why you fell for her, right Reiji, because she's kind?

127
00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.067
Shut up.

128
00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.767
Oh, so it was your car.

129
00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.867
I'm so sorry.

130
00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:54.767
It was such a rare car that I couldn't help myself.

131
00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:56.367
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:59.567
But our hands aren't all that dirty!

133
00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:01.067
Okay, sonny.

134
00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:02.367
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:06.767
Yasumi, will you come take a look?

136
00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:10.167
I think the meat's just about ready, already.

137
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:13.667
Wow, it looks delicious!

138
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.367
The meat looks really expensive!

139
00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:17.967
Would you like to join us?

140
00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:19.267
Since there's some more meat left anyway.

141
00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:22.867
-Are you serious? -But, that's for tonight.

142
00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:25.667
Come on, don't get stingy!

143
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.067
If we run low, we can always borrow Haruka's wallet

144
00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.967
and go get some more from the supermarket at the foot of the mountain!

145
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:32.267
Right, Haruka?

146
00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:33.767
Yes.

147
00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:35.267
Please eat to your heart's content!

148
00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:36.767
All right!

149
00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:41.367
This is delicious!

150
00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:44.667
You're members of a university club.

151
00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:47.767
Yes, the name's The Outdoor Club!

152
00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:50.067
We go to the mountains and the beach.

153
00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.667
We all went to Hawaii together before too!

154
00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:56.567
Well, everything is thanks to our sponsor, Haruka, though!

155
00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:58.367
Not really.

156
00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:02.567
Yasumi, you're good at cooking and Reiji's a good driver.

157
00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:04.167
I don't have any special talents like

158
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.867
picking edible mountain plants or fishing like our cook here so...

159
00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:10.067
the most I can do is dish out cash.

160
00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.867
I'm a helpless Ms. Richie-Rich,

161
00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:16.067
so the most I can do is dish out cash.

162
00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:19.867
If only for once in my life, I'd like to say something like that!

163
00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:21.267
No...

164
00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:24.667
Honestly, you're way too good for a womanizer like Reiji!

165
00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:28.067
Didn't I just tell you to shut up?

166
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:32.167
A rich friend, huh?

167
00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:34.767
They're just like Ran and Sonoko.

168
00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:39.067
Are you feeling sick or something? You don't seem to be eating much.

169
00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:40.367
No.

170
00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.867
I was just thinking, that's how things usually are...

171
00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:48.967
Are you ready? Here goes!

172
00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:13.267
-How about it? -Too bad. 10 seconds 31!

173
00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:15.267
You couldn't make it under 10 seconds!

174
00:10:15.267 --> 00:10:18.467
No joke! And I was quite confident.

175
00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:19.767
Too bad!

176
00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:22.167
Oh? That belt.

177
00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:25.867
It's the same kind that Yoko Okino was wearing the other day!

178
00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:27.167
That's right!

179
00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:28.767
She was wearing her outfit for her new song, right?

180
00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:32.867
But, I'm the one who found this first!

181
00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:35.967
You've been wearing that a lot recently, haven't you, Yasumi?

182
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:38.467
Because it's the same as something an idol is wearing!

183
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:39.467
That's right!

184
00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:41.067
Why don't you eat at our place for dinner

185
00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:43.067
as a token of our appreciation for lunch?

186
00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.367
Oh, really?

187
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:47.267
Wow, that sounds great!

188
00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:50.467
I guess we can take it easy till dinner time, then!

189
00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:51.567
Yeah!

190
00:10:57.567 --> 00:10:59.167
How is it, Conan?

191
00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:00.867
Yep, I think it's good.

192
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.967
Let me taste it too!

193
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:07.167
If you taste it, half of the curry will be gone, so you may not!

194
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.867
Oh well, so sorry.

195
00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:12.167
I'll go get the other people then!

196
00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:13.667
Oh, let's go together!

197
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.167
Ah... Ai...

198
00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.667
Ai... Ice... I wonder if it'll make them happy

199
00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.467
if I told them we also have ice cream.

200
00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:24.067
I guess so.

201
00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:32.467
Wow! This curry is delicious!

202
00:11:32.467 --> 00:11:35.767
I'd like to make our chef taste this too!

203
00:11:35.767 --> 00:11:37.567
Huh? Where's Yasumi?

204
00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:40.767
I haven't seen her for quite some time.

205
00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:45.367
Her bicycle's not here so it seems she's gone somewhere.

206
00:11:45.367 --> 00:11:48.667
Going shopping to the foot of the mountain is too far.

207
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.567
Maybe she went there.

208
00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:53.467
The time is just about right too.

209
00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:54.967
There?

210
00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:59.967
There's a great place about 5 minutes uphill by car from here.

211
00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:02.367
I guess I'll go look for her.

212
00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:03.967
Yeah.

213
00:12:03.967 --> 00:12:06.567
Do you guys want to come too? It's a nice place.

214
00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:07.767
Yes, I'll go!

215
00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:12.367
Then, I guess we'll accompany you all on our Beetle too!

216
00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:15.367
Then, why don't you come with us?

217
00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:17.967
You'd like to ride the camping car, wouldn't you?

218
00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.767
Yes! I'd like to ride it!

219
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:24.867
Wow, fantastic! Super!

220
00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:27.667
This sofa is so fluffy!

221
00:12:27.667 --> 00:12:29.067
There's a TV here too!

222
00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:32.467
There's a toilet and shower too!

223
00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:34.867
It's like a hotel.

224
00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.267
This is really something.

225
00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:39.067
What is that sound...

226
00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:41.667
Oops, sounds like it's started already!

227
00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.267
Reiji!

228
00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:44.967
Can you do what we did last year this time too?

229
00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:46.067
Okay!

230
00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:49.567
What?

231
00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:51.867
Oh, the sunroof.

232
00:12:51.867 --> 00:12:55.167
I'll hold you up, so would you like to take a look?

233
00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:56.667
Can we see something?

234
00:12:56.667 --> 00:12:58.467
You'll see!

235
00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:03.667
See, look.

236
00:13:05.967 --> 00:13:08.167
Fireworks! It's fireworks!

237
00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.267
Hey, I wanna see too.

238
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:13.167
It's covered by the mountains and I can't see it anymore.

239
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.967
Okay, let's go back inside.

240
00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:16.167
Okay.

241
00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:18.267
Don't worry.

242
00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:19.267
When we get to the top of the mountain,

243
00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:21.267
you'll get to see it nice and clear!

244
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.367
Look out, Reiji!

245
00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:33.767
What's wrong?

246
00:13:34.367 --> 00:13:38.467
I ran over something that was on the road.

247
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:41.067
Hey, what do you mean something?

248
00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:43.667
Don't tell me that...

249
00:13:53.489 --> 00:13:54.789
Don't tell me that...

250
00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:00.489
What the...

251
00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:04.789
A wooden fence, wooden fence!

252
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:07.089
What the... It scared me out of my wits.

253
00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:09.289
I thought it was Yasumi.

254
00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:12.589
It seems to have decayed and fell from above.

255
00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.989
So, let's hurry to the spot!

256
00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:17.089
The fireworks might end soon.

257
00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.489
Okay.

258
00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:38.389
Wow! How pretty!

259
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:41.089
Tamaya!

260
00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:50.689
This is indeed a great place to watch the fireworks!

261
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:53.589
Yes, we coincidentally found this place

262
00:14:53.589 --> 00:14:55.589
when we camped here four years ago.

263
00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:58.689
It's a place that not too many people know of yet!

264
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.889
But, since we'll graduate and start working,

265
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:05.389
I guess this will be the last time we'll be coming here together.

266
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:07.589
By the way, I wonder where Yasumi is.

267
00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:10.089
There are bicycle tire marks here!

268
00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:11.389
What?

269
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:14.089
By this broken fence.

270
00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:16.689
Don't tell me she fell from there or something...

271
00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:18.489
Don't be silly.

272
00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:22.089
If so, we would've found her on the road on our way here!

273
00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.189
But...

274
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:25.489
I'm sure that someone who recently came here

275
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:28.789
bumped into the fence with his bicycle and broke it!

276
00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:29.789
I wonder.

277
00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:32.589
Even Yasumi is not that much of a klutz.

278
00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:38.789
But, I wonder where Yasumi disappeared to.

279
00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:42.589
I was positive that she beat us to that spot.

280
00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:44.089
Yes.

281
00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:47.489
Is Yasumi a person who usually does things like that?

282
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:51.389
Yes, even last year she went there by bicycle before us

283
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:53.189
and boasted being the first one there.

284
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:55.989
I'm sure she went to get something to eat!

285
00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:58.189
She's not you, Genta.

286
00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:03.289
Hey, Fukuura!

287
00:16:03.289 --> 00:16:05.389
What now?

288
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:07.889
She... she's there.

289
00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:09.089
Yasumi.

290
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:12.789
-Yasumi? -Where?

291
00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:15.489
The road.

292
00:16:15.489 --> 00:16:18.589
In the middle of the road!

293
00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:29.989
The victim is Ms. Yasumi Shirafuji, age 22,

294
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.489
a university student.

295
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:33.289
Judging from the wound on her head,

296
00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:36.489
it seems she probably hit her head hard on something

297
00:16:36.489 --> 00:16:37.689
and passed away.

298
00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:39.689
You mean she fell to her death?

299
00:16:39.689 --> 00:16:41.289
I believe so...

300
00:16:41.289 --> 00:16:43.289
Is something wrong?

301
00:16:43.289 --> 00:16:46.389
Well, she's bleeding so much and yet...

302
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:49.789
there is virtually no blood stains on the road.

303
00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:51.789
You're right.

304
00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:54.089
When is the estimated time of death?

305
00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:57.389
Around 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening.

306
00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:01.289
That's strange!

307
00:17:01.289 --> 00:17:03.289
You guys again.

308
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:05.189
What's strange?

309
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:09.889
We came up this hill by car at night.

310
00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:12.389
But nobody was lying on the road at that time!

311
00:17:12.389 --> 00:17:17.389
We found Yasumi when we came back down by car after a while!

312
00:17:17.389 --> 00:17:21.789
Just what do you mean? Will you give me more of the details?

313
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:26.389
Well, I brought the kids to a camping ground nearby,

314
00:17:26.389 --> 00:17:29.389
and we happened to hit it off well with these people.

315
00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:31.489
Then we decided to ride in their camping car

316
00:17:31.489 --> 00:17:35.889
and come to this scenic spot to get a view of the fireworks.

317
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.989
You're friends of the victim, Yasumi?

318
00:17:38.989 --> 00:17:39.989
Yeah.

319
00:17:39.989 --> 00:17:43.489
When we went to see the fireworks and first passed by here,

320
00:17:43.489 --> 00:17:47.289
the fireworks had already started so it was past 7pm.

321
00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:50.589
Then, on our way back at about 9pm after the fireworks,

322
00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:52.189
we found her.

323
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:54.589
Our friend Yasumi, who belonged to the same university club as us

324
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:57.289
lying here on the road!

325
00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:00.389
Which means that when you passed here at after 7pm,

326
00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:03.089
you really saw no one lying here?

327
00:18:03.089 --> 00:18:06.989
Yeah, the only thing we saw was the wooden broken part of the fence.

328
00:18:06.989 --> 00:18:08.089
A wooden fence?

329
00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:11.089
See? There's a wooden fence on top of the mountain.

330
00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:13.689
That's where we were watching the fireworks.

331
00:18:13.689 --> 00:18:16.689
A part of the fence had broken off and fell to the road below

332
00:18:16.689 --> 00:18:18.389
so I avoided it by slamming on the brakes.

333
00:18:18.389 --> 00:18:21.089
I kind of hit it a bit though.

334
00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:23.489
Was it really a wooden fence?

335
00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:24.789
Of course.

336
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:26.689
Only when we got to the top,

337
00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:28.589
it looked more like somebody had deliberately broken it than

338
00:18:28.589 --> 00:18:30.489
as if it had naturally broken off.

339
00:18:30.489 --> 00:18:31.489
I thought that

340
00:18:31.489 --> 00:18:34.289
maybe Yasumi had gone through it with her bicycle

341
00:18:34.289 --> 00:18:36.489
and fell off.

342
00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:38.189
Bicycle?

343
00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:41.689
A bicycle that we had in the camping car.

344
00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:43.589
Since the bicycle was missing,

345
00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.289
we decided to go up the mountain

346
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:47.989
to that spot to watch the fireworks and look for her at the same time.

347
00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:51.489
She always liked to beat us to places too so...

348
00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:53.689
But, I figured that if she did fall from the above,

349
00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:57.589
we would find her bicycle or something on the road along the way,

350
00:18:57.589 --> 00:18:59.689
so I didn't think much of it.

351
00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:04.189
This is...

352
00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:07.389
Let's go to the place

353
00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:10.989
where you all say you watched the fireworks!

354
00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:20.489
There are tire marks of a bicycle near the broken fence.

355
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:23.489
I wonder if she fell from here after all.

356
00:19:23.489 --> 00:19:27.189
Didn't you notice any tire marks when you came here?

357
00:19:27.189 --> 00:19:30.489
I did notice, but I didn't think that it there was any connection.

358
00:19:30.489 --> 00:19:31.689
Inspector Megure!

359
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:34.089
What's up, Officer Takagi?

360
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.189
I found the bicycle!

361
00:19:36.189 --> 00:19:38.089
It seems to have been stuck in the bushes

362
00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:39.889
on the outer side of the guard rail!

363
00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:41.789
Oh, is that right?

364
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:45.489
Let's verify it. Will you bring it here?

365
00:19:46.189 --> 00:19:48.689
Yeah, no mistake about it!

366
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:52.189
That's the bicycle we had in camping car!

367
00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:54.689
Okay, try matching the wheel mark then!

368
00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:55.989
Yes, sir!

369
00:19:59.889 --> 00:20:02.389
They seem to match!

370
00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:05.389
I see. Which means...

371
00:20:05.389 --> 00:20:09.489
Yasumi came here by bicycle before you all got here,

372
00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:11.389
and because it was dark,

373
00:20:11.389 --> 00:20:13.489
she stopped her bicycle a bit too late,

374
00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:16.989
broke through the fence and fell over

375
00:20:16.989 --> 00:20:19.689
hit her head somewhere on the road

376
00:20:19.689 --> 00:20:24.489
and then rolled into the bush the bicycle was found in.

377
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:27.489
And, while you were all watching fireworks here,

378
00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:30.189
Yasumi's body that was stuck somewhere in the bushes

379
00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:32.789
slipped off to the road below.

380
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:35.389
Then, on your way back from the fireworks,

381
00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:37.889
you happened to find her here.

382
00:20:37.889 --> 00:20:39.489
This looks to be an accident.

383
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.889
Yes. Then the thing about no blood on the road

384
00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:45.689
where she was found is understandable too.

385
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:47.989
I wonder about that.

386
00:20:47.989 --> 00:20:51.089
Yasumi came here last year too, right?

387
00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:52.989
She should've known about this open square as well as the fact

388
00:20:52.989 --> 00:20:55.989
that there is a cliff on the other side of the fence too, right?

389
00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:59.489
If so, I wonder why she crashed into the fence.

390
00:20:59.489 --> 00:21:04.189
So, it was dark and she couldn't see the fence.

391
00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:07.189
If it was dark, wouldn't she try to be even more careful?

392
00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:09.389
She should've known it was dangerous, right?

393
00:21:09.389 --> 00:21:10.489
Well...

394
00:21:10.489 --> 00:21:14.489
Maybe she was happy that she was the first one here

395
00:21:14.489 --> 00:21:16.189
and got carried away?

396
00:21:16.189 --> 00:21:17.189
Right!

397
00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:20.789
That's why she couldn't stop herself fast enough and fell over!

398
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:22.689
Then...

399
00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:24.489
Oh, watch out, Conan!

400
00:21:24.489 --> 00:21:26.789
If Yasumi fell from here,

401
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:29.189
there should be a place on the road below

402
00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:34.189
where the blood stains of when she hit her are!

403
00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:36.489
How about it, Officer Takagi?

404
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:41.589
Well, the shattered pieces of the broken light cover were found,

405
00:21:41.589 --> 00:21:43.989
but no blood stains were found yet.

406
00:21:43.989 --> 00:21:45.589
What did you say?

407
00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:47.789
Inspector, could it be that Yasumi

408
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:49.989
did not fall to her death but rather...

409
00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:53.489
Somebody deliberately left wheel tracks

410
00:21:53.489 --> 00:21:55.589
and tried to make it look like an accident.

411
00:21:55.589 --> 00:21:57.489
In other words, a homicide!

412
00:21:57.489 --> 00:21:59.489
Which means that the killer is someone

413
00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:03.689
who could freely take the bicycle from the camping car.

414
00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:07.389
Yeah. Her friends who belong to the same circle.

415
00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:11.989
The probability of the killer being among the three is high!

416
00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:46.789
Who drives this camping car?

417
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:50.489
It's Fukuura who used to be in a car club before.

418
00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:55.189
Hey, hey, if it's moving the car, all three of us can!

419
00:23:55.189 --> 00:23:56.389
What's this?

420
00:23:57.089 --> 00:23:58.589
Don't tell me that...

421
00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:01.889
So, that's the story. I figured this case out!

422
00:24:01.889 --> 00:24:07.589
And the only one who could've worked out this trick is...

423
00:24:07.689 --> 00:24:09.089
Next Conan,

424
00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:13.489
"Friendship Torn Apart (Part 2)"

425
00:24:14.357 --> 00:24:16.557
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:16.557 --> 00:24:18.457
"Belt"

427
00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.457
The next episode is part two of this story.

428
00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:23.503
Will Ayumi succeed in calling Haibara by her first name Ai?
