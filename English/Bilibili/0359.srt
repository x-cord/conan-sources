1
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.840
Today's date turns into an investigation.

2
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.740
Search for the culprit for each of their own reasons.

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.840
Will the case as well as the feelings of the two be settled?

4
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.240
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.025
Officer Takagi and Officer Sato

8
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.125
came to Tropical Marine Land on a secret date

9
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:01.925
without telling their colleagues at the station.

10
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.725
However, not only did they end up being watched

11
00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.525
by Inspector Shiratori and the other officers,

12
00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:11.725
we were sent to interrupt their date.

13
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.625
Then, instead of a ring

14
00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.025
that he was planning to give as a present,

15
00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:20.425
a paper bag of heroin was found in Officer Takagi's bag.

16
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.825
Here.

17
00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.025
That's right.

18
00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:28.425
When I rode the "50,000 Miles Under The Sea" attraction,

19
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:30.625
I'm sure someone made a mistake back then

20
00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.325
and took my bag.

21
00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:34.725
You've got a clue!

22
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:37.025
Look at the shoulder belt of that bag.

23
00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:40.425
Only the hole on the left side is spread out wide.

24
00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:43.625
A right-handed person would normally carry it on the right shoulder,

25
00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.425
but the owner of that bag always carried it on his left shoulder.

26
00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:49.325
Which means

27
00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:51.825
the possibility of him being left-handed is very high.

28
00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.325
"Genta Kojima"

29
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.325
Here it is.

30
00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:58.525
This person is left-handed!

31
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:00.425
How do you know?

32
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:01.425
The characters written using the ballpoint pen

33
00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:03.025
smeared to the right.

34
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.825
This is proof that the person is left-handed.

35
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.425
Please announce his name that's on the survey sheet

36
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.325
and have him come here immediately!

37
00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.625
He's a major witness for an investigation!

38
00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:20.925
"Love Story at Police Headquarters #5 (Part 2)"

39
00:03:27.025 --> 00:03:28.625
"300 fireworks show at 7 pm!"

40
00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:30.925
"Tropical Marine Land, Gate C"

41
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:38.425
Mr. Noboru Takagi, please come immediately to the front

42
00:03:38.425 --> 00:03:40.325
of the entrance of the attraction "50,000 Miles Under The Sea".

43
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:43.725
Takagi?

44
00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:48.525
I see, Takagi has already gathered all his relatives here.

45
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:51.325
Inspector, the two are probably going to

46
00:03:51.325 --> 00:03:52.825
have their reception wedding here today.

47
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:54.025
It'll be okay.

48
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.425
Without a ring, they cannot proceed with the ceremony.

49
00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:59.825
But if you find anyone with a similar kind of bag,

50
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:01.925
question them at all cost

51
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.025
and check inside their bag.

52
00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:05.825
Show it to me.

53
00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:07.525
Hurry.

54
00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.525
Attention, all customers.

55
00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:12.325
Mr. Noboru Takagi from Chiba Prefecture...

56
00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.925
please come immediately to the front entrance

57
00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:18.225
of our "50,000 Miles Under the Sea" attraction.

58
00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.525
It's him! He's the one!

59
00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:25.025
The man that was doing the golf swing!

60
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:28.725
Are you Mr. Noboru Takagi?

61
00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:31.425
The police?

62
00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:34.125
Yes, I am Takagi.

63
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:35.525
What do you want from me?

64
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.325
You're left-handed, aren't you?

65
00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:39.625
Yes.

66
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:40.625
I'd hate to trouble you,

67
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:42.525
but will you show me your bag?

68
00:04:42.525 --> 00:04:46.325
My... my bag? But this is all I have.

69
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:49.025
Oh, no.

70
00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:51.425
It's totally different from Officer Takagi's bag.

71
00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.225
Hey, daddy. I'm hungry!

72
00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:58.725
-Come on! -Okay, okay.

73
00:04:58.725 --> 00:05:00.825
What? He is...

74
00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:03.125
the child that's in the picture.

75
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:05.925
Geez, you called me out here,

76
00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.425
and this is what you had to say?

77
00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.125
I... I'm so sorry!

78
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.425
Thank you for your cooperation!

79
00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.825
There's just no way a mule would bring a child.

80
00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:22.025
But it's one down, so just three more to go.

81
00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:24.025
If we check the survey sheets,

82
00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:25.325
we can get their names and addresses.

83
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.925
That won't work.

84
00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.125
The survey sheets taken after that man's

85
00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.125
are those of three students on a school trip.

86
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.825
In other words, the three people in between

87
00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:37.125
didn't answer the survey sheets.

88
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.625
Oh, no.

89
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.325
If only we could at least find those students,

90
00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:43.725
we could ask them what kind of bag

91
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.325
the three suspects were holding.

92
00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:47.925
The male students on a school trip

93
00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:49.925
were around there some place a while ago.

94
00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:51.825
See, over there!

95
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:02.725
They're the DC Academy's famous trio!

96
00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:03.925
Treerrios?

97
00:06:03.925 --> 00:06:07.325
Not Treerrios, but trio.

98
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.825
All three of them are famous for being sportsmen.

99
00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:16.525
Hey, there was a soiled handkerchief in the bag, wasn't there?

100
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:17.525
Oh, yes.

101
00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.125
Do you mean this?

102
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:22.925
The color and smell of this stain...

103
00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:25.825
Just as I thought.

104
00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:29.225
Okay, I'll go ask the three then!

105
00:06:29.225 --> 00:06:31.125
No, you don't have to.

106
00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.425
There's something I just remembered.

107
00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:37.425
A taboo that a sportsman should never do.

108
00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:40.625
A taboo that a sportsman should never do?

109
00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:43.925
Is that going to specify the owner of this bag?

110
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.925
What's a taboo?

111
00:06:45.925 --> 00:06:50.725
That's something that you're not supposed to do.

112
00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:55.325
See, just watch those three very carefully.

113
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.725
All three of them are famous high school sportsmen.

114
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:01.625
On the right end is Yosuke Goto,

115
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.325
a high school baseball player who has won his way up to rank 4

116
00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:05.125
as the best left-handed player.

117
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:08.325
In the middle is Keita Nakajima, the backstroker

118
00:07:08.325 --> 00:07:09.925
who broke the inter-high record.

119
00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:13.225
And at the very left is Kazuhiko Maeda,

120
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:14.725
a soccer player under seventeen.

121
00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:17.425
Don't you notice something?

122
00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:21.725
The owner of the bag is a left-hander

123
00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:24.825
who always carries his bag over his left shoulder.

124
00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.125
Who among the baseball player, soccer player, and swimmer

125
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.325
is the person we're looking for?

126
00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:31.125
It's the one who plays soccer then,

127
00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:34.025
because he's carrying his bag on his left shoulder.

128
00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:37.425
That's because he happens to be left-handed.

129
00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.125
How is that so?

130
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.925
What about the swimmer?

131
00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:44.825
We've got to ask whether she's right-handed or not

132
00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:47.125
or we'll never know.

133
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:49.425
I get it. Maybe it's the baseball player?

134
00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:52.225
A left-handed player means he's left-handed, doesn't it?

135
00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:54.125
Then, it's the baseball player.

136
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.925
That's only a coincidence, I think.

137
00:07:57.825 --> 00:07:59.225
But something seems strange.

138
00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.425
Look, the baseball player

139
00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:03.425
is carrying the bag on his right shoulder.

140
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:06.125
True. Why? Why?

141
00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.225
Maybe he used to throw with his right arm

142
00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:10.025
before he switched to using his left arm.

143
00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:12.825
That's why he's probably actually right-handed.

144
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.225
No, you're wrong.

145
00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:17.425
That is not the reason why he's not carrying the bag

146
00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:19.125
on his right shoulder.

147
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.525
He's not supposed to carry it over his left shoulder.

148
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:25.025
That's one of the taboos a sportsman is not supposed to do.

149
00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:33.725
That is, he has to protect his precious left shoulder.

150
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:36.225
Now that you mentioned it, I've heard something like that before.

151
00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:38.825
Pitchers try not to burden their shoulders.

152
00:08:38.825 --> 00:08:40.225
So when they carry heavy loads with their shoulder,

153
00:08:40.225 --> 00:08:42.825
they carry it on the shoulder opposite the hand they throw with.

154
00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:45.725
Genta, the guy you saw was right-handed, wasn't he?

155
00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:49.425
Yeah, he was throwing in air like this.

156
00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.825
I see.

157
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.325
If that person is a right-handed pitcher

158
00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:55.225
and is still playing baseball somewhere,

159
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:56.525
it is very likely that he was carrying the bag

160
00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:59.525
on his left shoulder to protect his right shoulder.

161
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:02.725
As if he were left-handed.

162
00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:06.125
But I wonder if it's safe to base our conclusion on just that.

163
00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.525
There are left-handed soccer players and swimmers too.

164
00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:11.225
That's not all.

165
00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:13.325
This handkerchief that was in the bag.

166
00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:14.925
Try smelling it.

167
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:22.225
This is...

168
00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:26.225
Yeah. Mr. Mouri was polishing his glove with it this morning.

169
00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:33.325
It's the smell of glove oil.

170
00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:36.325
Then the owner of this bag...

171
00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.225
In other words, the mule is...

172
00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:41.125
The man that wears a cap and plays baseball.

173
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.825
I'm pretty sure.

174
00:09:42.825 --> 00:09:47.225
But how do we look for him?

175
00:09:47.225 --> 00:09:50.025
It seems like the number of customers has increased too.

176
00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:59.825
I bought it at a nearby shop, but it's not working well.

177
00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.825
It's difficult to see too far with opera glasses.

178
00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:08.025
This is Sogawa.

179
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:10.525
Takagi and Sato are beginning to really move about.

180
00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:13.525
They seem to be looking desperately for the bag with the ring inside.

181
00:10:13.525 --> 00:10:14.625
Roger.

182
00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:17.625
Let's make sure that we get to it before they do, no matter what.

183
00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:21.025
All officers, please continue questioning.

184
00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:23.125
And please do not lose track

185
00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:25.025
of both Officer Takagi and Officer Sato. Thank you.

186
00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:38.725
If he's walking out here somewhere,

187
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.825
we still have a chance of finding him.

188
00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:43.825
But if he's inside a pavilion of an attraction or something,

189
00:10:43.825 --> 00:10:45.625
there's no way we can find him.

190
00:10:47.325 --> 00:10:48.625
Don't worry.

191
00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:51.325
Marine Land is only open till 8.00 pm.

192
00:10:51.325 --> 00:10:54.325
It's already 5.30 pm. If any deal is going to be carried out,

193
00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:55.825
there are only two and a half hours left.

194
00:10:55.825 --> 00:10:59.025
I'm sure he'll avoid an attraction in which he has to wait in line.

195
00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.425
Moreover, if he's a mule,

196
00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:02.925
chances are he's here alone.

197
00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:05.625
I'm sure he's having problems trying to kill time.

198
00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:08.425
I can't be all that sure,

199
00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:10.625
but if the mule were to appear,

200
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:11.825
it would most likely be...

201
00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:18.325
"Retro-Game Pavilion"

202
00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.025
He's nowhere in sight.

203
00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:45.725
I did say that I can't be all that sure, you know.

204
00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:48.725
I have to go take a leak.

205
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:50.525
I'm going to the restroom.

206
00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:51.825
Me too!

207
00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:54.725
Maybe it's this way.

208
00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:56.125
It's the john!

209
00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:01.825
Oh. Are you okay?

210
00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:08.125
You're the two kids that were at "50,000 Miles Under the Sea".

211
00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.425
Nice to see you.

212
00:12:10.525 --> 00:12:11.725
See you guys then.

213
00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:13.525
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

214
00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:18.025
-He's here! -He sure was, Genta!

215
00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:22.925
Hurry...

216
00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:25.225
Here I am again.

217
00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:28.425
This is the best place to kill time after all.

218
00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:31.825
He's carrying a bag that looked really similar on his left shoulder.

219
00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:34.425
It seems quite certain that he's the mule.

220
00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:41.025
Bull's eye!

221
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.425
What's the matter, Ms. Sato?

222
00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:52.025
-Hurry, get the bag. -Wait.

223
00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:54.525
Let him be until he goes off to make the deal.

224
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:57.425
We'll nab him just when he makes contact with the dealer.

225
00:12:57.425 --> 00:13:00.125
But my bag...

226
00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:04.025
Did you have something very important inside it, after all?

227
00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:08.125
Yes. It's what I was planning to give you, Ms. Sato.

228
00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:09.125
A...

229
00:13:10.925 --> 00:13:12.725
Finger... ("Yubi" means "finger" in Japanese)

230
00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.725
What? Finger?

231
00:13:14.725 --> 00:13:19.025
A ri... A...

232
00:13:19.025 --> 00:13:20.525
A ring... ("Yubiwa" means "ring" in Japanese)

233
00:13:20.525 --> 00:13:21.625
A mail? ("Ring" sounds similar to "mail" in Japanese)

234
00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:24.025
Do you mean a letter?

235
00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:26.625
Gosh, if you have something you want to say to me,

236
00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.725
why don't you tell me directly as a man should?

237
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.425
You're right.

238
00:13:34.725 --> 00:13:36.725
Okay, we're going to approach the man,

239
00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:38.825
so all of you stay close to me, all right?

240
00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:43.225
It's a ring.

241
00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:51.889
Inspector Shiratori, we found the man

242
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:54.189
that seems to have the bag in question.

243
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:58.489
All right. Please check the contents then.

244
00:13:58.489 --> 00:14:02.989
But Ms. Sato and the others are near that man too.

245
00:14:02.989 --> 00:14:06.889
Does that mean that the ring inside the bag has already been...

246
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:09.789
No, it doesn't seem so.

247
00:14:09.789 --> 00:14:13.089
Rather, it seems as if they're keeping watch over the man.

248
00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:15.789
Please tell me where you currently are.

249
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.389
Let's get together there.

250
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.289
All officers gather at the Retro-Game Pavilion.

251
00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:21.489
-Gather there? -He said that?

252
00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:22.489
Roger.

253
00:14:23.889 --> 00:14:24.889
Roger.

254
00:14:29.489 --> 00:14:31.289
It's almost time.

255
00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:32.589
I guess it's time I get going.

256
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:44.189
Let's go there next.

257
00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:53.689
What is this? Oh, my.

258
00:15:11.489 --> 00:15:12.889
Where did he go?

259
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.689
It's okay. He's over there.

260
00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:17.689
Really!

261
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:18.789
He sat down.

262
00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:20.589
Now, we're about to start

263
00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:22.989
the greatest event of this tropical night,

264
00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:26.189
the vivid bursting fireworks in the night sky.

265
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:28.289
It's show time!

266
00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:36.989
I don't believe that they're going to go through a drug deal

267
00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:39.589
in a bustling place like this.

268
00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:41.989
Maybe it's a good place because it's so unlikely?

269
00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.389
That's...

270
00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:02.389
the drug dealer, Asakichi Yakura!

271
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:05.289
Okay, I don't know what this is about

272
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:07.489
but take it with you right away and give me the cash.

273
00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:10.889
Hold it. The deal starts after the fireworks are displayed in the sky.

274
00:16:10.889 --> 00:16:14.089
When all people are looking up at the fireworks.

275
00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:16.489
Oh, talk about being careful.

276
00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:19.189
It must be something super illegal.

277
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:22.789
It's better for you to not think about unnecessary things.

278
00:16:22.789 --> 00:16:26.689
You're a mule, and that's all that matters.

279
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:29.689
So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so very much for waiting.

280
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:36.789
The great 300 shots fireworks show is about to begin!

281
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:39.489
Officer Takagi, take care of the children.

282
00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:40.789
Ms. Sato!

283
00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:42.589
Inspector, there is a male among the audience

284
00:16:42.589 --> 00:16:44.689
that resembles a suspect on the wanted list.

285
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:45.689
What?

286
00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:49.889
Okay, now is the time.

287
00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:51.989
Put the stuff on my lap.

288
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:54.389
What?

289
00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:02.689
Police!

290
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.289
Freeze, both of you.

291
00:17:06.989 --> 00:17:08.389
No way.

292
00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:25.689
Didn't you hear another sound other than the fireworks just now?

293
00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:27.589
Yeah, I heard it. It's a loud bang!

294
00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:34.889
Yakura!

295
00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:35.889
Ms. Sato!

296
00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.689
What the hell are you doing? Let's go after him!

297
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:38.689
All right!

298
00:17:49.189 --> 00:17:51.989
Inspector, the two are going after Yakura.

299
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:53.889
Moreover, he's armed with a gun.

300
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:56.189
Roger. All officers on site,

301
00:17:56.189 --> 00:17:57.789
keep in mind the safety of all the people here

302
00:17:57.789 --> 00:18:00.189
while supporting Officer Sato and Officer Takagi!

303
00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:05.089
Hey! Freeze!

304
00:18:06.189 --> 00:18:08.889
Freeze, my foot. There's no way, man.

305
00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:15.589
Up ahead is where the pleasure cruiser is.

306
00:18:36.089 --> 00:18:37.989
Ms. Sato?

307
00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:44.289
Oh, no. He's probably planning on hijacking the boat using his gun

308
00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.789
and flee to the other side.

309
00:18:53.489 --> 00:18:54.989
No, you don't!

310
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:14.089
The ring!

311
00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:21.189
Darn it!

312
00:19:39.689 --> 00:19:42.589
My ring!

313
00:19:57.289 --> 00:20:00.489
Well, good work, Officer Takagi.

314
00:20:00.489 --> 00:20:02.489
Inspector Shiratori?

315
00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:03.989
What brings you here?

316
00:20:03.989 --> 00:20:06.889
Well, we got a tip about a drug deal

317
00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:09.789
that was to be held here and were staking out.

318
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.789
By the way, where is your bag

319
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:14.489
that the mule mistakenly took?

320
00:20:14.489 --> 00:20:16.089
Huh? Well...

321
00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:20.489
It went down into the sea when I caught the suspect.

322
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:25.789
Well, there wasn't much in it, so it doesn't matter.

323
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:29.389
Not much, he said.

324
00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:31.389
I'm glad then.

325
00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:34.289
Okay, case closed. Case closed.

326
00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:36.289
Shall we go have a shot tonight?

327
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:38.289
Sounds good.

328
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:40.789
You can come too, can't you?

329
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:43.889
Yes, after I take the children home.

330
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:47.389
Ms. Sato!

331
00:20:47.389 --> 00:20:50.089
Ms. Sato, we got the suspect!

332
00:20:51.189 --> 00:20:53.189
Ms. Sato.

333
00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:55.789
What's the matter?

334
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:57.689
Are you crying?

335
00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.289
It's probably because of that incident.

336
00:21:02.689 --> 00:21:03.889
It can't be...

337
00:21:16.589 --> 00:21:19.189
She seemed to have a flashback on the memory

338
00:21:19.189 --> 00:21:22.589
of Officer Matsuda who died on duty on the Ferris Wheel.

339
00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:06.389
You idiot!

340
00:23:06.389 --> 00:23:09.389
Why did you choose a place like this for a date?

341
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:10.689
The pits.

342
00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:13.289
What a dork!

343
00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:15.589
I... I'm sorry.

344
00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:18.189
It didn't dawn on me.

345
00:23:20.389 --> 00:23:23.289
Hey, will you promise me?

346
00:23:25.389 --> 00:23:27.489
That you will always be with me...

347
00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:31.989
and you will never disappear before me.

348
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:36.989
Give me your word!

349
00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:46.689
Although Officer Takagi lost his important bag...

350
00:23:47.889 --> 00:23:51.489
but he got a hold of something more important.

351
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:01.289
"Next Episode"

352
00:24:01.289 --> 00:24:03.089
Hurry, Officer Takagi!

353
00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:04.389
Hurry to where?

354
00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:06.489
We've found a clue!

355
00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:09.289
Did you find anything?

356
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:10.389
Soil?

357
00:24:13.189 --> 00:24:14.689
Beetle?

358
00:24:14.689 --> 00:24:16.989
What's that?

359
00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:18.889
