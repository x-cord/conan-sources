1
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

2
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.340
And move forward full speed without slowing down!

3
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.740
The clue to an unseen case

4
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.540
is seen in a mysterious mirage.

5
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.519
"The Angel Disappears into the Mirage"

9
00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.519
"Mouri Detective Agency"

10
00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.919
I see.

11
00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.419
So, you want me to look for your missing husband?

12
00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:39.019
Yes. This is my husband, Satoru Aoki.

13
00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.819
He's an artist,

14
00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.019
and there were times in the past,

15
00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.019
when he would go off painting without telling me where he was going.

16
00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.619
But he never failed to report back

17
00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.919
on how much progress his was making.

18
00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.319
He would send me photos of the canvas every day.

19
00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.719
I see. And that stopped the day before yesterday.

20
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.419
Yes. This is the last photo I received.

21
00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.719
How beautiful.

22
00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
But there's something strange about the photo.

23
00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.219
Which means?

24
00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.219
He's an artist that draws only

25
00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.819
what he actually sees with his own eyes.

26
00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.219
But that painting doesn't look to be anything of this world, does it?

27
00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.819
True. Maybe he changed his painting style.

28
00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.119
I got it! I know where Mr. Aoki is!

29
00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.919
What a beautiful ocean!

30
00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.119
Are you sure it's here?

31
00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.019
Yep. The bluish white waves that were in that painting

32
00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.719
is a natural phenomenon called "Glowing Firefly Squid"

33
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.619
or "Suicide of the Firefly Squid".

34
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.119
The phenomenon of the school of bluish white firefly squid

35
00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:47.119
being washed up to shore is exclusive only to Toyama Bay.

36
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:51.419
And recently, it was sighted at this beach!

37
00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.319
You're very knowledgeable, aren't you?

38
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.519
I... I saw it on TV.

39
00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.619
Oh boy.

40
00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.219
But, how do we look for him from here?

41
00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.519
Let's go search every lodging nearby.

42
00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.419
Dear!

43
00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.019
The victim is artist Mr. Satoru Aoki, age 52.

44
00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:28.219
I see. His identity was specified quite speedily, no?

45
00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:30.419
Yes. Well, you see...

46
00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.319
His wife just happened to be here looking for him,

47
00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.219
together with a detective.

48
00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.219
Hello, I'm Detective Kogoro Mouri.

49
00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.319
Mouri?

50
00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.119
You mean the Sleeping Kogoro?

51
00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.019
Did he drown to death?

52
00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.619
Yes, most probably.

53
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:50.819
His estimate tine of death is between 20:00 to 23:00 yesterday.

54
00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.319
The sea was rough last night, wasn't it?

55
00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.419
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.019
And moreover, this was found in the pocket of the corpse.

57
00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:00.319
You mean he was drunk?

58
00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.919
According to Mrs. Aoki,

59
00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.019
it seems that Mr. Aoki had a bad leg

60
00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:07.219
and was dragged it along when walking.

61
00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.619
He was probably drunk, slipped and fell into the sea.

62
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.119
-No. -Huh?

63
00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:16.819
He has what looks like a bruise on his cheek.

64
00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:17.819
See.

65
00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.219
Did he bruise himself when he fell into the sea?

66
00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.019
Well, there's a possibility that he was punched by someone.

67
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.419
-Yes. -Not you again. Stay put!

68
00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:35.719
Who is that?

69
00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.119
A local fisherman called Ishiguro.

70
00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:42.319
He's a hard worker, but prone to violence.

71
00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:45.819
Hello.

72
00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.519
I'm from the police. I contacted you earlier.

73
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.619
Yes. It's true that Mr. Aoki from about 2 weeks ago

74
00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.019
was staying over here.

75
00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.719
But I had no idea that he had passed away.

76
00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:02.819
If you will excuse me then.

77
00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:03.919
Thank you.

78
00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.819
Huh? The painting's gone!

79
00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.819
I found it! Mr. Aoki's painting.

80
00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.519
But, why is it in there?

81
00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:22.919
Sunlight, dust and temperature change are adverse to oil painting!

82
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.719
That's probably why he stored it like this, no?

83
00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.919
It's the same painting that he sent me a photo of.

84
00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.619
Nope. Look.

85
00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:33.619
Something's been drawn onto it.

86
00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.019
Huh?

87
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.519
True. There's something in the sky.

88
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:42.019
I think it's our house.

89
00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.919
It does look similar.

90
00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.819
Doesn't this one look like an angel ascending to the sky?

91
00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:51.819
So, the white one below

92
00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.519
is a soul that is guided along by the angel?

93
00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.719
But Mr. Aoki only drew things

94
00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.119
that he actually saw with his own eyes, right?

95
00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.819
He was probably drunk and hallucinated.

96
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.619
Maybe he had a hunch

97
00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:09.319
that he would be ascending to heaven.

98
00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:17.319
That's my husband's digital camera.

99
00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.819
He always took photos of the things he drew.

100
00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.519
And he painted while looking at the photos he took.

101
00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.619
May I see that?

102
00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.219
Okay.

103
00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.719
Just as I thought!

104
00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:32.319
Just what're you doing?

105
00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.019
It's been deleted!

106
00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:37.419
The data that was supposed to be used to draw his picture!

107
00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:38.419
What?

108
00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.419
The "Glowing firefly squid" phenomenon

109
00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:41.919
occurred at night 10 days ago.

110
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.719
The data for that day is all gone.

111
00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.319
True. 10 days ago...

112
00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.919
The folder for May 6th is gone.

113
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:53.519
Huh? The data in the digital camera's been deleted?

114
00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:56.519
Yes. Do you recall anything?

115
00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:01.819
Come to think of it, yesterday night...

116
00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:04.619
I think it was about midnight.

117
00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.419
Yes?

118
00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:13.719
Mr. Aoki?

119
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:19.919
The victim was supposedly already dead by then.

120
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.619
It's most likely that the person you saw was not Mr. Aoki

121
00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:26.219
but rather the who killed him.

122
00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:29.019
Why didn't you notice back then?

123
00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.419
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:32.219
It was dark.

125
00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.019
And besides, he was dragging his leg,

126
00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:37.019
so I just assumed it was him.

127
00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:38.419
No doubt about it.

128
00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.119
The perp disguised himself as Mr. Aoki

129
00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.519
and came to delete the photos

130
00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:46.019
because there was something he didn't want anyone to see.

131
00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:47.419
-I got it! -What?

132
00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:50.219
That person was probably a psychic!

133
00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:52.919
Huh? Just what're you talking about?

134
00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:56.919
Because that person went straight to Mr. Aoki's room, right?

135
00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:58.519
He wouldn't have know where the room was

136
00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:01.819
unless he was a psychic, right?

137
00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:03.119
True.

138
00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:04.619
It would've been impossible

139
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:07.519
to go straight to his room when there are other rooms, too.

140
00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.119
In other words, the perp is

141
00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:13.119
someone who had visited Mr. Aoki in his room before!

142
00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:21.219
Mrs. Aoki looked really depressed.

143
00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:24.119
I wonder if it was okay to send her home alone.

144
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:28.319
Well, after all, her husband passed away.

145
00:09:28.319 --> 00:09:29.719
She can't help it.

146
00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:33.219
All we need to do now is get the perp.

147
00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:38.219
What?

148
00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:42.519
I already told the police about it just a while ago.

149
00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:45.719
No. I'm not with them.

150
00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:48.219
Mrs. Aoki asked you to follow

151
00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:51.919
the final tracks of her husband for her, right?

152
00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.119
Yeah.

153
00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:55.319
If so...

154
00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:58.319
Yes, I met Mr. Aoki.

155
00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:02.119
I've been searching for my missing girlfriend for sometime

156
00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:05.519
and I went to the inn he was staying at the day before yesterday, too.

157
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.819
To pass out these flyers.

158
00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:09.919
Your cooperation would be most appreciated.

159
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:13.019
It must be hard, but hang in there, okay?

160
00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.319
Yes, thank you very much.

161
00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:20.419
Sorry.

162
00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:27.819
It's no use already.

163
00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:29.619
Forget it already.

164
00:10:29.619 --> 00:10:32.119
What?

165
00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:35.019
I was pissed!

166
00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:38.119
But I haven't seen him since then.

167
00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:40.519
I see.

168
00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:46.919
Yes. I met him at sundown the day before yesterday.

169
00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:49.719
I was talking a walk on the beach back then

170
00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:52.919
to see the famous mirage here.

171
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.419
That's when...

172
00:10:58.119 --> 00:11:01.319
He looked to be deeply troubled.

173
00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:04.019
It seemed as if he was contemplating suicide or something.

174
00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.919
So, I called out to him.

175
00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:09.319
We happen to hit it off well together, you see.

176
00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:12.219
So, we spent the entire night drinking in his room till morning.

177
00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.819
Is that so?

178
00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:19.219
Hey, hey. This is...

179
00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:20.719
Hey, sonny!

180
00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:25.019
You shouldn't look into other people's bags without permission.

181
00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.319
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:30.519
I wonder if Mr. Aoki committed suicide.

183
00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:34.819
Huh?

184
00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.719
I'd like these please.

185
00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:40.919
Gifts for your family?

186
00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:43.619
Yes, for my wife and daughter.

187
00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:51.819
And, what did you want?

188
00:11:51.819 --> 00:11:54.519
The last person is you.

189
00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:59.719
I met him yesterday morning

190
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.219
when I went to deliver fresh fish to the inn.

191
00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:08.019
What? That customer didn't even touch the food.

192
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.319
Sorry. He says he has no appetite.

193
00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:13.919
What? Where's that guy?

194
00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.219
They are gifts from the sea

195
00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:18.219
that we fishermen stake our lives to get a hold of.

196
00:12:18.219 --> 00:12:22.719
I can't stand somebody being wasteful like this!

197
00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:25.719
That's why you went to his room to bawl him out?

198
00:12:25.719 --> 00:12:29.019
Yeah, but I didn't lay a finger on him.

199
00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.819
How'd you get that wound?

200
00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.319
Huh? Oh, this...

201
00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:37.119
I had an accident at sea three years ago

202
00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:40.719
and I can't move it well since then.

203
00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:50.519
Just who's the perp anyway?

204
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:54.119
None of the three have alibis for the day of the crime.

205
00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:57.719
Is this a homicide to begin with?

206
00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:00.719
Or an accident? Suicide?

207
00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:03.619
Darn it! I'm totally lost!

208
00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:05.819
Huh? Those people...

209
00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:08.419
I wonder what they're looking at?

210
00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:11.119
Probably the spring mirage.

211
00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:15.019
Uozu is famous for mirages, you see.

212
00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:16.519
Mirage?

213
00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:19.419
Maybe that was...

214
00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:21.019
If so...

215
00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:33.578
I pooped. I'm exhausted.

216
00:13:33.578 --> 00:13:36.478
After all, we've been walking around all day.

217
00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:39.878
And, did you find him at all?

218
00:13:39.878 --> 00:13:43.378
The perp who deleted the video from Mr. Aoki's camera?

219
00:13:43.378 --> 00:13:45.978
No, unfortunately not yet.

220
00:13:45.978 --> 00:13:48.178
Is that so?

221
00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:50.678
Here, it's almost ready.

222
00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:52.778
It looks delicious.

223
00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:56.378
I fished them this afternoon, you see.

224
00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:59.578
You go out to fish, too?

225
00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:00.978
Sometimes.

226
00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:03.578
I used to be a fisherman before, you see.

227
00:14:03.578 --> 00:14:05.878
Then, please tell me.

228
00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.978
Does Mr. Ishiguro always wear a black cap

229
00:14:07.978 --> 00:14:10.578
when he goes out to sea?

230
00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:13.078
Yeah, he says that it's his lucky charm.

231
00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:14.678
Really?

232
00:14:14.678 --> 00:14:16.078
Oh, that's right!

233
00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.978
Before returning to Tokyo,

234
00:14:17.978 --> 00:14:21.778
why not go and watch the late night firefly squid fishing?

235
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:26.378
The sea glows blue and it's really romantic.

236
00:14:26.378 --> 00:14:28.278
What a bother.

237
00:14:28.278 --> 00:14:30.478
Oh, come on, let's go!

238
00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:32.578
-Right, Conan? -Huh?

239
00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:35.078
Yeah!

240
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:41.678
Wait, sir.

241
00:14:41.678 --> 00:14:42.878
Huh?

242
00:14:42.878 --> 00:14:44.078
What is it?

243
00:14:44.078 --> 00:14:47.078
Pops Kogoro asked me to tell you...

244
00:14:49.178 --> 00:14:50.778
I see.

245
00:14:50.778 --> 00:14:52.778
Got it. I'll keep an eye out.

246
00:14:52.778 --> 00:14:53.778
Please do.

247
00:14:57.678 --> 00:15:00.278
Hey, it's 2:00 after midnight, you know.

248
00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:02.378
Are we really going?

249
00:15:02.378 --> 00:15:04.578
The boat's leaving at 3:00.

250
00:15:04.578 --> 00:15:06.778
Come on, hurry, let's go!

251
00:15:06.778 --> 00:15:09.178
I'm counting on you, okay?

252
00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:11.078
Sure thing. Be careful.

253
00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:38.178
That's it!

254
00:15:41.478 --> 00:15:42.978
You're...

255
00:15:42.978 --> 00:15:45.978
Mr. Mouri, is he really the perp?

256
00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:46.978
Huh?

257
00:15:46.978 --> 00:15:50.178
You said so, didn't you? That the perp would be coming.

258
00:15:53.278 --> 00:15:56.878
Hot pot, beer, and sake...

259
00:15:56.878 --> 00:15:59.978
So, this is the Sleeping Kogoro?

260
00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:03.578
I set a trap a while ago.

261
00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:05.278
And told the perp that if we return to Tokyo,

262
00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:09.878
maybe it would be possible to recover the deleted digital camera data.

263
00:16:09.878 --> 00:16:13.278
So, I kept everyone away from this room.

264
00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:16.678
Then, the perp appeared just as expected.

265
00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:18.478
Correct?

266
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:22.178
Owner of this inn, Mr. Taro Hayashi?

267
00:16:22.178 --> 00:16:24.578
Just what're you talking about?

268
00:16:24.578 --> 00:16:28.378
I was just trying to protect the camera as I was told to.

269
00:16:28.378 --> 00:16:32.978
The perp of this case needed to satisfy two conditions.

270
00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:35.678
First, he had to be left-handed

271
00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:38.378
and in addition, be able to operate a boat!

272
00:16:38.378 --> 00:16:39.778
Huh?

273
00:16:39.778 --> 00:16:44.978
The corpse had a punch bruise on his right cheek.

274
00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:46.078
In other words,

275
00:16:46.078 --> 00:16:49.778
it means he was punched from the front with a left hand.

276
00:16:49.778 --> 00:16:52.878
But, what with the operating a boat?

277
00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:57.378
The perp had deleted the data from Mr. Aoki's camera.

278
00:16:57.378 --> 00:17:00.578
In other words, a clue leading to the perp

279
00:17:00.578 --> 00:17:04.478
was drawn in the painting, which was based on the data.

280
00:17:04.478 --> 00:17:06.278
Ran, bring the painting.

281
00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:08.278
Yes, sir.

282
00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:09.678
You may have all thought that

283
00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:12.778
this painting described an illusionary drawing of a soul

284
00:17:12.778 --> 00:17:15.978
ascending to heaven guided along by an angel.

285
00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:18.578
But Mr. Aoki was an artist who only drew things

286
00:17:18.578 --> 00:17:20.378
that he actually saw with his own eyes.

287
00:17:20.378 --> 00:17:23.678
This was actually reality after all!

288
00:17:23.678 --> 00:17:27.478
What? But no matter how you look at it, just cannot be real.

289
00:17:27.478 --> 00:17:29.078
It's a mirage.

290
00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:30.778
Mirage?

291
00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:34.278
The air near the surface of the water is cooled,

292
00:17:34.278 --> 00:17:36.478
and becomes dense during the mirage in spring.

293
00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:40.278
Light refracts and on top of the actual scenery,

294
00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:44.878
a virtual upside down image called superior mirage appears.

295
00:17:44.878 --> 00:17:48.078
In other words, if you turn the painting upside down,

296
00:17:48.078 --> 00:17:51.678
the actual image that is still not drawn will become visible.

297
00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.078
This is...

298
00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:56.178
Right.

299
00:17:56.178 --> 00:17:59.378
The white house that is depicted there is a white fishing boat.

300
00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.078
The angel ascending to heaven

301
00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:03.578
is a woman that was pushed into the sea.

302
00:18:03.578 --> 00:18:06.378
And the soul that is drawn below it

303
00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.178
is the white cap of the perp.

304
00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:10.578
In other words, this painting was

305
00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:14.278
a drawing of a dreadful murder being committed!

306
00:18:18.278 --> 00:18:22.978
After redrawing his painting several times,

307
00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:27.178
Mr. Aoki probably realized what had actually happened.

308
00:18:27.178 --> 00:18:31.278
Mr. Aoki told Mr. Akagi to forget about his girlfriend

309
00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:33.978
stared at the sea with a solemn look

310
00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:37.578
and couldn't eat his breakfast because he lost his appetite,

311
00:18:37.578 --> 00:18:39.978
all because of what he found out.

312
00:18:39.978 --> 00:18:42.978
Then, who is the woman that was killed?

313
00:18:42.978 --> 00:18:46.378
The glowing firefly squid that were drawn in the painting

314
00:18:46.378 --> 00:18:47.678
was seen 10 days ago.

315
00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:52.178
Mr. Akagi's girlfriend went missing the same day.

316
00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:54.078
Judging from her hairstyle and clothes,

317
00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.278
there's probably no doubt about it.

318
00:18:57.278 --> 00:19:02.078
Mr. Aoki was killed because he found out about this.

319
00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:05.178
In other words, the perp is someone who is left-handed

320
00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:08.178
and able to operate a boat.

321
00:19:08.178 --> 00:19:10.878
Mr. Akagi who was passing out the flyers with his left hand

322
00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:13.678
is left handed but cannot operate a boat.

323
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:18.078
Mr. Shirakawa locked the trunk with his right hand.

324
00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:21.378
Mr. Ishiguro who is also able to operate a boat

325
00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:23.478
cannot use his left hand.

326
00:19:23.478 --> 00:19:28.178
And when he goes to sea, he wears a black hat.

327
00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:29.278
In other words,

328
00:19:29.278 --> 00:19:32.578
the person who knew that Mr. Aoki was staying in this room...

329
00:19:32.578 --> 00:19:35.878
The person who satisfied these two conditions...

330
00:19:35.878 --> 00:19:39.178
That person is the one who held chopsticks using his left hand

331
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.978
and served us fish that he himself caught.

332
00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:44.878
The owner of this inn!

333
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:47.778
You're the only one who fits!

334
00:19:47.778 --> 00:19:49.978
But that's not enough to...

335
00:19:49.978 --> 00:19:52.778
You mentioned earlier, didn't you?

336
00:19:52.778 --> 00:19:55.878
And, did you find him at all?

337
00:19:55.878 --> 00:19:59.178
The perp who deleted the video from Mr. Aoki's camera?

338
00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:03.678
It's true that the digital camera can also take videos.

339
00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:09.178
But, how did you know that a video was deleted and not photos?

340
00:20:09.178 --> 00:20:12.278
The ones who know that are, the late Mr. Aoki

341
00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:16.278
and the one who deleted the data... the perp!

342
00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:21.978
Then, what about him having seen a suspicious character?

343
00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:24.978
It's probably an imaginary character

344
00:20:24.978 --> 00:20:27.378
that he made up to keep from being suspected.

345
00:20:30.178 --> 00:20:32.778
It was an accident at first.

346
00:20:55.778 --> 00:20:59.178
I didn't think I was being filmed.

347
00:21:01.378 --> 00:21:05.178
He tried to persuade me to turn myself in.

348
00:21:05.178 --> 00:21:07.478
He told me to atone for my crime.

349
00:21:07.478 --> 00:21:08.978
That's why...

350
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:21.978
I thought I got rid of all the evidence and yet...

351
00:21:21.978 --> 00:21:25.878
Darn it!

352
00:22:49.978 --> 00:22:53.478
Thank you so very much.

353
00:22:53.478 --> 00:22:54.978
Please cheer up.

354
00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:58.478
Mr. Aoki helped us solve the case.

355
00:22:58.478 --> 00:23:02.578
Besides, I'm sure that Mr. Aoki also saved a certain person's life, too.

356
00:23:02.578 --> 00:23:03.678
Huh?

357
00:23:03.678 --> 00:23:06.078
What do you mean, Conan?

358
00:23:06.078 --> 00:23:07.878
Mr. Shirakawa...

359
00:23:07.878 --> 00:23:11.178
He said he came to see the mirage

360
00:23:11.178 --> 00:23:14.978
and yet, he was empty-handed without binoculars or a camera, right?

361
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:17.778
And the only thing that was in his trunk

362
00:23:17.778 --> 00:23:20.178
were two bottles of sleeping pills.

363
00:23:20.178 --> 00:23:21.678
I think that Mr. Shirakawa probably

364
00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:25.178
came to Uozu intending to commit suicide.

365
00:23:25.178 --> 00:23:28.878
But he was buying gifts for his family at the hotel, right?

366
00:23:28.878 --> 00:23:31.678
That's proof that he decided not to commit suicide.

367
00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:35.378
That's why I think that Mr. Aoki was the one who made Mr. Aoki

368
00:23:35.378 --> 00:23:37.678
have second thoughts about committing suicide.

369
00:23:39.078 --> 00:23:41.878
I see! I'm sure that's it!

370
00:23:46.978 --> 00:23:49.878
Yep! I guess so. I'm sure that's it.

371
00:23:51.178 --> 00:23:54.678
"Next Episode"

372
00:23:54.678 --> 00:23:56.578
Rikumichi Kusuda?

373
00:23:56.578 --> 00:23:59.978
Oh, you mean the spy from the Organization that snuck into the hospital

374
00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:01.678
where Reina Mizunashi was staying.

375
00:24:01.678 --> 00:24:04.278
And, what about that?

376
00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:07.278
Please tell the people at the FBI

377
00:24:07.278 --> 00:24:09.878
to not leak this information to anyone outside!

378
00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:12.078
One of the guys of the Organization, Bourbon...

379
00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:14.978
Tohru Amuro is sniffing around, you see!

380
00:24:15.878 --> 00:24:21.178
Next Conan, "The Scarlet Prelude"

381
00:24:36.378 --> 00:24:38.878
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:38.878 --> 00:24:41.578
"An answer sheet"

383
00:24:41.578 --> 00:24:43.878
Did someone say "pro"? Did they mean me?

384
00:24:43.878 --> 00:24:46.078
I don't have time for you!
