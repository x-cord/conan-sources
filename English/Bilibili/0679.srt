1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,140
A mystery drama staged in Nagasaki

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,740
in the days of the end of the Edo era,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,240
in which Ryoma Sakamoto acts as a detective.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,840
The scriptwriter who is in the midst of writing the scenario for the drama,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
"Kosaku Tatsumi (45), Scriptwriter" -Kosaku Tatsumi, suddenly disappears,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,540
and Pops is asked to deduce the culprit of this incomplete script is.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,940
When we investigate Mr. Tatsumi's room,

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,140
we find hidden in the closet

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,840
many clippings of the band of thieves that stole artworks.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,040
There must be something lurking behind.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,440
Just then, the continuation of the scenario

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,040
is received by mail from Mr. Tatsumi whose whereabouts is unknown.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,640
In this script, a second murder occurs,

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
and a character called Otei of Miuraya, who was not scheduled to appear

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,440
makes an appearance.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Then, to our surprise, Ran ends up acting the role of Otei.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,640
And because of this, I end up dressing up like this too.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,740
But, Otei turns out to have several strange dialogs.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,740
And only the fonts of her lines were different from the rest.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,940
Could this be a message from Mr. Tatsumi?

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,040
Just then, an incident occurs.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,940
Mr. Sakota in charge of small props

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,740
is attacked by someone.

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,240
What?

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,140
Ran?

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,040
Ran's the culprit?

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,940
The vivid colored memories of summer

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,040
solve mysteries all season round.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Can the end of the Edo Era drama be completed?

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,240
The hidden behind the hidden.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,140
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:25,698
"The Nagasaki Mystery (The Present)".

35
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,198
Because the wounds on Mr. Sakota's face

36
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:34,098
"Kazuomi Sakota (35), Props Master" -was from being punched,

37
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,198
the Nagasaki Prefectural Police Office,

38
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,098
took Ran in as a prime suspect,

39
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,998
and interrogated her because she owned a black belt in Karate.

40
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:42,398
I don't know!

41
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:45,298
At that time, I was alone trying to memorize my lines.

42
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:47,398
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

43
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:49,798
Prove...

44
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,498
Something yellow seems to have passed across me.

45
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,198
What was that?

46
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:00,698
No good. I can't remember.

47
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:06,498
Ran was memorizing her lines just about here.

48
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,498
Talk about yellow... The only thing in sight are these flowers.

49
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:13,398
I need to find an eye-witness, after all.

50
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:14,698
Back at the time when the incident occurred,

51
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,398
I had no choice but to find a person who had witnessed Ran there.

52
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:21,798
What's this?

53
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,498
"Statue of Puccini" -Puccini, the composer of the opera "Madame Butterfly".

54
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:27,698
And...

55
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:29,798
"Statue of Tamaki Miura" -this is Tamaki Miura,

56
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,398
the heroine who acted as Madame Butterfly.

57
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,998
Miura?

58
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:34,998
I wonder if it has anything to do

59
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,898
with the part Ran is playing, "Otei of Miuraya"?

60
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:40,198
Mr. Sakota loved opera too.

61
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:42,298
Of the Japanese actresses who played the role of Madame Butterfly,

62
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,798
other than Ms. Tamaki Miura,

63
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:47,698
Ms. Teiko Kiwa was also famous.

64
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:50,898
Tamaki Miura and Teiko Kiwa.

65
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,798
Otei of Miuraya!

66
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:56,898
"Shimizu (68), Nagasaki Saruku/ Guide" -Let's move on then, shall we?

67
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,098
Yellow...

68
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,698
Sir.

69
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:03,498
Have you seen her?

70
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,798
Yeah. I remember seeing her.

71
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,098
If it's that girl,

72
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:12,298
I saw her sitting at the bench reading something right through.

73
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,498
Thanks to the testimony of the guide, Mr. Shimizu,

74
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:17,698
Ran was cleared of suspicion.

75
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:22,398
But I wonder why Mr. Sakota pointed at Ran back then.

76
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,598
Well, we've got a problem.

77
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:26,998
I heard from the officer just now

78
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:31,198
that a person who resembled Tatsumi was witnessed near here!

79
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,198
-What? -What?

80
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,498
Oh, no.

81
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:35,898
Really?

82
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,198
"Taizo Ooki (52)" -It seems that he ran off after a scream

83
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,898
"Producer of a drama production company" -was heard from the parking lot.

84
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,098
"Futaba Nanao (23) as Ine Karasuma" -That's a lie!

85
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:42,898
"Ryuhei Kishimura (30), Assistant Director" -Mr. Tatsumi would never...

86
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,598
It's definitely a lie!

87
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:47,398
Do you know anything?

88
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,498
No.

89
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:52,198
I just know that Mr. Tatsumi who writes such wonderful scripts

90
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,098
would never do a thing like that.

91
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,598
"Keisuke Sakakibara (45), TV Drama Director" -Leave the case to the police.

92
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:59,998
"Akikazu Nakane (48), Cameraman" -More than that, Mr. Mouri,

93
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,198
what about the culprit in the drama?

94
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,898
Well, as to that...

95
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:08,698
Hey, I wonder why Mr. Sakota was in this parking lot.

96
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:11,898
It was still too early to get ready to go home, right?

97
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,298
The continuation of the script came,

98
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:16,898
so there was still a lot more to do and yet,

99
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,498
why would he secretly flee off like that?

100
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:21,298
Flee?

101
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,998
I see!

102
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:24,898
Mr. Sakota read the script,

103
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:29,098
found out that he was in danger and fled?

104
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,798
In other words, are you saying that Tatsumi,

105
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:32,598
who supposed that Sakota would be attacked,

106
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:35,798
secretly hid a message in the script?

107
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:40,698
That's probably included in the dying message, "Kyu" (nine)!

108
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:43,298
"Kyu"... What on earth does it mean?

109
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:46,498
Well, it indicates you,

110
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,798
Ms. Futaba Nanao!

111
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:48,798
What?

112
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:49,798
-What? -What?

113
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,498
No way.

114
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,198
But, why?

115
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,398
"Futaba Nanao" -It's simple addition.

116
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:56,898
"Nana: 7" -If you add the number seven, in the name Nanao

117
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:59,298
"Futa: 2" -and the number two in the name Futaba, you get a sum of nine.

118
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:00,298
In other words,

119
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:04,598
the message meant, Futaba is after you, so be careful!

120
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,098
No... no way.

121
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:10,498
Then, why did you offer to be our guide of your own initiative?

122
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,698
Wasn't it because you wanted to find Mr. Tatsumi before anyone else did,

123
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,198
and shut him up as you did Mr. Sakota?

124
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:17,798
No!

125
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:21,198
I was just merely worried about Mr. Tatsumi.

126
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:23,498
"Benichiyo Yamashita (42) as Tsuru" -What forced logic

127
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:26,498
to say that seven plus two equals nine.

128
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,498
It's sundown already,

129
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,898
so I'm calling it a day.

130
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:31,998
You can't do that.

131
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:35,598
I guess it can't be helped, let's call it a day then.

132
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,698
What's wrong, Ooki?

133
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:40,998
Hey, Bara, I just remembered

134
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:45,198
Ochiyo was known as an action actress in her younger days, wasn't she?

135
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,698
Really?

136
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:49,998
Come to think of it, she used to practice Chinese martial arts too.

137
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:53,998
You could also say the same about Cho who used to act as a boxer.

138
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:55,798
"Chojiro Sazanami (45) as Chyubei Soneya" -Give me a break,

139
00:07:55,798 --> 00:07:58,398
"Kyonosuke Sasahara (33) as Ryoma Sakamoto" -it's been 20 years already.

140
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:00,198
Give me a break too,

141
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,198
with suspects popping up one after the other...

142
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,298
Moreover, all of you are actors.

143
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,998
Last night Andrew mentioned that

144
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:09,198
Tatsumi unlike the historical fact,

145
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,798
didn't like Glover and Tsuru being married,

146
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,798
-but is that true? -No, not really.

147
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:20,098
Because Tatsumi's the one who suggested to marry the two.

148
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,198
"Andrew Hatta (50) as Glover" -Is that true?

149
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:25,698
Yeah, although that's something that he would rarely do.

150
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,098
Where are you now?

151
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,698
I was just about to leave.

152
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,098
Yes, that's right.

153
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,798
Yeah, but...

154
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:42,398
Please do something about it, I beg you!

155
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,298
"The Nagasaki Ropeway"

156
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,098
How beautiful.

157
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,398
-Nice, isn't it? -Fantastic!

158
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:57,698
"Mt. Inasa, The peak"

159
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,298
Mr. Sazanami was attacked?

160
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,198
The police called just now.

161
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:13,198
The place is at the observatory of Mt. Inasa.

162
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,998
Why'd he go to a place like that?

163
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,598
"Treatment Room" -I wanted to see

164
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,998
the world widely famous night scenery of Nagasaki.

165
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:22,398
Then, I was suddenly attacked by someone there.

166
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:26,198
As to that, I think I tore the strap off when I was struggling.

167
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,798
It seems that Tatsumi's fingerprints were detected from that strap.

168
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,298
Strap? What kind?

169
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:36,398
One with a silver heart on it.

170
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,398
A silver heart...

171
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,398
Don't tell me that...

172
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,498
Okay, please be quiet!

173
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:51,398
Please don't look towards the camera, okay?

174
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:52,798
-Okay! Okay!

175
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,998
Why do I have to do something like this too?

176
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,098
Conan is cute, isn't he?

177
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,698
I told you I know!

178
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:04,898
He's been...

179
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,098
Ready... Start!

180
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:13,198
Cut!

181
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,498
Hey, hey, the writing order isn't correct.

182
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:17,098
I'll rewind it.

183
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,098
The first stroke is not this, but the "no" part!

184
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:23,698
If I remember correctly,

185
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,198
that too was...

186
00:10:26,998 --> 00:10:28,398
As to that...

187
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:31,698
See, the image was attached to the script,

188
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,898
saying to make it exactly like this.

189
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:35,498
Just as I thought.

190
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:39,098
"Ask Otei of Miuraya".

191
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,798
"Figures are important".

192
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:44,198
"Figures will solve everything".

193
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:48,698
Tamaki Miura and Teiko Kiwa who acted as Madame Butterfly...

194
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,998
The stroke of the kanji character "kyu" written in wrong order.

195
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:54,698
Madame Butterfly... Butterfly...

196
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:57,598
I see! I got it!

197
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,698
The meaning of the dying message!

198
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:03,898
In Nakashima River, a monster resides.

199
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,498
Its weak point is

200
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,098
the second tooth from the left of the lower jaw.

201
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:11,498
-Sorry. -Conan, do that, won't you?

202
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:12,798
With your glasses.

203
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:18,098
-Like this? -Yup, right, right.

204
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:20,598
So, that's the story.

205
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,498
I found it!

206
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:44,798
A mail's come from Mr. Tatsumi!

207
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:46,198
It says he'll hand over

208
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:48,798
the remainder of the script at Oshirasu so to come there!

209
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:49,998
Oshirasu?

210
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,698
-What? -What?

211
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:03,207
"Nagasaki Museum of History and Culture"

212
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,207
You received mail from Mr. Tatsumi?

213
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,207
-Is that true? -Yes.

214
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:10,207
It says that he would hand over the remainder of the script here.

215
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:14,207
"Oshirasu Theater" -This is a theater where performances are staged?

216
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,507
Is your wound okay?

217
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,707
Yeah, it's no big deal.

218
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,507
Tatsumi's not here yet?

219
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,407
The actors are all here.

220
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:32,607
Before Mr. Tatsumi arrives...

221
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:37,107
I, Kogoro Mouri will disclose the culprit of the real case,

222
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:40,307
the one who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami!

223
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:44,007
Are you saying that it's not Mr. Tatsumi?

224
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:47,307
But, I thought Tatsumi's fingerprints were found on the strap.

225
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:51,507
That indeed is the trap that the culprit set up using the strap!

226
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,207
The culprit is...

227
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:56,907
you, Mr. Kyonosuke Sasahara!

228
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,207
Me?

229
00:12:58,207 --> 00:12:59,907
There are many people in the staff and cast here

230
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:03,107
that have numbers included in their names.

231
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:06,107
That goes for you too, Mr. Sasahara.

232
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,407
Where, in my name is it?

233
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,407
The kanji character of your name Kyonosuke,

234
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,707
can also be read, Kei (quadrillion), which indicates the unit of numbers!

235
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,507
So what?

236
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:19,007
Even the dying message in the script was a number!

237
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,907
So, what if it was?

238
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:23,707
Well, you see...

239
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:29,507
You were calling somewhere right through, weren't you?

240
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:32,307
And, it seems you were arguing about something!

241
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,607
Well, that's...

242
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:38,707
I'll bet you were arguing with none other Mr. Tatsumi, no?

243
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,707
Wrong! That was...

244
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:52,207
I'll tell you the truth already!

245
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,507
I was arguing with the office!

246
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,107
The fact is...

247
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,207
I have a wife and child.

248
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,207
Oh, that's new news.

249
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,207
But, I thought you were single

250
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:06,107
and always ranked on the top of being the most wanted as a boyfriend.

251
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:09,407
And, a photo shots magazine got hold of this info,

252
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,707
so I was pleading with the office

253
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:13,907
to keep this hidden at all cost, because being single was what I went on.

254
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,807
"TMS Production" -See!

255
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:20,007
I see.

256
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:21,507
Then, you, Benichiyo!

257
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:26,507
You were out the night that Mr. Sazanami was attacked, weren't you?

258
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,607
Are you going to suspect me next?

259
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,507
Where on earth were you?

260
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,007
Do I have to answer?

261
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:33,807
Don't tell me that's you, Ochiyo?

262
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,207
Like, you were eating Turkish Rice?

263
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,207
"Kitchen Seiji"

264
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,407
"Turkish Rice" -Bull's eye.

265
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:47,707
In fact, I'm on a diet for my next job.

266
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:52,807
But, I just couldn't keep from eating the famed Turkish Rice of Nagasaki.

267
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,707
So, then who's the culprit...

268
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:57,807
I'm spinning...

269
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,007
Excuse me,

270
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:03,707
I will start the real show from now.

271
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:06,407
So this is the famous Sleeping Kogoro!

272
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,807
-Roll the cameras! -Okay!

273
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,207
The fact is, the letter that you received from Mr. Tatsumi this morning

274
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,307
is what I prepared.

275
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,207
What?

276
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,207
In order to indict the culprit who attacked Mr. Sakota and Mr. Sazanami.

277
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,707
That culprit is...

278
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,307
Ran, you!

279
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,807
-What? -What?

280
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,507
No!

281
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,207
She did?

282
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,907
Hey, Dad...

283
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,907
Cool it and listen, Ran.

284
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,707
The second murder that was written in the script,

285
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:38,207
what was the dying message?

286
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,407
Like I said, it was the kanji character, "kyu".

287
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,807
Right.

288
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,507
But, the order in which the stroke was written was incorrect.

289
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:47,807
You can tell by checking the traces of what was written on the soil.

290
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:48,907
In other words,

291
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,307
the dying message was not "Kyu"

292
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:53,407
but rather written in hiragana, "Tei"!

293
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,007
"Tei"?

294
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,307
In other words, Ran,

295
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:59,907
it's indicating the role that you acted of Otei of Miuraya!

296
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:03,507
Of course, it's only what happened in the drama.

297
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:05,607
However, I think that Mr. Tatsumi's script,

298
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:11,007
while fictitious is pointing to some actual case and accusing it.

299
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,807
An actual case?

300
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,107
Please take a good look at the script.

301
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,707
Only certain dialogs are written in different fonts.

302
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:21,707
And if that is the message sent from Mr. Tatsumi...

303
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,907
First, for Otei's dialog.

304
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,007
Figures are important.

305
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,107
Figures will solve everything.

306
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,507
With this dialog and dying message,

307
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:35,007
Mr. Tatsumi tried to express a word that has to do with a figure

308
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:38,307
that is included in a certain person's name.

309
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:39,507
Besides...

310
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:47,307
That was the included in Mr. Chojiro Sazanami's name.

311
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,907
"Cho"

312
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,907
No.

313
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,607
It can't be!

314
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:53,907
Mr. Sazanami?

315
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,707
Just... just what're you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

316
00:16:56,707 --> 00:17:01,107
I'm saying that the culprit for the series of incidents is you.

317
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,407
Wait!

318
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,807
Don't you write Cho with "Chi" instead of "Tei"?

319
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,507
That's right!

320
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,607
In the hiragana of olden days Japan,

321
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:12,407
they wrote "chocho" (butterfly) as "Teifuteifu".

322
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,407
Why all of a sudden does the hiragana "chocho" appear?

323
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,707
That's because Mr. Tatsumi's message

324
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:20,907
is greatly connected with Madame Butterfly.

325
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,907
Ask the daughter of the shipping agency Miuraya, Otei,

326
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:28,007
for the details.

327
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,807
The font for this dialog is also different.

328
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,807
If Otei of Miuraya

329
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,907
"Tamaki Miura, Teiko Kiwa" -refers to Ms. Tamaki Miura and Ms. Teiko Kiwa,

330
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:39,607
who acted out Madame Butterfly of the opera,

331
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,407
Otei would connect to Madame Butterfly.

332
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:44,307
In other words, the dying message

333
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:46,807
is pointing out "tei" from the word "Teifuteifu"!

334
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,607
I see!

335
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,507
That... that's forced logic!

336
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:52,307
There is a saying that Madame Butterfly

337
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:55,607
was maybe modeled after Glover's wife, Tsuru.

338
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,307
The reason why Mr. Tatsumi, despite changing the fact of history,

339
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,507
created the character Tsuru, who appeared in the drama

340
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,707
was a hidden advanced hint to the dying message!

341
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,307
In other words, Tatsumi to begin with, in this script,

342
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:10,007
had been trying to indict Cho?

343
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,207
Probably.

344
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:14,707
But the incident occurred after that, you know?

345
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:18,607
Mr. Tatsumi was trying to indict another case.

346
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,207
Another case?

347
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:23,707
Mr. Sakota, who likes opera, was the only one who realized it.

348
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:26,007
Before I solved the mystery,

349
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,207
he tried to flee

350
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,007
and was attacked by you.

351
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:32,907
Mr. Sakota pointed at Ran

352
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:38,207
because Otei was a character who was created to indict Mr. Sazanami.

353
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,607
Please wait.

354
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,507
Are you saying that the two were into something together?

355
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:44,807
-Conan! -Yes!

356
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,707
This is what was in Tatsumi's room.

357
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:52,607
Don't tell me they were involved in this!

358
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:54,007
You gotta be kidding!

359
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,107
I was attacked by Tatsumi after that, you know!

360
00:18:57,107 --> 00:19:00,307
You acted all of that out yourself,

361
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,907
in order to put all the blame on Mr. Tatsumi.

362
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,207
What?

363
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,907
How ruthless!

364
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,807
It... it's all baloney!

365
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,207
I have no choice.

366
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,507
I'll show you conclusive evidence, then.

367
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,807
Huh?

368
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,007
"A monster resides in the Nakashima River".

369
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:18,007
Do you remember that dialog of Otei?

370
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,007
Conan!

371
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:23,107
This is the identity of the monster!

372
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,707
Monster?

373
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,507
That's Megane Bridge.

374
00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:29,107
But if you do this...

375
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:35,207
See, it looks like a monster, doesn't it?

376
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,407
True!

377
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:37,407
That's why,

378
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,507
"The weak point of the monster

379
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:41,607
is the second tooth from the left on the lower jaw".

380
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,207
I think it's referring to this stepping stone.

381
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,007
Since Pops told me to,

382
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,407
I found this over there last night.

383
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,607
This micro SD.

384
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,407
Sir! Will you please check what's in here?

385
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:55,707
Okay.

386
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:57,407
We won't use this small prop anymore,

387
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,707
so let's put it in here.

388
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:02,107
We'll make millions with this again.

389
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:04,407
This is...

390
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,807
As you can see,

391
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:06,907
they hid the artworks that they stole

392
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:10,007
in the small props used for filming and transported them,

393
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,107
and were selling them off secretly

394
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,907
to the rich and collectors whenever they went on locations.

395
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,407
This is recorded proof of what they were doing.

396
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:19,807
Mr. Tatsumi tried to indict them in the script of this drama

397
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:23,807
but sensed that his life was in danger and disappeared.

398
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,607
But, after finding that you appeared,

399
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,907
he secretly embedded a hint

400
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,407
in the continuation of the script and sent it over?

401
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:35,407
Sleeping Kogoro, please solve this riddle for me!

402
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:37,707
It's just like him.

403
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:40,507
And, where is Mr. Tatsumi?

404
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,207
As to his whereabouts,

405
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,407
Mr. Sazanami should know.

406
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:48,107
No... I don't. Why would I?

407
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:50,707
Please tell me! Where's Mr. Tatsumi?

408
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,307
Where's Kosaku?

409
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:58,707
You can't get away with this, Mr. Sazanami.

410
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,607
The one who had Mr. Tatsumi's strap

411
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:05,007
was none other than you!

412
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:12,007
Futaba, don't tell me that maybe you're...

413
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:14,707
With Tatsumi?

414
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,107
Yes.

415
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,507
You offered to help me

416
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:22,207
all because you wanted to save your beloved Mr. Tatsumi.

417
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,307
Is that so?

418
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:27,807
But we weren't allowed to have love affairs at the office

419
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:31,107
and had to keep it a secret at all costs.

420
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,807
I'm very sorry.

421
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:38,807
But, with all the evidence he had on him,

422
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,507
I wonder why Mr. Tatsumi didn't go to the police.

423
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:44,207
He probably wanted them to turn themselves in.

424
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:47,107
In this drama, where all old colleagues got together,

425
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:50,107
I think he wanted to get Sazanami back on the right track.

426
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,207
Kosaku!

427
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:53,407
Futaba!

428
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,507
Mr. Sakota who was in ICU regained consciousness,

429
00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:24,707
and from his testimony, everything was substantiated.

430
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,507
The band of thieves responsible for stealing artworks that are behind them,

431
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,807
would also eventually be arrested.

432
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,207
Filming of the drama was resumed.

433
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:34,507
Of course,

434
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:38,407
after the scenes where Mr. Sazanami, Ran and I were to appear were deleted,

435
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:42,807
a new script was written at great speed by Mr. Tatsumi.

436
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:48,507
As to the relationship of the two,

437
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:52,007
the office approved of it, I hear.

438
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,707
I'm happy to hear that!

439
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:55,407
Hey, did you know?

440
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:57,707
When Nagasaki is written in English,

441
00:23:57,707 --> 00:24:00,507
the alphabet "I" (love) comes at the end!

442
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,707
Like those two!

443
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:12,007
"Next Episode" -So, this is the rumored cactus?

444
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,307
Uncle?

445
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:19,907
Gosh. I sure run into you kids a lot at the scenes of crimes.

446
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:21,707
Big brother, so, just as I thought...

447
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:23,407
Wrong! I didn't do it!

448
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:26,307
I see, so that's the story.

449
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:29,207
If so, the culprit is...

450
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,407
I figured everything out with that alarm just now!

451
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:33,707
What did you say?

452
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,307
Next Conan,

453
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,607
"Cactus Rhapsody".

454
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:57,607
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:59,307
"Heater".

456
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,207
Dad's so cool when he's asleep.

457
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:04,307
Ran, you've got thorns like a cactus.
