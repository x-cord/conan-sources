1
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,840
Prize contest, lucky draw and lottery.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,440
The lucky man who's envied by all.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Something's bound to happen if you're too lucky.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,740
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,325
"First prize" -Red for the first prize!

8
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,125
"Second prize" -Blue for the second prize!

9
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,825
"Third prize" -Yellow for the third prize!

10
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,825
Please, at least the third prize.

11
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,525
Give me the yellow!

12
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,525
Come on!

13
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,625
White.

14
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,325
You won a pack of tissues!

15
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,425
Here you go!

16
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:32,825
Come on! Forget about it, Genta!

17
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:35,325
Things can't always go the way you want.

18
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,125
That's right, Genta.

19
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,125
Yeah, but...

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,725
"Third prize" -I really wanted the prize.

21
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,225
At least the third prize. That digital camera.

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,625
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

23
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,325
Oh, he's.

24
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:53,225
"Makoto Owada (30)" -Dr. Owada, isn't he?

25
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,425
He won a prize again.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,225
So you know him?

27
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,825
He is the doctor at Beika Hospital.

28
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,825
He's a doctor!

29
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,025
No, he is a great doctor.

30
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:06,825
He's enthusiastic and talented.

31
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,625
He's also kind to everybody too.

32
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,825
Who would say bad about him?

33
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,225
Nobody.

34
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,325
Right.

35
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,425
Why don't you see that doctor, Conan?

36
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,625
Yeah, you should!

37
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,625
It's okay! I'm healthy.

38
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,325
Ayumi?

39
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,025
You said he won a prize again.

40
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,325
Yeah.

41
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:28,525
I think it was two week ago...

42
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,825
So beautiful!

43
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,625
"Super scratch lottery"

44
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,125
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

45
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,125
Really? The lottery ticket too?

46
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,425
He must be lucky.

47
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,425
He's too lucky!

48
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,225
I think my mom told me that

49
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:54,625
last week he won Union Beer lucky draw too.

50
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,425
I heard he's got a year supply of beer.

51
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,625
So within a week,

52
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,025
Dr. Owada has won money from lottery ticket, Union Beer,

53
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:05,825
and a digital camera.

54
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,425
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I'm home!

55
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:12,625
Yeah!

56
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,625
I got beer supply for a year!

57
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,025
Come on, Union Beer. You can't do this!

58
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:26,325
Pops, what happened to Union Beer?

59
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,125
I thought I got this letter because I won,

60
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,025
but it was actually a letter of apology

61
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,525
that the drawing had been postponed until next month.

62
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,725
Gosh!

63
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:36,925
The drawing had been postponed?

64
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,025
It's true!

65
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:41,725
But then, what did Dr. Owada win?

66
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:49,725
"The Lucky Man's Suspense"

67
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,025
Dr. Owada didn't win the prize?

68
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,425
Yeah, it cannot be true.

69
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:59,125
Because they haven't done the drawing yet.

70
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,625
You're right.

71
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,225
If this is what's really happening,

72
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,125
then the rest of the prizes cannot be real too.

73
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,425
What do you mean the other prizes?

74
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:09,325
But it's true that he won the lottery.

75
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,825
I think it's also true that he won the lucky draw!

76
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,925
We saw it, right?

77
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,325
Yes, I did.

78
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,725
And you guys all saw it too.

79
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,325
But not the exact moment.

80
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,625
What? Cheating?

81
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,925
Can you stay here?

82
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,525
Let's talk about it somewhere else.

83
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,625
Okay, I admit that I cheated a bit.

84
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,425
All right, go ahead!

85
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,825
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

86
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:04,925
So it was.

87
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,425
Cheating!

88
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:07,525
It's not fair!

89
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,725
Just as I thought.

90
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:11,325
But the doctor doesn't know this!

91
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:14,425
This was actually his wife's request.

92
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:17,625
What? The doctor's wife's request, you said?

93
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,525
Right. She asked me to give him

94
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,425
the third prize when he came over.

95
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,525
She said she wanted to cheer him up

96
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:28,025
since he had lost confidence as a doctor.

97
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,825
Since Dr. Owada saved my life before,

98
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,125
so I wanted to help him too.

99
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,525
So you did it to return the favor.

100
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:38,725
But cheating is still bad!

101
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:42,525
That prize could've been won by somebody else.

102
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:45,325
Well, actually the doctor's wife brought the camera,

103
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,125
when she came over to the tent.

104
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,725
What? She prepared it herself?

105
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:53,425
So that means, Mrs. Owada gave you the digital camera she bought

106
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:56,925
and you gave it to Dr. Owada as prize, am I right?

107
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:57,925
Yeah.

108
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,025
Nobody was victim, even if it was a cheating.

109
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,425
Then, this isn't a crime, is it?

110
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,525
"Owada" -I asked him?

111
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,225
No, I never ask him to do that.

112
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:14,125
But the guy said the doctor's wife came.

113
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,225
First of all, my husband is doing pretty well at work.

114
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:21,425
He lost confidence as a doctor and depressed?

115
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,925
No. It can't be!

116
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,225
Why is it so different?

117
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:27,425
Yeah, it is.

118
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:29,425
It's weird.

119
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:34,425
Oh, right. I heard that you won Union Beer. Is that true?

120
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:36,325
I heard there's been a rumor like that

121
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,525
but that's not true either.

122
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,425
Because neither of us can't drink.

123
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,125
There's no reason for him to enter a lucky draw

124
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,025
for a one-year supply of beer.

125
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,825
-What? -He didn't even enter the lucky draw?

126
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,625
Whether it's the lucky draw or the beer...

127
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,725
I think somebody has mixed us up with someone with the same last name.

128
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,625
-What's going on? -What's going on?

129
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,925
She really asked me, trust me!

130
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,825
She was the doctor's wife!

131
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,025
I'm not lying!

132
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,925
She said she was Dr. Owada's wife from Beika Hospital.

133
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:12,025
She was a tall, slim, beautiful woman.

134
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,225
What's the point of telling you a lie?

135
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,925
I have to go. I'm busy.

136
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,225
She was a tall, slim.

137
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,425
Beautiful woman.

138
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,125
It can't be her.

139
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,725
It seems we're getting somewhere.

140
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,825
It seems to be true that Dr. Owada won the lottery.

141
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,325
But the lucky draw was a setup.

142
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:37,325
The beer lucky draw is nothing but a baseless lie.

143
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,925
This is the work of a woman

144
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,625
who is tall, slim and beautiful

145
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,825
and try to make everybody thinks that Dr. Owada is lucky.

146
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,025
But what's the point of doing so anyway?

147
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,225
She even bought the prize for the lucky draw herself.

148
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,925
That's it!

149
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,425
What's waiting for her

150
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:59,025
after making the doctor a "super lucky man"?

151
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:04,525
Here's your prize, a pack of tissue!

152
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,325
There's gotta be something.

153
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:08,425
Some kind of reason to it.

154
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,825
We never win a prize, do we?

155
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:14,225
But you know, Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital.

156
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,225
Yes, I heard!

157
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:17,125
He won the third prize, right?

158
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,725
He also won the Union Beer's drawing, right?

159
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,325
Sounds like the doctor is sucking up fortune from us.

160
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:27,325
Yeah, so somebody was saying that,

161
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,025
too much luck can actually make other people envious

162
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:32,725
and that could bring about misfortune on the doctor.

163
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,125
Making others envious?

164
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,525
That's true. Envy is a scary thing.

165
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,925
Yeah.

166
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,525
People envy others when they are too lucky.

167
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,625
Maybe the purpose of that woman's action is...

168
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:50,225
Dr. Owada is an amazing guy, right?

169
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:51,925
Why are you asking that again?

170
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,225
I told you, nobody says bad about him. Right?

171
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,425
Yup!

172
00:09:57,425 --> 00:10:02,425
He's not a guy people hold a grudge against.

173
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:05,225
Maybe that's why the woman has been acting that way.

174
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,725
What's the matter, Conan?

175
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:10,625
Maybe that woman

176
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,525
is trying to make a forest.

177
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,925
-A forest? -A forest?

178
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:17,325
What do you mean by a forest?

179
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,725
So then...

180
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,625
There should be many other lucky stories about Dr. Owada.

181
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,225
There must be.

182
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,125
Other lucky stories?

183
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,425
Yeah, and also stories about people envying him.

184
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:32,525
Perhaps the tall, slim, beautiful woman

185
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:35,825
is where all those stories are coming from.

186
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:40,025
We're gonna go out separately to find out who this woman is.

187
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,825
I'll do it by using some other route!

188
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,625
What was that? All of a sudden?

189
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,825
If my deduction is correct,

190
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,825
then something is going to happen pretty soon.

191
00:10:57,688 --> 00:11:00,988
He told me to find out who but where should I go?

192
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,488
"Beika Kindergarten" -You mean Dr. Owada at Beika Hospital?

193
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:05,888
Yeah!

194
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:07,188
Owada?

195
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,688
I heard he found tons of gold coins

196
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,788
when he was digging a hole in his backyard!

197
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:14,288
Really? Oh, my. He must be lucky.

198
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,888
It's not all good stories though.

199
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:19,788
His tremendous luck is actually making many people envy him.

200
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,788
Excuse me.

201
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:24,088
About that story, where did you hear about it?

202
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:27,088
About the people envying Dr. Owada!

203
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:28,888
"Osawa Fruit and Vegetables Store" -A hundred million yen!

204
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,188
He found a big bag with a hundred million yen in it!

205
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:32,788
Dr. Owada did?

206
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:35,688
I heard so, and when he returned the money to the owner,

207
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,688
he received 5 million yen from the owner as a reward.

208
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,788
He's a lucky guy, really.

209
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:43,688
From who did you hear that story?

210
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,688
It was one of our customers, I think.

211
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:49,388
Wasn't that a woman with a tall and slim body?

212
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:52,888
But why?

213
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,088
-That's because... -I really don't know,

214
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:58,188
but I swear some terrible thing is about to happen for sure!

215
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,788
"Beika Hospital" -A person who hates Dr. Owada?

216
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:04,188
It's a woman, tall and slim.

217
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:08,788
I don't think there's anybody that hates Dr. Owada in this world.

218
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,888
Not only by the patients but also his co-workers.

219
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:14,688
Dr. Owada is loved by everybody.

220
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:15,788
Thank you!

221
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,088
Bye.

222
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,488
Good afternoon.

223
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,788
Dr. Owada.

224
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,388
How are you feeling today?

225
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,688
I'm quite well, thank you.

226
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:25,988
That's good! But take it easy, okay?

227
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:28,188
Thank you, doctor.

228
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,788
Okay, take care.

229
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,688
There's nothing in the hospital.

230
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,188
It hurts...

231
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,588
Hiroaki, I told you not to run inside the hospital.

232
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,588
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,888
But I'm glad that you can run now.

234
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:48,988
Yeah!

235
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,488
Having a fight with Dr. Owada?

236
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:58,488
Yeah.

237
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:02,288
Who would do such thing to that great doctor?

238
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:04,788
It was a woman, I was shocked!

239
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:05,888
What?

240
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,188
Excuse me, sir!

241
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,388
About what you just said,

242
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,288
a woman was having a fight with Dr. Owada?

243
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:14,488
Yeah.

244
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:15,588
When?

245
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,788
It was about a month ago.

246
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,588
Mrs. Shiina...

247
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,488
Please calm down, Mrs. Shiina!

248
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,088
Please, Mrs. Shiina.

249
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,388
So her name is Mrs. Shiina?

250
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:38,188
She was tall and slim.

251
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,288
That must be her!

252
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,688
I think she was dressed in black.

253
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,888
Dressed in black.

254
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,388
It's me, I found her.

255
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:51,388
I found the woman!

256
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:57,988
Mitsuhiko.

257
00:13:57,988 --> 00:14:00,888
Conan, she's the one on the right.

258
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:07,888
"Akiko Shiina, (30)" -She's living in an apartment around here.

259
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,088
Her name is Akiko Shiina.

260
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:11,988
Shiina.

261
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:14,188
So you found her?

262
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,388
The one on the right.

263
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,088
I think I've met her before.

264
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,688
Come and find me, mom!

265
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,388
Hey, wait!

266
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,388
Hey, Conan.

267
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,688
I'm glad that Mrs. Shiina has got better.

268
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,888
Yeah. I thought she would never get over the shock

269
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,888
when her husband passed away.

270
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,488
Excuse me, aunties.

271
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:40,988
Did Mrs. Shiina lose her husband?

272
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:44,988
Yes. A month ago, Mr. Shiina was hit by a car.

273
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:48,488
The ambulance came and took him to the hospital right away.

274
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,288
Is that the motive?

275
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:55,588
I heard it was already too late

276
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,988
when the ambulance came to the scene of the accident.

277
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:01,788
What? So, it's not the doctor's fault?

278
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,488
What is she trying to do?

279
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,188
She looks like a kind mother to me.

280
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,488
Who is she?

281
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,988
Conan.

282
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:13,588
What did you ask?

283
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,188
Now I remember!

284
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:19,188
I knew I saw her somewhere before.

285
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:20,688
She was there.

286
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,988
Dr. Owada won the lottery ticket.

287
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:29,288
How can you laugh?

288
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,288
As if nothing happened at all,

289
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,688
without mourning the patient's death.

290
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,288
How could you act like that?

291
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:42,288
Now I see.

292
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,588
Perhaps that was when she decided to make the plan.

293
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:46,788
Let's go home.

294
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:47,788
-What? -What?

295
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:50,888
But you said something is going to happen soon.

296
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:52,888
Nothing is going to happen, I think.

297
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:55,288
I was just imagining things.

298
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,888
Imagining things?

299
00:15:56,888 --> 00:16:00,788
Then why was that woman making all those rumors?

300
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:02,088
-That's right! -That's right!

301
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:05,488
The aunties told me that she is a habitual liar, believe it or not.

302
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:06,888
A habitual liar?

303
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,988
What a troublemaker.

304
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:11,688
Man, you're the troublemaker.

305
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:15,288
Even you make a mistake sometimes, Conan.

306
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,188
Yeah.

307
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:18,788
Now, let's go home!

308
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,088
I won't let anything happen.

309
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,488
I will not!

310
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:35,788
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Where are you going, Conan?

311
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,188
To Dr. Agasa's house!

312
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,588
I left my stuff there.

313
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:40,888
-Be careful! -Okay!

314
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,288
Does it make you feel better,

315
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:17,788
if you kill Dr. Owada, Mrs. Shiina?

316
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,988
I'm Mouri, a private detective.

317
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:26,188
I heard some strange rumors about Dr. Owada,

318
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,688
so I did some investigation and ended up with you.

319
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,588
Akiko Shiina.

320
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:36,088
I heard your husband was hit by a car a month ago.

321
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:45,688
When the ambulance arrived at Beika Hospital,

322
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,388
everybody knew that nothing could be done.

323
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,988
It was too late.

324
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:52,188
But it was Dr. Owada who was on duty that night,

325
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,288
he encourage your husband.

326
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,188
You're gonna be just fine! I'm gonna save you, so don't die!

327
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,788
Come on!

328
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:02,688
He tried the best he could do to save your husband's life.

329
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:13,388
"In Operation"

330
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:32,688
Of course it wasn't Dr. Owada's fault.

331
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:34,588
And you knew it too.

332
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:36,288
You knew it, but...

333
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:39,688
How come you couldn't save him!

334
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,788
Why? Why?

335
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,788
As a matter of fact,

336
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,688
the driver who hit your husband is the one to be hated,

337
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:49,588
but he ran away, so there's no clue whatsoever about who he is.

338
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:56,288
Dr. Owada was the only one whom you could vent your anger out on.

339
00:18:56,288 --> 00:19:00,488
Then, your irrational anger against the doctor reaches its peak

340
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:03,888
after a half month passed.

341
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:07,688
How can you laugh?

342
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,788
As if nothing happened at all,

343
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:12,088
without mourning the patient's death.

344
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,588
How could you act like that?

345
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:16,688
You felt it was unforgivable

346
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,888
and you even felt that you wanted to kill him.

347
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:23,288
However, you knew that

348
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:27,788
nobody hates or holds a grudge against Dr. Owada.

349
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:28,988
If you just murdered him,

350
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:32,688
it was obvious that you were going to be the first suspect.

351
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:40,488
Because people witnessed you having a fight with Dr. Owada.

352
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,288
You wanted to kill Dr. Owada,

353
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:45,388
but you cannot be arrested no matter what.

354
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,388
If you get arrested,

355
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:51,688
there will be no future for your little children.

356
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:54,788
So you came up with a plan.

357
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,788
"Lottery ticket"

358
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,488
The rumors about Dr. Owada as a man of good luck.

359
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,988
You made them up.

360
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,388
Dr. Owada is so lucky, he's almost too lucky.

361
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,988
So there are many people, envying him.

362
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:10,888
That's what you wanted to make people think.

363
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,888
They weren't just simple rumors.

364
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:16,688
You changed them to make them sound more realistic.

365
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:20,888
This circumstance made it is safe for you to murder Dr. Owada,

366
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,188
since the police would think that

367
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:27,488
one of the envious people murdered him.

368
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:30,788
Moreover, it would be impossible to find out who actually did it.

369
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:32,088
Yes.

370
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:35,488
You created a fake situation,

371
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:39,188
in which there were a lot of people with motive of killing the doctor.

372
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:43,188
That way, you would just one of those people

373
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:46,288
who might be envious enough to kill the doctor but didn't.

374
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,588
It's like hiding a tree in a forest.

375
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,388
If there's no forest, then you can just make one.

376
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:55,188
You made up all those rumors so they would disguise you.

377
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,288
Am I right?

378
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,588
But Mrs. Shiina,

379
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:02,988
no matter how well you try,

380
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:05,888
a criminal attempt can never be kept hidden.

381
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:11,688
But, it's not too late.

382
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,988
Because nothing happened yet.

383
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:20,788
Nothing happened yet.

384
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:24,988
So, you can always still turn back.

385
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:27,688
Now, please go home,

386
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:30,588
before your beloved children wake up!

387
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:32,588
Mr. Mouri.

388
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,788
I will...

389
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,788
I will never do this again.

390
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,388
I know. It's gonna be all right.

391
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:47,288
You will be able to get over it.

392
00:23:21,888 --> 00:23:23,188
Did you watch yesterday's Masked Yaiba?

393
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:26,688
Yeah, the super Yaiba kick was incredible!

394
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:27,788
Good morning, everyone!

395
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:29,388
-Good morning! -Good morning!

396
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:32,288
Lord, please give them a peaceful day!

397
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,688
-Yes! -Yes!

398
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,688
Good morning...

399
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,288
Nothing happened.

400
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:39,488
Nothing.

401
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:51,588
I guess I did something without realizing it, didn't I?

402
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,188
Well, it's all good!

403
00:23:54,788 --> 00:23:58,288
The luckiest guy in this world may be him.

404
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:00,888
"Next Episode" -Gadlin!

405
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:05,088
A gun?

406
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,288
What's going on?

407
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,588
We got to get out of here right now!

408
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:15,088
Come on, Genta! Hurry up!

409
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,488
It's game over, isn't it?

410
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,088
"If you have seen this boy, call 110"

411
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:29,676
Next Conan, "Fugitive TV Game"

412
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,415
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:33,615
"Nameplate"

414
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:35,315
The Youth Detective Squad take the center stage next time.

415
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:37,015
You must hurry up. It's gonna melt.

416
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:39,215
It is not an ice-cream.
