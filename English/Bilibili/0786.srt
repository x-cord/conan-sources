1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.240
On the second day of his Meijin title match,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.840
Shukichi Haneda, also known as Sextuple Crown "Taiko Meijin",

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.640
receives a letter before the match.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.940
Inside, he finds a code and photo of his girlfriend,

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.340
Assistant Inspector Yumi Miyamoto.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.940
Haneda, in order to save Yumi, he leaves the match

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.540
and heads for the shrine indicated in the code.

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.840
There, he meets us and the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.840
that happen to be touring power spots.

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.640
We decide to join hands and rescue Yumi.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.440
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.740
You've got no choice but to take my promoted pawn.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.340
If you do, my captured rook

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.840
will shatter your offense

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.140
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.640
My victory is definite.

17
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
"3 hours and 4 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda"

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.640
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.340
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.140
Coded letters of scenic beauty sites and historic interest.

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Solve them all and checkmate the case!

22
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

24
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.740
His name is Detective Conan!

25
00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:05.194
"Taiko Meijin's Match of Love (Part 2)"

26
00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:11.694
Yuureizaka? (Ghost Hill)

27
00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:15.194
Why did they put such a terrifying name on it?

28
00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.994
I heard it's because it's a desolate hill

29
00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:21.094
lined with temples on both sides.

30
00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.894
It's written on the side of the sign post, isn't it?

31
00:03:23.894 --> 00:03:25.094
Oh, yeah!

32
00:03:25.094 --> 00:03:29.594
Oh, I thought it was a hill leading to hell.

33
00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:33.394
Well, our destination is a graveyard half way through this hill though.

34
00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:34.794
What?

35
00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:37.394
Right, Taiko Meijin?

36
00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:38.594
Yeah.

37
00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:43.494
The code found at Kiyomasa's well was found on a lance piece.

38
00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:44.494
In other words,

39
00:03:44.494 --> 00:03:48.194
the code numbers seven and three stands for lances or spears.

40
00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.494
Kiyomasa Kato, the spear and seven

41
00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:53.994
bring to mind the seven generals known as the "Seven Spears"

42
00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:57.594
that led the forces to victory at the Battle of Shizugatale.

43
00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:01.994
In addition, the three lances refer to the "Three Great Spears of Japan".

44
00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:05.494
Otogine, Hinomotogo, and Tonbogiri.

45
00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:09.294
The man who was one of the Seven Spears,

46
00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:12.494
owned one of the Three Great Spears.

47
00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:13.594
He was Masanori Fukushima,

48
00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:17.094
who received the Hinomotogo from Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

49
00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:18.194
Right.

50
00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:21.494
While drinking with Kanbei Kuroda's retainer,

51
00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:24.294
he won that spear in a bet.

52
00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:25.294
Yes.

53
00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:29.894
The upside-down T piercing the overlapping circles of seven

54
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:34.494
and three is the cartographic symbol for graveyards.

55
00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:35.694
I see.

56
00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:39.194
So the grave of Masanori Fukushima is up ahead, right?

57
00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:41.094
Yeah.

58
00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:43.394
-You have no idea, though? -What?

59
00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:46.194
Of who kidnapped Yumi.

60
00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:48.294
Since he calls himself the Headless Knight,

61
00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:50.494
I'm sure he has some connection with shogi.

62
00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:53.394
No. Nothing in particular.

63
00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:56.494
Don't tell me...

64
00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:01.994
4-8 rook! 4-8 rook!

65
00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:04.494
This move will fork his king and silver general.

66
00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:06.094
And I'll win!

67
00:05:06.094 --> 00:05:09.194
Quick take my promoted pawn!

68
00:05:09.194 --> 00:05:12.694
Let me play this winning move!

69
00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:15.294
My wife is waiting in the hospital.

70
00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:18.694
She's waiting to hear news of my victory.

71
00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:20.594
That I'll be acquiring rank B.

72
00:05:20.594 --> 00:05:23.594
That I'll be able to move her to a better hospital.

73
00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:28.494
Yes...

74
00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.294
The victorious 4-8 rook!

75
00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:31.794
Wait!

76
00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:35.794
There's no waiting in shogi!

77
00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:40.794
Why is my promoted pawn still there?

78
00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.394
What was that sound just now?

79
00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:43.894
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:45.994
I was playing with the piece while thinking,

81
00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:47.694
and the piece sounded.

82
00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:50.194
What?

83
00:05:50.194 --> 00:05:53.294
But taking two turns is against the rules.

84
00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:55.194
Please give up the game for lost.

85
00:05:56.594 --> 00:06:00.594
A post-match discussion won't be necessary, will it?

86
00:06:04.894 --> 00:06:08.194
That foul player is a Sextuple crown?

87
00:06:08.194 --> 00:06:09.994
You got to be joking!

88
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.394
After that,

89
00:06:11.394 --> 00:06:13.894
I was so bewildered that I didn't get to see my wife when she died.

90
00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:17.194
I was unable to play shogi and hit rock bottom.

91
00:06:17.194 --> 00:06:23.194
Come. Let's replay that match, Shukichi Haneda!

92
00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:28.694
That is if you can make it here.

93
00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:35.394
This is a strange looking grave.

94
00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:37.694
More accurately put, it's a memorial tower.

95
00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.494
The small one next to it is his son, Masatoshi's grave.

96
00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:43.594
But there's nothing here.

97
00:06:43.594 --> 00:06:45.194
If this is a memorial tower,

98
00:06:45.194 --> 00:06:47.794
the real grave maybe is somewhere else?

99
00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:51.294
Yeah. There seem to be graves in Nagano, Kyoto, Wakayama.

100
00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:53.694
And Hiroshima too.

101
00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:56.794
I figured that after making him go to Meiji Shrine in Tokyo,

102
00:06:56.794 --> 00:07:01.194
there would not be enough time to make him go to other prefectures, so...

103
00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:04.894
There' s something behind the grave!

104
00:07:04.894 --> 00:07:07.594
It's a shogi board!

105
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.294
There.

106
00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:12.294
Here goes!

107
00:07:12.294 --> 00:07:14.494
I'm finished taking a bath.

108
00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:16.994
You fell asleep?

109
00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:20.894
The TV remote controller?

110
00:07:26.094 --> 00:07:27.794
Shogi?

111
00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:34.294
The pieces are stuck onto the shogi board.

112
00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:36.594
But why are they nailed on?

113
00:07:36.594 --> 00:07:41.494
I think it means to come to where the nails are hammered down.

114
00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.994
Is this some sort of strategy?

115
00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:47.694
No, I don't recall such a formation.

116
00:07:47.694 --> 00:07:52.294
The thing that concerns me is the bishop which is nailed to the rook,

117
00:07:52.294 --> 00:07:55.094
and likewise, the overlapping gold and silver generals.

118
00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:58.394
And although there is only one each of the other pieces,

119
00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:01.694
it's a mystery as to why there are two bishops.

120
00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:05.294
I have no idea what it means.

121
00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:06.394
Yeah.

122
00:08:06.394 --> 00:08:08.694
Doesn't it look like "he"?

123
00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:12.194
From here, it looks like the hiragana character "he"!

124
00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:15.794
From here, it looks like the number seven.

125
00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:18.094
That seems more likely.

126
00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:21.894
The first code was the seven major titles of shogi,

127
00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:25.494
and the second was the seven spears of Shizugatake.

128
00:08:25.494 --> 00:08:27.494
True.

129
00:08:28.794 --> 00:08:31.494
There's something written on the side of the piece.

130
00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:34.294
"Show-off", it says.

131
00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:37.194
There's something written on the bottom of the silver piece too.

132
00:08:37.194 --> 00:08:38.994
"Lazy", it says.

133
00:08:38.994 --> 00:08:42.994
The bishop that is nailed onto the rook, the bishop is the show-off,

134
00:08:42.994 --> 00:08:46.694
and the gold general that is on top of the silver is the lazy one, right?

135
00:08:46.694 --> 00:08:48.794
I got it!

136
00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.594
The gold general is riding the silver

137
00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:52.894
and having it easy, that's why it's lazy!

138
00:08:52.894 --> 00:08:56.594
The bishop is making itself look strong by carrying the rook,

139
00:08:56.594 --> 00:08:58.594
that's why it's a show-off.

140
00:08:58.594 --> 00:09:01.894
The rook is the strongest shogi piece after all, right?

141
00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:04.394
Amazing, Mitsuhiko!

142
00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:06.994
I'm sure he's right!

143
00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:10.294
And? So what does that mean?

144
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.594
Well, I haven't thought that far yet.

145
00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:17.194
But it's strange.

146
00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:21.894
The gold general is a hard worker that can move as much as the king

147
00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:25.794
and the bishop is a strong piece that can move any distance diagonally.

148
00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:29.094
It doesn't have to carry the rook to make itself look strong.

149
00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:34.694
We only have two hours and a half to go before the time limit.

150
00:09:34.694 --> 00:09:36.494
There's only about thirty minutes left,

151
00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:39.394
if you plan to rescue Yumi

152
00:09:39.394 --> 00:09:41.994
and head on to Yamanashi where the match is being held.

153
00:09:41.994 --> 00:09:44.094
I don't intend to return.

154
00:09:44.094 --> 00:09:45.494
-What? -What?

155
00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:48.694
You said "choko" (you need time to think) and left, right?

156
00:09:48.694 --> 00:09:51.094
Are you giving up?

157
00:09:51.094 --> 00:09:52.894
If I didn't say "choko",

158
00:09:52.894 --> 00:09:54.694
my defeat would've been definite.

159
00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:59.394
I figured that my clock time would run out and put Yumi in danger.

160
00:09:59.394 --> 00:10:03.394
Well, I can always try for the Septuple Crown some other time.

161
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.194
That's true.

162
00:10:05.194 --> 00:10:09.194
Our priority now is to rescue Yumi.

163
00:10:10.894 --> 00:10:16.194
But it sure looks like the perp knows who we are.

164
00:10:16.194 --> 00:10:21.094
Because we're originally a group of six.

165
00:10:21.094 --> 00:10:25.194
And the new seventh member.

166
00:10:25.194 --> 00:10:27.894
The new member.

167
00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.994
The seventh member.

168
00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:32.794
It's just like the pieces on this board, don't you think?

169
00:10:32.794 --> 00:10:36.594
How do you know a new member was added?

170
00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.294
The bishop! The bishop!

171
00:10:38.294 --> 00:10:41.594
You start with only one bishop to begin with!

172
00:10:41.594 --> 00:10:44.494
Yes. It's just like us now.

173
00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:47.094
We're stalled from not being able to solve this difficult problem.

174
00:10:47.094 --> 00:10:49.094
No, wrong!

175
00:10:49.094 --> 00:10:51.594
The new member who joined us is...

176
00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:54.094
-not that bishop! -Not that bishop!

177
00:10:54.094 --> 00:10:57.194
There were eight members to start with, but now there are six.

178
00:10:57.194 --> 00:11:00.494
Then another one joined the group.

179
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:01.694
No doubt about it.

180
00:11:03.394 --> 00:11:05.194
The pieces on this board...

181
00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:07.494
Indicate the seven!

182
00:11:07.494 --> 00:11:10.794
Judging from the position of this rook...

183
00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:14.894
The place that Yumi is being confined is probably...

184
00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:16.894
To the car. Hurry!

185
00:11:16.894 --> 00:11:19.494
-What? -Did you figure it out?

186
00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:23.094
Yeah! Yumi's in Haido-cho!

187
00:11:23.094 --> 00:11:29.194
"2 hours and 18 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda"

188
00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:39.369
The Seven Deadly Sins?

189
00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:42.869
The pieces on the shogi board indicate that?

190
00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:43.969
Yeah.

191
00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:47.169
The Seven Deadly Sins were originally the eight sins of gluttony,

192
00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:53.769
lust, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, vanity and pride.

193
00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:58.169
Vanity merged with pride, and sorrow with sloth.

194
00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:02.669
Then envy was later added to make the modern seven.

195
00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:06.069
Just like the pieces on the shogi board.

196
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:09.669
But which piece indicates what sin?

197
00:12:09.669 --> 00:12:12.469
There were two bishops, right?

198
00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:15.169
No. The bishop that was pierced

199
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:18.069
had show-off written on it, so it's vanity.

200
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:21.869
The other bishop based on its position is envy.

201
00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:24.169
Right, Taiko Meijin?

202
00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:25.269
Yeah.

203
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:27.469
Since the bishop can only move diagonally,

204
00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:29.869
it can only land on certain squares.

205
00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:33.869
Therefore, the bishop that was not there to begin with, was there

206
00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:38.969
because it was captured and placed there.

207
00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:43.169
In other words, it's the newcomer, envy.

208
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:44.769
I see.

209
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:46.869
The gold general labeled lazy is sloth

210
00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:50.069
because it's riding the sorrowful silver general.

211
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:54.869
And the rook that is on top of the vain bishop is pride.

212
00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:57.569
Moreover, the rook placed there

213
00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:00.269
signifies an aggressive and high-handed position.

214
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:03.369
High-handedness is often associated with pride.

215
00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:05.769
Yes.

216
00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:08.069
I don't quite get it,

217
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:10.669
but where do we go from here?

218
00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:13.669
The rook that is pierced with the nail is "arrogant".

219
00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:16.669
Another word meaning the same thing is "pride."

220
00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:17.669
The place in this area

221
00:13:17.669 --> 00:13:21.969
with the word "pride" in its name is Hotel Hyde Pride.

222
00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:25.369
I'm sure that's where Yumi is being held captive.

223
00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:28.369
What a considerate kidnapper, though.

224
00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:30.469
Leaving so many clues behind.

225
00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:31.669
He probably wanted to let us know,

226
00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:34.969
even if somebody came along and pried the pieces off.

227
00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:36.969
After all, even if worse came to worst,

228
00:13:36.969 --> 00:13:39.069
it's not impossible to solve the problem with the single word "pride".

229
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:45.169
I'm sure the perp can't wait and is desperate for Taiko Meijin to come.

230
00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:49.569
But is that really the last place?

231
00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:52.069
Yeah. Until this point, the codes

232
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:57.369
were labeled first, second and third game, right?

233
00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:59.869
Since we solved codes one through three,

234
00:13:59.869 --> 00:14:03.469
if we win the next fourth game of the Meijin title match,

235
00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:05.069
it's our win!

236
00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:08.569
We're at the hotel,

237
00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:10.469
but what do we look for?

238
00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:11.969
Don't worry.

239
00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:15.169
The perp wants Taiko Meijin to come.

240
00:14:15.169 --> 00:14:17.569
So most probably, if we ask the front desk...

241
00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:20.669
Mr. Haneda!

242
00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:24.169
I was told to show you to the room when you arrive.

243
00:14:25.969 --> 00:14:28.269
Mr. Haneda has arrived.

244
00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.969
The door lock is sealed with masking tape.

245
00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:34.869
Does that mean just enter?

246
00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:36.169
Oh, wait!

247
00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:37.369
Yumi!

248
00:14:37.369 --> 00:14:39.569
Answer me if you're there!

249
00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:41.569
Yumi!

250
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:44.369
That's as far as you go.

251
00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:47.669
Shukichi Haneda is the only one allowed in this room.

252
00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:49.169
If you break that rule,

253
00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:52.369
the bomb embedded in the sofa will explode.

254
00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:56.869
I warned you not to tell anyone

255
00:14:56.869 --> 00:14:58.369
and yet you have all these people here with you.

256
00:14:58.369 --> 00:15:00.469
Well, I guess it's okay

257
00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:02.569
because they don't look like police people.

258
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:07.169
It was you, after all, Mr. Tanimori.

259
00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:11.369
It's time to replay that match of ten years ago.

260
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:14.069
Please sit down.

261
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:16.669
I'm sure you've already forgotten,

262
00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:20.369
but back then, I had you in check with my 4-2 promoted pawn?

263
00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:22.269
Same position, king!

264
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:26.069
I haven't forgotten that match.

265
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:28.769
That match hasn't left my mind these ten years. Not even for a moment.

266
00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.969
Go ahead, take your promoted pawn with my king.

267
00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:35.969
Well, if you say so.

268
00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:40.169
Then my winning 4-8 rook will explode!

269
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:45.769
Now I've forked your king and silver general!

270
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:47.769
I win!

271
00:15:50.469 --> 00:15:53.169
Keiko, I finally did it.

272
00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:55.669
I've finally taken revenge for what happened ten years ago.

273
00:15:55.669 --> 00:15:58.569
Finally, Keiko!

274
00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.269
4-7 bishop.

275
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:03.569
What?

276
00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:05.969
4-7 bishop?

277
00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:09.169
Same... same position, rook.

278
00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.169
5-1 king.

279
00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:13.869
5-3 lance and check.

280
00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:15.569
6-2 king.

281
00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:18.269
4-2 rook and check.

282
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.269
7-1 king.

283
00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:25.569
Now my king is safe

284
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:27.769
and yours is checkmated.

285
00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:31.969
When I realized I could win,

286
00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:33.469
I felt a tremor in my heart,

287
00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:37.469
I dropped the piece that I was playing with and made that sound.

288
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:43.069
4-7 bishop is a brilliant comeback move.

289
00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:48.369
Which means I would've lost the match either way.

290
00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:51.169
I'm sorry,

291
00:16:51.169 --> 00:16:52.469
before the match started,

292
00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:56.369
I happened to overhear you talking on the phone.

293
00:16:56.369 --> 00:16:58.369
What?

294
00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:00.169
No matter how bad my wife's condition is,

295
00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:03.469
I can't go to the hospital until the match is over.

296
00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:05.569
Please tell my wife to hang in there

297
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.569
because I'll try my very best in the match too.

298
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.569
Wanting to end the match as quickly as possible,

299
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.169
although I didn't mean to,

300
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:18.469
I guess I made a rude remark.

301
00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:21.469
Then, what you said back then...

302
00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:25.269
A post-match discussion won't be necessary, will it?

303
00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:28.669
You said it so that I could go to the hospital immediately.

304
00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:34.769
I've lost in every way.

305
00:17:34.769 --> 00:17:38.069
Please undo the bomb!

306
00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:41.369
Don't worry. This is just a bluff.

307
00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:46.969
She's just asleep on drugs,

308
00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:48.769
Taiko Meijin.

309
00:17:55.769 --> 00:17:58.869
Yumi?

310
00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:03.069
Chu... Chukichi?

311
00:18:03.069 --> 00:18:04.469
Yumi.

312
00:18:05.569 --> 00:18:07.069
Where is this?

313
00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:09.069
Inside the mini police car.

314
00:18:09.069 --> 00:18:11.969
Conan contacted me.

315
00:18:11.969 --> 00:18:15.769
He told me that Mr. Haneda rescued you who was kidnapped

316
00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:18.869
so to come pick you up right away.

317
00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:22.769
Come to think of it, where's the man that abducted me?

318
00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:27.269
Dr. Agasa already drove him to the police and he turned himself in.

319
00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:31.669
And? Where's this mini police car headed for?

320
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:32.869
To the hospital

321
00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:35.469
since you've been confined for a whole two days,

322
00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:36.869
so just to be safe...

323
00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:39.869
He didn't do anything sexual with me, though.

324
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.769
Just as I got out of the cafe,

325
00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:44.469
he snuffed me out with some drug and kidnapped me,

326
00:18:44.469 --> 00:18:49.169
but he let me use the bathroom and fed me too.

327
00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:52.169
But, Mr. Haneda, you're amazing.

328
00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:57.869
You stood up an important match today just for Yumi.

329
00:18:57.869 --> 00:18:59.369
What match?

330
00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:02.569
Well, today was the Meijin title match.

331
00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:04.069
The Meijin title match?

332
00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:06.669
And, where and when is it?

333
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:11.169
I've got to be at the Tokiwa Hotel in Yamanashi by 15:00.

334
00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:13.969
But there's only less than an hour and a half, so I don't think I'll...

335
00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:18.569
Chukichi! Don't take this car lightly now.

336
00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:22.169
Hey, you! The car in front!

337
00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:24.769
Change lanes and let us through!

338
00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:28.569
Come on get with it, stop dilly-dallying and move it!

339
00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:31.569
Yumi, you're going too far.

340
00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:35.569
We've already made it into Yamanashi besides.

341
00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:37.969
Mini police car over there! Pull over!

342
00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.569
I thought so.

343
00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:45.069
I guess your police ID is authentic,

344
00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:46.369
but what is it?

345
00:19:46.369 --> 00:19:48.269
This is Yamanashi Prefecture, you know?

346
00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:50.869
We've got our reasons, you see.

347
00:19:50.869 --> 00:19:54.769
We've got to hurry or Chukichi will be late for his Mejin title match!

348
00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:56.169
Meijin title match?

349
00:19:58.469 --> 00:19:59.869
Taiko Meijin!

350
00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:01.469
Yes?

351
00:20:01.469 --> 00:20:03.969
Do you remember? It's me!

352
00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:06.469
You gave me your autograph at the cafe the other day.

353
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.169
What's this?

354
00:20:13.169 --> 00:20:15.769
Don't tell me that you're some kind of celebrity, Chukichi?

355
00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:17.469
He is.

356
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:22.169
"Tokiwa Hotel" -See you, Taiko Meijin!

357
00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:24.269
I wish all the best for you!

358
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:28.469
It's 14:57.

359
00:20:28.469 --> 00:20:30.069
We really made it.

360
00:20:30.069 --> 00:20:32.669
It's gone?

361
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:34.069
What is?

362
00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:37.669
The picture! The one you gestured a "V" pose.

363
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.969
I must've dropped it somewhere.

364
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:43.569
Never mind that, just hurry up and go!

365
00:20:43.569 --> 00:20:47.069
But, that's my good luck charm!

366
00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:48.569
Even during the Meijin match last year,

367
00:20:48.569 --> 00:20:50.969
just because I forgot it...

368
00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:03.669
How's this?

369
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:08.169
I'll bet it'll bring you more luck than the photo.

370
00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:09.169
Yes!

371
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:11.569
Okay, then off you go!

372
00:21:11.569 --> 00:21:13.069
Okay!

373
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:19.969
I didn't know that there was a Meijin title match of Rakugo.

374
00:21:19.969 --> 00:21:21.669
Rakugo?

375
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:24.669
You see, that kimono!

376
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:28.169
Isn't that the kind you wear at the amateur Rakugo Meijin match?

377
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.069
Thirty seconds.

378
00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.169
Thank you for waiting.

379
00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:48.169
I don't mind,

380
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:49.769
but is it okay with you?

381
00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:52.369
You've used up your clock time

382
00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.069
and only have a minute left.

383
00:21:55.069 --> 00:21:58.169
Yes. For me now,

384
00:21:58.169 --> 00:22:00.969
a minute is infinite.

385
00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:27.369
There's a police car parked in front of this hotel but...

386
00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:29.569
Do you know what happened?

387
00:23:29.569 --> 00:23:31.269
No.

388
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:32.769
Beats me.

389
00:23:32.769 --> 00:23:33.969
What?

390
00:23:37.469 --> 00:23:39.269
What's with that reaction of yours?

391
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:41.069
You're grossing me out.

392
00:23:41.069 --> 00:23:43.969
"Taiko Meijin Acquires Seven Crowns!"

393
00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:54.069
"Next Episode" -How spacious!

394
00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:55.869
Aren't you excited, too?

395
00:23:58.969 --> 00:23:59.969
Yes.

396
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:01.769
Who's that lady?

397
00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:05.569
Daughter of the President Oiso we just mentioned.

398
00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:07.069
What?

399
00:24:07.069 --> 00:24:08.569
My necklace.

400
00:24:08.569 --> 00:24:10.669
Since you were swimming till a while ago,

401
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:13.169
could it be in the pool?

402
00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:16.869
Next Conan,

403
00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:20.869
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 1)"

404
00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:39.169
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:40.969
"Oxygen tank (bomb)"

406
00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:42.469
After the heart-thumping shogi game...

407
00:24:42.469 --> 00:24:43.569
The pool is the stage next.

408
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:46.069
Water was thrown into the match.
