1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.140
The boy that Ms. Kurumi Shodo

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.840
"Kurumi Shodo (39)" -befriended at the beach 30 years ago,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.740
saved her life from a traffic accident,

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.540
she owed her life to him.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.240
Kurumi says that the lottery ticket she happened to buy

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040
was a winning ticket for 1 billion yen

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.140
and she wants to give it to the boy who saved her.

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.140
So, she contacted TV stations and magazines.

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.040
The clues are her memory of the summer days

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.340
and the large scar that the boy got

11
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740
when he saved her from the accident.

12
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.340
Two men appear when she calls out for the boy.

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.140
Mr. Ryuhei Kusumoto has a large scar on his back

14
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.940
and Mr. Sogo Banba has a scar on his chest.

15
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.440
Both scars are large, extending in one straight line.

16
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.140
In order to discern which is the real man

17
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.740
we all go to visit the Shodo residence but,

18
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.140
there we find the officers of the First Investigation Division

19
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.540
secretly staking out in pursuit of a killer

20
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.740
whose time is about to expire.

21
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.640
That culprit also has a straight lined scar on his body.

22
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.840
However, we also find that

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540
the butler at the Shodo residence,

24
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.240
Mr. Taisuke Hoya has a scar on his back.

25
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.140
Who on earth is the "boy of her memory"?

26
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.840
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

27
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.340
Saturday nights are for mystery.

28
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.340
With the deadline approaching, a first love comes to light.

29
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.840
The case of the scar takes an unexpected turn!

30
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:12.292
"The Scar that Invokes the Past"

34
00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:15.292
No way.

35
00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:18.292
The butler had a scar on his back too?

36
00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:22.092
Yes. Although unlike Mr. Kusumoto and Banba's scar,

37
00:03:22.092 --> 00:03:25.792
his scar was smaller that had only about 15 cm.

38
00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.392
There's a chance that Hoya the butler,

39
00:03:28.392 --> 00:03:31.792
may turn out to be the murderer too.

40
00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:32.792
Why?

41
00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:35.892
Isn't the scar on the murderer a big one too?

42
00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:37.392
Well, when the Superintendent slashed

43
00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.892
the killer and wounded him,

44
00:03:39.892 --> 00:03:42.792
he was dazed out,

45
00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:44.692
so it could be that he doesn't remember

46
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.892
the accurate length of the scar.

47
00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:48.892
Besides, it seems as if that murderer

48
00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.792
is very cautious too.

49
00:03:53.192 --> 00:03:56.192
After that killer was slashed by the Superintendent,

50
00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:58.192
he fled by car,

51
00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.492
but when the car was found later,

52
00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:04.692
no signs of his prints nor blood was detected at all.

53
00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:08.292
The sheet covering the driver's seat was torn off,

54
00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:11.192
so the killer probably wiped away his prints that were in the car

55
00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:13.792
after tearing off the part where his blood stains were.

56
00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:19.092
But, what makes you say that the butler may be the killer?

57
00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.692
If the guy is cautious,

58
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:23.292
it's hard to believe that he would publicize himself,

59
00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.392
even for the sake of receiving money.

60
00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:29.592
After all, luminol reaction which usually detects

61
00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:31.892
the traces of blood even after being wiped off,

62
00:04:31.892 --> 00:04:34.992
wasn't detected.

63
00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:37.392
The scars of the three men.

64
00:04:37.392 --> 00:04:40.492
There's big one on Mr. Kusumoto's back

65
00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:43.192
and Mr. Banba's chest.

66
00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:46.092
On Mr. Hoya's back there is a small scar.

67
00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:49.892
Mr. Kusumoto used to be thin when he was a child

68
00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.892
and, Mr. Banba used to be a bookworm.

69
00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.392
The boy in her memory

70
00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.292
was knowledgeable of the sea and fish.

71
00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.192
His favourite drink is ginger ale.

72
00:04:59.192 --> 00:05:02.392
His favourite food are sushi and fried noodles.

73
00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:04.892
He is a very honest person.

74
00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:07.892
The nickname his classmates named him

75
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:09.192
was Gari.

76
00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:12.292
Yes.

77
00:05:13.892 --> 00:05:17.092
How is the investigation coming along?

78
00:05:17.092 --> 00:05:20.292
Well... Nothing definite has come up yet.

79
00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:21.692
I see.

80
00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:24.492
Well, there's still more time.

81
00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:27.192
A slight meal is ready, so you can eat if you like.

82
00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:29.392
Light meal?

83
00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:32.492
Let me guess, it's...

84
00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:33.992
sushi?

85
00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:37.092
Yes, amazing how you know.

86
00:05:37.092 --> 00:05:39.092
Well, you see...

87
00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:41.492
I've got a secret to tell you.

88
00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:44.692
A little more below.

89
00:05:49.692 --> 00:05:51.592
What're they talking about?

90
00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:55.592
Will you please do so then?

91
00:05:55.592 --> 00:05:56.592
Okay.

92
00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.092
How surprising, though.

93
00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:03.892
I thought that you were just a short high school boy

94
00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:07.692
that still didn't go through a voice change.

95
00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:11.192
But, you're still such a little boy.

96
00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:15.192
It's as if Sherlock Holmes is pretending to be a child.

97
00:06:15.192 --> 00:06:16.792
Really?

98
00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:20.392
I can see what normal people can't.

99
00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:24.792
I'll be waiting in my room, then.

100
00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:27.192
I'll leave the rest up to you.

101
00:06:29.092 --> 00:06:30.392
Mr. Detective.

102
00:06:30.392 --> 00:06:32.192
Yes.

103
00:06:36.992 --> 00:06:38.792
Super premium sushi for sure.

104
00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:44.992
Why don't you have some too, butler?

105
00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:48.392
Kurumi said for you to eat together with us.

106
00:06:48.392 --> 00:06:49.892
Yes.

107
00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:51.192
I guess so.

108
00:06:58.092 --> 00:07:01.792
Natural stuff is good after all.

109
00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:03.992
No, this is artificially bred fish.

110
00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:05.492
Just what're you talking about.

111
00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:07.492
This is natural stuff.

112
00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:09.992
Right, Mr. Detective. Don't you think so too?

113
00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.392
Oh, well...

114
00:07:11.392 --> 00:07:13.292
I really can't tell myself...

115
00:07:15.992 --> 00:07:17.692
Dad?

116
00:07:17.692 --> 00:07:20.792
Natural or artificial, you say?

117
00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:25.192
-Who cares? -Who cares?

118
00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:27.092
It's pretty important, I'd say.

119
00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:28.292
I see.

120
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:30.392
So, is it that you want to make an impression on me

121
00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:32.492
that the boy she's looking for

122
00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:34.692
is knowledgeable about the sea and fish and likes sushi.

123
00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:37.892
Is that what you're trying to get me to see?

124
00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:39.392
Oh, no.

125
00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:40.992
Well, I guess it can't be helped

126
00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:44.692
because 1 billion yen is hanging out there.

127
00:07:44.692 --> 00:07:48.392
Talking of sushi, when that boy bought the pack of sushi,

128
00:07:48.392 --> 00:07:50.292
what did the boy do after doing so?

129
00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:52.292
The change was 100 yen more than what it was supposed to be,

130
00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.692
so I went to return it.

131
00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:58.592
I can't take what's not mine.

132
00:07:58.592 --> 00:08:00.692
That's strange.

133
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:02.392
What is?

134
00:08:02.392 --> 00:08:04.692
Well... the honest boy who said that

135
00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:07.792
he can't accept what's not his

136
00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:10.992
is obviously trying to take off with 1 billion yen

137
00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:13.692
that should be going to someone else.

138
00:08:14.692 --> 00:08:17.692
What're you talking about?

139
00:08:17.692 --> 00:08:20.192
Kurumi is saying that she's going to give the 1 billion away

140
00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:23.892
as a token of her appreciation to the person who risked his own life

141
00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:26.892
to save her from a traffic accident.

142
00:08:26.892 --> 00:08:29.792
What's wrong with accepting it?

143
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:32.192
You saw when taking a bath with me didn't you,

144
00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:34.592
the scar from the accident back then.

145
00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:37.692
No, the scar on my back

146
00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:40.492
is indeed the scar I got during the accident.

147
00:08:40.492 --> 00:08:45.492
True, you had a large scar about 30 cm long,

148
00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:50.092
but that is again exactly what made me doubt you.

149
00:08:51.092 --> 00:08:54.892
Kurumi answered the interview on TV, didn't she?

150
00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:58.092
That the scar extended from one end to the other.

151
00:08:58.092 --> 00:09:00.192
She doesn't remember if the scar was on the chest or back,

152
00:09:00.192 --> 00:09:02.492
but it was a big scar.

153
00:09:02.492 --> 00:09:03.792
She said she was sure of that.

154
00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:07.392
Then, how old were you then?

155
00:09:07.392 --> 00:09:10.592
Around 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary school.

156
00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.992
Really? If the boy was in 2nd or 3rd grade of elementary,

157
00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:18.192
a scar reaching from side to side would be about 15 cm...

158
00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:20.392
Well. I guess...

159
00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:23.392
When I first got the scar, it was about that long, but...

160
00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:26.192
As I got older and my body got bigger,

161
00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:28.492
my scar got bigger too.

162
00:09:29.492 --> 00:09:31.892
Don't you know?

163
00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:35.492
Scars don't get larger even if a person grows up.

164
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.392
-What? -What?

165
00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:40.192
If you get a scar that's 15 cm,

166
00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:42.792
the scar stays the same size until you die.

167
00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:46.392
Well, I was pretty big for my age.

168
00:09:46.392 --> 00:09:47.692
Me too.

169
00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:49.592
Mr. Kusumoto.

170
00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:54.192
Didn't you say that you were very thin when you were a child?

171
00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:56.592
I did...

172
00:09:56.592 --> 00:09:59.392
He probably said he was skinny

173
00:09:59.392 --> 00:10:00.992
after hearing that the boy she's looking for

174
00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:03.092
was nicknamed Gari.

175
00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:05.492
He probably mistook it for "gari-gari" which means skinny.

176
00:10:05.492 --> 00:10:07.592
He was actually nicknamed Gari

177
00:10:07.592 --> 00:10:10.992
because he was a bookworm.

178
00:10:10.992 --> 00:10:13.592
Gari because he was a bookworm?

179
00:10:13.592 --> 00:10:14.992
Do you know?

180
00:10:14.992 --> 00:10:19.992
When that boy ate fried noodles at the beach house,

181
00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:23.192
he put a lot of red ginger on it.

182
00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:24.892
What's that about?

183
00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:27.292
I don't know about it.

184
00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:29.892
It's only natural that you don't know about it.

185
00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:32.192
I heard about it for the first time today too.

186
00:10:32.192 --> 00:10:34.292
It's a trump card.

187
00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:37.792
Don't you understand yet?

188
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:41.492
The boy liked ginger ale,

189
00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:44.292
bought sushi packs often

190
00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:47.392
and used to put a lot of red ginger on his fried noodles.

191
00:10:47.392 --> 00:10:51.692
I see. That boy liked ginger.

192
00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:54.392
There's ginger in ginger ale

193
00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:56.392
and the ginger that comes with sushi

194
00:10:56.392 --> 00:10:59.592
is ginger marinated in sugar and vinegar.

195
00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.192
Which means that the reason

196
00:11:01.192 --> 00:11:02.392
the boy got the nickname Gari was because...

197
00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:03.792
Yes, that's right.

198
00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:07.792
He was probably called Gari because he loved ginger.

199
00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.592
That's right, isn't it?

200
00:11:09.592 --> 00:11:12.092
You didn't even bother to eat the sushi

201
00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:14.392
but went right for the ginger and ate it all up,

202
00:11:14.392 --> 00:11:16.892
didn't you, Mr. Hoya?

203
00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:19.792
No way.

204
00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:21.892
You mean the real guy was here?

205
00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:26.892
Yes. He has a scar about 15 cm on his back too.

206
00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:29.392
So, there's probably no mistake about it.

207
00:11:29.392 --> 00:11:31.892
Then, why doesn't he come right out and say so?

208
00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:34.392
He could get a billion yen.

209
00:11:35.492 --> 00:11:38.692
I can't accept that money.

210
00:11:38.692 --> 00:11:43.092
Because if I didn't tell her to stay,

211
00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:47.092
she may have not gotten into the accident.

212
00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:49.292
That's why I decided to watch over her

213
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.592
without revealing my identity.

214
00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:52.392
But, it seems that you couldn't do so

215
00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.792
without revealing your true identity.

216
00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:56.592
Do you know why?

217
00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:58.792
Kurumi who knew that you're the type

218
00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:01.892
that would never accept what is not yours,

219
00:12:01.892 --> 00:12:04.792
went on air and publicized

220
00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.892
that she wanted to give you the billion yen?

221
00:12:08.092 --> 00:12:10.092
It's because she wanted you,

222
00:12:10.092 --> 00:12:12.992
who was right beside her to come out on your own.

223
00:12:12.992 --> 00:12:14.792
And to tell you to not publicize something like that

224
00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:17.892
because it may bring about imposters.

225
00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:21.992
Then... Kurumi knew, after all.

226
00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:24.292
Yes, she was aware

227
00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:29.292
that Mr. Hoya was the boy she had known back then.

228
00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.492
That's why she made him wash my back in the bath tub

229
00:12:31.492 --> 00:12:33.992
where the air conditioner was out of order.

230
00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:37.692
She didn't say anything about the red ginger till today.

231
00:12:37.692 --> 00:12:40.092
She served sushi as a late-night meal.

232
00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:43.292
She did all this to drop hints at me.

233
00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:46.492
So, what now, Mr. Hoya?

234
00:12:46.492 --> 00:12:49.592
Kurumi is waiting in her room.

235
00:12:52.092 --> 00:12:54.892
But... Well...

236
00:12:54.892 --> 00:12:56.592
I...

237
00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:58.592
You'll be fine.

238
00:12:58.592 --> 00:13:02.092
I'll go tell the lady for you in your place.

239
00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:06.492
If you like, shall I go tell her for you?

240
00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:08.692
I really don't want people who are just after the money

241
00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:10.592
lying and saying that they are the ones

242
00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:11.992
that she is looking for besides.

243
00:13:13.992 --> 00:13:18.192
Okay. I'll go tell her myself.

244
00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:28.692
He seems to have been urged to do what he has to do.

245
00:13:28.692 --> 00:13:30.192
Yes.

246
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:36.392
Jeepers. I'd like to tell the truth if I could, but can't.

247
00:13:36.392 --> 00:13:38.092
Just who are talking about?

248
00:13:40.592 --> 00:13:42.392
Kamen Yaiba.

249
00:13:42.392 --> 00:13:44.792
He can't afford to have people know his true identity.

250
00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.892
Then, I guess I'll be going.

251
00:13:47.892 --> 00:13:49.692
Bye.

252
00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:54.792
Hold it, will you?

253
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.392
Police?

254
00:13:56.392 --> 00:13:58.592
I... I was just joking.

255
00:13:58.592 --> 00:14:00.392
I had a scar on my chest

256
00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:01.992
that I got when I got hurt surfing, so...

257
00:14:01.992 --> 00:14:04.692
No, the one that we want

258
00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:07.392
is the guy with the large scar on his back.

259
00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:08.692
You. That is.

260
00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:11.692
Because after all,

261
00:14:11.692 --> 00:14:15.392
that wound is the straight-line scar

262
00:14:15.392 --> 00:14:19.292
what Superintendent Matsumoto left on the serial killer 20 years ago

263
00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:21.892
when he cornered the culprit.

264
00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:23.092
What?

265
00:14:23.092 --> 00:14:27.492
Back then, I didn't know if the scar was on the chest or the back but...

266
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.992
it cleared after I got the mail from Mouri.

267
00:14:29.992 --> 00:14:32.192
Mail?

268
00:14:32.192 --> 00:14:33.392
Oh no.

269
00:14:33.392 --> 00:14:35.892
I've got to return Pop's cell phone to him.

270
00:14:35.892 --> 00:14:38.492
Normally, when people are wounded,

271
00:14:38.492 --> 00:14:41.592
they reflexively cover that area with their hands.

272
00:14:41.592 --> 00:14:45.292
So, the fact that there was no luminol reaction detected

273
00:14:45.292 --> 00:14:48.092
on the steering wheel of the car that was abandoned

274
00:14:48.092 --> 00:14:51.892
was because the killer couldn't reach his wound.

275
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:54.692
In other words, he was wounded on his back.

276
00:14:55.692 --> 00:14:58.392
Tearing away the cover of the driver's seat

277
00:14:58.392 --> 00:15:02.492
in order to hide the blood stains inside the car gave you away.

278
00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:05.892
Oh, no... That's not it.

279
00:15:05.892 --> 00:15:09.092
The scar on the back of a man I met before looked cool,

280
00:15:09.092 --> 00:15:11.092
so I copied him and scarred my back.

281
00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:13.692
You'd better cut out your wisecracks.

282
00:15:13.692 --> 00:15:16.192
It's true, please believe me.

283
00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:19.792
Was that man whistling?

284
00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:21.292
How about it?

285
00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:23.192
Yes.

286
00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:24.692
If I remember correctly,

287
00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:27.592
it was a tune that was popular about 20 years ago.

288
00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:29.592
You're not lying, are you?

289
00:15:29.592 --> 00:15:30.792
No.

290
00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:33.292
Superintendent.

291
00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:35.892
Popular 20 years ago.

292
00:15:35.892 --> 00:15:38.792
That's the tune of the serial killer.

293
00:15:51.042 --> 00:15:54.242
Ryuhei Kusumoto, age 42.

294
00:15:54.242 --> 00:15:56.642
Around the time the incident occurred 15 years ago,

295
00:15:56.642 --> 00:15:59.542
he seems to have been abroad home-staying.

296
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.542
This has been confirmed,

297
00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:04.142
so I guess he could be cleared from the list of suspects.

298
00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:05.242
I see.

299
00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:08.942
He seems to have met the man with the scar on his back at a sauna

300
00:16:08.942 --> 00:16:12.842
just before he left to go abroad to home-stay.

301
00:16:12.842 --> 00:16:14.942
He seems to have had a towel over his head,

302
00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.042
so didn't see the face of the man.

303
00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:19.242
The man seems to have laughed and said,

304
00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:21.642
"This scar was made on my back 5 years ago

305
00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:23.242
by the police and is a crest of courage.

306
00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:26.242
You want to have one like this too?"

307
00:16:26.242 --> 00:16:27.942
Is anyone at that sauna?

308
00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:31.642
Officer Sato and Takagi are staking out there right now.

309
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:34.642
Tell them to stay on their guard.

310
00:16:34.642 --> 00:16:35.942
Yes, sir.

311
00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:39.542
He's a vicious killer who killed a total of 3 people,

312
00:16:39.542 --> 00:16:43.042
2 people 20 years ago and 1 person 15 years ago.

313
00:16:44.242 --> 00:16:46.442
No, there's one more.

314
00:16:46.442 --> 00:16:48.142
Did you forget?

315
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.542
I'd never forget

316
00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:53.642
about Superintendent Morimura who died on duty

317
00:16:53.642 --> 00:16:56.142
because of that incident.

318
00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:59.242
After all, he's the one who taught me all I need to know

319
00:16:59.242 --> 00:17:01.042
about being a police detective.

320
00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:10.742
Superintendent Morimura.

321
00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:12.342
After you died on duty,

322
00:17:12.342 --> 00:17:14.742
you were specially promoted 2 ranks,

323
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.242
and I've finally caught up to your rank now.

324
00:17:17.242 --> 00:17:19.242
But, I still don't understand

325
00:17:19.242 --> 00:17:22.042
the meaning of the words you said back then.

326
00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:27.042
Matsumoto, there's some meaning

327
00:17:27.042 --> 00:17:31.042
behind the tune that... that guy is whistling.

328
00:17:31.042 --> 00:17:33.742
I'm dead sure... there's something.

329
00:17:34.842 --> 00:17:39.442
What on earth could there be, Morimura?

330
00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:43.042
So there was nothing after all.

331
00:17:43.042 --> 00:17:44.242
Nothing at all.

332
00:17:44.242 --> 00:17:46.242
Well, it can't be helped.

333
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:48.642
It's an incident that happened 15 years ago.

334
00:17:48.642 --> 00:17:49.842
I guess so.

335
00:17:49.842 --> 00:17:51.842
The building itself seems to have been renovated,

336
00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:54.842
and the people who come here seem to have changed too.

337
00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:55.942
Come to think of it,

338
00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.942
the sauna at 5-chome seems to have been greatly renovated

339
00:17:57.942 --> 00:17:59.542
and has a good reputation.

340
00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.542
That's right.

341
00:18:01.542 --> 00:18:05.042
Why don't you invite Officer Chiba and go there with him?

342
00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.242
I'll go, alone.

343
00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:10.542
Did you ask me to come with you?

344
00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:12.942
Of course!

345
00:18:12.942 --> 00:18:14.942
Then, why don't we do this?

346
00:18:14.942 --> 00:18:16.342
If we get to arrest this serial killer

347
00:18:16.342 --> 00:18:18.342
before the expiration date,

348
00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:20.942
let's go to a hot spring together.

349
00:18:20.942 --> 00:18:23.142
But, we've only got three more days to go.

350
00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:25.542
Take me to a hot spring.

351
00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:26.742
You know what...

352
00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:28.342
I wonder, is it okay?

353
00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:32.742
For officers to be acting lovey-dovey on duty.

354
00:18:32.742 --> 00:18:35.742
Oh, no. We're not acting lovey-dovey.

355
00:18:35.742 --> 00:18:37.942
We're questioning the people around here...

356
00:18:38.942 --> 00:18:41.642
Don't tell the children what you don't have to.

357
00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:43.242
I know.

358
00:18:43.242 --> 00:18:46.842
If I put together the details of the incident that was aired on TV

359
00:18:46.842 --> 00:18:49.842
and what Superintendent Matsumoto said,

360
00:18:49.842 --> 00:18:52.542
the first incident happened 20 years ago.

361
00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:55.442
The victim was a doctor, aged 50,

362
00:18:55.442 --> 00:18:57.542
called Mr. Tsuguharu Bokawa.

363
00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:01.442
The murder weapon was the Japanese sword that he owned.

364
00:19:01.442 --> 00:19:03.642
Two days later,

365
00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.242
the professor of the science and technology department

366
00:19:05.242 --> 00:19:08.642
of Tohto University, Mr. Atsunori Mugita, age 42,

367
00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:10.842
was killed with the same Japanese sword.

368
00:19:10.842 --> 00:19:13.642
When the officer who was asking questions in the area

369
00:19:13.642 --> 00:19:16.642
about a car that was seen often and thought to be suspicious,

370
00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:18.142
it fled and ran over the officer.

371
00:19:18.142 --> 00:19:21.642
The officer as a result died on duty.

372
00:19:21.642 --> 00:19:24.542
Superintendent Matsumoto who cornered the car

373
00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:26.342
was attacked by the culprit

374
00:19:26.342 --> 00:19:28.142
and was hurt in the left eye,

375
00:19:28.142 --> 00:19:31.442
but despite being hurt grabbed the sword from the culprit

376
00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:34.842
and slashed him leaving a straight-lined wound on his back.

377
00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:36.942
And, five years later,

378
00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.342
Lawyer Susumu Nabei, age 34,

379
00:19:39.342 --> 00:19:42.442
was killed at his residence with a knife that was in his house.

380
00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:45.742
First the victims were knocked out by a stun gun,

381
00:19:45.742 --> 00:19:50.042
then viciously slashed using a Japanese sword or a knife.

382
00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:51.642
In all three incidents

383
00:19:51.642 --> 00:19:53.942
there were no signs of the door being forced open,

384
00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.742
so investigation was carried out under the presumption

385
00:19:55.742 --> 00:19:57.342
that it was committed by an acquaintance.

386
00:19:57.342 --> 00:19:59.142
No common points what so ever were found among the three victims,

387
00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:02.042
and the investigation was coming to a dead end.

388
00:20:02.042 --> 00:20:03.542
Is that correct?

389
00:20:03.542 --> 00:20:05.042
Yes.

390
00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:07.342
But, I don't understand.

391
00:20:07.342 --> 00:20:10.042
The first and second victims were killed with the same weapon

392
00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.742
so it was probably the same killer.

393
00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:14.042
Right.

394
00:20:14.042 --> 00:20:16.842
A knife was used to commit the murder five years later.

395
00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:19.442
How did you figure out it was the same culprit?

396
00:20:19.442 --> 00:20:20.742
Well, that's...

397
00:20:20.742 --> 00:20:21.942
That was because the letter

398
00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:25.342
-that was on the victim's body was... -Hey, Officer Sato.

399
00:20:25.342 --> 00:20:28.542
You're telling her about it too.

400
00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:29.642
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:29.642 --> 00:20:31.542
I can't seem to stop myself when they ask me questions.

402
00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:35.042
-So, there are only three more days to go... -They're still broadcasting

403
00:20:35.042 --> 00:20:37.342
-Do you think the police... -that incident now.

404
00:20:37.342 --> 00:20:39.442
will be able to arrest the culprit, Mr. Hiramune?

405
00:20:39.442 --> 00:20:43.942
Well, I think it's impossible judging from the present circumstance.

406
00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:45.442
"Doji Hiramune (41)" -The culprit probably

407
00:20:45.442 --> 00:20:47.142
has all the curtains closed,

408
00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:48.542
and has all the telephone jacks pulled out

409
00:20:48.542 --> 00:20:50.442
to keep out of contact from everything on the outside.

410
00:20:50.442 --> 00:20:52.742
He's probably shivering in bed waiting

411
00:20:52.742 --> 00:20:55.742
for the three days to go by.

412
00:20:55.742 --> 00:20:58.842
He's probably trying with all his might

413
00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:01.242
to keep a low profile and pass the time away.

414
00:21:01.242 --> 00:21:04.642
If this isn't true, come to here to me.

415
00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:08.342
That is, if you want to waste all the effort

416
00:21:08.342 --> 00:21:11.042
you put into fleeing and hiding for 15 years.

417
00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:13.842
I know that man.

418
00:21:13.842 --> 00:21:15.842
He lives in the same condo as me.

419
00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:17.442
Well, we're just about to go over

420
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.442
to your place to play.

421
00:21:19.442 --> 00:21:22.442
We may just run into that man.

422
00:21:22.442 --> 00:21:23.742
True.

423
00:21:25.142 --> 00:21:29.442
Well, the serial killer may come along too?

424
00:21:29.442 --> 00:21:31.642
No. I hope he doesn't.

425
00:21:31.642 --> 00:21:34.342
Ai, you're frightening.

426
00:21:34.342 --> 00:21:36.942
Be careful going home, okay?

427
00:21:36.942 --> 00:21:40.042
If the killer comes make sure to contact us.

428
00:21:40.042 --> 00:21:41.342
-Yes! -Yes!

429
00:21:43.142 --> 00:21:46.942
A certain letter on the bodies of the victims?

430
00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:51.142
Get a load of that.

431
00:21:51.142 --> 00:21:54.142
There's good view of all the buildings in the distance too!

432
00:21:54.142 --> 00:21:56.842
I'm sure the night view is also beautiful too.

433
00:21:56.842 --> 00:21:58.042
I'm back!

434
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:01.542
I bought some juice.

435
00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:03.642
We also got a lot of candy while we were at it.

436
00:22:03.642 --> 00:22:04.842
"Masked Yaiba"

437
00:22:04.842 --> 00:22:06.742
Did you get some Yaiba chocolate too?

438
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:07.842
Of course.

439
00:22:07.842 --> 00:22:08.942
Come to think of it,

440
00:22:08.942 --> 00:22:12.142
we passed a weird man by the entrance.

441
00:22:12.142 --> 00:22:13.942
Weird man?

442
00:22:13.942 --> 00:22:16.942
He was wearing a long coat that didn't seem to fit this season

443
00:22:16.942 --> 00:22:18.942
and was whistling a tune.

444
00:22:20.442 --> 00:22:21.742
What?

445
00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:23.542
What kind of guy was he?

446
00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.142
Did you see his face?

447
00:22:25.142 --> 00:22:27.242
No. I couldn't because it was covered

448
00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:28.642
with his hat, hair and mustache, but...

449
00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:29.842
Listen, all of you.

450
00:22:29.842 --> 00:22:32.842
Don't leave this room till I return.

451
00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:36.342
Don't tell me that he was actually provoked

452
00:22:36.342 --> 00:22:38.242
by Mr. Hiramune who appeared on TV a while ago,

453
00:22:38.242 --> 00:22:40.042
and really decided to come?

454
00:22:40.042 --> 00:22:41.942
The serial killer?

455
00:24:05.842 --> 00:24:06.942
Mr. Hiramune.

456
00:24:08.742 --> 00:24:11.442
It seems that the culprit was whistling

457
00:24:11.442 --> 00:24:14.242
even when Morimura approached that car.

458
00:24:14.242 --> 00:24:16.342
And, he was shedding tears.

459
00:24:19.442 --> 00:24:21.542
So enthusiastic.

460
00:24:21.542 --> 00:24:23.742
Maybe it worked a bit too effectively.

461
00:24:23.742 --> 00:24:28.342
I've finally figured out the connection of the four victims!

462
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.842
Next Conan,

463
00:24:29.842 --> 00:24:33.742
"A New Scar and the Whistling Man"

464
00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:36.869
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:38.869
"Z".

466
00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:40.569
Ayumi, I'm with you!

467
00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:42.469
Aren't you going to protect me?

468
00:24:42.469 --> 00:24:43.769
Mitsuhiko, what're you going to do?
