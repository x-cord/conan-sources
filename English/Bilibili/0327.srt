1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,540
The fragrance of murder

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,740
and the blotches of a love affair.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,567
The Morozumi residence

9
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,867
that Hattori, Pops and I went on behalf of Kusukawa,

10
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,867
to investigate caught fire,

11
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:47,267
and Ryoko Morozumi dies.

12
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:53,167
Like all the other serial arson sites,

13
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,467
a red horse doll is left behind at the site.

14
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:02,467
However, one of the suspects Takanori Genda, admits to the crime,

15
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,067
and the case seems to have closed, but...

16
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:13,267
"Red Horse In The Fire (Case Solved)"

17
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,067
Oh, no! It's already 3 pm.

18
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,667
I guess we'll just have to forget about Tropical Land.

19
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,167
I see.

20
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,567
It's true that if we do as you say,

21
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,567
fire could be ignited automatically.

22
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,767
But the burn on that light bulb

23
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:39,067
could be something that coincidentally got there during the fire.

24
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,067
If that trick were to be used,

25
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,067
any of the three could've done it, couldn't they?

26
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,967
The owner of that house, Akira Morozumi, of course.

27
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,567
That womanizer Misao Soga,

28
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,467
as well as Ryoko's older sister, Keiko Gondo

29
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:02,167
seem to have frequently gone in and out of the house.

30
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,467
We came to Mr. Genda's house to find out who the culprit is,

31
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,167
so let's hurry and go into the house.

32
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,567
Yeah, right.

33
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:16,067
We may find a diary or something that could be a key to the case.

34
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,467
Gosh.

35
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:22,367
But you don't even have a search warrant

36
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,967
and yet you have the keys. It's amazing.

37
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:30,767
I told Genda that I would prove his innocence.

38
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,967
Then he broke out in tears and lent it to me.

39
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:38,667
It sure is a big house for Mr. Genda to be living in alone.

40
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,767
Yeah.

41
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:43,167
He was living here with his mother after his father passed away,

42
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:46,267
but last year, his mother also passed away of an illness.

43
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,267
By the way, Mouri, did you notice

44
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,167
the shoe marks in the corridor?

45
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,667
Yes. They're here and there.

46
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,067
The shoe marks of someone...

47
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,067
These are Mr. Genda's shoe marks.

48
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,967
It's the same as the shoes that's in the shoes cabinet.

49
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,067
Which means that Mr. Genda...

50
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,767
Hey. Take a look at this.

51
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,367
There's something strange in the wastebasket.

52
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:19,367
A soiled pair of socks and a burnt shirt.

53
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:23,067
If Mr. Genda's sleepwalking habit was getting worse,

54
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:26,367
maybe his saying, "The other me did it",

55
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,867
is not all that much of a lie.

56
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,267
He's not that kind of a guy.

57
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,567
He's not the kind of man

58
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,067
that would set fire to other people's houses.

59
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,067
Mr. Yuminaga...

60
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,867
Hey, Kudo!

61
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,867
Come here a minute!

62
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,967
It's the telephone bill that was on top of the shoes cabinet.

63
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,367
It says 30,000 yen a month.

64
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,167
Isn't it a bit too much?

65
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:01,167
It's true that it's strange for a guy who's living alone, but...

66
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,667
Ran also talks to Sonoko for a long time over silly things

67
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,567
and the bill totals to about that much.

68
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,167
Come to think of it,

69
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,467
silly Kazuha does the same thing.

70
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:15,067
She talks for a long time with my mom.

71
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,567
I wonder why women like to talk on the phone so much.

72
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,767
Well, I'm so sorry!

73
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,067
That our phone calls are so silly!

74
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,067
Heiji!

75
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,667
Conan!

76
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:34,467
Don't tell me you guys were eavesdropping from the front door?

77
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,767
We wouldn't do something low class like that!

78
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,867
You idiot!

79
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,467
We were listening to the car radio

80
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,367
when we heard you guys talking.

81
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,167
Right?

82
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,367
Radio?

83
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,467
It's inside this vase.

84
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,067
Here it is! Look!

85
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,567
It's a wiretap.

86
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,167
Huh?

87
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,067
That's exactly the same as the vase

88
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,967
that is in the front entrance of the Morozumi's, isn't it?

89
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,267
We heard other things, too.

90
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,067
Something about the wastebasket.

91
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,967
Hey, wait!

92
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:23,767
There's got be one near this wastebasket too, a wiretap.

93
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,667
A crystal ball?

94
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,467
Hattori.

95
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,167
I found it.

96
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,967
This time inside the cushion under the crystal ball.

97
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,367
I've seen that!

98
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,767
It's the crystal of good luck that the woman fortune-teller

99
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,667
at the building in front of Haido Station is selling.

100
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:46,067
She's known for being pretty good.

101
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,767
Hey! That small cushion...

102
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:51,867
It's a different color,

103
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,767
but similar to the one Ryoko was holding, don't you think?

104
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,367
Don't tell me...

105
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,767
Could it be in here, too?

106
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,767
Hey.

107
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,067
No.

108
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,167
It's not a wiretap.

109
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,667
But we found something unbelievable.

110
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,367
Yes. The guy, Genda confessed,

111
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,267
but suddenly refused to say anything.

112
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:29,467
The red horse was indeed handmade by Genda.

113
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:34,467
But he refuses to say anything about the serial arsons.

114
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,267
And we're at Genda's house right now,

115
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,067
but can't find any vital evidence.

116
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:43,167
Genda saying that he has a habit of sleepwalking

117
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,567
is probably a lie, too.

118
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,367
Well, the forensic officers will be here tomorrow,

119
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,367
so I'm sure something will come out.

120
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,667
When something more concerning the investigations come up,

121
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,067
I'll contact you again.

122
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,167
Was it okay, sonny?

123
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,067
Just great, Inspector!

124
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,567
But, what are you up to anyway?

125
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,767
Making fake calls like that to all three suspects?

126
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:09,767
Fake calls?

127
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,267
They're fake calls, aren't they?

128
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:14,167
You found wiretaps in the vase at the front entrance

129
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,067
as well as something in the cushion.

130
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,367
There is proof everywhere

131
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,267
that Mr. Genda had a habit of sleepwalking.

132
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,667
Well, I'll explain everything later.

133
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,467
And us being here, too.

134
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,167
Won't that make more work for the forensic officers?

135
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:33,067
Yeah. I'm sure our hair is on the floor somewhere, too.

136
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:37,067
Then, what should we do to erase all evidence that we were here?

137
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,767
What should we do?

138
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,667
Go all out and clean the place, what else?

139
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,967
If you didn't have time to do so, then what?

140
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,667
Well...

141
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,667
Maybe...

142
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,067
Hey.

143
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:23,567
Aren't you forgetting to leave this red horse behind?

144
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,567
Mr. Arsonist.

145
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,547
Or, should I say...

146
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,547
Mr. Morozumi.

147
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:47,947
Yeah.

148
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,847
This key holder of the red horse that Mr. Genda made

149
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,847
was the start of everything.

150
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:57,047
This red horse that is supposed to bring prosperous business.

151
00:11:57,047 --> 00:12:01,047
I don't know what caused the first fire in Rizencho,

152
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,747
but this horse was found at the site of the fire

153
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:08,647
because the owner of the house was a good customer of Mr. Genda's store.

154
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:13,747
Mr. Genda probably gave that person this key holder inside a box.

155
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,847
But before the person opened the box, the house caught fire.

156
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,547
The box and Guan Yu both burned

157
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,947
leaving behind only the Red Rabbit Horse.

158
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,247
Of course, the owner of the house

159
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:24,247
would have no knowledge of the horse.

160
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:28,547
And "Red Horse" is a code word for the police meaning arsonist.

161
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,947
So, the press began making a fuss writing articles

162
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:32,247
such as "The Start of a Series of Arsons".

163
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,647
On the other hand,

164
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,247
Mr. Genda who was shocked at hearing the person saying,

165
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,847
she knew nothing about the horse that he gave her...

166
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:41,547
got worried that maybe his sleepwalking habit

167
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,547
when he was a child had reoccurred again,

168
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,747
and went to your hospital,

169
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:48,847
where he was taken advantage of.

170
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:51,547
And when you heard Genda's story, you made him believe that

171
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:55,447
he was a sleepwalker who had a habit of committing arsons,

172
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:58,947
and took note of the fact that the first fire occurred in 1-chome.

173
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:02,547
Then after, you set fire to 2-chome and 3-chome in order.

174
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,147
You burned your house on 4-chome,

175
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:08,147
and killed your wife, Ryoko.

176
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,047
You cut the Guan Yu and stand off the key holder

177
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:14,147
and left the red horse at the site of the fire

178
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,447
to make it look like the serial arsonist did it,

179
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,047
and framed Mr. Genda up as the arsonist.

180
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,747
You made a spare key for this house

181
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,847
and snuck in here night after night

182
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,447
to corner Mr. Genda up against the wall.

183
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,147
You left shoe prints,

184
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:33,247
burnt shirts and dirty socks in his room

185
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:37,247
to make him come under the illusion that he was the arsonist.

186
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:41,447
But Mr. Genda came of his own initiative to my hospital

187
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,947
saying that he had a habit of sleepwalking.

188
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:47,847
But that's when he was a child, right?

189
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:49,447
I saw on TV that there are many cases

190
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,847
when a nervous child unable to cope with all the excitement

191
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:56,247
during the day sleepwalks around his sleeping quarters at night.

192
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,547
A psychiatrist should know something like that

193
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,747
right off the bat, no?

194
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:04,747
But Mr. Genda was loitering around nearby

195
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:07,347
when my house caught fire, wasn't he?

196
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,447
I would never know something like that,

197
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,047
even if I were his doctor, would I?

198
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:17,047
You heard Genda and Soga talking on the phone, didn't you?

199
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:20,547
With the wiretap that you set up inside the underside of the telephone

200
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,247
that you took out a while ago.

201
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,447
After hearing Soga say, "If you go to the houses on that day,

202
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,147
your fortune will take a turn for the better."

203
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:30,047
You picked the date to set fire.

204
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:34,047
All you had to do was change the beckoning cat key holder Genda

205
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,247
was supposed to pass out to the neighborhood that day,

206
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,647
to the Red Rabbit Horse.

207
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:41,247
You knew that Mr. Genda would come to retrieve the key holders

208
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,847
when he finds out that he had passed out the wrong ones and that,

209
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:48,447
the people would become suspicious at seeing him do this.

210
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:51,547
Since it was the day that Ryoko had called the detective,

211
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,647
you figured that if things worked out well,

212
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,747
the detective would remember Genda.

213
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:58,147
Please wait!

214
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,147
The fire was set at past 7:30 pm, right?

215
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,147
I went out to drink with Mr. Soga before 7:30 pm,

216
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,147
and he also testified to this.

217
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,747
Or, are you saying that the boy next door

218
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,647
who testified to the time of the arson is lying?

219
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,847
Huh? What's this?

220
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,647
The tissue paper is wrapped around the light bulb and taped on.

221
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:23,047
And there's something poked in between the tissue paper, too.

222
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,347
Wait!

223
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:27,347
It's a match!

224
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,847
The surface temperature of a light bulb of 100 watts

225
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,547
is 218 degrees.

226
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,947
Wrapping tissue paper around something like that

227
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:35,447
and moreover, poking a match between it.

228
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:36,647
It's not hard to figure out what will happen, is it?

229
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:41,547
In other words, it's a time-igniting device

230
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:44,447
to set fire to your house

231
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,247
while you are out drinking with Mr. Soga.

232
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,947
You did the same thing to the light bulb in the storeroom,

233
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,547
poured kerosene on the floor

234
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,347
and stuck a red horse between the window beforehand.

235
00:15:55,347 --> 00:15:56,647
Then, before you went out drinking with Mr. Soga,

236
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,847
you turned on the light.

237
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,347
So, 10 minutes later, the match would ignite,

238
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,847
the tissue paper would fall to the ground and fire would break out.

239
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:07,347
Then, the boy next door

240
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,747
as usual watches TV with the room dark.

241
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:13,047
When the tissue is wrapped around the light bulb,

242
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,647
the light is still weak,

243
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,847
so the silhouette of the horse will not project.

244
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,947
But after the tissue paper burns off,

245
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:20,947
the silhouette of the horse is projected

246
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,447
as if the arsonist had left the horse behind at that time.

247
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,247
Next, you were probably planning to sneak in here

248
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:30,447
and burn this place down to erase traces of you having been here.

249
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,947
But there is still other evidence.

250
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,647
It's the stand of the key holder

251
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,147
with the words "Red Rabbit Horse" on it

252
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,147
that Ryoko was holding on to at the time she died.

253
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,247
The cut part matched the leg of the horse

254
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,447
that was left back at the fire site on 3-chome.

255
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:46,847
Now, all that needs to be done is to see

256
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,547
if the fingerprints that are on it match your fingerprints.

257
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,947
You cut off the stand and Guan Yu

258
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:55,747
because you didn't want anyone to know it was what Mr. Genda had made.

259
00:16:55,747 --> 00:17:01,647
You didn't want him to get caught before you kill Ryoko.

260
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,747
It seems she knew what you were up to though.

261
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,847
She probably asked the detective to come and investigate

262
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:11,747
the suspicious person loitering around at night,

263
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:12,747
but found out that it was you,

264
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:16,747
experimenting on the trick in the storeroom.

265
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:19,347
After realizing it was you,

266
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:20,947
she checked your belongings

267
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:23,247
and found the red horse and the stand,

268
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:27,047
and was convinced that the serial arsonist was you.

269
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,347
She probably asked us to leave

270
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,647
because she was planning to threaten you to...

271
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,147
Right!

272
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:36,147
She threatened to divorce me and kick me out of this house!

273
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,447
All I wanted to do was

274
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,447
burn the house and build a hospital.

275
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,747
Hey, hey.

276
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:44,847
Only if this stand wasn't found!

277
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,747
If I didn't get deceived into a trap like this!

278
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,447
This was supposed to be a perfect crime!

279
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:54,447
You idiot. We knew from before you came here.

280
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:55,747
Don't lie!

281
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,047
Soga could've done it, and so could Ryoko's older sister!

282
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,147
Yeah.

283
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:02,447
Those two also sold objects with wiretaps in them to Genda

284
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,347
and were wiretapping him.

285
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:07,147
They probably wanted him to believe in Feng Shui

286
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:10,347
and fortune-telling by telling him stuff only he alone knew,

287
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:13,747
and sell him more expensive stuff.

288
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:18,847
We found out from the telephone bill that the phone was wiretapped.

289
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,247
When you wiretap using the telephone line,

290
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,847
it has to be connected all the while

291
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:26,847
so the telephone bill sky-rockets.

292
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,347
So, how can you tell that I'm the one who set it up?

293
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:34,347
It could be either one of the two!

294
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,047
You still don't realize?

295
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,647
Huh?

296
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:40,247
You understand that in order to set up a wiretap in the phone,

297
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:44,447
you have to sneak into the house, right?

298
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:45,847
Yeah.

299
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:49,447
As for the other two, if they were to sneak into the house,

300
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:52,147
they would first of all remove the wiretap

301
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:54,447
from the things that they sold Mr. Genda,

302
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,447
because otherwise, they'd be suspected.

303
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:05,247
You probably came across committing this crime

304
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,447
after reading Agatha Christie's "The ABC Murders",

305
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,347
but why didn't you realize then

306
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:14,547
that no matter how hard you think out the plan,

307
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:17,447
the one who gets to laugh at the end is not the killer,

308
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,047
but the old man with the gray brain.

309
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,447
See you then, Mouri. Thanks for everything.

310
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,547
No, not at all.

311
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,547
No. Rather...

312
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,147
maybe I should be thanking these boys?

313
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:51,347
By the way, what will become of those two?

314
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,247
Well, it's not that they sold

315
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,147
something outrageously expensive to Genda yet,

316
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,747
and all they did was sneak in to collect their wiretaps

317
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:02,347
because they didn't want to be suspected as arsonists, so...

318
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:05,747
We'll let them go after we give them a good lecture at the station.

319
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:11,847
Tell me. Why did you believe Genda was innocent?

320
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,147
Yeah.

321
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:16,047
When Genda came up as a suspect,

322
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,847
I called him out to the park and talked to him.

323
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,747
I stayed with him for 30 minutes, but he hardly talked.

324
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,747
So, we decided to talk again some other time

325
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:27,947
and I got up from the bench.

326
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:30,047
I turned to look back at him from a distance,

327
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,047
and saw him looking desperately for something

328
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:35,247
in the grassy area around the bench.

329
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:40,747
It began raining a little while after he left the bench.

330
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,047
After seeing the look of relief on his face,

331
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,547
I finally understood

332
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,447
that he was looking for the cigarette butt

333
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,747
that I threw down on the ground.

334
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:55,647
Because that was what caused the fire that took his father's life.

335
00:20:57,747 --> 00:21:00,247
I just couldn't believe that a guy like him

336
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:01,947
could set fire to anybody's house.

337
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:04,147
Neither did I want believe he could.

338
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:06,047
It's as simple as that.

339
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,447
See you, Mouri!

340
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:13,347
Yes, sir!

341
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:49,447
Hey, come on. A little cheaper!

342
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:53,247
I came all the way here to buy from you to cheer you up, you know?

343
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,247
But that watch is made by a famous craftsman.

344
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:59,047
No matter how famous,

345
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,047
if it doesn't move unless you wind it,

346
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:05,847
it's practically useless in this day and age, right?

347
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:07,447
But...

348
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,547
Okay! Give me this too and a 500 yen discount.

349
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:11,847
How's about it?

350
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:13,447
Heiji, we better hurry

351
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:15,547
or we won't make it in time for the plane going back home.

352
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:18,047
Come on, mister. Hurry and wrap it up, will you?

353
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,247

Never mind giving him a discount already,

356
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:28,247

No, no way!

360

Please, mister!

366
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:07,047
Stay back! Don't touch anything on the table!

367
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:13,347

Is the next story about Japanese sake again?
