1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,500
Uncle Kogoro.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Inspector Megure always says that

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,700
incidents happen when we're around, right?

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,500
Yes, well...

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
I guess that's what they call a coincidence.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,700
So, is that also a coincidence?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,500
It's a coincidence, all right!

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,100
A message in the vegetables.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,700
Lit on fire with lives on the line.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,200
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,000
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,900
"The Pork Soup Is A Signal To Risk One's Life"

16
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,000
The victim is Lisa Hewitson, 25 years old.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
( Lisa Hewitson(25) )
The cause of death is severe blood loss.

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,800
The estimated time of death
is between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Judging by the way the blood spurted out,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,200
the culprit likely had blood
spattered on his or her body.

21
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,700
I think so.

22
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,400
So, where's the murder weapon?

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Mr. Mouri? Why are you here?

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
And Conan, too?

25
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,200
We haven't found the murder weapon yet.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
How about fingerprints?

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
We've discovered three sets of fingerprints

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
other than that of the victim.

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,200
I see.

30
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Excuse me.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,300
What was in that pouch?

32
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,300
The contents are on the table.

33
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,400
ID papers, a wallet,
and a complete set of make-up

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,600
as well as a ballpen and notebook.

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,500
There were no signs of the doorway
or windows being forced open.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,400
So, perhaps it was done
by someone she knew.

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
In that case,

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,600
first, we have to find out about the lovers.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,100
Takashi Hara, 23 years old.

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,700
We've confirmed he was
romantically involved with the victim

41
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,000
based on testimonies
by those who know them.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,300
By the way, his fingerprints,

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900
which we obtained
when he broke traffic rules,

44
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,100
matched one of the fingerprints
we found at the scene.

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,700
( Takashi Hara(23) )
That can't be!

46
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,750
( Takashi Hara(23) )
I can't believe Lisa was killed.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,800
She was so lively yesterday.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,100
So, you're saying that
you were with Lisa yesterday?

49
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
I last saw her three days ago.

50
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,500
We were talking on the phone yesterday.

51
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,200
In that case, where were you
between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m.?

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,100
Last night, I was out drinking

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,000
with my co-workers until 3:00 a.m.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
By the way,

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,100
did you notice anything strange
in your girlfriend lately?

56
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,700
Anything strange?

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,200
We'd like to know
if there's anyone suspicious around her.

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
It's him!

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
It's Komaki,
the owner of the bar where Lisa works!

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
She always complained to me
about how she was troubled

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
by how he would always flirt with her.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,700
He has to be the culprit!
You have to catch him!

63
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,500
Satoshi Komaki, 47 years old.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,200
He has a history of tax evasion
and attempted extortion.

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
There are also rumours

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
that he is connected
to some unsavoury people.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
In addition, his fingerprints

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
were also found at the scene of the crime.

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
What?

70
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,900
( Satoshi Komaki(47) )
Officer, you can't possibly
be suspecting me of the crime.

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,800
That's not what we are saying.

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,600
It's just that one of your employees has died.

73
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
So, if you don't tell us anything...

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Is that so?

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,200
If that is the case,
we'll give our extensive support.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,100
Then, please tell us about your relationship

77
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,700
with Miss Hewitson.

78
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,600
Well, you could say that
we have a working relationship.

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
In other words, a relationship
between an employer and an employee.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
What is it like when you are in private?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,700
Instead of giving her allowance,

82
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,500
I would play Old Maid with her
in the middle of the night.

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
- What?
- In other words,

84
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,200
you've been in Miss Hewitson's apartment.
Is that correct?

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
Of course.

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,700
Old Maid is meant to be played
in the middle of the night.

87
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,300
Then, I would like to know your alibi

88
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,500
for between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m. last night.

89
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Hey. Isn't there something else that
you should be investigating?

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,600
There is conclusive evidence
left  in her apartment.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,300
Am I right?

92
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
For example, it could be
a murder weapon with her blood

93
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,700
or a wine bottle with fingerprints on it.

94
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,100
Or maybe some outerwear
that belonged to the culprit.

95
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,400
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,500
Do you happen to
know something about the incident?

97
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,000
No, well... What I meant to say is...

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,700
That's it! He's the one who did it.

99
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,400
What do you mean by "him"?

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm talking about that Hara kid.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,400
He's always leering at my employees.

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,600
That's why there's no doubt that he did it.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,800
Aren't you jumping to
conclusions a little early here?

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm not jumping to conclusions!

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,600
He has to be the one who did it.

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,700
Doesn't that make you the culprit?

107
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,500
What did you say?

108
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,700
I believe we still haven't heard an alibi

109
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,600
for 1:00 to 1:30 a.m. from you yet.

110
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,100
Alibi?

111
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,800
An alibi?

112
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,400
I have one, all right.

113
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,900
It's a cast-iron alibi.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,200
I was at home at that time.

115
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,900
If you think it's a lie,
you can ask my wife Mihoko.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,200
Mihoko Komaki, 28 years old.

117
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
She doesn't have a criminal record.

118
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,300
Since she got married two years ago,
she has become a housewife.

119
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,600
But, will the old man's wife
have a reliable testimony?

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,000
The testimony may not be
as authentic as it can be.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Before she was married,

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,400
she worked alongside the victim at Komaki's bar.

123
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,500
Apparently, she was forced to marry him.

124
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, it would be convenient for him

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
if he could get his wife
to fabricate evidence for him.

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,500
I, the great detective Kogoro Mouri,

127
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,600
will see through the contradictions

128
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,300
and solve the case quickly!

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
Please have a seat.

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,300
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you for having us.

131
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,300
Let's cut to the chase.

132
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,700
You are Ms. Mihoko Komaki, is that right?

133
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,100
( Mihoko Komaki(28) )
Yes. Please ask me anything.

134
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,200
( Mihoko Komaki(28) )

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,100
My husband insisted that

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,200
I answer honestly so many times before.

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Then, at what time did Mr. Komaki
return home yesterday night?

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,700
My husband usually comes home

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,300
around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. after the bar closes.

140
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,800
But there was a TV programme
he wanted to watch yesterday,

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,400
so he came home at 11:00 p.m.

142
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,500
By the way, what was the TV programme
he wanted to watch?

143
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
It was a news programme.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
He said he had to watch it

145
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,500
since an accountant he knows was arrested.

146
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,200
You can watch TV programmes
anywhere these days.

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,900
Even if you knew what was in the programme,

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,500
it does not become substantial evidence.

149
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,100
What? Are you suspecting my husband?

150
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,700
My husband may look like that,
but he actually hates to lie.

151
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,600
What? There's something on the ornament.

152
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,800
Is that...

153
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,300
A microphone!

154
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,900
So, the conversation is being recorded.

155
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,200
Mrs. Komaki, you are a beautiful young woman,

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,600
so why are you married to a man like him?

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Surely there are a lot of other,
better men out there.

158
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
We got married two years ago.

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,800
At that time, I was engaged to another man.

160
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,200
My fiance and I
believed we were going to be married.

161
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
But just before the wedding ceremony...

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,300
An unknown random attacker stabbed him.

163
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,700
And in that incident, your fiance...

164
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
He died.

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,000
The murderer was arrested right away,

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,300
but I heard he died in prison.

167
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,100
After that, bad things kept happening around me.

168
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,900
Could you give any specifics as to what happened?

169
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,900
The company I worked at went bankrupt
all of a sudden.

170
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,300
My younger sister was followed by a stalker.

171
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,800
My father's factory caught fire,

172
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,900
and my mother fell off a train station platform.

173
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,000
Is that true?

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Would I joke about something like this?

175
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,000
You've had a streak of terrible luck.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
The only fortunate thing was that

177
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
no one in my family died.

178
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,000
The one who helped me out
when I was at rock bottom

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,900
was none other than Komaki.

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,300
Something isn't right.

181
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,800
There's a hidden microphone.

182
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,700
And the way she's bringing
attention to things in the room...

183
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,200
On top of that, she's telling us
about her misfortunes

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
and how she met her husband...

185
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
More importantly, her expression...

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Hey, do you love your husband?

187
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,500
Pardon?

188
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

189
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,900
Of course, I love him.
Why did you ask that?

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,700
So, I see.

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't ask such weird questions!

192
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,300
There's no doubt.

193
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,200
She's lying.

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
If that is the case...

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
(7 December)

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,300
(Incidents occurring on 7 December)

197
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
This must be it.

198
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
(From: Conan)

199
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,000
Uncle Kogoro is saying that
the room is being bugged.

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
The room is being bugged?

201
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,500
Mrs. Komaki's husband
is probably the one listening.

202
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,200
But why would he plant a bug?

203
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,900
Mrs. Komaki wants to tell the truth,

204
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,900
but it seems impossible
with the room being bugged.

205
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,200
That's why Uncle Kogoro
is saying that we need to find out

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
using methods other than speaking.

207
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,900
Other than speaking?

208
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,600
But how?

209
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,950
By the way, Uncle Kogoro is telling us

210
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,900
to keep pretending we don't know.

211
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,500
You're free to love your husband, after all.

212
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,900
Could we ask you to do something for us?

213
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,300
Ms. Mihoko.

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:34,150
Could you answer the following questions
with "yes" or "no"?

215
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Pardon?

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,700
With "yes" or "no", please.

217
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,700
Sure. I understand.

218
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,000
You're Ms. Mihoko Komaki, is that right?

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,900
Yes.

220
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,100
Have you been lying about
your husband's alibi in your testimony?

221
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Of course not.

222
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,000
He returned home at 11:00 p.m. last night.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,300
I can guarantee it.

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,500
- Well, that is...
- Do you think...

225
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,600
your husband is involved
in the current incident?

226
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I don't think so.
The culprit has to be out there.

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
If that is the case, the culprit...

228
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Madam, what makes you think so?

229
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,700
- Pardon?
- Is there anyone else on your mind?

230
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,000
Well...

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
that's just my opinion.

232
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,000
Mrs. Komaki.

233
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,500
The police will guarantee your safety.

234
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,100
Would you cooperate with us?

235
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh, right!

236
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,000
It's about time for my husband to come home!

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,200
I have to cook for him.

238
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,400
Mrs. Komaki?

239
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,900
First, I have to chop the vegetables, or else...

240
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,400
What on earth is going on?

241
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,800
Spring onion, burdock, and radish...

242
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,200
I know! You're making pork soup!

243
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,200
That's what you came up with?

244
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
If she isn't, then it's a Morse code signal.

245
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,500
She's trying to tell us something
by chopping up the vegetables.

246
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,200
This is...

247
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,800
Excuse me, Mrs. Komaki...

248
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,700
Stop right there!

249
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,900
Don't try to get close to my wife.

250
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,200
- Komaki!
- You must have heard enough from her now.

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,000
If you're not going to arrest me,
get out of here right away!

252
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,500
Madam. Here you go.

253
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,000
It's an amulet. See you!

254
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,000
There's no doubt Komaki is the culprit,

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,700
but there's no evidence.

256
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,100
If only we had concrete evidence...

257
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,900
That won't be a problem!

258
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,400
Mr. Mouri, what did you find out?

259
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,900
She was making pork soup.

260
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,400
After that, she would
cook the rice and main dish.

261
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,300
In other words, the pork soup
would consist of pork belly...

262
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Pork soup...

263
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Mr. Mouri?

264
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,400
Officer Takagi.

265
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
We're going to the victim's apartment building.

266
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,300
Roger that!

267
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,000
But why are we going to
the victim's apartment building?

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,800
The first thing she tried to tell us about

269
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
was the bug on the horse ornament.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
She was telling us that she couldn't say things

271
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,100
as freely as she would have liked.

272
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,500
Next was the painting on the wall.

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,300
A date was written on it.

274
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Officer Chiba.

275
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,100
Search the internet for incidents
that occurred on 7 December.

276
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,900
Yes, sir. Let's see...

277
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,400
This is...

278
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,800
The murder by that random attacker.

279
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
The victim was most likely Ms. Mihoko's fiance.

280
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,100
And it's possible that the arrested culprit
was falsely accused.

281
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,400
How did you figure it all out?

282
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,300
It's the evidence.

283
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,400
For example, it could be
a murder weapon with her blood

284
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,600
or a wine bottle with fingerprints on it.

285
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,500
Or maybe some outerwear
that belonged to the culprit.

286
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
The evidence seized
in the random attacker incident

287
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,700
was exactly the same
as the things Komaki mentioned.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,800
To think that the dog would bite its owner...

289
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,900
What on earth are you talking about?

290
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm so disappointed.
I thought I taught you well enough.

291
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,800
He probably left similar evidence
at the crime scene

292
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,800
to pin the crime on Mr. Hara.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,200
But for some reason,
that evidence has disappeared.

294
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,600
This is what I meant.

295
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,500
After I left Lisa's apartment,

296
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,600
you snuck in and took away the evidence.

297
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Am I wrong?

298
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
It wasn't me!

299
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Don't lie to me!

300
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,200
You were desperate
to tip off the police, weren't you?

301
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I would never do such a thing!

302
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,800
I planted a camera
inside the teddy bear on the sofa.

303
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,800
So, you're saying that
the third set of fingerprints at the crime scene

304
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,100
belongs to her. Is that right?

305
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes. And what she told us
about her misfortunes...

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,100
Those were likely true.

307
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,900
For that reason, she was unable to take action.

308
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,100
She had been warned that
her family would be in danger

309
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,200
if Komaki was arrested
and he found out about her betrayal.

310
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
What a jerk.

311
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,100
What are you going to do to me?

312
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,500
I won't do a thing.
You are my beloved wife, you know.

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,000
But unfortunately,
my beloved "honey" has gone missing.

314
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There's no point in intentionally leaving a body

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,700
when I'm being targeted by the police, after all.

316
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,400
By the way, what was she trying to do

317
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
when she chopped those vegetables?

318
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,400
That was also her way of giving us a hint.

319
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
A hint?

320
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,100
What do spring onion, burdock,
and radish have in common?

321
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,800
That they're all ingredients in pork soup?

322
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
No!

323
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
They're all long and thin?

324
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Yes! However, in case it didn't come across,

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,700
she started doing something else.

326
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,800
You two might not have seen it
because Komaki appeared at that time,

327
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
but Conan had a look at it.

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What she was making
with the vegetables she chopped was...

329
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
It looks like a regular old ballpen to me.

330
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
How about we disassemble it?

331
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
All right.

332
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
This is...

333
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,100
It's a receipt from the cleaners!

334
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,800
We've finally found solid evidence.

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,200
If we investigate
the DNA from the blood on the shirt...

336
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
The case will be solved.

337
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
Hello? This is Chiba.

338
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
What did you say?

339
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
Komaki has disappeared!

340
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,600
What?

341
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,900
Well then, do you have any last words?

342
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Why did you kill her?

343
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,500
It's because she said no
when I asked her out.

344
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,600
I had such a good offer, too.

345
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,100
But she just had to be loyal to that guy.

346
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,800
You're the worst!

347
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
What are you saying, you stupid traitor?

348
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,700
The police will arrest you for sure.

349
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,800
Did you really think
I only erased the evidence?

350
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,100
You're bluffing.

351
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,600
I told them everything!

352
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Even all the atrocious things
you did in the past!

353
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,900
Is that all you're going to say?

354
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,100
- It's the cops!
- How?

355
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
It's because the amulet worked.

356
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,300
Police! Don't move!

357
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
You...

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
Stop right there!

359
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
You're not getting away, old man!

360
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
After that, investigations proved that

361
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Komaki was guilty
of murdering Ms. Mihoko's fiance

362
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,600
as well as the case involving the man
thought to be the perpetrator.

363
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Hello? Is that you, Ran?

364
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,000
I want you to make pork soup
for dinner tonight.

365
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,900
What? You've finished shopping for ingredients?

366
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,800
Never mind that!
Just make pork soup with them!

367
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,400
I told you... Pork soup...

368
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Pork soup with spring onion, burdock, and radish!

369
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,100
I want it now!

370
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,000
(Next Episode)
It's dessert after this!

371
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,590
It's time for that birthday cake
to make an appearance.

372
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,220
I can't wait!

373
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,930
Whoa, your glasses is glowing!

374
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,690
Darned, it's so dark I can't see a thing!

375
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,740
Next Conan,

376
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,820
"Divine Punishment of the Birthday Party"
(Part 1)

377
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,720
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,800
“Birthday Cake"

379
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
This week, we'll be having pork soup

380
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,800
while telling you
how we feel about pork soup.

381
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,310
Thank you for the meal.
