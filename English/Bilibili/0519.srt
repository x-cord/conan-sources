1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.340
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.440
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.040
The treasure hunt became a big case.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.840
What will happen to the kidnapped Haibara and Mitsuhiko?

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:52.193 --> 00:01:54.193
At the Shouin Shrine in Tokyo,

9
00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:55.493
we rescued Kimiko Kobayakawa

10
00:01:55.493 --> 00:01:58.393
from a man attacked her.

11
00:01:58.393 --> 00:02:00.993
In order to search for "The treasure that could buy a country"

12
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.593
that her deceased grandfather was said to possess.

13
00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:06.593
We went to Tsuwano, Kimiko's family home.

14
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:10.593
On the way, at Shin-Yamaguchi Station,

15
00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:13.893
we ran into Kimiko's friend, Shigeru Kawaguchi.

16
00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:15.393
However, Haibara and I noticed that

17
00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:17.993
he was assuming a false name.

18
00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:22.993
At Tsuwano, we discovered a new riddle

19
00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:24.793
and an old map of the town of Hagi.

20
00:02:24.793 --> 00:02:28.593
As well as a picture of a cat drawn in the diary.

21
00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:31.393
In search for clues, we went to visit Hagi.

22
00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:32.993
I witnessed Shigeru

23
00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:37.193
meeting the men who attacked Kimiko in Tokyo.

24
00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:39.893
And finally, those mysterious men made their move.

25
00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:49.193
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Deciphering Chapter"

26
00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:53.193
-Horrible people. -What should we do?

27
00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:56.193
What we should do is to notify the police!

28
00:02:56.193 --> 00:03:00.093
That's right, didn't someone say that the police was coming?

29
00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:01.293
That voice.

30
00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:03.693
Police! This way! Come quick!

31
00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:08.293
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi. Kimiko's friend!

32
00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:11.493
That was unmistakably his voice that we heard.

33
00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.993
It's from Ms. Kimiko's phone!

34
00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:16.393
Put it on speakerphone!

35
00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:17.693
Okay.

36
00:03:17.693 --> 00:03:19.593
Press this button and...

37
00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:20.993
Can you hear me?

38
00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:22.993
We have the girl and kids here.

39
00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:25.593
Find the treasure now.

40
00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:28.993
If you delay, you know what will happen to them, right?

41
00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:30.193
You!

42
00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:34.193
Do not notify the police. Will contact you again.

43
00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:36.493
Hello?

44
00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:39.693
Ms. Kimiko? Hello?

45
00:03:42.193 --> 00:03:43.893
We have to call the police!

46
00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:47.293
We can't! If we do, they might harm them.

47
00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.393
But there's no guarantee of their safety

48
00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:51.793
just because we obey them either.

49
00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:53.593
I understand.

50
00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.593
Conan.

51
00:03:56.593 --> 00:04:00.193
Mitsuhiko threw this before he got caught.

52
00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:01.593
Mitsuhiko.

53
00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:05.893
I see! I got it!

54
00:04:05.893 --> 00:04:08.793
If you put this picture of the cat and the old map of Hagi...

55
00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:11.493
When you turn over the map onto this...

56
00:04:12.793 --> 00:04:14.193
They are the same shape!

57
00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:15.593
Wow!

58
00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:19.093
This cat is representing the map of Hagi.

59
00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:23.893
And to "Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat" means...

60
00:04:23.893 --> 00:04:26.993
place the cat eye and the position of the castle..

61
00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:29.093
And the hole in the picture of the cat

62
00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:31.493
should tell us where to go next!

63
00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:33.993
I see!

64
00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:36.093
If we go here, we should be able to solve

65
00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:38.793
what it means by "look under the mouse"!

66
00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:41.493
Mr. Mouri! I have notified the police!

67
00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:47.693
Mr. Kikkawa, can you tell us where this is in Hagi?

68
00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:48.993
Look here!

69
00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.193
This is...

70
00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:53.693
Enseiji Temple!

71
00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.293
Then Enseiji Temple is where we're going!

72
00:04:56.293 --> 00:04:58.993
We have to hurry.

73
00:04:58.993 --> 00:05:01.293
"On November 30th,"

74
00:05:01.293 --> 00:05:05.793
"only then, the sunset will show the truth of the treasure."

75
00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:08.093
We only have until sunset!

76
00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:12.493
You can take those off now.

77
00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:16.793
I will tell you though, nobody can hear you from here.

78
00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:19.193
Now stay there and don't try anything!

79
00:05:24.493 --> 00:05:29.893
Stay here? They're really thinking we are just a couple of kids.

80
00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:34.593
That's so true. We don't give up that easily.

81
00:05:37.993 --> 00:05:39.793
-Conan? -Mitsuhiko?

82
00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:41.793
You can hear me?

83
00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:43.093
Mitsuhiko!

84
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.193
Is everyone all right?

85
00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:45.893
They haven't done anything to you, I hope!

86
00:05:45.893 --> 00:05:48.093
We are all okay.

87
00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:49.993
We're in an underground.

88
00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:51.693
What are you hiding there?

89
00:05:51.693 --> 00:05:53.693
-Mitsuhiko! -What's going on?

90
00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:55.593
Mitsuhiko!

91
00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:00.293
Seems like someone needs to be taught a lesson!

92
00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:04.493
Mitsuhiko! Mitsuhiko!

93
00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:06.793
We lost contact.

94
00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:09.193
You did contact the police, right?

95
00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:11.293
Yes.

96
00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:15.393
This is Enseiji Temple.

97
00:06:15.393 --> 00:06:20.193
People such as Hirobumi Ito and Shinsaku Takasugi studied here.

98
00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.493
"Look under the mouse."

99
00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:23.993
What does it mean?

100
00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:26.493
Wow! Look at that mask!

101
00:06:26.493 --> 00:06:28.493
It's scary-looking!

102
00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:31.393
What is it?

103
00:06:31.393 --> 00:06:34.293
I found it! Right here!

104
00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:36.993
I see a mouse!

105
00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:39.593
The animals that represent the Chinese zodiac are decorated here.

106
00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:43.593
I see, so it should be underneath here.

107
00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:45.693
Under here?

108
00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:47.693
I don't see anything.

109
00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:51.293
Well, Kimiko's grandfather loved to play with words.

110
00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:54.293
Maybe there is another twist to this.

111
00:06:54.293 --> 00:06:56.393
"Mouse" is also similar to "Mouth."

112
00:06:56.393 --> 00:06:59.093
That's it!

113
00:06:59.093 --> 00:07:00.793
Mouth!

114
00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:04.793
That means the treasure should be inside the mouth of this.

115
00:07:04.793 --> 00:07:08.693
Oh, it says under, so it might be this?

116
00:07:12.193 --> 00:07:15.693
I see. This is it.

117
00:07:19.193 --> 00:07:20.193
What are those?

118
00:07:20.193 --> 00:07:22.793
Those are the largest stone lantern in the prefecture.

119
00:07:22.793 --> 00:07:24.993
The amazing thing is that some of the stones

120
00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:27.993
holding up the lanterns are able to move around.

121
00:07:27.993 --> 00:07:29.893
Got it.

122
00:07:31.893 --> 00:07:34.693
-I found it. -Wow! You did it!

123
00:07:34.693 --> 00:07:37.393
How did you figure it out?

124
00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:39.593
That opening in the top of the lanterns are called "Higuchi"

125
00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:41.493
which means "Fire Mouth".

126
00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:45.593
I see, so this means "Under the mouth" as well.

127
00:07:45.593 --> 00:07:48.893
And, what's this time?

128
00:07:48.893 --> 00:07:50.193
This is...

129
00:07:50.193 --> 00:07:51.893
What is this?

130
00:07:51.893 --> 00:07:53.693
Another puzzle?

131
00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:58.293
Wait. I've seen this before in the diary.

132
00:07:58.293 --> 00:07:59.993
Look.

133
00:07:59.993 --> 00:08:04.293
This paper was torn off from this diary.

134
00:08:04.293 --> 00:08:09.193
Then these two pages are the next puzzle.

135
00:08:09.193 --> 00:08:13.093
"Make the map in the cave where the water goblin lives."

136
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:17.693
There is only one cave that they say the water goblin lives.

137
00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:19.693
You mean, they are real?

138
00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:21.893
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

139
00:08:22.993 --> 00:08:25.493
So you know where the treasure is?

140
00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:27.993
Are all three of them safe?

141
00:08:27.993 --> 00:08:29.693
Do you know where the treasure is?

142
00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:32.893
Let us hear their voices first!

143
00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:37.293
So you do not care if you cannot hear their voices ever again.

144
00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:42.993
It's the Akiyoshi Cave.

145
00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:46.693
Hurry!

146
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.793
We don't have time!

147
00:08:48.793 --> 00:08:50.793
Akiyoshi Cave is said to be

148
00:08:50.793 --> 00:08:54.393
one of the largest limestone caves in Orient.

149
00:08:57.193 --> 00:08:59.093
The sun is setting soon.

150
00:08:59.093 --> 00:09:00.193
Let's go!

151
00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:06.393
"Make the map in the cave."

152
00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:08.493
So there should be some hints in this cave

153
00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:10.593
that would help us complete the map.

154
00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:13.293
This is the "Ao-Tenjo" area.

155
00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:15.793
The light coming from outside reflects on the water

156
00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:18.593
and makes the ceiling blue.

157
00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:19.793
What's this place?

158
00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:22.493
It says, "Nagabuchi".

159
00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:24.593
"Hyakumaizara".

160
00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:26.893
It really does look like a hundred plates!

161
00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:30.393
Just like the name! They're so interesting.

162
00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:31.993
Hyakumaizara.

163
00:09:31.993 --> 00:09:34.893
Nagabuchi. Ao-Tenjo.

164
00:09:34.893 --> 00:09:37.893
Ao and Hyaku.

165
00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:39.393
I get it!

166
00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:40.993
What is it?

167
00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:42.293
Look.

168
00:09:43.993 --> 00:09:46.693
We take these apart.

169
00:09:46.693 --> 00:09:48.493
What are you doing?

170
00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:50.193
This is how it's supposed to be.

171
00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.493
Look closely!

172
00:09:52.493 --> 00:09:54.393
See the letters on the top left corner?

173
00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.093
-Yeah. -Well, these are

174
00:09:56.093 --> 00:10:00.093
all the first letter of the areas inside the Akiyoshi Cave.

175
00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:02.593
See, this one is "Ao" from the "Ao-Tenjo" area, meaning "Blue".

176
00:10:02.593 --> 00:10:04.593
This is "Naga" from "Nagabuchi", meaning "Long".

177
00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:07.893
This means the Hyakumaizara area.

178
00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.193
Look at the rest too!

179
00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.893
Yes, you are correct.

180
00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:16.493
And from there it goes from "Dounaifuji", "Kabocyaiwa",

181
00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:20.993
"Oomatsutake", "Subogaki", "Chirimeniwa".

182
00:10:20.993 --> 00:10:23.193
Those are the famous places in order.

183
00:10:23.193 --> 00:10:25.993
So, if we put these pieces of papers

184
00:10:25.993 --> 00:10:29.093
in order from the entrance...

185
00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:31.493
What's going to happen?

186
00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:33.193
See!

187
00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:36.393
It's a map of a cave.

188
00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:40.193
The "X" mark should be where the treasure is!

189
00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:42.993
Look at the message here.

190
00:10:42.993 --> 00:10:46.493
It says, "Wainori."

191
00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:48.393
Actually, this one you read from right to left.

192
00:10:48.393 --> 00:10:50.093
I see.

193
00:10:50.093 --> 00:10:55.893
Kuroka, radetefu, tagonori, yuuki,

194
00:10:55.893 --> 00:11:01.893
tsunei, wanokuchi, sakihika, rinoiwa?

195
00:11:01.893 --> 00:11:04.893
It says, "Out from the black, the twin dragons,"

196
00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:08.593
"on the tip of the foxes mouth, in the rock of light".

197
00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:12.893
"Out of the black" should be...

198
00:11:12.893 --> 00:11:14.993
Kurotaniguchi.

199
00:11:14.993 --> 00:11:19.693
Kuro of "Kurotaniguchi" as in black, huh?

200
00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:23.393
Then what is the "Twin dragons"?

201
00:11:23.393 --> 00:11:24.793
Hey!

202
00:11:24.793 --> 00:11:25.993
Do you know anywhere

203
00:11:25.993 --> 00:11:28.693
that has two waterfalls lined up next to each other?

204
00:11:28.693 --> 00:11:30.693
Two waterfalls?

205
00:11:30.693 --> 00:11:34.593
There is one place halfway through the mountain here.

206
00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.893
So that's what the twin dragons are about!

207
00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:38.593
Then, right close to that.

208
00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:40.993
We can find the fox rock!

209
00:11:40.993 --> 00:11:42.493
Hurry!

210
00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:44.593
Mr. Kikkawa!

211
00:11:44.593 --> 00:11:46.393
Can I borrow that cell phone?

212
00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:49.193
Sure. Of course.

213
00:11:49.193 --> 00:11:51.493
But whom are you calling now?

214
00:11:51.493 --> 00:11:55.993
It's better to wait. Sorry about that, thank you.

215
00:11:55.993 --> 00:11:58.293
It's okay.

216
00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:15.404
This must be the twin dragons.

217
00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:20.704
Then all we have to do is look for a fox-shaped rock!

218
00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:24.204
But I don't see it anywhere.

219
00:12:24.204 --> 00:12:26.404
Where could it be?

220
00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:36.904
Over there.

221
00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:39.304
Huh? Where is it?

222
00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:42.904
That rock? But it doesn't look like a fox.

223
00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:46.104
-The shadow. -The shadow?

224
00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:50.604
Oh! It's a fox!

225
00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:53.104
I see! It wasn't about the shape of the rock,

226
00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:55.304
but the shape of the shadow!

227
00:12:55.304 --> 00:12:57.604
And on the tip of its mouth.

228
00:12:57.604 --> 00:13:00.004
That over there is the "Rock of Light".

229
00:13:02.904 --> 00:13:06.704
There is a mirror inside this rock.

230
00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:09.004
It has to be this day of the year

231
00:13:09.004 --> 00:13:11.304
to have the sun exactly shine into the mirror.

232
00:13:11.304 --> 00:13:13.804
Let's move this rock!

233
00:13:17.304 --> 00:13:19.504
The treasure should be inside here.

234
00:13:19.504 --> 00:13:22.104
Yes, no doubt about it.

235
00:13:26.904 --> 00:13:29.504
Genta, Ayumi, be careful!

236
00:13:29.504 --> 00:13:31.904
Leave it to us!

237
00:13:31.904 --> 00:13:34.204
The path breaks off into two directions.

238
00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:35.804
Take a right.

239
00:13:35.804 --> 00:13:38.404
Another right.

240
00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:39.904
And another right.

241
00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:43.104
Then left, and left.

242
00:13:43.104 --> 00:13:46.204
Okay, right, right, right, and left, left!

243
00:13:46.204 --> 00:13:50.104
Right, right, right, and left, left!

244
00:13:50.104 --> 00:13:52.604
Why are you yelling?

245
00:13:52.604 --> 00:13:56.104
I'm sorry, I got a little excited.

246
00:13:56.104 --> 00:13:58.104
Next should be this way.

247
00:13:58.104 --> 00:13:59.604
Almost there.

248
00:13:59.604 --> 00:14:02.404
We turned left and...

249
00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.104
What?

250
00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:05.504
What is this place?

251
00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:08.304
It's beautiful!

252
00:14:08.304 --> 00:14:10.704
This is where the treasure is!

253
00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:13.604
This light must be from the moon

254
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:16.704
that's coming through the cracks of the ceiling.

255
00:14:16.704 --> 00:14:19.904
How romantic.

256
00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:22.304
Conan! Where is the treasure?

257
00:14:22.304 --> 00:14:24.104
Right there!

258
00:14:27.804 --> 00:14:29.704
Found it!

259
00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:31.504
I'm opening it!

260
00:14:33.304 --> 00:14:34.904
-We found it! -Yeah!

261
00:14:34.904 --> 00:14:37.004
Not so fast!

262
00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:39.204
Good job. All of you.

263
00:14:39.204 --> 00:14:41.504
Ai! Mitsuhiko!

264
00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:43.404
Are you both all right?

265
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:46.304
Yes! We're both fine!

266
00:14:46.304 --> 00:14:48.304
Hand over the treasure.

267
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:51.104
Then I'll release all of them!

268
00:14:51.104 --> 00:14:54.504
-Ms. Kimiko! -Hurry up!

269
00:15:02.904 --> 00:15:04.704
Dad!

270
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.804
Why don't you stop acting like a criminal?

271
00:15:07.804 --> 00:15:11.304
You are disturbing the scenery here.

272
00:15:11.304 --> 00:15:13.004
Mr. Mouri.

273
00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:16.704
Why don't you come out from hiding, Shigeru?

274
00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:18.004
What?

275
00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:29.104
Wha... what are you doing here?

276
00:15:29.104 --> 00:15:30.904
Shigeru?

277
00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:37.204
I believe that is not your real name.

278
00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:40.904
Your pendant and Ms. Kimiko's cell phone strap is the same,

279
00:15:40.904 --> 00:15:43.204
with your initials engraved in it.

280
00:15:43.204 --> 00:15:46.004
It is "K.K" on Ms. Kimiko's strap.

281
00:15:46.004 --> 00:15:49.604
But yours says "A.T".

282
00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:52.504
And also, you had no problem

283
00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:56.804
of getting those rare tickets for the train.

284
00:15:56.804 --> 00:15:58.304
So I suspected you have very strong connections

285
00:15:58.304 --> 00:16:00.904
with the powerful people in the area.

286
00:16:00.904 --> 00:16:03.804
Also, the man who was giving a speech in front of the station.

287
00:16:03.804 --> 00:16:05.604
Hisamichi Takahashi.

288
00:16:05.604 --> 00:16:07.804
He was an influential person in the area,

289
00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:10.004
announcing has candidacy for the prefectural assembly.

290
00:16:10.004 --> 00:16:11.704
And...

291
00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:15.304
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that...

292
00:16:15.304 --> 00:16:18.104
Atsushi, right?

293
00:16:18.104 --> 00:16:22.804
The son of Hisamichi Takahashi is named Atsushi.

294
00:16:22.804 --> 00:16:26.104
"Atsushi Takahashi".

295
00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:29.004
So his initials would be "A.T."

296
00:16:29.004 --> 00:16:31.804
You definitely live up to the name of detective.

297
00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:34.704
I'm Atsushi Takahashi.

298
00:16:34.704 --> 00:16:39.304
You were trying to stop these people, weren't you?

299
00:16:39.304 --> 00:16:42.004
When Ms. Kimiko and the others were taken.

300
00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:44.504
Police! This way! Hurry!

301
00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.504
That was you, wasn't it?

302
00:16:47.504 --> 00:16:52.704
That's right. It's out in the open now.

303
00:16:52.704 --> 00:16:56.304
Give up, Father!

304
00:16:56.304 --> 00:16:58.504
You idiot!

305
00:17:02.704 --> 00:17:04.204
Hey, isn't that...

306
00:17:04.204 --> 00:17:06.604
That person who was making the speech.

307
00:17:06.604 --> 00:17:09.404
When Atsushi knew what his father

308
00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:13.404
was trying to do to Ms. Kimiko, he tried to stop it.

309
00:17:13.404 --> 00:17:17.204
Yeah. I just heard about that yesterday.

310
00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:19.504
It doesn't matter if it gets a little rough,

311
00:17:19.504 --> 00:17:22.104
we have to get that no matter what!

312
00:17:22.104 --> 00:17:26.304
And to tell her that, I went to Shin-Yamaguchi Station.

313
00:17:27.904 --> 00:17:30.904
Why did you do such a thing?

314
00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:32.604
Of course he would!

315
00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:35.204
He did it to protect Ms. Kimiko.

316
00:17:35.204 --> 00:17:37.204
What?

317
00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:41.404
Ms. Kimiko was very aware of the surroundings at the station.

318
00:17:41.404 --> 00:17:43.804
As though she didn't want anyone

319
00:17:43.804 --> 00:17:47.004
to see her with him.

320
00:17:47.004 --> 00:17:50.204
If someone knew about us,

321
00:17:50.204 --> 00:17:52.004
we wouldn't be able to see each other.

322
00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.504
Of course!

323
00:17:53.504 --> 00:17:56.604
That family has all the treasure of this land!

324
00:17:56.604 --> 00:17:58.904
I am different from the Kobayakawa family!

325
00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:02.004
I am going to use money to develop this town,

326
00:18:02.004 --> 00:18:03.904
for it to prosper!

327
00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:08.204
Shut up! For that purpose, you even kidnapped kids!

328
00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:10.604
Let them go then!

329
00:18:10.604 --> 00:18:12.904
There. Go ahead.

330
00:18:14.304 --> 00:18:15.904
Father?

331
00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.304
Atsushi.

332
00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:20.804
Kimiko.

333
00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:28.404
Mr. Kikkawa! What are you doing?

334
00:18:28.404 --> 00:18:29.704
Mr. Kikkawa?

335
00:18:29.704 --> 00:18:32.004
So it was you,

336
00:18:32.004 --> 00:18:35.404
who told Mr. Takahashi about this treasure.

337
00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:38.404
Conan has looked into your cell phone.

338
00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:42.504
He says he did not see any call made to the police.

339
00:18:42.504 --> 00:18:46.804
And also you were shouting the directions out loud.

340
00:18:46.804 --> 00:18:51.104
So Mr. Takahashi and the others can hear you.

341
00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:52.804
No.

342
00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:55.704
Ms. Kimiko, I am so sorry.

343
00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.304
My son failed in the stock market,

344
00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.404
and he has huge debt with a financial company

345
00:19:00.404 --> 00:19:02.904
under the Takahashi Group.

346
00:19:02.904 --> 00:19:05.204
He promised me that he would write off that debt

347
00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:07.004
if I listened to him.

348
00:19:07.004 --> 00:19:11.004
I am very, very sorry.

349
00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:13.304
Mr. Kikkawa.

350
00:19:13.304 --> 00:19:15.304
What? This can't be!

351
00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:21.404
This cannot be the treasure!

352
00:19:21.404 --> 00:19:23.404
This is unbelievable!

353
00:19:27.904 --> 00:19:29.404
It's a letter

354
00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:33.304
that the ancestors of the Kobayakawa family wrote.

355
00:19:33.304 --> 00:19:35.104
Please read it for us.

356
00:19:35.104 --> 00:19:38.904
I have studied under the teacher, Shouin Yoshida.

357
00:19:38.904 --> 00:19:41.904
And I have learned about a great treasure that cannot change in time,

358
00:19:41.904 --> 00:19:44.704
whatever the world may be.

359
00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:46.204
He says that,

360
00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:47.804
"It is the goals we have in life"

361
00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:50.304
"that are the beginning of all things."

362
00:19:50.304 --> 00:19:55.104
"It is having a purpose in one's life that gives rise to everything."

363
00:19:55.104 --> 00:19:56.704
According to his teachings,

364
00:19:56.704 --> 00:20:00.404
we students with the ambition to make the country better.

365
00:20:00.404 --> 00:20:02.304
Shall come to see how we can make a difference

366
00:20:02.304 --> 00:20:03.804
in the real world.

367
00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:06.004
From here on, no matter how bitter the winds

368
00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:08.004
that may sweep over our world,

369
00:20:08.004 --> 00:20:10.904
our greatest asset will be our ambition.

370
00:20:10.904 --> 00:20:12.704
That we can change the people,

371
00:20:12.704 --> 00:20:15.704
and give them the power to change the country.

372
00:20:15.704 --> 00:20:18.004
I must rely on my ability with my writing brush

373
00:20:18.004 --> 00:20:21.504
in order to communicate this to the generations to come.

374
00:20:21.504 --> 00:20:23.304
The power to change the country?

375
00:20:23.304 --> 00:20:25.004
That's it!

376
00:20:25.004 --> 00:20:28.004
It wasn't about buying a country,

377
00:20:28.004 --> 00:20:31.204
it was to change it!

378
00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:37.004
Those who are unable to solve my riddle

379
00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:41.104
does not have the right to inherit the words of my ancestor.

380
00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:45.404
Shut up!

381
00:20:45.404 --> 00:20:48.304
Hisamichi Takahashi!

382
00:20:48.304 --> 00:20:51.604
What worth is your ambition?

383
00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:54.104
I am asking you, what is the price

384
00:20:54.104 --> 00:20:58.904
to buy your ambition, your goal?

385
00:20:58.904 --> 00:21:03.704
Is there any meaning to buy ambition with money?

386
00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:06.304
If it could be bought with money,

387
00:21:06.304 --> 00:21:09.304
it will disappear with the money used.

388
00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:10.904
Isn't that right?

389
00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:39.104
"One Week Later" -This is the Shoka Village School?

390
00:22:39.104 --> 00:22:41.604
The people behind the Meiji Restoration

391
00:22:41.604 --> 00:22:44.904
studied many different things here.

392
00:22:45.804 --> 00:22:47.404
He turned himself in?

393
00:22:47.404 --> 00:22:50.504
Yeah. Hisamichi Takahashi

394
00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:53.104
did kidnap you and the others.

395
00:22:53.104 --> 00:22:57.604
However Ms. Kimiko is denying the kidnapping.

396
00:22:57.604 --> 00:22:59.404
How naive of her.

397
00:22:59.404 --> 00:23:02.204
At any rate, what a waste.

398
00:23:02.204 --> 00:23:05.204
The stamp, right?

399
00:23:05.204 --> 00:23:08.804
As for that old stamp that was on the letter,

400
00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:11.504
that stamp had a printing error.

401
00:23:11.504 --> 00:23:13.904
The characters on it were printed upside down.

402
00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:15.404
It seems it's something

403
00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:19.704
worth tens of millions of yen among stamp collectors.

404
00:23:19.704 --> 00:23:23.804
Kimiko, if you were to send a letter to the future,

405
00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:27.004
how much postage would you need?

406
00:23:27.004 --> 00:23:30.004
That stamp was his answer to that riddle.

407
00:23:30.004 --> 00:23:32.604
And for his descendant who finds that letter,

408
00:23:32.604 --> 00:23:35.104
it would give them funds to accomplish

409
00:23:35.104 --> 00:23:37.804
whatever great things they desire to do.

410
00:23:40.304 --> 00:23:43.404
I will glue this back together.

411
00:23:43.404 --> 00:23:47.604
With my will, I shall.

412
00:23:51.904 --> 00:23:55.904
Man, what is the worth is your will?

413
00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:11.004
They've moved to a safer location

414
00:24:11.004 --> 00:24:16.604
because I was looking around the house.

415
00:24:16.604 --> 00:24:18.804
Don't mess with me!

416
00:24:18.804 --> 00:24:21.204
You, are the guilty one!

417
00:24:21.204 --> 00:24:22.704
Next Conan,

418
00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:26.804
"Accusation in Wine Red"

419
00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:39.404
Next Conan's Hint:

420
00:24:39.404 --> 00:24:41.804
"Tasting"

421
00:24:41.804 --> 00:24:43.104
The luxurious fragrance...

422
00:24:43.104 --> 00:24:44.604
as it spread in the mouth is astounding.

423
00:24:44.604 --> 00:24:46.704
This fruit juice tastes good.
