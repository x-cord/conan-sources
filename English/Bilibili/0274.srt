1
00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:04.224
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:05.924
Ran has been feeling weak.

4
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:07.924
The appearance of ghost may explain it.

5
00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:09.524
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.324
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.511
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:00.811
Everyone is worrying about you.

10
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.111
You know what they're saying, "She doesn't have a fever,

11
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.911
but, is just playing hooky."

12
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:09.211
I catch the common cold too.

13
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.511
Your eyes are teary with fever.

14
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.611
And you sure look sexy, Ran!

15
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.211
I'll bet Shinichi would sure love to see you like this.

16
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:20.511
Okay, I'm going to get going.

17
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.911
You get some rest, understand?

18
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.011
What? Leaving already?

19
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.911
It's sort of creepy here that I don't really want to be alone.

20
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:32.211
I kind of feel like someone's watching me.

21
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:36.411
What? You mean like a stalker?

22
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.011
What?

23
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.711
No, that's not it.

24
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:42.011
Then, what is it?

25
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:43.511
Don't laugh, okay?

26
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:46.011
Come on, tell me.

27
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.811
I'm sure that it was...

28
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.811
It was?

29
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:53.411
It was definitely an imp.

30
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:57.611
See. That sound just now.

31
00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:03.111
It's there, on the other side of the door.

32
00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:04.411
The imp...

33
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.811
Here behind the door? Me?

34
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.311
Shoots.

35
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:28.111
Strange. Nobody's here, Ran.

36
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:31.311
But, I heard the rattling sound too.

37
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:34.311
What should I do?

38
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.011
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:40.411
The imp is nothing but a snot nosed brat.

40
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:42.511
Nothing to fear at all.

41
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:50.811
"The Truth of the Haunted House (Part 1)"

42
00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:52.711
"Araide Clinic"

43
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.111
An imp, in this day and age?

44
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.511
That stuff don't exist.

45
00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:58.711
But...

46
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.511
By the way, doctor, how is she?

47
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.411
Well, she got over her cold.

48
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:09.511
In fact, she's in great shape.

49
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:10.811
Being as healthy as she is,

50
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.111
even the ghost will turn tail and run away from her.

51
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.611
By the way, I've been wondering...

52
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:23.811
What happened to the Granny and the house helper that was here before?

53
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:28.811
I had them go to Aomori ahead of me.

54
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:31.111
I remember. You told me once

55
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:33.811
that you're going to be transferring to a hospital in Aomori.

56
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.211
So, they're going to go there with you too...

57
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:43.211
Yes. But, since I still have to introduce my patients to other hospitals,

58
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.311
so I'm having the hospital in Aomori wait for me

59
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.511
till I'm done with everything.

60
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:51.211
And besides, I have to go to court

61
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:53.111
to testify on the case the happened here,

62
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.811
to support Mr. Mouri's deduction.

63
00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:59.511
Yeah, Dr. Araide seems to have heard me

64
00:04:59.511 --> 00:05:01.711
making my deduction from behind the door

65
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:05.211
and found out about the truth.

66
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:07.811
I just can't figure out

67
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:11.811
how you can manage living in such a huge house like this, all alone.

68
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.311
Aren't you scared?

69
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.711
Me, scared?

70
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:18.011
Well...

71
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:21.211
It's so spooky here.

72
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:23.411
Not again.

73
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.711
In this age and day when science and medicine have greatly advanced,

74
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:27.311
there are no such things as ghosts.

75
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.411
In fact, there are...

76
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:36.111
But people who are narrow-minded can't see them.

77
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.611
They seem to appear in my apartment too,

78
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.411
"Houichi Otonashi (68), Room 5 resident" -carrying out their evil deeds.

79
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:43.011
Mr. Otonashi.

80
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:45.011
You've come again.

81
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.711
I believe I told you not to come here anymore.

82
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:51.511
No use giving me the cold shoulder.

83
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:56.111
I've made up my mind to have you take care of me for the rest of my life.

84
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.911
Who is this old buddy?

85
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:03.211
He's Mr. Otonashi, a patient that has been under my care.

86
00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:06.611
But he refuses to go to the hospital I introduced him to...

87
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:11.511
By the way, gramps, is what you just said true?

88
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.811
About your apartment being haunted by a ghost.

89
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:15.411
Hey, Conan.

90
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.011
Yeah, it's true.

91
00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:19.811
You want to come over and see, sonny?

92
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:25.011
The restless soul of a young girl who died holding a grudge

93
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:28.211
still wandering about unable to find peace.

94
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:34.011
I come here to see what's it's like, but what the heck is this?

95
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.511
This is nothing more than a shabby apartment.

96
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.411
But, look.

97
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.811
There is a park in front of the building.

98
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:47.111
It's quite peaceful here.

99
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:52.311
This is the park where a young girl's body was found.

100
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:58.411
The burned body of the young girl that was charred black.

101
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:00.111
Burned body?

102
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.911
By the way, the construction of the building beside my apartment

103
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:07.811
has been left as is since the owner committed suicide

104
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:11.311
after the burst of the financial bubble.

105
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.411
It originally used to be a small cemetery.

106
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.711
Cemetery.

107
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:20.811
I'll tell you more about inside.

108
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:25.011
I see.

109
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.311
A perfect location for ghosts to appear.

110
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:33.311
Dad, I think it's better that we go home after all.

111
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:37.511
I promise nothing good will happen even if we stay here.

112
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:38.811
Shut up.

113
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.011
Why don't you just catch a cab and go on home then?

114
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:45.911
No way. It's more frightening to go and stay home by myself.

115
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:48.711
Besides, Conan looks so interested in ghosts

116
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.711
that I don't think he'll accompany me home either.

117
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.311
What a surprise.

118
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:56.511
I thought that the boom of ghosts in this apartment ended long ago.

119
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:58.811
Actually I didn't expect

120
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.111
that people would still come up to this apartment to take a look.

121
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:02.811
"Kikuji Bancho (34)" -Tonight is going to be an exciting night

122
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:04.511
"Room 4 resident" -in a long time.

123
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:06.411
Exciting?

124
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:08.811
Like they say,

125
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:12.111
ghosts like to appear where a lot of people gather together.

126
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:18.911
Who's that?

127
00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:22.211
Mr. Bancho, who is renting Room 4.

128
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.511
He works for a model kit shop.

129
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:28.811
And he often creates spooky figures in his room...

130
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.911
Let's go home right now, Dad!

131
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.511
What if a ghost really appears?

132
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:38.511
If so, it'd be great.

133
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:41.211
That'll be a lot of fun. I missed her

134
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:43.911
because I haven't got to see her for a while.

135
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.111
"Iwahisa Yotsuya (22), Room 2 resident"

136
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:49.311
Come out.

137
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:52.611
Who's that guy?

138
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:54.811
He's Mr. Yotsuya of Room 2.

139
00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:56.011
He's a SFX movie mania

140
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.511
and there are tons of those kinds of video tapes in his room.

141
00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:01.611
I heard that he along with his college friends

142
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.211
are making a horror movie of this apartment building

143
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:07.311
with a 8mm camera.

144
00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.911
Well, he never let me see it though.

145
00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:12.011
The movies are totally worthless to watch.

146
00:09:14.111 --> 00:09:16.711
A horror movie based on such unreal things as ghosts

147
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.511
"Tsuyuhiko Botan (27)" -is one of the silliest things.

148
00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:21.411
"Room 1 resident" -That's hog-wash!

149
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:25.011
Isn't your room supposed to be Room 1?

150
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:27.811
The restroom downstairs was occupied,

151
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:30.211
so I went up to the one on the second floor.

152
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:33.611
Anyway, I understand your excitement over the appearance of ghosts,

153
00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:36.411
but try to keep the noise down.

154
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:39.811
Because I have a thesis to finish by tomorrow.

155
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.311
And, who's he?

156
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:47.511
He's Mr. Botan, a grad student.

157
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:51.711
He's the only resident here who hasn't seen the ghost, yet.

158
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:52.911
And even if he did see the ghost...

159
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:58.711
The only ones who are staying in this apartment without running away

160
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:01.411
are Mr. Bancho and Mr. Yotsuya that you just saw a while ago

161
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:07.111
and me, living in Room No.5 on the second floor, just the three of us.

162
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:16.911
So half of the eight residents moved out because of the ghost scare.

163
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:19.211
Yeah, exactly.

164
00:10:19.211 --> 00:10:23.411
It began when I saw a death candle floating

165
00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:27.811
in that building next door at a midnight.

166
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:33.011
In the beginning, none of the residents in this apartment believed me.

167
00:10:33.011 --> 00:10:36.611
But suddenly after the water of the toilet turned bloody red,

168
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:41.211
and, a pale figure of a person was seen through the window,

169
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:43.611
the residents suddenly began feeling faint

170
00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:45.211
and seeing dreadful hallucinations.

171
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:49.111
Strange and eerie things happened one after the other.

172
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.511
Oh, media people, TV reporters and magazines journalists used come

173
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.111
-and interview us too. -Yeah.

174
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:57.511
But, why didn't you move out, gramps?

175
00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:01.011
I'm old and have not much time to live.

176
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:03.711
So there is nothing for me to be scared of.

177
00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:08.511
And also I don't want to move out of my dear old house.

178
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:10.911
Anyway, you're welcome to stay as long as you like.

179
00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:15.311
I think the ghost doesn't want to come out till after dark.

180
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:17.711
No, thanks. We're leaving now.

181
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:18.711
Why?

182
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.011
Don't argue with me.

183
00:11:21.011 --> 00:11:23.811
Hey, what's the rush?

184
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:26.111
And it sounds very interesting too.

185
00:11:26.111 --> 00:11:27.811
Come on.

186
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.411
Okay then. Only until 7 pm.

187
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:51.111
Go home.

188
00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:56.811
Get out...

189
00:11:56.811 --> 00:11:59.011
immediately!

190
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:16.361
Dad, Dad...

191
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.061
What's up, Ran?

192
00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:19.661
Did something come out?

193
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:23.361
A scary woman is appearing on the TV screen.

194
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:30.261
There's nothing on the screen.

195
00:12:31.861 --> 00:12:33.561
No way.

196
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:37.961
Maybe you had a nightmare or something?

197
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:40.361
No. I really saw...

198
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:44.661
Is this late already.

199
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:47.561
Gee, how could I have fallen asleep like this?

200
00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:52.261
I'm going to go to the john.

201
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:55.261
Wake that gramps up and tell him that we're heading on home.

202
00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:02.261
Ghosts, my foot. Talk about ridiculous.

203
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:05.061
After all, it was nothing but a waste of time.

204
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:12.761
What is this? This toilet is so stink and dark.

205
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:15.461
This place is full of dead insects!

206
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:20.161
Heck, I should've left here earlier just as Ran said.

207
00:13:21.561 --> 00:13:24.861
Dad. Come, quick.

208
00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:27.561
I can't wake the old man up.

209
00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:30.061
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

210
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.461
What's up, dad?

211
00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:42.061
Blood...

212
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:45.061
The toilet water is blood red.

213
00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:46.561
No way!

214
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:48.161
Hey, what's going on here?

215
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.261
What's all the commotion about?

216
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.961
The...

217
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:55.361
The toilet water is blood red, my father said.

218
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:56.961
I knew she'd come here.

219
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.261
Really?

220
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:01.061
Ridiculous.

221
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.161
This is someone's idea of a sick joke.

222
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:06.161
He must have put red paint in the tank water.

223
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:10.461
I guess not...

224
00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.561
Could it be that you had blood in your urine?

225
00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:17.561
No darn way!

226
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:18.661
When I flushed it,

227
00:14:18.661 --> 00:14:23.061
the water turned the color of blood all of a sudden.

228
00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:27.061
A dreadful illusion appearing after feeling faint.

229
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.261
Water suddenly turning red.

230
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:30.561
Then all that's left to happen

231
00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:32.861
is a spooky figure looking inside through the window.

232
00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:35.961
Here she comes...

233
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:38.561
What?

234
00:14:51.061 --> 00:14:52.861
She's appeared!

235
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:57.061
What?

236
00:14:57.061 --> 00:14:59.361
What the heck is that?

237
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.861
Can't you tell what you're looking at?

238
00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:03.961
The ghost has come...

239
00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:09.361
The ghost of the girl that was killed in the park nearby.

240
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:10.861
Her spirit has come.

241
00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:17.061
It... It disappeared...

242
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:21.061
Of course, because it's a real ghost.

243
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:25.861
She may already be in this apartment.

244
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.661
What? Ghosts my foot!

245
00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:33.561
Someone must have crawled up the wall to the second floor

246
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:35.561
and stuck his head out of the window to frighten us.

247
00:15:35.561 --> 00:15:38.261
Get out of the way! I'll go check it out!

248
00:15:38.261 --> 00:15:40.461
Okay, but here is...

249
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:49.761
No one can crawl up to and stand here

250
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:53.161
because there is no veranda or anything like that on this window.

251
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:56.461
Yeah, I guess so.

252
00:15:58.861 --> 00:16:01.861
And it didn't look like a human figure.

253
00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:04.761
The outline of it wiggled like jelly

254
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:09.161
and the shadow already started losing shape before the window opened.

255
00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:12.361
-It's like... -It's like a demon burning to ashes

256
00:16:12.361 --> 00:16:14.961
when the morning sun, touches it, right?

257
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:17.861
Grandpa.

258
00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:21.261
I've also seen her in the window before.

259
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.961
It was too painful to look at her.

260
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:26.761
Well, it stands to reason that she disappeared like ashes.

261
00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:32.561
Because that ghost is supposed to be the restless soul of Ms. Rui Tabuchi

262
00:16:32.561 --> 00:16:35.461
who was burned to death in the park four years ago.

263
00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.061
Ms. Rui Tabuchi?

264
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:41.761
Yeah, her driver's license narrowly escaped burning up.

265
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:44.261
The police said that her teeth matched.

266
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:49.861
So long as the two guys who killed her don't get arrested,

267
00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:53.861
her soul will never rest in peace and go to heaven.

268
00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:55.761
The two guys?

269
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:57.761
Weren't there any witnesses?

270
00:16:57.761 --> 00:17:03.361
Yes. A person who happened to be passing by the park after midnight,

271
00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:08.361
saw two men nearby staring at the burning body.

272
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.561
There, as you can also see on the poster that is posted

273
00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:12.861
onto the street lamp that you can see from the window.

274
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:18.261
It's a portrait of one of the two murderers.

275
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:22.461
An evil looking guy with a scar across his cheek.

276
00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:25.861
Another guy was with him in the park,

277
00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:29.161
but his face couldn't be seen because it was dark.

278
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:31.261
Anyway, the old man that was here a while ago

279
00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:32.761
is the only one who had been living here

280
00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:35.361
from before the incident happened.

281
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:36.361
Oh, yeah.

282
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.661
Hey! Did she appear again?

283
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:45.861
Bugs...

284
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:48.161
A moth is on your arm, Dad!

285
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:55.561
Moths are very common around here.

286
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:58.261
It probably came in through the window.

287
00:17:58.261 --> 00:17:59.761
I hear that lots of moths are living in the park

288
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:02.661
where the incident happened.

289
00:18:02.661 --> 00:18:05.261
They often fly over here because this apartment

290
00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:07.361
is right in front of the park.

291
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:08.461
Give me a break.

292
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:11.561
It's just a moth. Cut out the noise!

293
00:18:11.561 --> 00:18:15.261
She completely screwed up this ghostly mood, for god's sake!

294
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.861
I think her screaming was just great.

295
00:18:20.061 --> 00:18:24.261
Whatever. Anyway stop all this racket, please!

296
00:18:24.261 --> 00:18:26.461
The strange shadow that we just saw,

297
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:31.761
was probably only a reflection of one of us on the window.

298
00:18:31.761 --> 00:18:32.861
You idiot.

299
00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.261
That's for real.

300
00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:36.961
Sure, sure.

301
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.061
I told you, didn't I?

302
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:42.161
If we stay here, nothing good will happen to us.

303
00:18:42.161 --> 00:18:44.761
So, Dad, let's hurry on home.

304
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:49.261
Hey, Conan! Hurry it up.

305
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:54.761
Come on, Conan. What're you doing?

306
00:18:54.761 --> 00:18:56.561
Hey, Pops!

307
00:18:56.561 --> 00:19:00.461
Are you sure that the water in the toilet became bright red with blood?

308
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:01.761
Yeah.

309
00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:03.561
I'm not sure whether it was blood or not,

310
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:06.661
but I'm sure that the water became bright red.

311
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:08.161
Now that I think of it,

312
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:12.961
it could have been red water caused by a rusty water pipe.

313
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.561
It's strange.

314
00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:21.561
I'm sure there was a sharp acidy smell just a while ago. But now...

315
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:23.761
I guess it was aired out

316
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:25.961
because the door has been left open.

317
00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:27.561
It may be so.

318
00:19:31.761 --> 00:19:35.261
It smells of alcohol.

319
00:19:35.261 --> 00:19:37.661
Hey. That's enough.

320
00:19:37.661 --> 00:19:39.361
I just want to look more closely

321
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:42.661
and share it with my classmates at school.

322
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:45.661
That the ghost scared the great detective,

323
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:47.961
Kogoro Mouri out of his wits!

324
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:49.161
Insolent.

325
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:51.761
Hey, Ran!

326
00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:53.261
We're not leaving yet.

327
00:19:53.261 --> 00:19:55.661
What? How come?

328
00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:58.561
Because ghosts don't exist.

329
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:05.261
It's all illusions.

330
00:20:05.261 --> 00:20:06.661
A strange figure in the window

331
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:08.961
was just a reflection of someone among us.

332
00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:12.961
Bloody toilet water was actually rusty water.

333
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:17.561
This ominous, gloomy atmosphere just lulled me to develop delusions.

334
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:21.561
So then, what about the woman I saw?

335
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:23.961
I really saw her on the TV screen.

336
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:26.961
A woman suffering serious burns,

337
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.961
said, "Go home. Go home."

338
00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:32.161
That was just an illusion too!

339
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:36.361
There were no ghost programs listed on the TV column

340
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:37.961
of the newspaper either.

341
00:20:38.961 --> 00:20:40.461
But...

342
00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:44.061
Well, another likely explanation is...

343
00:20:44.061 --> 00:20:47.461
That the resident of this room showed us a spooky video

344
00:20:47.461 --> 00:20:50.761
in order to make us believe that this place is haunted.

345
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:53.461
Are you talking about me?

346
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.561
That's not possible.

347
00:20:55.561 --> 00:20:57.061
I checked it out right away back then,

348
00:20:57.061 --> 00:21:00.661
but there was no tape in this VCR then.

349
00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:03.161
Whatever. Instead, what I can't understand

350
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:07.561
is why we all fell asleep together back then.

351
00:21:07.561 --> 00:21:09.761
Isn't that because of the curse?

352
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:12.261
Nonsense! Impossible!

353
00:21:15.261 --> 00:21:19.261
If someone step onto this window rail, it seems it would collapse easily.

354
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:22.861
The apartment building is enclosed with high walls.

355
00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:23.861
And when I look out this window,

356
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:25.561
I see the building under construction before my eyes.

357
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:27.961
Conan.

358
00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:30.561
What're you doing with the window open?

359
00:21:30.561 --> 00:21:32.561
The bugs will fly in again.

360
00:21:33.761 --> 00:21:35.761
Well, I was just wondering

361
00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.861
about where of that building gramps saw the death candle.

362
00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:44.661
It was in the darkness around the center of that building.

363
00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:49.161
A red light was looming and moving about in the sadly in the air.

364
00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:53.561
At times it turned a bluish white light too, I think.

365
00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:57.661
What does this mean anyhow?

366
00:22:00.261 --> 00:22:01.961
We suddenly go faint,

367
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:04.461
then the apparition appears on TV.

368
00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:07.761
The toilet water suddenly turns red.

369
00:22:07.761 --> 00:22:10.361
Both can be explained scientifically,

370
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:14.961
but I just can't understand

371
00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:18.761
the other two the death candle and the figure by the window.

372
00:22:20.761 --> 00:22:24.561
How did the culprit do it?

373
00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:27.761
In the first place, is there really a culprit at all?

374
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:31.061
If so, who is it,

375
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:33.361
and for what reason is this being done?

376
00:24:05.461 --> 00:24:06.961
"Next Episode" -Oh, yeah.

377
00:24:06.961 --> 00:24:08.761
I saw not only red, but also blue death candle

378
00:24:08.761 --> 00:24:11.461
when I visited a room where my senior at school was living.

379
00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:13.761
What if I turns off the light like this?

380
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:18.161
Yeah, I've never seen it before.

381
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:22.261
I believe nothing but what I can comprehend scientifically.

382
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.861
Now I'm going to unlock

383
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:28.761
the mysteries of a lot of psychic phenomena.

384
00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:31.261
Next Conan,

385
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:35.182
"Truth of the Haunted House (Part 2)"

386
00:24:35.679 --> 00:24:38.179
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.079
