1
00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:03.882
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:06.082
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:07.982
Today is a 2-hour special program, of many mysterious being solved.

4
00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:09.882
We also get very close to meeting Gin and Vodka.

5
00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:11.382
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:13.382
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.682
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:49.382
I am Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

9
00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:53.382
I went to an amusement park with my childhood friend Ran,

10
00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:55.382
when I happened to witness a suspicious dealing

11
00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.082
being carried out by a man in black.

12
00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.782
Absorbed in watching the event,

13
00:01:58.782 --> 00:02:02.082
I did not realize that another man in black was sneaking up behind me.

14
00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:04.982
I was knocked down, and forced to drink poison.

15
00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:06.582
When I regained consciousness,

16
00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:09.082
I realized that my body had shrunk to that of a child's.

17
00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:11.582
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is alive,

18
00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:13.882
danger will fall upon the people around me.

19
00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:17.182
Through Dr. Agasa's advice, I decided to hide my true identity.

20
00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:19.982
When Ran asked for my name, I instantly replied...

21
00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:21.782
Conan Edogawa.

22
00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:24.582
In order to gather information on the men in black,

23
00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:26.082
I decide to free-load at Ran's house,

24
00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:27.682
because I find out that her Father is a detective.

25
00:02:31.482 --> 00:02:36.982
"The Mysterious New Student"

26
00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:38.882
"Teitan Elementary School"

27
00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:40.882
Hey, did you hear the news?

28
00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:44.282
A new student's coming to class today.

29
00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:46.382
Really?

30
00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:49.982
We haven't had a new student, since Conan came, have we?

31
00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.382
I wonder what kind of person is coming?

32
00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:54.582
I hope she's cute.

33
00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:57.182
No, no, whether it be a girl or boy,

34
00:02:57.182 --> 00:02:59.682
the main thing is personality.

35
00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.282
Hey, Conan?

36
00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.982
What kind of person do you think will come, Conan?

37
00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:06.682
I wonder.

38
00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:09.882
Maybe a reticent bookworm type?

39
00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.582
You think it's going to be a boy, then?

40
00:03:14.082 --> 00:03:18.082
Ayumi, you didn't get to see the student in the teachers' room?

41
00:03:18.082 --> 00:03:20.982
No, but I got the name.

42
00:03:20.982 --> 00:03:22.782
It was Haibara.

43
00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:23.982
Haibara?

44
00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:27.082
Right. Haibara.

45
00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.082
An unusual name.

46
00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:31.782
Not as unusual as Conan's thought.

47
00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:32.982
Leave me alone.

48
00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:46.082
Here they come!

49
00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:50.882
Oh, it's a girl!

50
00:03:52.082 --> 00:03:55.082
She's cute...

51
00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:57.982
Sit down, everyone!

52
00:03:57.982 --> 00:03:59.682
Yes...

53
00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:03.582
What's the big deal over a girl.

54
00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.782
Hi, everyone, this is Ai Haibara,

55
00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:14.782
who will be studying with us starting today.

56
00:04:14.782 --> 00:04:17.082
Let's all welcome her to our class.

57
00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:19.182
Yes...

58
00:04:19.182 --> 00:04:21.382
How energetic you all are.

59
00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:23.282
Where shall we seat you, Haibara?

60
00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:26.882
Mrs. Kobayashi! Over here, the seat next to me is open!

61
00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:32.782
Here.

62
00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:47.582
-Hi. -Hi.

63
00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:50.582
What's with her? She's so stuck up.

64
00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.282
She sure is cool.

65
00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:54.182
She's probably nervous.

66
00:04:55.282 --> 00:04:58.382
All right, everyone. Class time!

67
00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:00.282
Yes...

68
00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:09.582
Haibara.

69
00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:12.882
Haibara!

70
00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:15.282
Let's go home together.

71
00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.082
Okay?

72
00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:23.682
Let her be! That stuck up chick.

73
00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:25.382
But...

74
00:05:27.282 --> 00:05:30.782
Where do you live? You moved here, didn't you?

75
00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:35.782
Don't be hesitant, we'll walk you home.

76
00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:39.782
Beika 2-22.

77
00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:43.382
That 's where I live.

78
00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.882
What?

79
00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:45.982
What is it?

80
00:05:45.982 --> 00:05:47.582
No, nothing.

81
00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:52.282
Strange, Beika is my address.

82
00:05:52.282 --> 00:05:55.482
But, there are no condos or apartments nearby.

83
00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:58.182
I wonder if there was a residence called Haibara.

84
00:06:06.382 --> 00:06:07.882
What's the matter?

85
00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:10.682
Don't tell me you have eyes for that stuck up chick?

86
00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:13.482
No way. No darn way!

87
00:06:15.082 --> 00:06:18.582
The Youth Detective Squad?

88
00:06:18.582 --> 00:06:20.882
-You're members? -Yeah.

89
00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:23.882
We work day in and day out

90
00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.782
solving difficult cases by request of our clients.

91
00:06:25.782 --> 00:06:28.782
Why don't you join us too, Ai?

92
00:06:29.982 --> 00:06:31.982
Is Conan a member, too?

93
00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:36.682
Yeah, he's something like my henchman.

94
00:06:36.682 --> 00:06:39.682
The requests all go into...

95
00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:44.682
The requests are to be put in here.

96
00:06:44.682 --> 00:06:46.882
We haven't told the teachers about it though.

97
00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:49.282
They already know about it.

98
00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:54.882
We get loads of mails from guys who have unsolved mysteries every day.

99
00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:59.282
There's nothing inside.

100
00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:02.782
Theres usually a lot of mails in here, but I guess not today.

101
00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:05.482
You never have mail in there.

102
00:07:05.482 --> 00:07:08.982
Let's hurry home and play soccer at the park.

103
00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:10.182
Let's go, let's go.

104
00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:11.782
Good idea.

105
00:07:11.782 --> 00:07:13.782
Hey, wait for me.

106
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.582
A request!

107
00:07:23.582 --> 00:07:25.082
Really?

108
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:31.782
It says that they'll be waiting for us in grade 1 class A.

109
00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:34.182
Then, let's go.

110
00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:35.682
To grade 1, class A!

111
00:07:35.682 --> 00:07:38.682
Come with us too, Ai, quick!

112
00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:45.182
What? Disappeared from home?

113
00:07:45.182 --> 00:07:48.782
My brother suddenly disappeared.

114
00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:50.782
Don't tell me he's been kidnapped?

115
00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:53.082
Wait a minute.

116
00:07:53.082 --> 00:07:55.482
There was a similar case once before.

117
00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:57.482
Come to think of it, it really is.

118
00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:01.382
Don't tell me that the brother of yours is a cat?

119
00:08:01.382 --> 00:08:05.282
No! My brother who is 10 years older than me!

120
00:08:05.282 --> 00:08:08.482
He disappeared a week ago at sundown,

121
00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:11.082
saying he was going to drop by at his friend's house.

122
00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:12.882
And he never came back since.

123
00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:16.882
The police set out to search for him too, but couldn't find him.

124
00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:21.082
I thought that maybe you guys could help me.

125
00:08:23.182 --> 00:08:26.382
Have you received any threat calls?

126
00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:27.682
Calls?

127
00:08:27.682 --> 00:08:31.482
Nope, nothing like that.

128
00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:33.482
Maybe he just ran away from home?

129
00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:35.982
He would never run away from home!

130
00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.482
Because...

131
00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:41.582
Because me and my brother, we get along really well.

132
00:08:44.582 --> 00:08:48.982
But, your brother may have had his reasons.

133
00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:54.882
Let's go over to his house.

134
00:08:55.282 --> 00:08:57.482
We'll talk later.

135
00:08:57.482 --> 00:08:59.082
Thank you.

136
00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:02.882
Okay. The Youth Detective Squad are on our way.

137
00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:06.082
Let's go, Ai.

138
00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:16.682
It's that house where the police car is parked.

139
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.882
Cool, a police car!

140
00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:22.382
This is a standard police car.

141
00:09:22.382 --> 00:09:25.782
But, it's been modified nicely like a police car.

142
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:29.682
Is that right? Which one's the radio?

143
00:09:29.682 --> 00:09:32.382
See, it's the one by the passenger's seat.

144
00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:34.782
I wonder if I can ask for eels over rice with that?

145
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.082
I'd like a pizza.

146
00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:41.082
Hey, hey, what did you guys come here for?

147
00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:45.982
All right, if something comes up, please contact the station.

148
00:09:47.582 --> 00:09:48.982
Thank you.

149
00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:52.682
Thank you.

150
00:09:56.482 --> 00:09:58.082
My, Toshiya.

151
00:09:58.082 --> 00:09:59.882
-Are they your friends? -Yes.

152
00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:01.882
Hello...

153
00:10:03.282 --> 00:10:04.882
Come on in.

154
00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:09.082
Toshiya, would you like me to you something?

155
00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:13.382
Oh, please don't bother, because we'll be leaving soon.

156
00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:15.482
Oh, is that right?

157
00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:17.982
I'll be in the kitchen, then.

158
00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:24.382
I'm sorry. My mom's preoccupied about brother right now.

159
00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:27.482
I know. Let's hurry to your brother's room.

160
00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.482
All right.

161
00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:34.682
It's so neat and clean.

162
00:10:35.682 --> 00:10:38.082
Are we going to look for clues here?

163
00:10:38.082 --> 00:10:39.282
Exactly.

164
00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:51.582
This is...

165
00:10:52.582 --> 00:10:54.082
This is cool. Take a look at this.

166
00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:57.282
Super premium prices air shoes.

167
00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.582
Don't you guys get something wrong?

168
00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:02.382
Don't mess around too much.

169
00:11:02.382 --> 00:11:05.682
-All right. -But now we know that Toshiya's brother

170
00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:09.182
was knowledgeable of famous brand products.

171
00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:11.482
Was your brother that kind of person?

172
00:11:11.482 --> 00:11:14.182
I don't know.

173
00:11:14.182 --> 00:11:17.182
But my uncle gave him those as a gift from the States.

174
00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:18.882
I got one, too.

175
00:11:18.882 --> 00:11:21.382
I see...

176
00:11:21.382 --> 00:11:24.582
-Now we know that he wasn't. -That's right.

177
00:11:37.982 --> 00:11:42.782
Hey, Conan, we're getting nowhere standing here.

178
00:11:42.782 --> 00:11:45.782
See, so maybe he ran away from home after all?

179
00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:47.782
No, that can't be.

180
00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:49.782
See, this is your brother's wallet, isn't it?

181
00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:50.782
Yes.

182
00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:51.782
If he's going to run away from home,

183
00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:53.782
he'd at least take his wallet, wouldn't he?

184
00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:55.982
So then, where is he?

185
00:11:55.982 --> 00:11:57.482
He either got into an accident

186
00:11:57.482 --> 00:12:00.582
or got mixed up in some incident.

187
00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:11.982
Gosh.

188
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:12.982
What's with these pictures?

189
00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.782
There are many strange pictures under the bed.

190
00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:19.882
Talk about the pits.

191
00:12:19.882 --> 00:12:21.582
See.

192
00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:24.782
Who drew this picture?

193
00:12:24.782 --> 00:12:26.282
Picasso.

194
00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:27.582
What?

195
00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:31.482
Yes. That's a copy of Picassos Crying Woman.

196
00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:34.782
Gogh, Monet, Gauguin, Utrillo.

197
00:12:34.782 --> 00:12:37.082
They all look genuine.

198
00:12:37.082 --> 00:12:40.082
My brother drew all of these.

199
00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:42.282
He was in the art club of his high school,

200
00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:45.582
and was good at copying other peoples paintings.

201
00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:47.582
Hey, don't tell me he's been kidnapped

202
00:12:47.582 --> 00:12:49.382
and being forced to draw pictures.

203
00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:50.682
That's possible.

204
00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:53.582
If the masterpieces are copied and exchanged for the real ones.

205
00:12:53.582 --> 00:12:55.482
No, that's not possible either.

206
00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:56.482
What?

207
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:58.682
His sketches are indeed good,

208
00:12:58.682 --> 00:13:00.782
but he needs a bit more practice as to color and touch.

209
00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:02.782
It's not good enough to be counterfeit yet.

210
00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:06.482
And this is not a kidnapping for ransom either.

211
00:13:06.482 --> 00:13:08.982
Because if it were so, it would be easier to kidnap you

212
00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:10.782
than to kidnap your brother who is in high school.

213
00:13:11.782 --> 00:13:13.882
What bothers me is this painting.

214
00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:16.482
What? I've seen him somewhere before.

215
00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:18.782
It's Soseki Natsume.

216
00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:22.382
Yes. My brother was a great fan of Soseki!

217
00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:23.582
He liked that painting so much

218
00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:25.782
that he even entered it in the community exhibition.

219
00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:30.182
But, everybody was complaining about it

220
00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:34.382
because was a copy of his picture.

221
00:13:34.382 --> 00:13:37.182
Only one weird woman praised it.

222
00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:38.382
A weird woman?

223
00:13:38.382 --> 00:13:41.482
Yes, she was wearing a broad-brimmed hat

224
00:13:41.482 --> 00:13:44.482
and dressed in black from head to toe.

225
00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:50.382
When was that? When did you see that woman?

226
00:13:50.382 --> 00:13:53.082
About 10 days ago.

227
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:56.082
Were there any men dressed in black besides her?

228
00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:59.882
Yes, there were two.

229
00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:01.082
Don't tell me that...

230
00:14:02.982 --> 00:14:04.882
What's the matter, Conan?

231
00:14:05.882 --> 00:14:07.982
It couldn't be that...

232
00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:09.382
That...

233
00:14:17.596 --> 00:14:20.296
No...

234
00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:24.696
Hey, take me to a place near here that your brother is likely to go.

235
00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:28.696
His wallet and his train pass are in his drawer.

236
00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:30.696
Even his bicycle is at the front door.

237
00:14:30.696 --> 00:14:32.296
It's highly probable

238
00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:35.196
that your brother was called out near here and kidnapped.

239
00:14:35.196 --> 00:14:37.696
I see. So if we search the vicinity...

240
00:14:37.696 --> 00:14:39.096
Maybe we'll find some clue.

241
00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:40.696
Come on, hurry.

242
00:14:42.696 --> 00:14:44.196
Hey, wait, Conan.

243
00:14:45.996 --> 00:14:47.496
Conan!

244
00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:58.396
A week ago at sundown?

245
00:14:58.396 --> 00:14:59.496
I wonder...

246
00:14:59.496 --> 00:15:01.296
I don't think she came

247
00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:03.696
because I was at the shop all the time.

248
00:15:03.696 --> 00:15:06.096
But, I don't remember seeing a woman dressed in black,

249
00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:08.596
although I'm sure she'll stand out.

250
00:15:57.996 --> 00:16:02.696
Darn. We've gone to all the places he may be called out to,

251
00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:06.696
like coffee shop, game centers, department stores and back alleys.

252
00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:10.296
There is nobody who saw him that day,

253
00:16:10.296 --> 00:16:13.496
nor did anyone see the woman in black.

254
00:16:13.496 --> 00:16:15.096
What am I getting all worked up for?

255
00:16:15.096 --> 00:16:18.896
I'm sure the police already checked all the places he could be...

256
00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:20.696
We have too little to go on.

257
00:16:20.696 --> 00:16:23.296
Isn't there anything? Anything else...

258
00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:24.796
Something will do.

259
00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:32.096
Conan, would you mind if I stop by at the convenience store?

260
00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:34.296
I'm thirsty.

261
00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:37.396
It's so cool.

262
00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.896
Thank you very much.

263
00:16:38.896 --> 00:16:40.996
Hello, there.

264
00:16:40.996 --> 00:16:43.696
It'll be 430 yen, please.

265
00:16:43.696 --> 00:16:45.596
Thank you very much.

266
00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:47.596
A Seven Mild.

267
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:54.796
Your change is 770 yen.

268
00:16:57.596 --> 00:16:58.996
Thank you very much.

269
00:16:58.996 --> 00:17:00.796
What's the matter, Conan?

270
00:17:00.796 --> 00:17:03.196
He bought only one pack of the cigarette with a thousand-yen bill.

271
00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:04.596
Strange.

272
00:17:04.596 --> 00:17:07.096
Maybe he didn't have loose change?

273
00:17:07.096 --> 00:17:08.196
If he had a thousand yen,

274
00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:10.296
he could've bought it at the vending machine outside.

275
00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:11.296
He didn't have to go through the trouble

276
00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.996
of waiting at the check-out counter.

277
00:17:14.196 --> 00:17:17.696
Maybe the cigarette he wanted was sold out.

278
00:17:19.296 --> 00:17:23.396
Will you show me the thousand-yen bill that the man just gave you?

279
00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:25.796
-What? -Just let me see it!

280
00:17:26.596 --> 00:17:27.696
Hey!

281
00:17:31.096 --> 00:17:32.696
There's no watermark.

282
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.396
Maybe he's...

283
00:17:37.396 --> 00:17:39.796
What's with you anyway?

284
00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:42.596
Conan? What's wrong?

285
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.296
Call the police. This is counterfeit.

286
00:17:46.296 --> 00:17:47.596
What?

287
00:17:47.596 --> 00:17:49.296
Hey, wait, sonny?

288
00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:50.796
Wait, Conan!

289
00:17:50.796 --> 00:17:52.996
Wait up!

290
00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:12.396
Hey.

291
00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:15.296
Conan, what's the matter?

292
00:18:18.596 --> 00:18:20.896
What is it about the counterfeit

293
00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:23.196
that you were talking about at the convenience store?

294
00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:29.096
That man bought a cigarette with a thousand-yen, right?

295
00:18:29.096 --> 00:18:31.096
He did so, although there was a vending machine right outside the store

296
00:18:31.096 --> 00:18:33.396
and went out of his way to line up at the counter.

297
00:18:33.396 --> 00:18:38.396
In other words, he used a thousand yen that the machine wouldn't accept.

298
00:18:38.396 --> 00:18:42.096
A counterfeit that the human eyes are likely to overlook.

299
00:18:42.096 --> 00:18:47.396
But that has nothing to do with brother disappearing, does it?

300
00:18:47.396 --> 00:18:48.996
It has everything to do with him.

301
00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:50.296
Do you remember

302
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:54.196
the portrait of a certain person that your brother had drawn?

303
00:18:55.496 --> 00:18:57.296
Soseki Natsume.

304
00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:58.396
Come to think of it,

305
00:18:58.396 --> 00:19:00.896
the thousand-yen bill has the face of Soseki Natsume on it.

306
00:19:00.896 --> 00:19:03.196
Then, is my brother...

307
00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:06.296
Yes, maybe somebody saw through his talent for art,

308
00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:10.496
and has him confined some place, forcing him to make counterfeit.

309
00:19:12.496 --> 00:19:15.096
We can't be sure if that man is involved or not,

310
00:19:15.096 --> 00:19:18.496
but maybe they're the guys who shrunk my body.

311
00:19:18.496 --> 00:19:20.596
Those men in black.

312
00:19:20.596 --> 00:19:22.796
Shrunk your body?

313
00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:27.596
I'm only joking! Joking.

314
00:19:27.596 --> 00:19:30.596
I was just teasing you guys.

315
00:19:31.996 --> 00:19:33.396
What a fix.

316
00:19:33.396 --> 00:19:36.596
I can't get them involved in such a dangerous case either.

317
00:19:37.596 --> 00:19:41.296
I'll lose sight of the man if I don't hurry.

318
00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:43.096
All right, then.

319
00:19:43.096 --> 00:19:45.296
I'll use this, then.

320
00:19:47.796 --> 00:19:49.596
Conan!

321
00:19:51.596 --> 00:19:54.396
Hey, you over there!

322
00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:55.696
You dropped something!

323
00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:58.396
This is your thousand yen, isn't it?

324
00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:01.996
Conan!

325
00:20:01.996 --> 00:20:05.096
See. He dropped his money.

326
00:20:05.096 --> 00:20:07.096
So, I came after him to give it back to him.

327
00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:08.196
Oh...

328
00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:09.996
It's no fun.

329
00:20:10.996 --> 00:20:13.596
But what're you going to do about looking his brother?

330
00:20:13.596 --> 00:20:15.096
It's getting late.

331
00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:17.996
We've no choice but to come back and continue tomorrow.

332
00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:22.196
You guys go on ahead to Toshiya's house and pick up your satchels.

333
00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:24.196
I've got to stop by some place first.

334
00:20:24.196 --> 00:20:26.396
What? Come back right away, okay?

335
00:20:26.396 --> 00:20:28.096
Okay, see you.

336
00:20:28.096 --> 00:20:30.396
Okay, then. I caught him.

337
00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:35.296
That man took the thousand-yen with the transmitter on it.

338
00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:38.996
All I have to do now is pursue him with these glasses.

339
00:20:38.996 --> 00:20:41.596
Ai, hurry or we'll leave you behind.

340
00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:50.896
He just may take me to where they... the men in black are.

341
00:20:52.496 --> 00:20:53.996
The station.

342
00:20:57.896 --> 00:21:00.696
A stand? No.

343
00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:06.196
Yeah. That man wearing a black hat came here.

344
00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:09.996
He bought a can of 110 yen coffee with a thousand-yen.

345
00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:12.796
Gosh, just as I thought.

346
00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:14.596
He wasn't friendly,

347
00:21:14.596 --> 00:21:17.296
and besides there was a strange seal stuck on the bill.

348
00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:18.896
He was a weirdo.

349
00:21:18.896 --> 00:21:22.496
And do you know which way he went?

350
00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:23.696
I'm not sure.

351
00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:24.996
After he bought the can of coffee,

352
00:21:24.996 --> 00:21:26.896
he was using the phone over there.

353
00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:27.896
What?

354
00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:30.796
He placed loose change on the phone,

355
00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:34.896
and was talking on the phone until he used it all up.

356
00:21:34.896 --> 00:21:37.696
For around 10 minutes.

357
00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.396
Did he by any chance ask you to give him

358
00:21:40.396 --> 00:21:43.696
the change in 100 yens and 10 yens?

359
00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:46.696
Yes. But since I didn't have 100 yens,

360
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:50.196
I mixed 500 yen and gave him 890 yen.

361
00:21:50.196 --> 00:21:53.896
The change that he got at the convenience store is 770 yen.

362
00:21:54.696 --> 00:21:57.796
One 500-yen coin and two 100-yen coins,

363
00:21:57.796 --> 00:22:00.596
one 50-yen coin and two 10-yen coins.

364
00:22:00.596 --> 00:22:03.296
If the 890 yen change that he received at the stand is added,

365
00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:05.996
the money that he can use to make the phone call

366
00:22:05.996 --> 00:22:09.296
would be five 100-yen coins and eleven 10-yen coins.

367
00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:11.096
That is, 610 yen all together.

368
00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:16.396
If he had more loose change on him, it be more than that.

369
00:22:17.196 --> 00:22:20.396
He used more than 610 yen for a call approximately 10 minutes long?

370
00:22:20.396 --> 00:22:22.696
Was he making a long-distance call?

371
00:22:22.696 --> 00:22:24.896
Could it be he went somewhere far away to the place

372
00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:27.596
where his telephone partner is waiting?

373
00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.696
No, if he calls from a public phone to a cellular phone,

374
00:22:30.696 --> 00:22:32.596
it would cost 10 yen per 9 seconds.

375
00:22:32.596 --> 00:22:34.696
There is still that possibility.

376
00:22:34.696 --> 00:22:36.196
Hey, sonny.

377
00:22:36.196 --> 00:22:39.496
Are you an acquaintance of the man wearing the black hat?

378
00:22:39.496 --> 00:22:41.196
Yes, sort of.

379
00:22:41.196 --> 00:22:45.696
Oh, great. Please give this to him.

380
00:22:45.696 --> 00:22:48.296
What? 50-yen?

381
00:22:48.296 --> 00:22:51.996
He was in such a rush that he forgot to take this 50-yen change

382
00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:55.396
from the ticket vending machine.

383
00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:57.496
Which ticket vending machine was it?

384
00:22:57.496 --> 00:22:59.896
The one for the Tohto Line, over there.

385
00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:03.096
Do you know which button he pressed?

386
00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:04.496
I don't know.

387
00:23:04.496 --> 00:23:06.596
He put in one 500-yen coin, and I saw a lot of loose change came out.

388
00:23:06.596 --> 00:23:10.596
He put in one 500-yen coin, and I saw a lot loose change came out.

389
00:23:10.596 --> 00:23:15.196
But I was more concerned about the rubbish at his feet

390
00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:16.896
that I didn't notice anything else.

391
00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:19.896
Thank you. I'll go after him.

392
00:23:19.896 --> 00:23:22.896
-Bye. -Yes.

393
00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:28.896
He probably got more than three coins as change.

394
00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:30.596
If he inserted 500-yen,

395
00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:34.696
and got chance that included a 50-yen coin and three more...

396
00:23:40.696 --> 00:23:43.196
The station would be 500-yen minus 320 yen,

397
00:23:43.196 --> 00:23:47.296
the answer is one 100-yen coin, one 50-yen coin,

398
00:23:47.296 --> 00:23:50.196
and three 10-yen coins, making a total of 5 coins.

399
00:23:50.196 --> 00:23:52.496
A change of 180 yen would come out.

400
00:23:53.696 --> 00:23:55.496
It's Daitohma Station.

401
00:24:01.005 --> 00:24:04.405
Daitohma! Daitohma!

402
00:24:12.005 --> 00:24:15.205
No good. I've come to Daitohma Station,

403
00:24:15.205 --> 00:24:18.005
but nobody has seen the man with the black hat.

404
00:24:18.005 --> 00:24:22.405
What now? Their purpose is to make counterfeit bills.

405
00:24:22.405 --> 00:24:26.305
Maybe I should start off by asking at a real estate agency.

406
00:24:28.405 --> 00:24:30.605
-A warehouse? -Yes.

407
00:24:30.605 --> 00:24:32.705
Haven't you rented out a warehouse that is inconspicuous,

408
00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:34.605
in the suburbs and won't be suspected

409
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.205
no matter what is done there to anyone?

410
00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:39.905
No. We haven't rented any warehouse out recently.

411
00:24:39.905 --> 00:24:42.605
It could've been many years in the past.

412
00:24:45.605 --> 00:24:47.505
Gosh. You're getting in the way of business.

413
00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:49.505
Take your friends and go home.

414
00:24:49.505 --> 00:24:51.605
Friends?

415
00:24:51.605 --> 00:24:54.805
They're your friends, aren't they, sonny?

416
00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:56.105
What?

417
00:24:56.105 --> 00:24:57.905
You guys?

418
00:24:59.205 --> 00:25:01.805
Do you think you can fool us every time with the same trick?

419
00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:04.605
You really have a talent of running out on us, don't you?

420
00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:06.705
How did you know I was here?

421
00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:10.705
We came after you because Ai told us to.

422
00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:13.005
She said that you were going to leave us behind

423
00:25:13.005 --> 00:25:15.005
and pursue the man by yourself.

424
00:25:15.005 --> 00:25:16.105
Right?

425
00:25:18.605 --> 00:25:21.005
Mister.

426
00:25:21.005 --> 00:25:24.805
-What is it? -Isn't there a novelist who lives near here?

427
00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:27.505
A novelist? What do you mean?

428
00:25:27.505 --> 00:25:31.605
After my brother disappeared, he called us once at home.

429
00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:35.505
-What? -Why didn't you tell us sooner?

430
00:25:35.505 --> 00:25:39.305
It's my grandmother who took the call.

431
00:25:39.305 --> 00:25:42.105
She's hard of hearing and besides my brother talked so fast,

432
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:45.205
that she couldn't understand what he said.

433
00:25:45.205 --> 00:25:46.705
All she could make out was,

434
00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:51.905
his words, "I'm with a lot of people like Soseki".

435
00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:55.605
He's with people like Soseki?

436
00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:00.605
Soseki.

437
00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:03.705
Did you tell the police about this?

438
00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:04.805
Of course.

439
00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:06.205
But they couldn't find anybody like that

440
00:26:06.205 --> 00:26:07.905
no matter how hard they searched.

441
00:26:08.905 --> 00:26:11.005
So, they said that maybe grandma made a mistake,

442
00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:13.905
or that it was a crank call.

443
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:17.305
But, wasn't your brother a fan of Soseki?

444
00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:19.905
If so, there's nothing to worry about, is there?

445
00:26:19.905 --> 00:26:23.505
But grandma said my brother's voice was trembling

446
00:26:23.505 --> 00:26:27.305
and cut off halfway.

447
00:26:27.305 --> 00:26:31.005
I see. He somehow made the call while they weren't around,

448
00:26:31.005 --> 00:26:34.205
but was caught after all and forced to hang up.

449
00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:39.005
Come to think of it, a man who looks like Soseki does live near here.

450
00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:40.405
What?

451
00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:43.005
He's the owner of the bookstore on the corner.

452
00:26:43.005 --> 00:26:45.305
His nickname is One-thousand-yen.

453
00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:47.205
That's it...

454
00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:49.005
Please...

455
00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:51.805
-What? What do you mean? -Take us there...

456
00:26:51.805 --> 00:26:56.505
No. I'd advise you not to go to his place.

457
00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:58.005
What?

458
00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:07.305
You've got to be kidding! Counterfeit my foot!

459
00:27:07.305 --> 00:27:10.905
Stop playing jokes on adults.

460
00:27:12.405 --> 00:27:14.605
Get out of here!

461
00:27:14.605 --> 00:27:18.205
A thousand-yen, they said. I'm not that cheap.

462
00:27:19.205 --> 00:27:24.105
Why isn't Soseki Natsume on the 10,000-yen bill.

463
00:27:24.105 --> 00:27:25.505
He scared me.

464
00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:27.405
That's why I told you not to come.

465
00:27:27.405 --> 00:27:29.405
What's with that man, anyway?

466
00:27:29.405 --> 00:27:30.905
He sure smells fishy.

467
00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:33.605
No, he probably has nothing to do with the incident.

468
00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:36.805
I checked the warehouse of the bookstore,

469
00:27:36.805 --> 00:27:40.005
but there was no printer for printing out counterfeit bills.

470
00:27:40.005 --> 00:27:41.805
Talking about printers,

471
00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:45.705
the newspaper agency in front of the station was installing one.

472
00:27:46.305 --> 00:27:47.905
A newspaper agency?

473
00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:51.705
See, the building next to the police box. The agency is on the 3rd floor.

474
00:27:51.705 --> 00:27:55.405
We handled that building 2 years ago, too.

475
00:27:55.405 --> 00:27:58.105
What were the people in there like?

476
00:27:58.105 --> 00:28:02.605
A lady who is always wearing a broad-brimmed hat

477
00:28:02.605 --> 00:28:04.305
is the president of that small agency.

478
00:28:04.305 --> 00:28:05.605
What?

479
00:28:05.605 --> 00:28:07.805
But, they're printing out information magazines on this town,

480
00:28:07.805 --> 00:28:10.205
not counterfeit bills.

481
00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:11.205
They couldn't possibly do something like that here.

482
00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:13.105
After all, it's right beside the police box.

483
00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:14.105
So, that's the story.

484
00:28:14.105 --> 00:28:16.505
I don't know what this is about, but it's already nighttime.

485
00:28:16.505 --> 00:28:20.305
Quit playing detective already and head on home, you guys!

486
00:28:20.305 --> 00:28:23.705
Could that newspaper agency be...

487
00:28:23.705 --> 00:28:26.905
But, it doesn't have anything to do with Soseki, does it?

488
00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.705
Rinse one's mouth with stone

489
00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:30.705
and sleep with one's pillow in the water.

490
00:28:32.605 --> 00:28:35.805
This is a famous ancient event that Soseki took his name from.

491
00:28:35.805 --> 00:28:37.705
It means eccentric.

492
00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:40.105
Normally we rinse our mouths with running water

493
00:28:40.105 --> 00:28:42.605
and use stones for pillows, right?

494
00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:47.105
But, to use it reversely, you'd have to be quite eccentric.

495
00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:49.805
To make counterfeit bills,

496
00:28:49.805 --> 00:28:52.605
one would usually want to go to the suburbs and avoid the eyes of others.

497
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:54.905
But, they deliberately situated their stronghold

498
00:28:54.905 --> 00:28:59.005
in a bustling station front right beside a police box.

499
00:28:59.005 --> 00:29:02.105
It may at first glance look to be the action of one who is eccentric.

500
00:29:02.105 --> 00:29:03.305
But, there is no better way

501
00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:06.305
than to use this advantageous location to blind the police.

502
00:29:06.305 --> 00:29:10.305
Toshiya's brother probably wanted to relay this message.

503
00:29:10.305 --> 00:29:12.005
Which means that brother is...

504
00:29:12.005 --> 00:29:15.105
If it's as I have deduced,

505
00:29:15.105 --> 00:29:18.005
he is probably inside that newspaper agency.

506
00:29:20.305 --> 00:29:23.005
That's why I've been telling you.

507
00:29:23.005 --> 00:29:24.805
His brother's been kidnapped

508
00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.705
and is making counterfeit bills in there.

509
00:29:30.805 --> 00:29:34.205
Hey! You've been watching too many gang movies, kids!

510
00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.905
It's really true!

511
00:29:35.905 --> 00:29:37.905
Please believe us!

512
00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:42.305
Why would they believe kids talking like that? I wouldn't either.

513
00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:46.905
Hey, you guys, don't move from there, no matter what.

514
00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:49.305
You got me, right? Don't move!

515
00:29:49.305 --> 00:29:50.905
Conan.

516
00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:53.105
The more he tells us not to move...

517
00:29:53.105 --> 00:29:56.105
The more you feel like moving, right?

518
00:29:59.905 --> 00:30:02.205
What? Counterfeit bills?

519
00:30:02.205 --> 00:30:03.805
Is that true, Shinichi?

520
00:30:03.805 --> 00:30:07.205
Yes, although I have no proof yet, it's very likely.

521
00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:10.605
And, please be careful when you raid the place.

522
00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:13.905
They may threaten the hostages to save themselves.

523
00:30:16.405 --> 00:30:18.905
A woman dressed in black.

524
00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:21.205
Come to think of it, once...

525
00:30:23.605 --> 00:30:25.205
once in the past...

526
00:30:29.105 --> 00:30:31.105
No, Genta.

527
00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:35.605
Conan said not to move, remember?

528
00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:38.505
Shut up! I've got to find some kind of proof

529
00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:41.205
or the police won't believe me.

530
00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:55.605
What? There's nobody here.

531
00:30:57.605 --> 00:31:01.205
There are no counterfeits anywhere.

532
00:31:01.205 --> 00:31:04.405
Maybe Conan made a mistake?

533
00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:08.605
All types of ink. They were trying it out here.

534
00:31:11.905 --> 00:31:14.805
Please forgive me, boss.

535
00:31:14.805 --> 00:31:16.205
I thought I told you not to use that

536
00:31:16.205 --> 00:31:20.505
because it was just a prototype with no watermark!

537
00:31:20.505 --> 00:31:23.705
It looked so real that I just couldn't help myself.

538
00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:26.805
I'll let you use it until you get sick of it in time.

539
00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:30.105
Something way better than this half-done, Soseki Natsume,

540
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:33.305
A 10,000 yen bill with Yukichi Fukuzawa on it.

541
00:31:33.305 --> 00:31:37.805
I hope you bought the ink that I specified.

542
00:31:37.805 --> 00:31:40.105
Yeah, I bought all there was left.

543
00:31:40.105 --> 00:31:43.805
I tried all kinds, but this is the best for the watermark.

544
00:31:46.105 --> 00:31:49.005
Hey! Somebody's in the room next door.

545
00:31:49.005 --> 00:31:51.905
Kids, five kids!

546
00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:55.205
-Toshiya! -What the... What?

547
00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.105
You stay put!

548
00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:01.505
So, he came all this way to look for his brother.

549
00:32:01.505 --> 00:32:03.505
How cute.

550
00:32:05.305 --> 00:32:08.805
What? They went inside the newspaper agency?

551
00:32:08.805 --> 00:32:11.605
Yeah. All five of them saying that they'll come again

552
00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:12.905
after they find proof.

553
00:32:12.905 --> 00:32:14.605
-Darn! -Hey.

554
00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:16.305
Those idiots.

555
00:32:18.205 --> 00:32:20.505
They could be...

556
00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.905
They could be...

557
00:32:22.905 --> 00:32:26.005
in the same organization as the men in black!
