1
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:21.032
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:22.632
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.232
The legend of a mermaid starts off the new series.

4
00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:26.132
Heiji, Kazuha, Ran and Conan work together again.

5
00:00:26.132 --> 00:00:27.632
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:29.432
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:32.032
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:02.668
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Mystery)"

9
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:08.368
Good grief, I hope you appreciate what I'm doing.

10
00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:10.068
First, you pop up out of the blue

11
00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:12.268
then you tell me that we've got to go to Fukui on a job

12
00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:15.368
and that's what we're on this crazy trip.

13
00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:19.568
Oh, don't grumble! I'm paying for this.

14
00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:21.068
Now what? So where are we?

15
00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:23.568
What's the name of that island we're going to?

16
00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:26.668
It's called Bikuni Island, it's just a tiny island.

17
00:02:26.668 --> 00:02:30.168
The locals around here call it,

18
00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:32.568
the island where the mermaid lives.

19
00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:34.968
"Bikuni Island" -Did you say mermaid?

20
00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:36.068
Yeah.

21
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:41.068
They say there's an old lady on that island that eat mermaid meat.

22
00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:42.368
I've heard about that!

23
00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:44.368
About 3 years ago, there was a big fuss about her,

24
00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:46.468
she's an old lady who has lived forever, isn't that right?

25
00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:48.568
Yes, that's right. I decided to come along

26
00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.368
because I wanted to learn the secret of her beauty and longevity!

27
00:02:51.368 --> 00:02:55.168
I get it! You want to snare Hattori with those secrets!

28
00:02:55.168 --> 00:02:58.168
Don't talk so loud!

29
00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:00.968
You've got to be kidding.

30
00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:08.768
I hope you're not to tell me our job is find a mermaid.

31
00:03:08.768 --> 00:03:10.768
It's just the opposite.

32
00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:13.968
There were only 3 lines in the letter giving us the job

33
00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:16.468
and the writing was shaky.

34
00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:20.668
This is what it said, "The mermaid will kill me. Help!"

35
00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:22.568
A mermaid is...

36
00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:24.268
Going to kill someone?

37
00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:28.468
This is serious!

38
00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:31.468
Give me a break, mermaids only exist in fairy tales,

39
00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:33.368
don't expect me to take you seriously.

40
00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:37.168
I don't believe they really exist either.

41
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:40.968
But the name in the letter got my attention.

42
00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:42.668
The envelope was addressed to me

43
00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:47.168
but the letter was written to Shinichi Kudo.

44
00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:50.068
You should be thanking me.

45
00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:51.768
It might be somebody from your past,

46
00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.768
that's why I brought you along.

47
00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:58.068
So did you contact the person who sent the letter to confirm it?

48
00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:01.068
Yes. The sender, Saori Kadowaki

49
00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:05.068
wrote the number for her cellular phone on the letter.

50
00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:08.368
But the first time I tried, someone answered but hung up right away,

51
00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:12.268
I tried again many times but nobody answers.

52
00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:14.868
On that first call though, I can still hear the sound

53
00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:17.668
coming from the other side of the receiver.

54
00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:21.768
It was the sound of waves and a woman moaning.

55
00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:25.168
-It couldn't be... -Maybe the mermaid already killed her.

56
00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.268
What?

57
00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:32.868
Saori Kadowaki is missing?

58
00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:37.768
Yes, it seems she hasn't shown up for work for the past 3 days.

59
00:04:37.768 --> 00:04:41.668
3 days ago, that's about when I got the letter.

60
00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:42.768
Her neighbors are saying that

61
00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:45.868
she might have gone to the main island on the ship though.

62
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.568
Sir, it's almost time.

63
00:04:47.568 --> 00:04:49.168
Yes, be right there.

64
00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:52.468
Well, I've got to go prepare for the festival.

65
00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:53.868
Festival?

66
00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:56.568
Today's the day of the "Dugong Festival",

67
00:04:56.568 --> 00:04:58.868
it's the island's annual celebration.

68
00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:00.768
If you want to know more about it,

69
00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:05.568
go to the gift shop Saori worked at, it's right at the corner.

70
00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:09.468
Mermaid amulets, mermaid straps.

71
00:05:09.468 --> 00:05:12.568
They've even got dugong cakes!

72
00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:16.468
It's true, this island's got every mermaid item in stock.

73
00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:18.668
What's a dugong, anyway?

74
00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:21.268
Well, it's a mammal that lives in the ocean,

75
00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:23.868
some people say that that's the model for the mermaid is.

76
00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:26.568
They used to live in the southern part of Japan too, long ago

77
00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:28.668
and it was believed that their meat was medicine

78
00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:30.968
and you'd live a long life.

79
00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:32.368
A Dugong Arrow?

80
00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:35.168
Yes, sir. It's a charm to keep you young forever,

81
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:39.768
only 3 are given away, once every year at the Dugong Festival.

82
00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:41.968
Saori was presented with 1 last year

83
00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:44.268
but she said she lost it

84
00:05:44.268 --> 00:05:47.168
and she was terrified since last week.

85
00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:49.568
She said the mermaid would curse her.

86
00:05:49.568 --> 00:05:52.568
That's hard to believe... a mermaid.

87
00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:54.868
Mermaids do exist.

88
00:05:54.868 --> 00:05:56.968
Nahoko.

89
00:05:56.968 --> 00:05:59.668
There's a Holy Person who gained eternal life

90
00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:02.268
after eating the dugong meat

91
00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:04.768
and whoever possesses the Dugong Arrow

92
00:06:04.768 --> 00:06:07.368
with the Holy Person's hair tied to it that has been blessed by her

93
00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.968
will also be granted eternal life.

94
00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:12.068
I don't blame her for running away,

95
00:06:12.068 --> 00:06:14.368
who wouldn't be afraid of the mermaid's curse

96
00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.868
after losing an arrow that important.

97
00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:18.068
Who was that?

98
00:06:18.068 --> 00:06:19.768
That's Nahoko, she and Saori have been friends

99
00:06:19.768 --> 00:06:21.768
since they were children.

100
00:06:21.768 --> 00:06:23.568
And who is this Holy Person?

101
00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:25.668
She's the star of the festival

102
00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:27.268
as well as the symbol of our island,

103
00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:30.068
she's old lady Shimabukuro!

104
00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:34.568
So tell me, how old is the old lady anyway?

105
00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:39.868
Well, there's some that say she's a hundred. Some say she's 200.

106
00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:41.768
If you don't believe me, why don't you

107
00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.568
go to the shrine for the festival?

108
00:06:44.568 --> 00:06:45.468
The shrine?

109
00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:47.468
The Holy Person's great-granddaughter, Kimie,

110
00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:50.768
who's also Saori's childhood friend should be there too.

111
00:06:50.768 --> 00:06:53.968
I think we're being given the run around.

112
00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:57.468
"Bikuni Shrine" -200 years old, that's ridiculous.

113
00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:00.968
My great-grandmother's exactly 130 years old this year.

114
00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:04.268
You can check the birth records that'll prove it.

115
00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:07.268
Good grief, just because she's a little older than most,

116
00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:09.368
everyone exaggerates so much.

117
00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.568
A little older?

118
00:07:11.568 --> 00:07:14.268
She belongs in the Guinness Book of Records.

119
00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:18.968
So where is this very old lady anyway?

120
00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:19.968
She's in her room,

121
00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:23.268
blessing the arrows to be presented at today's festival.

122
00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:26.968
Then, you mean, she really eats dugong meat?

123
00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:35.368
There's no such things as mermaids.

124
00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.368
That story's a complete lie.

125
00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:41.568
But what about the Dugong Arrow?

126
00:07:41.568 --> 00:07:45.668
My late mother told me that it was originally a protection amulet

127
00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.768
but the people on the island went and started

128
00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:52.668
to call it Dugong Arrow instead.

129
00:07:52.668 --> 00:07:55.468
You've lost your mother?

130
00:07:55.468 --> 00:07:58.968
Yes. She was lost at sea 5 years ago, along with my father

131
00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:00.168
and it seems my grandparents

132
00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:03.968
were also lost at sea before I was born.

133
00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:05.868
How awful, you lost your whole family to the sea,

134
00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:07.968
there must be something behind it!

135
00:08:07.968 --> 00:08:09.968
That's nonsense.

136
00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:12.568
Saori and I went to the main island by boat just recently

137
00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:14.268
and nothing happened.

138
00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:16.368
-You went... -With Saori?

139
00:08:16.368 --> 00:08:18.168
When was that?

140
00:08:18.168 --> 00:08:20.268
4 days ago.

141
00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:23.668
I had a dentist appointment and asked her to come with me.

142
00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:26.368
There's no dentists on this island.

143
00:08:26.368 --> 00:08:29.068
Was there anything strange about her that day?

144
00:08:29.068 --> 00:08:32.368
She was very scared because she lost the Dugong Arrow.

145
00:08:32.368 --> 00:08:34.968
She said the mermaid would curse her.

146
00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:37.268
No matter how hard I tried to convince her nothing would happen,

147
00:08:37.268 --> 00:08:38.568
she wouldn't listen.

148
00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:40.768
You're so stupid.

149
00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:42.768
She wouldn't listen because you don't believe

150
00:08:42.768 --> 00:08:44.368
in the holy one's powers, isn't that right?

151
00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:45.768
Toshimi?

152
00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:50.368
She's the real thing. She really ate dugong meat.

153
00:08:50.368 --> 00:08:52.068
Well, actually, about 3 years ago,

154
00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:54.968
the carcass of a real dugong did wash up.

155
00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.868
A dead dugong?

156
00:08:57.868 --> 00:09:01.868
Wasn't it on television about 3 years ago?

157
00:09:01.868 --> 00:09:05.168
The media played it up a lot.

158
00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.868
You don't know what you're talking about.

159
00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:09.368
You saw it, didn't you?

160
00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:13.168
The bones were crushed in a very strange way, it was grotesque.

161
00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:15.168
That's enough, Toshimi!

162
00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:16.368
Rokuro.

163
00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:19.468
You shouldn't tell outsiders too much.

164
00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:22.268
If you people are looking for Saori,

165
00:09:22.268 --> 00:09:24.968
why don't you just go to her home?

166
00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:29.968
You might learn something if that drunkard father lets you in.

167
00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:32.768
Nobody seems to be very worried.

168
00:09:32.768 --> 00:09:34.868
That's because Saori fought with her father a lot

169
00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:36.968
and she'd often run away.

170
00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:40.068
Would you mind taking us to Saori's home?

171
00:09:40.068 --> 00:09:43.568
I don't mind. But it'll have to be after the festival.

172
00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:46.168
What do you do at the festival?

173
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:49.468
Lottery tickets are sold beforehand

174
00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:51.568
and if their numbers match the numbers my great-grandmother picks,

175
00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:53.368
they get an arrow.

176
00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:56.268
It's like lucky number drawing.

177
00:09:56.268 --> 00:10:00.968
Oh, that's right. Would you like to try your luck?

178
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.868
An elderly couple suddenly cancelled this morning

179
00:10:03.868 --> 00:10:05.968
so there are 2 extras.

180
00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.068
If you say so.

181
00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:15.268
Whether you win or lose, it's all up to the Gods.

182
00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:19.668
Maybe, you'll be able to obtain eternal youth and beauty

183
00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:21.868
just like the rumors.

184
00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:34.068
I'm kind of excited.

185
00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:35.368
Me too.

186
00:10:42.868 --> 00:10:46.468
"Mikoto Shimabukuro (130), The Holy Person"

187
00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:48.068
It's the Holy Person.

188
00:10:48.068 --> 00:10:50.768
The Holy Person is making her appearance.

189
00:10:50.768 --> 00:10:52.768
That's the Holy Person?

190
00:10:52.768 --> 00:10:55.568
She's so tiny.

191
00:10:55.568 --> 00:10:58.768
It's just an old lady wearing heavy makeup.

192
00:11:05.468 --> 00:11:07.768
She set fire to the door!

193
00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.668
It's burning the door!

194
00:11:23.568 --> 00:11:24.968
I get it.

195
00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:28.368
The fire burns the winning number onto the door.

196
00:11:28.368 --> 00:11:30.768
I... I don't believe it. Am I seeing things?

197
00:11:30.768 --> 00:11:32.968
I did it, what luck!

198
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.568
Ran.

199
00:11:35.568 --> 00:11:38.068
I...

200
00:11:38.068 --> 00:11:39.768
I won!

201
00:11:44.768 --> 00:11:46.568
Attention, winners.

202
00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:50.768
The Dugong Arrows will be presented to you in an hour.

203
00:11:50.768 --> 00:11:54.368
Please proceed to the Mermaid's Waterfall.

204
00:11:58.268 --> 00:12:01.668
Now, will the 3 persons who will receive divine favor

205
00:12:01.668 --> 00:12:02.668
step forward?

206
00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:05.668
Yes! Here I am!

207
00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:12.468
Where is the other person? Isn't there anyone else?

208
00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:13.768
"Benzo Kadowaki (52), Saori's father"

209
00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.068
"Fisherman" -Here I am.

210
00:12:17.368 --> 00:12:19.568
What is this? That's strange.

211
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:22.568
I could've sworn that other girl won too.

212
00:12:22.568 --> 00:12:25.768
Yeah, I don't see her around here.

213
00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:28.368
At this time, however...

214
00:12:28.368 --> 00:12:32.968
she was already here at the Mermaid's Waterfall.

215
00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:35.968
Show these 3 with the divine light.

216
00:12:41.768 --> 00:12:43.368
Hey. What's that?

217
00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:44.968
What is that?

218
00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.668
That's right.

219
00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:56.868
Long, black hair wafting on a slim body that sways,

220
00:12:56.868 --> 00:13:01.368
it most certainly looked like a mermaid swimming up the waterfall,

221
00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:03.368
shiny and blue

222
00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:05.768
but it was a lifeless body.

223
00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:20.376
Toshimi?

224
00:13:20.376 --> 00:13:21.976
Do you think she killed herself?

225
00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:23.776
Or was she murdered?

226
00:13:23.776 --> 00:13:27.376
Maybe it's neither.

227
00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:29.676
The rope that's around her neck

228
00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.976
is the one that's used to rope off the dangerous areas along the river.

229
00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:35.476
What did you just say?

230
00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:38.376
I see.

231
00:13:38.376 --> 00:13:43.176
So it happened like this, it was dark and Toshimi tripped,

232
00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:46.076
she grabbed the rope but the current was too strong

233
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:48.276
so the nails came loose and as she fell,

234
00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:51.676
the rope got tangled around her neck.

235
00:13:51.676 --> 00:13:53.476
But don't you think that's strange?

236
00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:57.176
The festival was still going on around the bottom of the waterfall

237
00:13:57.176 --> 00:14:00.776
so why did she go into the forest for?

238
00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:03.176
Maybe she was looking for the mermaid's grave?

239
00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.676
What?

240
00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:07.976
The mermaid's grave is somewhere in this forest.

241
00:14:07.976 --> 00:14:10.276
On the night of the festival 3 years ago,

242
00:14:10.276 --> 00:14:12.076
a fire burned the shrine's storage house,

243
00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:13.076
that's how the mermaid's bones were found

244
00:14:13.076 --> 00:14:15.576
and they were buried somewhere in this forest.

245
00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:19.276
Yes, I remember she was always talking about that grave.

246
00:14:19.276 --> 00:14:21.876
Hold on a minute! You all talk about a mermaid

247
00:14:21.876 --> 00:14:24.376
but how do you know it was a mermaid's bones?

248
00:14:24.376 --> 00:14:25.876
Well...

249
00:14:25.876 --> 00:14:28.176
All the people on the island said it was

250
00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:30.076
but the policeman from the main land

251
00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:31.776
said the bones were that of a middle aged woman.

252
00:14:31.776 --> 00:14:33.076
That's a lie!

253
00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:34.376
He said he could be sure if there were

254
00:14:34.376 --> 00:14:36.276
bones from the lower part of her body!

255
00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.176
The lower part of her body?

256
00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:40.676
The main beam from the storage house burned

257
00:14:40.676 --> 00:14:43.976
and fell on the lower part of her body.

258
00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.676
But when the beam was lifted off,

259
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:49.576
there were no bones for where her legs should have been.

260
00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:51.876
That's hard to believe!

261
00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:54.476
Thanks to that fact, the media made a big fuss broadcasting that

262
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:55.676
a mermaid's body was found.

263
00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:58.976
And our Holy Person became famous.

264
00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:02.876
But didn't the police say it was a lady?

265
00:15:02.876 --> 00:15:07.676
Yes. They said probably a tourist who didn't win one of the Dugong Arrow

266
00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:11.276
snuck into the storage house looking for an extra arrow

267
00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:12.676
and the fire was caused

268
00:15:12.676 --> 00:15:15.376
when the candle in the storage house was lit.

269
00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:20.876
A year went by and it was still unidentified

270
00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:24.376
so we went and buried it.

271
00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:26.676
The problem started after that.

272
00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:27.876
Problem?

273
00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:30.676
Grave robbers.

274
00:15:30.676 --> 00:15:32.476
Stupid tourists

275
00:15:32.476 --> 00:15:36.476
started coming around trying to dig up the bones.

276
00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:38.476
It seems they heard that mermaid bones

277
00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:39.976
were the elixir of eternal life.

278
00:15:39.976 --> 00:15:42.976
That's why great-grandmother asked someone to help

279
00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.976
and they reburied the bones here secretly.

280
00:15:45.976 --> 00:15:48.776
Who did she ask?

281
00:15:48.776 --> 00:15:49.976
I don't know.

282
00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:54.076
All she said was it was someone she trusted very much.

283
00:15:54.076 --> 00:15:58.576
Well, whether it's suicide, murder or an accident,

284
00:15:58.576 --> 00:15:59.476
we'll continue this conversation

285
00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:05.176
after we've taken her body down and the police arrive.

286
00:16:05.176 --> 00:16:08.576
If it was murder, then it's partly Toshimi's fault too,

287
00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:11.576
coming to a place like this at this time of night.

288
00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:15.876
Aren't you the cold one? Your fiancee just died.

289
00:16:15.876 --> 00:16:17.976
Fiancee?

290
00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:20.576
Our parents arranged that on their own.

291
00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:22.276
I never proposed to her.

292
00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:26.576
Besides, both my father and mother are no longer alive.

293
00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:33.276
Toshimi!

294
00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:34.976
Who is that?

295
00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:36.776
That's Toshimi's father.

296
00:16:36.776 --> 00:16:39.176
Mr. Ebihara, the head of the fisherman's union.

297
00:16:39.176 --> 00:16:40.976
Dad!

298
00:16:40.976 --> 00:16:44.576
Did you call the Fukui prefectural police?

299
00:16:44.576 --> 00:16:46.576
They said the seas are too rough

300
00:16:46.576 --> 00:16:49.576
and they won't be able to come until it calms down.

301
00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:50.976
You've got to be kidding.

302
00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:54.076
Hey, lucky for us.

303
00:16:54.076 --> 00:16:57.476
The murderer can't get off the island either.

304
00:16:57.476 --> 00:16:59.276
What do you mean, murderer?

305
00:16:59.276 --> 00:17:02.476
We don't know for sure yet that she was murdered.

306
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:04.476
Then take a look it.

307
00:17:04.476 --> 00:17:06.176
A swim ring?

308
00:17:06.176 --> 00:17:09.576
Heiji and I found it, it was stuck in the middle of the river

309
00:17:09.576 --> 00:17:12.776
that joins the water from the waterfall to the ocean.

310
00:17:12.776 --> 00:17:15.676
If Toshimi was knocked unconscious then the rope is wound her neck

311
00:17:15.676 --> 00:17:17.876
and then she's put on the swim ring and set afloat,

312
00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:20.076
she'd end up hanging from the waterfall, wouldn't she?

313
00:17:20.076 --> 00:17:22.376
We saw Toshimi at the shrine

314
00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.576
2 hours before the fireworks went up.

315
00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:28.276
It doesn't take an hour to get to and from the top of the waterfall.

316
00:17:28.276 --> 00:17:29.976
Which means,

317
00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:33.776
anyone could have committed the crime, man or woman

318
00:17:33.776 --> 00:17:38.176
and the murderer is still on the island!

319
00:17:38.176 --> 00:17:40.376
That's terrible.

320
00:17:40.376 --> 00:17:44.676
Don't worry about it! The murderer will be caught in no time!

321
00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:47.476
When Heiji moves his hat around, he's turned his switch on.

322
00:17:47.476 --> 00:17:49.276
He's raring to go.

323
00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:53.976
But you must've fall in love with him.

324
00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:58.276
I'm no match for you if we become rivals.

325
00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:02.176
Kazuha.

326
00:18:02.176 --> 00:18:03.176
You're so sweet!

327
00:18:03.176 --> 00:18:05.676
Hey, what're you doing?

328
00:18:05.676 --> 00:18:08.776
Listen. If Toshimi was murdered,

329
00:18:08.776 --> 00:18:11.376
you'd better not let that person out of your sight.

330
00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:16.176
I'm talking about Saori's drunk of a father.

331
00:18:16.176 --> 00:18:19.076
Excuse me. Would you like to go to Saori's home now?

332
00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:21.076
I'll take you since I promised you earlier.

333
00:18:21.076 --> 00:18:24.676
With him in that condition, I doubt he'll be much help though.

334
00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:27.476
Alright then.

335
00:18:27.476 --> 00:18:30.576
I'd like to meet the Holy Person.

336
00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.676
Sure.

337
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:38.876
This house is old.

338
00:18:38.876 --> 00:18:40.576
It doesn't look like they're making too much money

339
00:18:40.576 --> 00:18:42.276
from those Dugong Arrows.

340
00:18:42.276 --> 00:18:46.276
How can you say that? Those platelets cost 500 yen a piece.

341
00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:47.876
500 yen?

342
00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:49.976
The people on this island said the price has been the same

343
00:18:49.976 --> 00:18:51.276
since they can remember.

344
00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:54.676
There are 108 number platelets in a huge box

345
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:57.176
and everyone lines up then pulls one out.

346
00:18:57.176 --> 00:19:01.976
Then the old woman picks the 3 winning numbers.

347
00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:04.376
What's taking that old lady so long anyway?

348
00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.976
Kimie said she'd tell her we want to see her

349
00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:09.076
but she might be tired after today's festival

350
00:19:09.076 --> 00:19:11.576
so we may not be able to see her.

351
00:19:13.276 --> 00:19:14.976
What is that sound?

352
00:19:22.076 --> 00:19:25.876
Are you the ones who want to see me?

353
00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:28.776
Without makeup, she looks like a spook.

354
00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:30.676
Excuse me.

355
00:19:30.676 --> 00:19:35.576
We wanted to know how you picked the winning numbers.

356
00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.276
Excuse me...

357
00:19:38.276 --> 00:19:41.076
I just pick them randomly.

358
00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:45.676
Once I used the numbers of the horses that won at the races.

359
00:19:45.676 --> 00:19:47.276
I don't believe this.

360
00:19:47.276 --> 00:19:49.676
Then why don't you sell more of them

361
00:19:49.676 --> 00:19:52.076
instead of being so chintzy and selling only 3?

362
00:19:52.076 --> 00:19:54.076
That can't be helped.

363
00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:58.076
The hair I tie to the arrow is my own and I don't have a whole lot.

364
00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:02.576
Great-grandmother! Your bath is ready!

365
00:20:04.176 --> 00:20:06.176
Excuse me, if that's all you came here for,

366
00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:09.176
I'm going to take a bath now and go to bed.

367
00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:10.576
Wait, I'd like to ask you more.

368
00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:13.676
Alright then, you girlie.

369
00:20:13.676 --> 00:20:16.176
You, the one with your hair tied back.

370
00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:17.776
Who, me?

371
00:20:17.776 --> 00:20:21.276
The Dugong Arrow is really a charm to warn off evil.

372
00:20:21.276 --> 00:20:24.076
If it leaves your person, evil will overtake you.

373
00:20:24.076 --> 00:20:28.476
Men will return to the soil and become heartless demons.

374
00:20:28.476 --> 00:20:33.576
Women will return to water and become silent mermaids.

375
00:20:33.576 --> 00:20:37.076
You must never let it leave your person.

376
00:20:45.676 --> 00:20:47.876
Even her voice sounds wrinkly and she's so pale.

377
00:20:47.876 --> 00:20:50.476
She looks like she could drop dead any minute.

378
00:20:51.476 --> 00:20:53.776
"The Next Day, Ebihara House"

379
00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:56.376
See! I'm glad I brought my school uniform with me,

380
00:20:56.376 --> 00:20:58.376
it's coming to good use.

381
00:20:58.376 --> 00:20:59.476
Are you sure this is okay?

382
00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:01.376
Won't they mind having us showing like this?

383
00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:03.776
No problem! It's a small island,

384
00:21:03.776 --> 00:21:05.976
this'll be the perfect time to question everybody.

385
00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:10.076
Stop smiling like that! This is Toshimi's wake!

386
00:21:10.076 --> 00:21:11.976
Oh, sorry.

387
00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:15.276
Kazuha, did you bring the arrow with you?

388
00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:17.476
Yes. I certainly did.

389
00:21:18.976 --> 00:21:21.776
It's that drunk. He's already here.

390
00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:29.876
Mr. Mouri, I'm surprised you all came.

391
00:21:29.876 --> 00:21:32.676
Yes, well...

392
00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:37.876
By the way, I understand that Mr. Kadowaki didn't go home last night.

393
00:21:37.876 --> 00:21:38.876
That's right.

394
00:21:38.876 --> 00:21:42.876
But I heard he got into a fight with a tourist at a bar.

395
00:21:42.876 --> 00:21:46.176
So he was drinking all night, huh?

396
00:21:46.176 --> 00:21:49.776
I don't see Nahoko around.

397
00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.776
Her name was on the sign in sheet though.

398
00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:54.576
Nahoko's here?

399
00:21:54.576 --> 00:21:56.476
She's probably in the restroom.

400
00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:58.576
We'll go check.

401
00:21:58.576 --> 00:22:00.776
Yes, good idea.

402
00:22:08.676 --> 00:22:11.576
Don't tell me you're afraid of thunder?

403
00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:15.276
No, it's not that. Someone's out there.

404
00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:19.376
You're right.

405
00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:20.476
What's going on?

406
00:22:20.476 --> 00:22:21.776
Oh, Heiji.

407
00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:23.476
Somebody's out there.

408
00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:24.676
Are you sure?

409
00:22:27.276 --> 00:22:28.376
Isn't that?

410
00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:05.776
Fish scales?

411
00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:08.476
You mean the killer's a mermaid?

412
00:24:08.476 --> 00:24:10.876
Stay close to me.

413
00:24:12.776 --> 00:24:14.276
What happened?

414
00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:17.276
Over there, a brown-haired girl with glasses is...

415
00:24:17.276 --> 00:24:19.576
She's looking straight at us!

416
00:24:21.276 --> 00:24:23.576
-I don't believe it! -Saori?

417
00:24:23.576 --> 00:24:24.676
That's impossible!

418
00:24:24.676 --> 00:24:27.976
Idiot! That's impossible! I'm not convinced!

419
00:24:28.576 --> 00:24:29.876
Next Conan,

420
00:24:29.876 --> 00:24:33.597
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Unveiling)"

421
00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:36.294
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:36.294 --> 00:24:37.894
"The mermaid's grave"

423
00:24:38.594 --> 00:24:39.894
The two are in a pinch in the next episode!

424
00:24:39.894 --> 00:24:41.694
They overcome the danger and their love for each deepens.

425
00:24:41.694 --> 00:24:43.194
What about you?
