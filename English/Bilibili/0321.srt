1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.240
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.040
It's a kidnap case demanding ransom.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.840
What happened in the tunnel?

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:45.567
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 1)"

9
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.467
"Beika General Hospital"

10
00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:53.367
Yeah, I thought that Masked Yaiba was going to lose yesterday.

11
00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:56.167
What a thing to say!

12
00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:59.667
Yes, he missed his Yaiba kick.

13
00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:16.767
Jun!

14
00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:18.167
Hello!

15
00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.567
"Jun Kataoka (7), Kataoka's son"

16
00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:21.967
How's it, Jun?

17
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.367
How's your broken bone? Is it better now?

18
00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.367
You don't look too happy.

19
00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:34.067
They're Jun's classmates. They always come to visit him.

20
00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.867
Oh.

21
00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:37.867
Thank you so much!

22
00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.467
Oh, no, it's nothing, really...

23
00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:43.067
We're friends so...

24
00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:47.067
You two are always like that when you see pretty women.

25
00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.667
How disgusting! Don't you think so?

26
00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.367
Hey! Jun.

27
00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:54.067
I didn't know you had an older sister.

28
00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:57.467
Did you call me his older sister?

29
00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.367
Oh! Yes!

30
00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:00.767
My, how flattering.

31
00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:04.267
She's Ms. Sachiko Ezaki, a fashion designer.

32
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.167
A fashion designer?

33
00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.767
Wow!

34
00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:10.767
Did you come to visit Jun?

35
00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.367
Yes!

36
00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.567
Nice meeting you all!

37
00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:17.667
Come over to my place someday!

38
00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.667
You're all very welcomed to come!

39
00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.267
Place?

40
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.467
Jun's house.

41
00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.567
Jun's house?

42
00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.167
What do you mean?

43
00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:30.467
She means...

44
00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:33.167
I think you'd better go already!

45
00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.467
Isn't it time for your fashion show recital to start?

46
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.367
Oh, right.

47
00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.267
We'd better get going then.

48
00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:43.567
Okay.

49
00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:45.267
See you, Jun.

50
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:48.767
Since Jun looks bored,

51
00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:50.567
please spend as much time as you can with him.

52
00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:51.867
Goodbye.

53
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.767
Jun, you'll be discharged tomorrow.

54
00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.467
Hang in there just one more day, okay?

55
00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:14.067
Is that person called Ezaki...

56
00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.267
Is she going to become your new mother?

57
00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:21.667
How nice that such a pretty person's going to be your mother?

58
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.167
My mother who died was much prettier!

59
00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:29.267
She's just marrying daddy because she wants his estate.

60
00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:31.367
Estate?

61
00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:35.067
Right. Because I heard them.

62
00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.367
What?

63
00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:40.167
For me?

64
00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:43.267
I'm so happy! Thank you!

65
00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:48.167
How do I look?

66
00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.167
They look nice!

67
00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:53.267
And, when shall we have the wedding?

68
00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:55.767
Please wait a little while more.

69
00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:58.967
Until the February show is over.

70
00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.567
Are you saying you want to put all your energy into the show?

71
00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:03.867
Yes.

72
00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:06.867
I want it to succeed this time no matter what.

73
00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.767
If I don't make it again this time,

74
00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:11.867
I'm going to give up my career as a fashion designer!

75
00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:13.667
My mind's made up.

76
00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:15.067
Okay!

77
00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:17.567
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.867
It's okay.

79
00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:23.367
By the way, about this show, do you have enough cash?

80
00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:25.167
If you need some...

81
00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:29.867
I'm fine! If I ever need any, I won't hesitate to ask you for help.

82
00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.367
So, please be prepared!

83
00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:33.767
Keep it within reasonable range now!

84
00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:38.767
Jun!

85
00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.667
Aren't you taking everything too negatively?

86
00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.067
A pretty person like her could never...

87
00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:45.167
Genta!

88
00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:51.767
I understand how you feel. Revulsion against your new mother?

89
00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:08.767
Game corner?

90
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.467
You know the one where the supermarket in Haido-cho is?

91
00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:14.767
Do you want to go now?

92
00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:18.267
Please! I've always wanted to go there. Just this once!

93
00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:19.767
But, you're still not fully recovered.

94
00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:21.367
I'm just fine, fine.

95
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:22.967
The cast is just for show.

96
00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:24.667
I'm doing just fine.

97
00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:26.167
See! Watch!

98
00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:28.367
But...

99
00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:31.167
Are you sure you're okay?

100
00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:34.367
You can go after you're discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

101
00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:37.367
No way, impossible. It would never happen!

102
00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:40.267
As soon as I'm discharged, I'll have to study with my tutor,

103
00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:42.167
go to piano lessons, and English class

104
00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.567
that I won't have any time to go play games.

105
00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:48.267
Well, I've always felt sorry for you behind the scenes.

106
00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:49.967
So, please!

107
00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:52.367
Today's the only chance I have.

108
00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:53.767
If we can back here in two hours in time

109
00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.367
for the 12pm rounds that the doctor makes,

110
00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:58.267
they'll never even miss me.

111
00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:01.567
Hey! What do you think, Conan?

112
00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:05.367
In order to leave the hospital, first,

113
00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:08.967
you'd have to go past the nurse station.

114
00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:12.867
And, I'm pretty sure that nurse will come by and check the room.

115
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:17.667
So, as long as somebody sleeps in bed in place...

116
00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:20.067
Hey! Hey! That's absurd.

117
00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.467
Come on, we're friends, let's help him.

118
00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:25.767
Yeah, please!

119
00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:29.267
Jun's pleading with us too.

120
00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:30.667
If we ignore his wish,

121
00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:33.267
it'll make a bad name for the Youth Detective Squad!

122
00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:34.567
Right, Conan?

123
00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.267
Okay...

124
00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:38.967
Thank you!

125
00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:43.367
Shall we decide by stone, paper, scissors, then, Conan?

126
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:45.967
What? Stone, paper, scissors?

127
00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:51.767
What's with him?

128
00:07:51.767 --> 00:07:54.867
Conan is really weak when it comes to stone, paper, scissors.

129
00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:56.667
We don't have time, let's hurry!

130
00:07:56.667 --> 00:07:58.767
Let's have eels over rice on the way home!

131
00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.167
If you're treating us, Genta!

132
00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:01.567
Yeah!

133
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:12.067
Well, go enjoy yourselves to your heart's content.

134
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:16.267
Oh, no!

135
00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:33.567
"Supermarket Moriwaki"

136
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.067
Jun?

137
00:08:58.167 --> 00:08:59.967
Jun?

138
00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:03.267
Hey! Hey!

139
00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:05.667
Jun's bed is empty.

140
00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:07.567
Do you have any idea where he went?

141
00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:08.767
No...

142
00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:13.667
Come to think of it, a bunch of children came to see him.

143
00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:15.167
Shall I go look for them?

144
00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.467
It's me, Yoshizawa!

145
00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:32.067
I kidnapped the kid named Jun.

146
00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:35.967
It's going just as you planned.

147
00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:38.267
Now?

148
00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:40.967
Yeah, he's fast asleep.

149
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.267
Where is this?

150
00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:46.767
What happened?

151
00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:54.867
So, you're up, sonny, eh? Get down!

152
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:56.467
Hurry it up!

153
00:09:58.867 --> 00:10:01.767
What's with you? You can't move yet?

154
00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:04.267
Where is this?

155
00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:07.267
What're you going to do to me?

156
00:10:07.267 --> 00:10:08.267
Hey...

157
00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:13.067
Nothing much.

158
00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:16.967
We're just going to ask your dad for ransom.

159
00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:19.567
You mean I was kidnapped?

160
00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:21.667
Well, I guess so.

161
00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:34.067
Good!

162
00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.567
Okay! That's it.

163
00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:39.467
Do the same for tonight's show!

164
00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:41.267
Let's take a break till then!

165
00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:42.567
Fantastic!

166
00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:46.167
No mistake you're going to join the circle of top class designers now.

167
00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:48.967
I sure hope so.

168
00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.167
Believe in your ability.

169
00:10:52.867 --> 00:10:54.767
Yes, this is Kataoka.

170
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:56.767
What?

171
00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:59.467
Jun's been...

172
00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:01.767
Yes! Okay.

173
00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:04.067
I'll head over there right away.

174
00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:06.667
Jun... is something wrong?

175
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.067
It seems he disappeared from the hospital.

176
00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:11.867
What? I'll go with you.

177
00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:14.867
No, I'll go to the hospital alone.

178
00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:17.767
You've got an important show to take care of.

179
00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.167
But...

180
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.267
I'm sure everything's okay!

181
00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:22.867
He probably went out to play some place nearby.

182
00:11:22.867 --> 00:11:25.267
There's nothing to worry about!

183
00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:27.267
I'll get in touch with you later!

184
00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:35.267
He hasn't gone home, and I've had the nearby area checked but...

185
00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:38.067
Do you have any idea where else he could be?

186
00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:42.267
I wonder. His leg is hurt, so I don't think he can go that far.

187
00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:46.167
Sachiko!

188
00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.367
Did you find out where Jun is?

189
00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:51.367
Sachiko, go back to the show site!

190
00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:53.867
Leave Jun to us.

191
00:11:53.867 --> 00:11:56.267
What's most important to you now is...

192
00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.167
Jun is more important than the show.

193
00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:02.067
I won't go back until I know he's safe!

194
00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:03.367
Officer Sato!

195
00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.367
How was it?

196
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:06.367
I asked the nurses.

197
00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:08.467
It seems that the classmates who came to see him

198
00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:10.467
were Conan and the others.

199
00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:12.067
Conan and his friends?

200
00:12:12.067 --> 00:12:14.967
All four of them seem to have come together and gone home together.

201
00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:18.867
Oh. Which means he didn't go out with them.

202
00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:26.067
This is Kataoka.

203
00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:30.867
You kidnaped Jun?

204
00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:43.347
If you want your kid back,

205
00:12:43.347 --> 00:12:46.447
get 30,000,000 yen in old bills ready!

206
00:12:46.447 --> 00:12:49.447
How's Jun? Is Jun okay?

207
00:12:49.447 --> 00:12:51.647
Yeah, he's fine.

208
00:12:51.647 --> 00:12:55.047
I let you hear his voice right now!

209
00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:57.947
Oh no. I don't have my voice changer either.

210
00:12:57.947 --> 00:12:59.447
Here!

211
00:12:59.447 --> 00:13:02.047
He wants to hear your voice.

212
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:06.547
What's the matter?

213
00:13:07.747 --> 00:13:09.047
Daddy.

214
00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:12.647
Jun!

215
00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:16.447
Seems the kid's panicked that he's lost his voice.

216
00:13:16.447 --> 00:13:19.947
Get the cash ready quick.

217
00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:22.747
Oh, wait.

218
00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:23.747
He hung up.

219
00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:26.647
Mr. Kataoka, does the voice sound familiar to you?

220
00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:28.047
No.

221
00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:30.047
This is the first time I've heard his voice.

222
00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:33.747
Jun's voice was so weak.

223
00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:36.047
I wonder if he's really safe.

224
00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:40.647
I can't say, but please leave the rest up to the police.

225
00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:42.347
All right.

226
00:13:46.647 --> 00:13:49.147
Inspector Megure! Everything's ready.

227
00:13:49.147 --> 00:13:50.847
Thanks!

228
00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:54.147
All we can do now is wait for the kidnapper

229
00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:56.747
to get back in touch with us.

230
00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:07.847
Inspector Megure!

231
00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:11.447
Please answer the phone, Mr. Kataoka!

232
00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:12.747
Yes.

233
00:14:18.747 --> 00:14:21.247
Hello, this is Kataoka.

234
00:14:21.247 --> 00:14:23.247
Did you get the cash ready?

235
00:14:23.247 --> 00:14:25.847
Yes. It's ready.

236
00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:29.647
And, you're going to give Jun back to us, aren't you?

237
00:14:29.647 --> 00:14:34.247
Bring that money to the clock tower of the Ogane Park at 12pm!

238
00:14:34.247 --> 00:14:39.147
12pm to the clock tower of Ogane Park. I'll be there!

239
00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:44.147
Hold it! You're not the one who's bringing the money!

240
00:14:44.147 --> 00:14:47.747
We want a woman called Sachiko Ezaki to bring it.

241
00:14:48.547 --> 00:14:50.647
What? You want her to bring it?

242
00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:54.147
We don't hassle with anybody acting funny.

243
00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:56.747
We feel more secure if a woman brings it.

244
00:14:56.747 --> 00:14:59.447
Don't be late.

245
00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:06.047
Inspector Megure!

246
00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.547
I'll go disguised as Ms. Ezaki.

247
00:15:10.647 --> 00:15:12.747
No! Let me...

248
00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.647
Ms. Ezaki?

249
00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.347
I'll go!

250
00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:18.147
Sachiko?

251
00:15:18.147 --> 00:15:20.747
The kidnapper demanded me to go.

252
00:15:20.747 --> 00:15:23.547
I'm sure he knows how I look.

253
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:27.647
But, if the worst should happen...

254
00:15:27.647 --> 00:15:29.047
Please!

255
00:15:29.047 --> 00:15:32.847
Nothing... nothing can be greater than Jun's life!

256
00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:36.747
Let me go! Inspector!

257
00:15:36.747 --> 00:15:38.347
Inspector!

258
00:15:42.547 --> 00:15:43.947
Inspector Megure.

259
00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:51.647
All right. Will you do it for us?

260
00:15:51.647 --> 00:15:52.647
Yes.

261
00:15:52.647 --> 00:15:54.047
Inspector!

262
00:15:54.047 --> 00:15:55.547
I know!

263
00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:01.047
Ms. Ezaki, we will be 500m behind you

264
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:04.147
so that the kidnapper doesn't realize we're there.

265
00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:06.847
I'll put this tracking device in your bag,

266
00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.047
so we'll be able to locate the kidnapper right away.

267
00:16:09.047 --> 00:16:10.747
And, if you need to get in touch with us for anything,

268
00:16:10.747 --> 00:16:12.347
please use this to contact us.

269
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.647
Sachiko, please don't do anything reckless.

270
00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:18.847
I promise I'll bring Jun back with me.

271
00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:20.447
Sachiko.

272
00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:21.547
Go on!

273
00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:26.847
This is your grave! No use calling for help.

274
00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:44.147
I've got to get out of here fast.

275
00:16:44.147 --> 00:16:48.047
Understand? When the kidnapper comes in contact with Ms. Ezaki,

276
00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:51.647
if he has Jun with him, nab him on the spot.

277
00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:54.847
If Jun is nowhere in sight,

278
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.347
let the kidnapper go and get a hold of the whereabouts of Jun.

279
00:16:58.347 --> 00:17:01.147
After confirming whether he is okay or not, then nab the kidnapper!

280
00:17:01.147 --> 00:17:02.747
This is Sato at Ogane Park!

281
00:17:02.747 --> 00:17:05.347
All the investigators are in position!

282
00:17:05.347 --> 00:17:08.247
Good! Be very careful.

283
00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:14.747
Takagi, come closer to me!

284
00:17:14.747 --> 00:17:16.747
No, I'm just fine.

285
00:17:17.547 --> 00:17:18.747
Don't be silly.

286
00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:21.047
If you don't, we won't look like lovers!

287
00:17:21.047 --> 00:17:22.847
Oh, okay.

288
00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:26.847
Come on, at least put your arm around me or something.

289
00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:28.447
Here goes, then.

290
00:17:29.147 --> 00:17:31.447
Like this?

291
00:17:31.447 --> 00:17:34.047
Gosh! Get with it, will you?

292
00:17:37.747 --> 00:17:41.247
Inspector! Ms. Ezaki's car has arrived.

293
00:17:51.247 --> 00:17:52.447
Inspector!

294
00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:56.147
A suspicious car is in view approaching Ms. Ezaki's car from behind.

295
00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:02.147
It's a compact truck with the words Honeybee Courier written on it.

296
00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:06.147
Would a kidnapper come in a flashy car like that?

297
00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:14.447
It stopped beside Ms. Ezaki.

298
00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:16.047
Is Jun anywhere in sight?

299
00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:19.047
No. I can't really confirm whether or not.

300
00:18:19.047 --> 00:18:22.147
Jun? Isn't Jun with you?

301
00:18:22.147 --> 00:18:24.547
One of my friends is watching the kid.

302
00:18:24.547 --> 00:18:26.747
I'll give him back to you as soon as I return with this ransom.

303
00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:31.847
Tell the police that if I'm late getting back, the kid's dead.

304
00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:33.947
The kidnapper grabbed the bag from Ms. Ezaki

305
00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.747
and has fled by truck!

306
00:18:36.747 --> 00:18:39.447
The number plate on the truck is Shinjuku, two letters 44.

307
00:18:39.447 --> 00:18:41.747
"Mi" for Mikasa 328.

308
00:18:41.747 --> 00:18:45.147
On its orange colored bed, there is a large honeybee mark.

309
00:18:45.147 --> 00:18:46.847
What shall we do, Inspector?

310
00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:48.747
Don't get to close!

311
00:18:48.747 --> 00:18:51.547
Chiba, get the officers in emergency position on the double.

312
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.547
-Yes, sir! -Sato, Takagi, go after him by chopper!

313
00:18:54.547 --> 00:18:55.747
Roger!

314
00:18:55.747 --> 00:18:58.547
A child's life is at stake, so be extremely careful.

315
00:18:58.547 --> 00:19:00.947
Don't let him get away, no matter what.

316
00:19:02.947 --> 00:19:06.147
Jun, isn't it about time we get going?

317
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.747
It's only a little after 11pm yet, though.

318
00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:09.947
See?

319
00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:12.247
Then, you can still play a lot more!

320
00:19:12.247 --> 00:19:14.947
Next, why don't we challenge the game over there?

321
00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:16.247
Okay!

322
00:19:16.247 --> 00:19:18.247
Genta, are you good at that game?

323
00:19:18.247 --> 00:19:19.247
Nope.

324
00:19:30.847 --> 00:19:33.647
Something... if I can only find something...

325
00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:49.347
Inspector! The truck's headed for Kenbashi Tunnel!

326
00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:50.947
What's the length of the tunnel?

327
00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:53.747
About 1km, so at this speed...

328
00:19:53.747 --> 00:19:55.647
it'll go through it in about a minute!

329
00:19:58.147 --> 00:20:01.347
Inspector! The truck will soon be entering the tunnel!

330
00:20:01.347 --> 00:20:04.147
Go on ahead and wait at the exit of the tunnel!

331
00:20:04.147 --> 00:20:05.147
Roger!

332
00:20:17.147 --> 00:20:19.047
It stopped.

333
00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:21.047
It stopped in the center of the tunnel!

334
00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:27.447
It won't budge with the strength of a child.

335
00:20:27.447 --> 00:20:29.047
Darn it!

336
00:20:32.247 --> 00:20:35.547
Maybe the kidnapper abandoned the truck.

337
00:20:35.547 --> 00:20:37.847
Do you see anybody suspicious?

338
00:20:37.847 --> 00:20:41.547
No, only other cars are coming out of the tunnel.

339
00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:45.447
No humans, not even a cat for that matter.

340
00:20:45.947 --> 00:20:48.647
Why? Why isn't it moving?

341
00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.647
Inspector, 10 minutes have gone by.

342
00:20:51.647 --> 00:20:54.347
Okay, let's go inside the tunnel!

343
00:20:54.347 --> 00:20:55.447
Yes, sir!

344
00:20:57.847 --> 00:21:01.347
Darn! I've got to do something quick.

345
00:21:05.747 --> 00:21:09.147
It was abandoned on the side of the road in the center of the tunnel.

346
00:21:09.147 --> 00:21:10.647
Which means...

347
00:21:10.647 --> 00:21:12.247
The kidnapper threw away the communicator

348
00:21:12.247 --> 00:21:14.147
and got away with the cash.

349
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:18.647
But the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

350
00:21:18.647 --> 00:21:20.247
Are you sure about it?

351
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:24.747
Yes. The pilot of the chopper as well as I was watching carefully

352
00:21:24.747 --> 00:21:27.847
but the Honeybee courier truck didn't come out of the tunnel.

353
00:21:27.847 --> 00:21:30.347
Maybe he made a U-turn inside the tunnel?

354
00:21:30.347 --> 00:21:31.647
But if so, he would be driving

355
00:21:31.647 --> 00:21:34.547
in the opposite direction on the freeway and cause a commotion!

356
00:21:34.547 --> 00:21:36.247
Then, are you saying that the kidnapper's car

357
00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:40.347
disappeared in the tunnel?

358
00:21:40.347 --> 00:21:42.347
Another thing I don't understand is

359
00:21:42.347 --> 00:21:45.947
how the kidnapper found out about this communicator.

360
00:21:46.547 --> 00:21:50.747
Officer Sato, I have something I want you to check for me.

361
00:21:50.747 --> 00:21:51.847
Yes, sir.

362
00:23:43.347 --> 00:23:46.647
Strange. Conan's not answering.

363
00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:48.447
I wonder if something's happened.

364
00:23:48.447 --> 00:23:51.347
What? What do you mean something?

365
00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:54.347
I called the Honeybee courier company,

366
00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:57.447
and was told that the whereabouts of all their cars are known!

367
00:23:57.447 --> 00:24:01.047
Could that truck have been stolen?

368
00:24:01.047 --> 00:24:02.147
No.

369
00:24:02.147 --> 00:24:06.747
Does that mean you have no clue where the kidnapper is?

370
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:09.647
Next Conan,

371
00:24:09.647 --> 00:24:13.447
"The Kidnap Car That Disappeared (Part 2)"

372
00:24:14.215 --> 00:24:15.915
Next Conan's Hint:

373
00:24:15.915 --> 00:24:17.615
"PET bottle"

374
00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:19.915
-In the next episode... -It's finally the time for our appearance!

375
00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:21.515
Let's go, Takagi!

376
00:24:21.515 --> 00:24:23.461
It's not that way! This way, Inspector!
