1
00:00:01.524 --> 00:00:03.124
We, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

2
00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:04.524
along with Agasa are invited over

3
00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:08.124
to the house of a couple we met at a camp site to have barbecue.

4
00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:11.724
The couple welcomes us when we get to their home,

5
00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:14.224
and we all have barbecue together.

6
00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:16.624
The couple goes back into the house

7
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.324
saying that the husband's cell phone is nowhere in sight.

8
00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:23.224
The cell phone is found under the bench in the yard.

9
00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.024
When Ayumi goes to deliver the cell phone...

10
00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:33.524
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

11
00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:34.924
I'm gonna kill you!

12
00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:37.724
Hey, Sumika!

13
00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:39.424
Cool it.

14
00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.424
Sumika.

15
00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:47.024
Die!

16
00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:51.724
Bad... bad news!

17
00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:54.424
Those two are at it again!

18
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:57.424
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

19
00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.124
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

20
00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:01.424
she's going to kill him.

21
00:01:01.424 --> 00:01:03.224
-What? -What?

22
00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:05.024
We've got to stop them, quick!

23
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:20.624
At first glance, it looked to be that the husband

24
00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:25.224
accidentally stabbed his wife after they had an argument, but...

25
00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:28.424
But, if that lady makes it,

26
00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:31.524
it's probably thanks to us who came here, right?

27
00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.524
Yes, I guess so.

28
00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:36.224
If back then, the cell phone wasn't found

29
00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:38.924
and Ayumi didn't go to give it to him,

30
00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:41.224
we wouldn't have realized that the two were fighting

31
00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:43.824
and maybe it would've been too late to save her.

32
00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:48.724
Something just doesn't seem right.

33
00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:51.024
Everything's moving too smoothly.

34
00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:54.324
Like something's being manipulated.

35
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:00.124
Oh, mail.

36
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:03.724
That's Mrs. Konno's cell phone that we found a while ago, right?

37
00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.424
-Yep. -Let me see it.

38
00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:13.024
No, you shouldn't read other people's mail without permission.

39
00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:15.324
This is...

40
00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:16.924
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

41
00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:20.624
The husband was saying that his wife sent mails saying, "Die, thief"

42
00:02:20.624 --> 00:02:24.124
to the women that sent him suspicious mails, right?

43
00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:27.524
Yes, but there's nothing like that here.

44
00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:29.524
It does seem that she was irritated

45
00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.024
because she wasn't feeling good, though.

46
00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:36.224
I see! That's why that cup was over there!

47
00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:39.624
She wasn't feeling good, that is, she was feeling sick, right?

48
00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:43.024
It looked like the lady was about to drink medicine.

49
00:02:43.024 --> 00:02:47.024
Because I found a glass cup with water inside in the kitchen!

50
00:02:47.024 --> 00:02:49.624
Glass cup with water?

51
00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:52.324
Then, did you find medicine nearby too?

52
00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:56.424
No. The only other thing there was a sugar container.

53
00:02:56.424 --> 00:03:01.724
I was about to bring that water to the lady, but...

54
00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:07.424
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:10.024
Maybe you're the one who needs medicine, Genta.

56
00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.424
Could it be that you have a cold?

57
00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:17.624
No. My nose feels ticklish.

58
00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:20.024
I can't stop...

59
00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:23.724
Then, why don't you try holding the space below your nose

60
00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:25.924
with your index finger and blocking off your nostrils?

61
00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:27.824
Like this?

62
00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:31.624
If that doesn't work, pinch your nose.

63
00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:32.924
It stopped!

64
00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:36.224
Well, it's something like a lucky spell.

65
00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.224
Lucky spell...

66
00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:41.224
Don't tell me it's...

67
00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:47.524
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

68
00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:52.724
The vivid colored memories of summer

69
00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:54.924
solve mysteries all season round.

70
00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:56.824
A couple's brawl is the cause of the case?

71
00:03:56.824 --> 00:03:59.224
The feelings of the two that have gone astray.

72
00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:00.824
He sees through the one and only truth.

73
00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.924
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

74
00:04:02.924 --> 00:04:05.224
His name is Detective Conan!

75
00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:57.965
"Not Even a Millimeter of Forgiveness (Part 2)"

76
00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:00.665
Lucky spell...

77
00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:03.465
Don't tell me that...

78
00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.465
Don't tell me that he used it and attacked his wife.

79
00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:15.965
But there's no proof at all to prove that for now.

80
00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:19.165
The only thing we have to go on is his wife's testimony.

81
00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:20.965
Hey.

82
00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:23.465
Something's shining.

83
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:24.365
What?

84
00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:27.065
I just happened to take a video

85
00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:30.865
of when Ayumi went to deliver the cell phone, you see.

86
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.165
Bad news!

87
00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:34.865
Those two are at it again!

88
00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:37.665
I tell you. Not again. Let them be.

89
00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:38.765
It's after this.

90
00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.365
But the wife is holding a knife saying,

91
00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:43.065
she's going to kill him.

92
00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.365
Here.

93
00:06:45.365 --> 00:06:49.465
The lamp on Ayumi's cell phone is on, see?

94
00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:51.965
Yeah.

95
00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:55.065
Maybe it's the telephone answering service?

96
00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:59.265
He said that he called his wife from this cell phone,

97
00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:01.565
so it just may be here.

98
00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:04.065
The little clue that may serve as a lead

99
00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:05.665
to the trick of Mrs. Konno being stabbed.

100
00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:08.865
This is the answering service.

101
00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.565
There is one new message for you.

102
00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:15.865
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

103
00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:17.765
I'm gonna kill you!

104
00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:19.465
Hey, Sumika.

105
00:07:19.465 --> 00:07:21.065
Cool it.

106
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:22.065
Sumika.

107
00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:24.165
Die!

108
00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:28.465
Did it stop?

109
00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:31.365
To listen to this message again...

110
00:07:31.365 --> 00:07:34.065
What does that last phrase mean?

111
00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.065
It was Mrs. Konno's voice, wasn't it?

112
00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:39.765
If I'm not mistaken, she said "Did it stop", didn't she?

113
00:07:39.765 --> 00:07:41.865
Just as I thought.

114
00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:44.965
This is not self-defense.

115
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:46.865
He took advantage of his wife's personality,

116
00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:49.165
and tried to kill her.

117
00:07:49.165 --> 00:07:50.665
Unaware at all that doing so,

118
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:53.865
would result in a situation so disastrous.

119
00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.165
"Surgery in progress"

120
00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:15.165
"Surgery in progress"

121
00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:17.465
The lamp turned off!

122
00:08:17.465 --> 00:08:19.965
It seems the surgery has finished!

123
00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:25.665
Sumika!

124
00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:30.065
And, how did the surgery go?

125
00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.665
Just fine!

126
00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:34.465
The pulmonary artery was a bit damaged,

127
00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:37.165
but since the treatment right after she was stabbed was appropriate,

128
00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:38.765
it saved her life.

129
00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:41.265
She should be discharged in a few weeks.

130
00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.965
-All right! -All right!

131
00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:46.765
-Thank you very much. -Not at all.

132
00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:48.465
Thank you very much.

133
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:53.465
I've already reported to the police

134
00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.965
that this was an accident as a result of a brawl.

135
00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:57.065
I understand.

136
00:08:57.065 --> 00:09:02.765
Please tell the officers that will be here in a while the details, too.

137
00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:05.865
Although it's an accident, no doubt it's a serious incident, you see.

138
00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.765
I know.

139
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:09.465
Well, after she recovers,

140
00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:12.165
I'm sure your wife will be questioned too.

141
00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:14.865
At any rate, please watch yourselves when fighting with each other.

142
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:17.365
Yes. Thank you very much.

143
00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:19.065
Take care.

144
00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:27.065
Relief, guilt and fear.

145
00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:31.065
If so, the next action that'll be taken is...

146
00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:35.965
To spit it all out to the police

147
00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:39.465
or flee from here.

148
00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:41.065
Or...

149
00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:44.665
What?

150
00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:48.165
You were at the site where the wife was stabbed, too?

151
00:09:48.165 --> 00:09:51.565
Yeah, although we didn't see her get stabbed.

152
00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:54.265
Ayumi saw her before she got stabbed though.

153
00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:55.365
Yep.

154
00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:58.465
Because I found the cell phone that Mr. Konno was looking for,

155
00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.965
and went to deliver it to where they both were.

156
00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:03.765
Then I saw Mrs. Konno was holding a knife...

157
00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:06.765
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

158
00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:09.165
I'm gonna kill you!

159
00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:10.365
I see.

160
00:10:10.365 --> 00:10:12.665
After hearing about it from Ayumi,

161
00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:14.965
we rushed over to see Mrs. Konno

162
00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:19.065
lying on the floor with a knife stabbed into her!

163
00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:21.265
I see, I see.

164
00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:23.165
I guess the husband stabbed her

165
00:10:23.165 --> 00:10:25.465
while they were fighting with each other.

166
00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:28.465
And where's her husband now?

167
00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:32.165
Huh? He was here till just a while ago.

168
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:35.865
Come to think of it, Conan and Ai aren't here either.

169
00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:38.365
True. I wonder where they went?

170
00:10:38.365 --> 00:10:40.965
Maybe to the restroom or something?

171
00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:51.057
"Beika General Hospital"

172
00:11:04.157 --> 00:11:06.157
Are you going to run for it?

173
00:11:07.457 --> 00:11:10.557
After doing what you did to your wife,

174
00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:13.957
I'm asking you if you alone plan to cross over!

175
00:11:16.057 --> 00:11:17.857
Just what're you talking about?

176
00:11:17.857 --> 00:11:21.757
I just came out to this roof to get some fresh air,

177
00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:25.957
relieved that my wife was saved.

178
00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:28.357
So, cut out your silly remark

179
00:11:28.357 --> 00:11:30.257
and go back to where everyone else is.

180
00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:34.757
I'll bet you're planning to jump off after we leave, right?

181
00:11:36.057 --> 00:11:37.757
Is it because after your wife recovers

182
00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:39.857
and is interrogated by the police,

183
00:11:39.857 --> 00:11:41.757
the truth will come to light?

184
00:11:41.757 --> 00:11:45.157
The truth that you were planning to kill her to begin with?

185
00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:49.157
See, that look on your face.

186
00:11:49.157 --> 00:11:52.957
You had the same look on your face when you heard from the doctor

187
00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:56.457
about the police interrogation a while ago.

188
00:11:56.457 --> 00:11:59.557
When you heard that your wife was saved,

189
00:11:59.557 --> 00:12:01.357
tears flowed from your eyes,

190
00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:03.457
but you were wearing a look of relief.

191
00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:06.257
When you heard again that your wife was in critical condition,

192
00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:08.457
you looked down and away

193
00:12:08.457 --> 00:12:12.257
because of your feeling of guilt of having done something seriously bad.

194
00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:15.257
After your wife's recovery,

195
00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:17.457
to think that the entire truth would come to light,

196
00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:22.057
you closed your lips tightly and opened your eyes wide,

197
00:12:22.057 --> 00:12:24.057
this was the look of hidden fear.

198
00:12:24.057 --> 00:12:27.657
If you unfortunately stabbed your wife in self-defense,

199
00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:29.457
you wouldn't be wearing such a look.

200
00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.957
Such a look...

201
00:12:31.957 --> 00:12:35.357
Your friend saw it too, right?

202
00:12:35.357 --> 00:12:37.957
My wife flung up the knife to attack me

203
00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:40.857
saying that she was going to kill me!

204
00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:43.557
I had no other choice but to do so,

205
00:12:43.557 --> 00:12:45.757
in order to save myself.

206
00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:47.957
I had no other choice!

207
00:12:47.957 --> 00:12:51.157
-Your wife didn't try to kill you. -What?

208
00:12:51.157 --> 00:12:53.957
She was just trying to shock you.

209
00:12:53.957 --> 00:12:56.957
Shock me? Why?

210
00:12:56.957 --> 00:13:00.357
-Because it didn't stop. -What?

211
00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:03.457
Your hiccups!

212
00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:06.557
Hiccups, to stop it?

213
00:13:06.557 --> 00:13:09.557
That's why she flung up the knife,

214
00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:12.057
saying that she was going to kill me?

215
00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:16.757
That's ridiculous.

216
00:13:16.757 --> 00:13:20.357
You know her well too, don't you, your wife's personality?

217
00:13:20.357 --> 00:13:22.057
Last Christmas,

218
00:13:22.057 --> 00:13:24.757
she wore the reindeer outfit because you didn't accept her

219
00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:27.857
wearing the mini skirt Santa outfit.

220
00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:30.857
She tried to delight us by welcoming us,

221
00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:34.457
wearing a Halloween outfit, despite it being way past the date.

222
00:13:34.457 --> 00:13:35.657
She's the type that would go all the way

223
00:13:35.657 --> 00:13:36.757
without thinking of the consequences

224
00:13:36.757 --> 00:13:39.457
if she thinks it'll please someone.

225
00:13:39.457 --> 00:13:40.957
Being the of her nature,

226
00:13:40.957 --> 00:13:44.557
if she sees you having trouble because your hiccups wouldn't stop,

227
00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:45.957
it's really easy to assume that she would go all the way,

228
00:13:45.957 --> 00:13:48.757
no matter how distasteful, to shock you,

229
00:13:48.757 --> 00:13:51.757
in order to try to make it stop!

230
00:13:51.757 --> 00:13:54.757
If you are hiccupping while trying to place a phone call

231
00:13:54.757 --> 00:13:56.557
to your superior at the company,

232
00:13:56.557 --> 00:13:57.957
and the more so, if she goes into the kitchen

233
00:13:57.957 --> 00:14:01.557
and sees a fruit knife there!

234
00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:04.657
Well, there seems to have been a cup with water in it

235
00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:08.057
and a sugar container in the kitchen,

236
00:14:08.057 --> 00:14:10.957
so your wife seems to have thought of other ways

237
00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:13.357
to stop your hiccups, too.

238
00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:14.857
Sugar?

239
00:14:14.857 --> 00:14:18.557
There's a not too well known method of stopping hiccups

240
00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:22.657
by shoving a spoonful of sugar down your throat too, you know.

241
00:14:22.657 --> 00:14:25.757
In Japan, the well known method is

242
00:14:25.757 --> 00:14:28.657
to make a person drink water or shock the person.

243
00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:31.957
In other words, the trick that you set up is as follows.

244
00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:36.557
First, you hinted that your cell phone is nowhere in sight,

245
00:14:36.557 --> 00:14:40.457
in front of all of us that you invited over to have barbecue with.

246
00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:43.257
Then you set it up so that your wife gets irritated

247
00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.857
and that leads to a brawl.

248
00:14:45.857 --> 00:14:50.057
Then, in order to make your wife help you look for the cell phone,

249
00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:51.957
you lure her into the living room

250
00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:56.257
and pretend to find your cell phone that you hid under the sofa.

251
00:14:56.257 --> 00:14:58.157
You tell her that you want to make a call to your superior

252
00:14:58.157 --> 00:15:00.757
because you didn't receive any mail from him.

253
00:15:00.757 --> 00:15:02.957
Which after, you pretended to have the hiccups

254
00:15:02.957 --> 00:15:05.757
and set her up.

255
00:15:05.757 --> 00:15:08.057
After telling her that you want to make a call to the Department Head,

256
00:15:08.057 --> 00:15:10.957
but your hiccups won't stop.

257
00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:14.457
Then you confirmed that your wife got hold of the knife

258
00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:16.157
just as you expected,

259
00:15:16.157 --> 00:15:18.757
and rang your wife's cell phone

260
00:15:18.757 --> 00:15:21.757
that you hid under the barbecue bench beforehand.

261
00:15:21.757 --> 00:15:24.057
You wanted anybody among us

262
00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.057
who came to deliver the cell phone to the living room,

263
00:15:26.057 --> 00:15:31.157
to witness your wife coming at you with a knife.

264
00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:32.857
This way, even if it were that you snatched the knife away from her,

265
00:15:32.857 --> 00:15:34.757
and stabbed her instead,

266
00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:38.557
it would look as if your wife who was irritated at you, tried to kill you,

267
00:15:38.557 --> 00:15:42.757
so having no choice, you stabbed her in self-defense!

268
00:15:42.757 --> 00:15:44.157
Well, ironically though,

269
00:15:44.157 --> 00:15:47.757
on your wife's cell phone that you rang in order to acquire a witness,

270
00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:49.657
the recording that serves as proof of this,

271
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:52.657
was clearly left behind on her answer phone.

272
00:15:52.657 --> 00:15:55.557
There is one new message.

273
00:15:57.357 --> 00:16:00.357
I'm not forgiving you anymore!

274
00:16:00.357 --> 00:16:01.857
I'm gonna kill you!

275
00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:04.057
Hey, Sumika.

276
00:16:04.057 --> 00:16:05.557
Cool it.

277
00:16:05.557 --> 00:16:06.557
Sumika.

278
00:16:06.557 --> 00:16:08.857
Die!

279
00:16:11.357 --> 00:16:12.757
Did it stop?

280
00:16:18.157 --> 00:16:21.557
But even without this answer phone recording,

281
00:16:21.557 --> 00:16:23.657
once your wife recovers,

282
00:16:23.657 --> 00:16:26.557
I'm sure she would testify the truth for you.

283
00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:31.057
I told you, didn't I?

284
00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:34.057
That I was on the verge of a break up with my wife.

285
00:16:34.057 --> 00:16:36.857
I was able to take it till just a while ago

286
00:16:36.857 --> 00:16:38.657
and the way she used to get carried away

287
00:16:38.657 --> 00:16:40.557
even if it was distasteful was cute.

288
00:16:40.557 --> 00:16:45.657
But recently, she's really constantly been irritated,

289
00:16:45.657 --> 00:16:48.657
saying things like, "I'm fatigued, tired or sleepy."

290
00:16:48.657 --> 00:16:50.857
She neglected doing house chores

291
00:16:50.857 --> 00:16:53.057
and threw up the food that I made.

292
00:16:53.057 --> 00:16:55.557
These are all true.

293
00:16:55.557 --> 00:17:00.657
But I did have my doubts about

294
00:17:00.657 --> 00:17:03.657
whether to go through with this murder.

295
00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:07.657
Until I heard those words come out of my wife's mouth...

296
00:17:07.657 --> 00:17:10.657
Yes! I sent mail after mail to all the girls

297
00:17:10.657 --> 00:17:12.657
that were sending you suspicious mails!

298
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.057
"Die, you thief" I wrote!

299
00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:23.257
I thought something was strange.

300
00:17:23.257 --> 00:17:25.757
Because I completely stopped getting invitations from my friends

301
00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:30.157
who used to ask me to go to the beach or mountains with them.

302
00:17:30.157 --> 00:17:32.757
Even the woman subordinate at the company who mailed me

303
00:17:32.757 --> 00:17:34.657
saying she had something she wanted to discuss with me,

304
00:17:34.657 --> 00:17:38.357
suddenly quit the company and I haven't heard from her since.

305
00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:42.357
I was totally fed up already

306
00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:45.457
of that woman who thought only about herself!

307
00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:50.157
But, what a fool I am.

308
00:17:50.157 --> 00:17:53.757
Despite having stabbed her, being that she's my wife,

309
00:17:53.757 --> 00:17:57.057
I found myself praying that I don't want her to die!

310
00:17:57.057 --> 00:17:59.957
Knowing that if she makes it through, it's all over for me.

311
00:17:59.957 --> 00:18:03.657
Yeah, you're a fool.

312
00:18:03.657 --> 00:18:05.457
Look!

313
00:18:05.457 --> 00:18:09.757
This is the mail that your wife sent to your woman friends.

314
00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:12.657
What she really wrote.

315
00:18:12.657 --> 00:18:14.757
What she really wrote?

316
00:18:18.657 --> 00:18:21.857
Thank you for always inviting my husband

317
00:18:21.857 --> 00:18:23.657
to go to the beach and mountains.

318
00:18:23.657 --> 00:18:28.657
Only, my husband's blood type is AB, RH minus,

319
00:18:28.657 --> 00:18:33.157
so please take care that he doesn't hurt himself seriously.

320
00:18:39.757 --> 00:18:42.457
Thank you always for taking care of my husband.

321
00:18:42.457 --> 00:18:44.757
If you have something to discuss with my husband,

322
00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:47.657
why not come over to our home?

323
00:18:47.657 --> 00:18:48.757
Although I may not be of much help,

324
00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.057
maybe as a woman who is older than you,

325
00:18:51.057 --> 00:18:53.757
I could help in one way or another.

326
00:18:56.957 --> 00:18:58.657
Sumika.

327
00:19:01.257 --> 00:19:04.757
Your friends stopped inviting you to go to the beach and mountains

328
00:19:04.757 --> 00:19:07.357
because they were worried about your body.

329
00:19:07.357 --> 00:19:11.657
The subordinate woman didn't discuss things over with you

330
00:19:11.657 --> 00:19:15.457
was because she had some ulterior motive, wasn't it?

331
00:19:15.457 --> 00:19:19.257
Anything a woman could want to talk to you about without your wife knowing

332
00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:21.857
wouldn't be anything good anyway.

333
00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:25.357
Besides, you probably got it all wrong.

334
00:19:25.357 --> 00:19:27.357
Got it all wrong?

335
00:19:27.357 --> 00:19:29.757
Irritable, tires easily,

336
00:19:29.757 --> 00:19:33.057
gets sleepy, fatigued, and nauseated...

337
00:19:33.057 --> 00:19:36.257
These are all early signs of pregnancy!

338
00:19:36.257 --> 00:19:38.157
What?

339
00:19:38.157 --> 00:19:42.357
Your wife was probably lightly dressed because of this, too.

340
00:19:42.357 --> 00:19:44.257
Since they are people who get feverish

341
00:19:44.257 --> 00:19:48.557
due to the increase of the female hormone during pregnancy.

342
00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:51.857
It seems that your wife doesn't know of this yet, though.

343
00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:55.457
By the way,

344
00:19:55.457 --> 00:19:59.157
I was watching your facial expression after the surgery

345
00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:02.757
to decide whether you were really relieved that your wife was saved,

346
00:20:02.757 --> 00:20:07.057
and whether you really regretted having stabbed her.

347
00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:10.457
Well, as for me,

348
00:20:10.457 --> 00:20:16.757
no matter how relieved or apologetic you are,

349
00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:19.957
I wouldn't be able to forgive you even a millimeter

350
00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:23.957
because I wouldn't want to make the baby who is about to be born,

351
00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.957
the child of a murder who was about to kill his wife

352
00:20:25.957 --> 00:20:28.457
because of a stupid misunderstanding.

353
00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:32.657
At any rate, for today, I'll explain it to the police

354
00:20:32.657 --> 00:20:34.657
and deceive them in your favor,

355
00:20:34.657 --> 00:20:36.257
so make sure that when your wife recovers,

356
00:20:36.257 --> 00:20:38.057
you apologize to her from the bottom of your heart,

357
00:20:38.057 --> 00:20:41.157
and talk over what you'd like to do in the future.

358
00:20:51.857 --> 00:20:54.157
"Several days later" -Then, just as your husband...

359
00:20:54.157 --> 00:20:56.757
and Conan had said, back at the time of the incident,

360
00:20:56.757 --> 00:20:59.657
you, in order to stop your husband's hiccups,

361
00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:02.157
flung up a knife in an attempt to shock him,

362
00:21:02.157 --> 00:21:04.957
and got into a fight with your husband who thought you were serious,

363
00:21:04.957 --> 00:21:07.257
and was stabbed instead?

364
00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:11.357
Yes. I guess my acting looked very real.

365
00:21:11.357 --> 00:21:15.557
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused.

366
00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:16.757
No problem.

367
00:21:16.757 --> 00:21:18.457
Well then, we'll take care of this case

368
00:21:18.457 --> 00:21:20.657
by just giving you a strict warning, this time.

369
00:21:20.657 --> 00:21:23.657
Please take care not to take things too far when fighting.

370
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.657
-Thank you very much. -Thank you very much.

371
00:21:25.657 --> 00:21:28.257
Goodbye, then.

372
00:21:28.257 --> 00:21:30.457
Thank you so much.

373
00:21:34.857 --> 00:21:39.257
Listen. Keep your word with me, okay?

374
00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:40.757
Yeah.

375
00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:42.457
No flirting!

376
00:21:42.457 --> 00:21:45.557
Make sure you eat dinner at home!

377
00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:46.957
I know.

378
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:50.457
And, if you ever do the same thing again,

379
00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:53.057
I won't hesitate to counterattack.

380
00:21:53.057 --> 00:21:55.357
So, keep that in mind.

381
00:21:56.657 --> 00:21:59.057
Okay, Daddy?

382
00:22:01.657 --> 00:22:03.357
Yep!

383
00:23:27.357 --> 00:23:30.257
But, what a surprise! That lady...

384
00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:34.057
Yeah! Who would've thought she was trying to stop hiccups!

385
00:23:34.057 --> 00:23:36.157
But she's taking it too far, don't you think?

386
00:23:36.157 --> 00:23:38.857
I guess so.

387
00:23:38.857 --> 00:23:41.557
Isn't that the lady's husband?

388
00:23:47.657 --> 00:23:49.957
He's buying a lot of toys.

389
00:23:49.957 --> 00:23:54.457
I don't think they know whether it's a boy or girl yet though.

390
00:23:54.457 --> 00:23:56.157
Talk about a doting parent.

391
00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:06.257
I can't forgive even a millimeter yet, though.

392
00:24:06.257 --> 00:24:07.757
Come on...

393
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:10.857
"Next Episode"

394
00:24:10.857 --> 00:24:13.157
-Are you Mr. Mouri? -What?

395
00:24:13.157 --> 00:24:15.557
I heard about you from Nagisa.

396
00:24:15.557 --> 00:24:17.657
Okay! Shall we go then?

397
00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:19.757
Don't!

398
00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:21.957
An atmospheric depression is closing in.

399
00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:25.657
Nagisa!

400
00:24:25.657 --> 00:24:27.857
This is probably homicide.

401
00:24:27.857 --> 00:24:30.857
But the only footprints around the corpse

402
00:24:30.857 --> 00:24:34.057
are ours, who came running over.

403
00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:39.557
Next Conan, "A Sandy Beach Without Footprints"

404
00:24:55.257 --> 00:24:57.357
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:57.357 --> 00:24:59.857
"Surfboard"

406
00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:02.257
-I'd like to eat a little more meat. -You can't!

407
00:25:02.257 --> 00:25:04.357
He's not going to get a millimetre close to having his way here either.
