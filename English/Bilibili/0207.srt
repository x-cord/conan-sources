1
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,040
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,640
And step into the essence with strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Be attentive today and listen well,

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,540
because it is a unique mystery that can be experienced only with Conan.

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,940
His name is Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:59,999
"An Overly Superb Deduction"

9
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,899
"Beika Station"

10
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,299
Hey, Ran.

11
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,999
Walk a little slower, will you?

12
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,899
I tell you. Since it is a hassle having to pick you up,

13
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,099
if you have to drink, don't go and drink on the other side of the station!

14
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,499
Well, well.

15
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,899
Talk about hopelessness.

16
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,299
From 20:00 to 22:00, all you can eat, all you can drink, it says.

17
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,599
You're always going for ads like that!

18
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,799
What do you mean?

19
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,799
I got to eat three times the amount I paid

20
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,099
and drank five times the price, too.

21
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,799
Hey, stop throwing things! Go home!

22
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,299
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

23
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,999
Just what do you think you're doing?

24
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,099
Let me go, Nakamoto!

25
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,399
Shut up!

26
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,999
What shall we do, dad?

27
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,499
We can't ignore them, can we?

28
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,199
I'll go stop them.

29
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,099
Dad. Let me go and handle it.

30
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,599
They'll be fine.

31
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,599
They always fight like that.

32
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,899
But the next minute, they'll be smiling at each other and make up.

33
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:12,999
Right?

34
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,999
That's a good boy.

35
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,999
I worried for nothing.

36
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,999
Let's go home!

37
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,499
Hey, dad! Wait for me! You've got to watch your step.

38
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,599
Come on, get a hold of yourself.

39
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,699
Something bothered me,

40
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,999
so I went to check the apartment out the following morning.

41
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:41,599
We'll get the details after the autopsy,

42
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,899
but the estimated time of death is between 22:00 to 23:00 last night.

43
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,099
You're joking, right?

44
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,299
-Not you again! -Well, you see.

45
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,499
Then, how else would you explain this?

46
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:01,299
Inspector Megure, it's just as Mr. Mouri says.

47
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,599
The residents of the apartment also heard them.

48
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,099
It seems that at the time in question, a man called Nakamoto

49
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,099
was having a heated argument with the victim, Mr. Irie.

50
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,699
And who is the guy called Nakamoto?

51
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,999
I... I'll go check!

52
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,399
To think that a detective as renowned as Kogoro Mouri

53
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,299
was not able to stop a murder that happened right before his eyes.

54
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:25,399
I'm truly ashamed.

55
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,499
Darn it!

56
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,299
Only if that old man who was taking a walk didn't say what he did,

57
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,399
I would've gone in to stop them!

58
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:42,999
Please help me, Mr. Mouri!

59
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:47,099
I used to be a member of the Beika University

60
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,099
physics research lab together with the victim Irie.

61
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,399
My name is Nakamoto.

62
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,099
-What? -Nakamoto?

63
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,599
What?

64
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,699
You're the one who killed him last night?

65
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:59,999
No!

66
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,099
I was summoned by the police for testimony but didn't do anything.

67
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,399
I didn't go to Irie's room last night.

68
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,799
Please believe me.

69
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:18,999
Listen, we definitely heard you arguing with the man who was killed.

70
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,499
So, what do you mean by you didn't go there?

71
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,099
A tape!

72
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,799
Somebody recorded it on tape to make it look like I went there.

73
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,599
What?

74
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,199
Made it looks like you were there?

75
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,999
Yes.

76
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,799
Irie set the time and probably pressed the play button.

77
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,999
Hey, stop throwing things! Go home!

78
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,599
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

79
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,899
You mean he acted it all out alone?

80
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:56,399
Yes, he was creating my alibi.

81
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,999
Alibi?

82
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,699
For what purpose?

83
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,599
He snuck into the house of our mentor, Professor Demura...

84
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,599
In order to murder him!

85
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,699
What?

86
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,199
The professor is secretly selling

87
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,399
the fruit of our research off to businesses.

88
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:20,899
Even if we were to file charges against him, he has tremendous authority,

89
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,399
and we'd be ousted.

90
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,499
That's why...

91
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,599
we decided to break into his house when his family was away

92
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,699
and make it look like a case of robbery and homicide.

93
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,099
But, it didn't work out as planned.

94
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,999
We snuck in, but the professor wasn't home.

95
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,199
I waited one hour, but he didn't come home.

96
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,199
So, I eventually gave up.

97
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,899
I went to the professor's house at 22:00

98
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,899
and left at 23:00.

99
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,299
If what you're telling us is true,

100
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,299
you could not have killed Mr. Takayuki Irie.

101
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:03,599
But the professor seems to have testified that he was doing some writing

102
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,999
in his study all last night, and never left his home.

103
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:12,099
That sure is strange.

104
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,099
Yes, don't know why the professor is lying.

105
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,799
But, if things go as is I'll end up being a murderer!

106
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:24,599
I wonder why the police let you, who happens to be a prime suspect go.

107
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,399
I heard at the station that you, the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri,

108
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,499
was also nearby the scene of the crime last night.

109
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,499
This is probably no coincidence,

110
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,999
please I beg you, help me.

111
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:39,999
It's true that I am not totally uninvolved in this case, but...

112
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,099
So, you don't believe me either, do you, Mr. Mouri?

113
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,899
If only I can find that recorded tape.

114
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,699
Are you sure there really is something like that, to begin with?

115
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,299
I was told that there was no such tape anywhere in Irie's house.

116
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:59,799
I'm sure the killer took it with him.

117
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:04,199
If that cannot be found, the killer can frame me!

118
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,499
What shall I do?

119
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:08,599
I'm sure that the killer has gotten rid of the tape by now, too.

120
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,599
Dad, why don't you at least try searching for the tape?

121
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,599
If you solve this case,

122
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,599
you'll regain your reputation again, won't you, Pops?

123
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:26,099
Regain my reputation? Okay, why not?

124
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,499
There is only one way in and out of the apartment.

125
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:34,699
The exit after the crime was committed...

126
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,199
is this street which leads to the station.

127
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,899
The killer is sure to have wanted to get rid of the tape

128
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,199
which would serve as evidence as soon as possible.

129
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,199
Wait! Wait up! That trash!

130
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,999
What is it?

131
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:00,099
It can't be. This is too close.

132
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,999
I found it!

133
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,499
That's the tape!

134
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,999
Talk about duck soup!

135
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,099
Thank you for your cooperation.

136
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,899
Officer Takagi!

137
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,299
I'll take the evidence.

138
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:19,299
So, they were keeping watch over the prime suspect.

139
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,699
Wait.

140
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,499
You re not going to take that tape with you, just like that, are you?

141
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,599
Go home? What do you mean to go home, you bastard?

142
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,899
This is the same remark we heard last night.

143
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,099
Right, Conan?

144
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,099
Yes.

145
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,999
I see.

146
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,099
Now, it's been proved.

147
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,299
Mr. Nakamoto is not lying!

148
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:48,899
I'm glad. I've finally found someone who believes me.

149
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,199
But l wonder why the professor lied.

150
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,899
You can say that again.

151
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,199
I wouldn't have been suspected at all

152
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,899
if the professor didn't lie in the first place!

153
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,699
That's just it. He wanted to set you up as the suspect!

154
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:08,699
But what advantage would the professor have doing something like that?

155
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,599
It could be that the professor

156
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:17,699
was somewhere he didn't want anyone to know.

157
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,499
Could it be that he was on his way to kill Mr. Irie?

158
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,699
That's a possibility, but...

159
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,599
That's not possible!

160
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:35,699
It'd be a different story if he knew about our plan.

161
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,799
We planned everything out in lrie's room.

162
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,899
The professor couldn't have even eavesdropped on us!

163
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,499
Eavesdrop? That could be possible.

164
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,399
Is this the screws of the lid are loose?

165
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,499
It's probably in here.

166
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,499
Is that right? I see. Thank you.

167
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:04,099
There seems to have been evidence of a wiretap being set, after all?

168
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,399
So, now we know.

169
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,699
Although Professor Demura had been making money

170
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,799
stealing the research by Irie and Nakamoto,

171
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,699
he became wary that maybe one day you would take revenge.

172
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,299
Therefore, he set up a wiretap to keep track of what you were both doing.

173
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,599
I wonder how he snuck in?

174
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:27,899
If he stole the key from Mr. Irie's locker in the lab,

175
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,699
he could've easily made a spare key, right?

176
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,299
Exactly.

177
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,499
And, while he was tracking your conversation through the wire tap,

178
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,699
he found out of your plan to kill him.

179
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,299
That's when he thought about using the alibi

180
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:49,199
that you had both made up, his advantage.

181
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:52,999
Last night, Mr. Irie went on with his one-man act

182
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,599
of creating the alibi tape as usual at a little past 22:00.

183
00:11:55,599 --> 00:12:00,299
Then the professor sneaks in using the spare key

184
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,399
and kills Mr. Irie.

185
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,299
He then steals the tape,

186
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,899
retrieves the wiretap and leaves the site.

187
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,099
If Mr Irie's body is found,

188
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,599
the police would naturally take it to be a crime

189
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,899
committed by Mr Nakamoto, from the testimonies of the people in the area.

190
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,899
In other words, Professor Demura, after killing Mr. Irie,

191
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,199
set it up so that it would look like

192
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,299
Mr. Nakamoto committed the murder.

193
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,899
Our plan was used to his advantage.

194
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,699
Very skillfully indeed.

195
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,299
But he was unable to fool

196
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,699
the eyes of the top-notch, renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri's eyes.

197
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,699
Hey, hey, what's up, Pops?

198
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:45,499
Your deduction is perfect.

199
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,699
I guess I'm not called for this time.

200
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,799
What are you bragging about?

201
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,099
If you went into Mr. Irie's room last night,

202
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,699
you could've stopped the murder from happening, you know?

203
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,999
Come on, don't say that.

204
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,899
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure that a man

205
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,899
who was walking his dog stopped you from going inside.

206
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,499
Right, only if that old man didn't say what he did.

207
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,499
True, but that old man didn't have any bad intentions either.

208
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:19,699
Don't tell me that...

209
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:23,199
But, if thought of it that way, it is convincing.

210
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,699
Even Pop's superb power of deduction...

211
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:33,988
Okay!

212
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:38,188
So, I guess I'll go tell Inspector Megure of my superb deduction,

213
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,388
in order to regain my reputation!

214
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,888
Not that!

215
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,488
What? What's not that?

216
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:47,688
Well, it's a superb deduction after all,

217
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:49,388
why go all the way out there and tell him about it?

218
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:50,388
Why not have him come here from his side?

219
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,588
It's cooler that way.

220
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:55,288
I guess so.

221
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,488
-Okay! -I'm going to go out play until then.

222
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,088
"Mouri Detective Agency"

223
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:06,288
So, the alibi scheme was used against the very ones who made it up.

224
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:08,888
I see. Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

225
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,488
Well, I'm just being my usual self.

226
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,588
I'm sorry for having suspected you, Mr. Nakamoto.

227
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,288
Don't be, so long as you find out the truth.

228
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:22,688
Besides, I'm still to be charged for sneaking into the professor's house.

229
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:25,288
Well, we'll take care of that later.

230
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:26,588
Officer Takagi.

231
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:30,088
Get an arrest warrant for Professor Demura on the double.

232
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,088
Yes, sir.

233
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:40,688
Please wait for a second, inspector!

234
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:45,888
However, the deduction that I have presented you is just one possibility.

235
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:49,088
The one that the real killer wished the case to look like.

236
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,188
What the real killer wish?

237
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,588
Just what do you mean, Mouri?

238
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,588
Please sit down once again.

239
00:14:56,588 --> 00:15:00,988
What I am about to say from now is the real truth.

240
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:04,388
The testimonies of Mr. Nakamoto and Professor Demura

241
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:05,788
are really different.

242
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:10,588
That is, one of them is lying.

243
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:14,588
At a timelike that, if the tape that Mr. Nakamoto mentioned is found,

244
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:17,788
his testimony would naturally sound to be the truth.

245
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:18,888
On the other hand,

246
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:22,888
suspicion against Professor Demura would grow.

247
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,688
All that needs to be done next,

248
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,188
is to lead the deduction in the preferred direction.

249
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:29,488
And make everybody fall under the illusion

250
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:33,188
that Professor Demura had indeed killed Mr. Irie.

251
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,388
An illusion?

252
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:36,588
Lead the deduction?

253
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:37,688
Are you saying that somebody lead everyone

254
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,088
to think that it happened that way?

255
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,588
It is indeed possible.

256
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,788
As for the recorded tape...

257
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,988
The killer probably got rid of it, too.

258
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:51,688
Because Mr. Nakamoto had mumbled,

259
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:56,088
so I was led to check inside the trash can near the site.

260
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,288
The reason I turned my attention to Professor Demura was because...

261
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:02,688
I wouldn't have been suspected at all

262
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:05,488
if the professor didn't lie in the first place!

263
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:09,788
Mr. Nakamoto said what he did. And...

264
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,288
It could be that the professor

265
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:17,688
was somewhere he didn't want anyone to know he was.

266
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:21,288
From his remark, I was lead to think

267
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:25,288
that maybe Professor Demura had set off to kill Mr. Irie.

268
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,088
Furthermore...

269
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:30,688
The professor couldn't have even eavesdropped on us.

270
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,988
I was lead to imagine a wire tap

271
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:35,688
from his remark "eavesdropping".

272
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,788
In other words, by deliberately casually remarking the things

273
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:42,988
that he did about the essentials,

274
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:45,988
Mr. Nakamoto lead me to deduce

275
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,688
that Professor Demura had committed the crime.

276
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:52,688
That is, I did not make a deduction,

277
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,988
but rather was lead to make a deduction.

278
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,988
By who else, but Mr. Nakamoto himself.

279
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,388
I see.

280
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,188
Needless to mention,

281
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,088
you never snuck into Professor Demura's house.

282
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,888
The one who snuck in when Mr. Irie was putting on his one-man act,

283
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,488
and killed him...

284
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:15,688
is you!

285
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:22,288
Professor Demura was probably in his study just as he said he was.

286
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:26,488
Of course, there was no wiretap, to begin with either.

287
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:31,488
You were the one who loosened the screws of the outlet.

288
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:34,988
Isn't that right, Mr. Nakamoto?

289
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,388
First of all, the story about the recorded tape is strange, to begin with.

290
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:44,388
If it were disposed of last night right after the crime,

291
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,888
it would never have been found.

292
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:51,488
Because the trash of that convenience store is collected daily

293
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:55,388
before dawn by the trash collectors.

294
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,888
However, the tape that wasn't supposed to be there, was found there.

295
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:02,888
Which means the tape was not disposed of last night, but rather, today

296
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:05,588
after the trash collectors came.

297
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:09,588
If the tape is taken away, you wouldn't have been able to lead us to it.

298
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,288
Right, Mr. Nakamoto?

299
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,988
You have no evidence of anything, Mr. Mouri.

300
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:20,088
That's all mere paper plans that detectives are known to be good at.

301
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,288
This is no paper plan.

302
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:25,888
Unfortunately, Mr. Nakamoto, there is a witness.

303
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,388
A witness?

304
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:36,088
I was asked to come here a while ago by Conan.

305
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:39,388
I asked him to ask you to come here.

306
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:44,788
So, Mr. Nakamoto had to figure out who he would let make the deduction.

307
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:50,788
And that person had to be someone that the police would listen to.

308
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:57,988
So, you turned your attention to me, the renowned detective, Kogoro Mouri.

309
00:18:57,988 --> 00:19:00,688
But, you were worried that I may turn you down

310
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,188
if you came to me just like that.

311
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:07,088
To make sure that I would listen to you,

312
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:11,188
you deliberately got me involved

313
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:13,088
by setting me up as a witness.

314
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,588
How?

315
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,988
Knowing that I love to drink,

316
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:21,788
you left an ad for an all you can eat and drink

317
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:25,488
between 20:00 to 22:00 in my post box.

318
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:29,488
I see. Mouri would undoubtedly fall for it.

319
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:33,388
Therefore, I would pass by Mr. Irie's apartment

320
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,988
after 22:00 on my way home.

321
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:39,888
But, in order to get the timing right,

322
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:45,688
Irie probably started his one-man act after confirming us passing by.

323
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,988
He had no way of knowing that he was going to be murdered,

324
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:49,588
so he did just as planned.

325
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:55,988
But, then why is Azusa from the restaurant below a witness?

326
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,288
That's because...

327
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:04,288
Nakamoto, you put this ad in the post box yesterday morning, didn't you?

328
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,388
She saw you do so.

329
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:11,288
How about it, Azusa? Are you sure it was him?

330
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,688
Yes. He's the one.

331
00:20:13,688 --> 00:20:16,288
When I came to the shop in the morning,

332
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:19,888
he was putting a red ad sheet in the mailbox.

333
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,688
I think it was the same as that one over there.

334
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:27,388
Your fingerprints would most naturally be found on the ad if checked for.

335
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:29,488
That ad was only distributed

336
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,988
on the other side of the station in the first place.

337
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:37,388
Why did you have to go out of your way to put that ad in my mailbox,

338
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:38,688
Nakamoto?

339
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:46,088
And I thought everything worked out perfect.

340
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,688
How did you figure everything out?

341
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,288
When did you suspect me?

342
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:51,588
You just talked too much.

343
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:55,188
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure

344
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:59,388
that a man who was walking his dog stopped you from going inside.

345
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,688
I told the inspector that a man taking a walk,

346
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:07,788
but I didn't give him the details about the old man walking his dog.

347
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,088
I probably would've given him more details

348
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,288
if no witness was found, though.

349
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:16,288
What a klutz I am.

350
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:19,688
If I went in there and stopped you both from fighting,

351
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,688
everything would go down the drain.

352
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:26,088
So, you kept me from going into the room.

353
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:30,288
The old man who was walking the dog was you, wasn't it?

354
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,988
I was right after all.

355
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:39,288
Mr. Mouri, you are a renowned detective after all.

356
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:42,688
No, rather you are too renowned.

357
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:21,088
In the battle for the rights and fame

358
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,788
of the research they were developing,

359
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:26,088
Mr. Nakamoto deceived his colleague, Mr. Irie,

360
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,888
and eventually killed him.

361
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:30,488
He then tried to frame Professor Demura as the killer

362
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:32,888
and take everything for himself.

363
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,488
"Mouri"

364
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:38,188
Another ad. What's this?

365
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,888
Starting tomorrow, 3 days sale of beer all you can drink?

366
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:44,288
Come on. Dad, what's the matter with you?

367
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,688
Give it back!

368
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,188
If I drink cheap liquor, it'll help with the household budget, won't it?

369
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:50,388
Stop drinking before saying something like that.

370
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,688
But I promise I won't do anything stupid again.

371
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:56,888
Hey, hey, don't you ever get fed up, or what?

372
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:02,488
"Next Episode"

373
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:05,788
Dr. Agasa, call the police and an ambulance!

374
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:11,188
Could it be a code or something?

375
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:13,588
We're sharing the treasure, understand?

376
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:16,188
This is bad. Don't tell me that this is...

377
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,888
Dr. Agasa, call the police right away!

378
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:22,988
They went to the killer who pushed the car over the cliff a while ago.

379
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,188
Next Conan,

380
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:28,509
"Great Fall From Mt. Ryujin"

381
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,306
Next Conan's Hint:

382
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,506
"The Traces of A Slip"

383
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,306
It's me, I'm the one who will solve the case.

384
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:36,606
It seems that Mitsuhiko will be playing a major role in the next episode.

385
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:38,006
No way!
