1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.640
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.540
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.540
Sonoko makes an appearance after a long absence today.

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.640
A man and crime at the skating rink.

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.999
"Dying Message Revives (Part 1)"

10
00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.599
There they are!

11
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.199
More and more of them!

12
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.399
Loads and loads of good-looking men!

13
00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.699
Take a look at all of them!

14
00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.699
Look at all those choices of good-looking men.

15
00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.899
We've got big catch.

16
00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.099
Hey, Sonoko.

17
00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.399
Sonoko! What about Mr. Kyogoku?

18
00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.499
Well...

19
00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.999
Makoto is more like a scarred

20
00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.199
all over the place samurai than a prince.

21
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.599
Besides, he hasn't contacted me at all

22
00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.799
after he's gone abroad too.

23
00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.499
I've kind of lost my passion for him.

24
00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.199
Come on, you will be beaten for speaking like this.

25
00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.899
Mr. Kyogoku has a lot of girl fans.

26
00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.099
Hey. Please don't put me in the same boat you're on.

27
00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.199
-What? -You're the type who'll wait patiently forever

28
00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.899
for your husband to return home, aren't you?

29
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.399
I'm not waiting for Shinichi!

30
00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.199
Oh, my...

31
00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.199
I never even said a word about Shinichi, did I?

32
00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.299
Hey!

33
00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.499
Besides, didn't you choose this rink

34
00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.599
because it's a memorable place

35
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.599
that you two used to always come together to, right?

36
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.899
I have no good memories!

37
00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.699
Shinichi looked down on me

38
00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.099
because I had a hard time learning how to skate.

39
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.799
So, he taught you holding your hands, feet and hips, right?

40
00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.699
What's with you today? Cut out teasing me, Sonoko.

41
00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.599
So today it's your turn to teach him how to skate!

42
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.599
No, don't bother...

43
00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.199
What? Can he skate?

44
00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:01.699
I wonder because this is my first time skating with Conan.

45
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.099
Can you skate, Conan?

46
00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.399
Oh, my God!

47
00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.599
Maybe this is his first time?

48
00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:19.199
Now is my chance to get back at this kid.

49
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.099
Cut it out, Sonoko.

50
00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.099
This Sonoko...

51
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.199
Out of my way...

52
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.399
Move!

53
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.199
Out of my way...

54
00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.499
No!

55
00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.499
Out of my way...

56
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:41.799
Conan!

57
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:43.599
It hurts!

58
00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.899
"Chizu Itami (27), Daughter of a Corporate Executive" -It hurts...

59
00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.699
Hey, are you all right?

60
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.099
Are you all right?

61
00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.299
It hurts! Help, Yasuharu!

62
00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:55.599
"Yasuharu Misawa (29), Banker" -Gosh.

63
00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.599
That's what you get for speeding despite being a beginner.

64
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.399
But...

65
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:06.399
You won't be able to attract men's attention by acting cute like that soon.

66
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.599
"Izumi Sano (28), Office Lady" -Chizu,

67
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.399
an active, curious rich young lady

68
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.299
is over the hill after 30 years of age, you know.

69
00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:17.199
How rude! Why do you always say things like that?

70
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.299
You annoy me.

71
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:20.899
Okay...

72
00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:22.099
"Yoriko Komatsu (30)" -It's been a long time

73
00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.799
"Housewife" -since the Clay comrades met!

74
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:25.799
So let's not argue, okay?

75
00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:29.799
Are you all Clay shooters?

76
00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:31.099
What is that?

77
00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.699
The game in which you throw a small plate

78
00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.699
and shoot it down with a shotgun!

79
00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.799
We just went this afternoon and finished a shooting!

80
00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:44.799
A group is more fun than one after all.

81
00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:48.999
We haven't seen each other since that accident six months ago.

82
00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.099
The accident six months ago?

83
00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.599
Right! Will you hear me out, kid?

84
00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.599
It's a sort of stupid and scary story.

85
00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:58.899
Don't tell him.

86
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.199
-What? -Are you crazy?

87
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.799
Why tell a kid something like that?

88
00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.599
Besides, I thought I already told you that

89
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.199
"Kunitomo Orita (29)" -if you ever talk about him,

90
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.199
"Firefighter" -I'm leaving on the spot.

91
00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.899
What a handsome guy.

92
00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.499
He is as much a samurai as you can get.

93
00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.499
Hey! Orita, are you really going to leave?

94
00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:19.999
Aren't we going to drink up?

95
00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.099
I'm just going to take a puff somewhere nearby

96
00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.099
since some idiot made me recall something unpleasant.

97
00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.099
What's with him? Just because he is a bit handsome,

98
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.399
he thinks he can talk like that to me!

99
00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.299
But it's your fault for bringing that out.

100
00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:38.599
It just slipped out!

101
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.399
And he has the nerve to call me stupid.

102
00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.499
He is the one who is being rude, don't you think?

103
00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.199
I hate that guy!

104
00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.799
He is not cheerful and has a foul mouth.

105
00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.199
He is always not part of the group, besides.

106
00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.999
Not part of the group?

107
00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:56.199
Hey, I've always been wondering about.

108
00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.999
Isn't it about time you explain things?

109
00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.999
What? You still don't know?

110
00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.999
Well, I don't really understand either.

111
00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.799
Same here. Why do you always say that?

112
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.899
What? No joke...

113
00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.899
Are you serious? I don't believe it.

114
00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.599
So, why don't you hurry up and tell us.

115
00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.099
Talk about annoying!

116
00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:22.299
No way! You're the last person I'm going to tell!

117
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.999
Since you guys are not curious young ladies,

118
00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:28.199
I guess you'll never find out!

119
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:30.199
Where are you going?

120
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.599
To the toilet!

121
00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.199
If you can't figure it out until the time I come back,

122
00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.199
I'll drop you a hint.

123
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.699
She makes me so mad!

124
00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.299
And? Curious lady of the Suzuki Financial Group,

125
00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:46.699
do you happen to know what it's about?

126
00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.299
Well...

127
00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:52.099
Don't you think this place is getting crowded?

128
00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:54.099
Probably because of the fireworks!

129
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.299
You mean the one that goes up every night at 7pm?

130
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:00.399
Yes! This rink is a special place

131
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:03.499
where you can see the fireworks and castle overlap.

132
00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.199
You're quite knowledgeable!

133
00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:08.499
That's why I've come here too!

134
00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:10.599
I'm not going to watch it like always.

135
00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:12.599
I'll go get a cup of coffee nearby.

136
00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.399
I've seen the fireworks so many times before.

137
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.899
What? You're not going to watch either?

138
00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.899
I'm a bit hungry.

139
00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.399
I'll come back before the fireworks start,

140
00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.599
so wait there for me.

141
00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:25.299
Wait here?

142
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:28.199
I've been waiting to go to the toilet for a while now.

143
00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.799
You may go!

144
00:08:29.799 --> 00:08:32.299
We'll be skating nearby for a while yet so.

145
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.899
When your friends come all we have to do

146
00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:36.499
is tell them to wait here, right?

147
00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:38.399
Yes, I'm sorry to trouble you.

148
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.899
I'll be right back, so could you do that for me?

149
00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:43.499
-Sure! -Sure!

150
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.399
"Toilet"

151
00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.099
Hey...

152
00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:51.399
It's already 5 minutes to the hour.

153
00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.399
What on earth are you doing?

154
00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:59.199
The fireworks will start if you don't hurry up.

155
00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:05.199
They're all so late.

156
00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:08.199
Sorry, Ran, I need to go to the toilet too.

157
00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:16.199
Gosh!

158
00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:18.199
You're late!

159
00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:33.499
To the toilet...

160
00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:35.499
What? What's wrong?

161
00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:36.499
Look at this.

162
00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:38.999
"Closed for cleaning. Please come back later." -What?

163
00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:41.599
It can't be.

164
00:09:45.499 --> 00:09:48.099
Wait a second!

165
00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:52.099
It is a little late to claim the accident was my fault.

166
00:09:57.499 --> 00:10:01.499
Besides, no matter how much you hide your face with that outfit,

167
00:10:01.499 --> 00:10:05.399
if you shoot me, people will hear you and gather here,

168
00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:09.599
then you'll be arrested right away.

169
00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:11.299
Don't tell me that...

170
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:18.899
Excuse me.

171
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:25.599
Are you going to take a while longer?

172
00:10:26.599 --> 00:10:30.199
This is bad, if it's not this toilet,

173
00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:33.099
I'll have to change shoes.

174
00:10:39.099 --> 00:10:40.599
Oh, no.

175
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:43.699
Hey, the fireworks have started already!

176
00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:45.799
Did you see it?

177
00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.799
Gosh!

178
00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:05.999
How beautiful!

179
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.599
Really, the first ones are the most fantastic.

180
00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:12.199
What? So, you came to watch after all.

181
00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:17.699
Yes, I thought it'd be nice to watch fireworks once in a great while.

182
00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:20.799
I made it!

183
00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:22.799
I thought I was going to miss it.

184
00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:26.799
What? Where are Chizu and your friend?

185
00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.699
Didn't you see them at the toilet?

186
00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:31.799
I wonder if I missed them.

187
00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.299
They were cleaning the toilet,

188
00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:37.099
so I changed shoes and went to a different toilet.

189
00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:41.299
Sonoko sure is late, though.

190
00:11:46.499 --> 00:11:48.999
Hey, that scream just now sounded like...

191
00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.399
Sonoko!

192
00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.899
Hey, kid!

193
00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.799
Sonoko!

194
00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:01.599
What's up?

195
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:07.899
What's the matter, Sonoko?

196
00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:12.199
That...

197
00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:33.899
"S"?

198
00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:39.199
What does "S" mean?

199
00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:58.488
Dad!

200
00:13:02.088 --> 00:13:04.288
Dad! Get up!

201
00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:06.288
Dad!

202
00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:10.288
What is it, Ran?

203
00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:12.888
I thought you wanted to leave after watching the fireworks.

204
00:13:12.888 --> 00:13:14.688
There's no time for that!

205
00:13:14.688 --> 00:13:18.588
There's been a murder! Homicide!

206
00:13:18.588 --> 00:13:22.188
A person has been killed in the toilet near the skating rink!

207
00:13:22.188 --> 00:13:24.188
What?

208
00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:29.088
Someone slipped and fell in the toilet near the skating rink?

209
00:13:29.088 --> 00:13:30.688
Gosh!

210
00:13:34.988 --> 00:13:36.188
Come on!

211
00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:39.388
Never mind, just come!

212
00:13:39.388 --> 00:13:43.388
Hurry!

213
00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:55.088
Why was Chizu killed? Why?

214
00:13:55.088 --> 00:13:59.588
Police! Please let us through!

215
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:03.188
All right... Everyone except authorised personnel move back!

216
00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:10.188
How ruthless.

217
00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:12.588
Yes, indeed.

218
00:14:12.588 --> 00:14:15.788
There's nobody inside, is there?

219
00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.288
No, when we got here,

220
00:14:18.288 --> 00:14:20.088
this boy was in here.

221
00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:24.988
Conan?

222
00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:26.988
Which means? Don't tell me that...

223
00:14:26.988 --> 00:14:30.788
Well, this is a coincidence, just a mere coincidence!

224
00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:33.988
Please don't get angry, Inspector Megure!

225
00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:35.688
I don't have the energy to get angry.

226
00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:40.688
Inspector! It seems that this shotgun is the murder weapon!

227
00:14:40.688 --> 00:14:44.788
Okay, check the registration number of the gun

228
00:14:44.788 --> 00:14:46.188
and find the owner of the gun.

229
00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:48.788
That gun is mine.

230
00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:51.688
It's the shotgun I use for Clay shooting.

231
00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:56.488
I left it in the electronic lock locker with everyone else's.

232
00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:59.488
What? Everyone else's?

233
00:14:59.488 --> 00:15:04.688
Yes, the three behind you are members of the Clay shooting.

234
00:15:04.688 --> 00:15:08.888
Who locked the electronic lock of the locker?

235
00:15:08.888 --> 00:15:11.488
Me.

236
00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:13.688
Everybody knows the number to the locker.

237
00:15:13.688 --> 00:15:15.688
When we all came here before,

238
00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.788
we all decided on the number together.

239
00:15:17.788 --> 00:15:21.488
It's "9017".

240
00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:25.988
Well, we'll find out soon enough after checking you four.

241
00:15:25.988 --> 00:15:29.988
The one with gun powder reaction on their body is the killer.

242
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:32.388
All four of us will definitely have reaction!

243
00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:36.288
We all went Clay shooting this afternoon.

244
00:15:36.288 --> 00:15:40.688
Besides, maybe the locker wasn't locked as it should've been too.

245
00:15:40.688 --> 00:15:44.588
If so, anyone could've taken the shotgun out of the locker and...

246
00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:46.488
No, I don't think that's possible.

247
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.388
Have you forgotten?

248
00:15:48.388 --> 00:15:52.588
Gun cases for shotguns are required to look like normal bags,

249
00:15:52.588 --> 00:15:54.888
so people can't figure out what's inside.

250
00:15:54.888 --> 00:15:58.288
Izumi's gun case is a plain leather case.

251
00:15:58.288 --> 00:16:01.288
Moreover, the shotgun is disassembled,

252
00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:05.188
so it's not something just anybody can handle.

253
00:16:05.188 --> 00:16:06.588
I see,

254
00:16:06.588 --> 00:16:10.288
so it has to be someone who knows that there is a shotgun inside the case.

255
00:16:10.288 --> 00:16:12.988
Moreover, it has to be one who can assemble the gun.

256
00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:16.488
Which means that the most likely suspect would still be among you four.

257
00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:19.388
No way...

258
00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:25.188
Well, the most important is to check for any witnesses

259
00:16:25.188 --> 00:16:27.188
who saw any suspicious person near the toilet

260
00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:28.688
around the time was committed!

261
00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:32.488
-Yes, sir! -Well...

262
00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:34.188
I saw it!

263
00:16:34.188 --> 00:16:36.188
-What? -What?

264
00:16:36.188 --> 00:16:38.788
The killer come out of this toilet.

265
00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:40.888
Are you sure, Sonoko?

266
00:16:40.888 --> 00:16:42.188
Yes.

267
00:16:43.688 --> 00:16:48.088
There was a cleaning sign hanging on the door of this toilet.

268
00:16:48.088 --> 00:16:50.088
There was no answer when I knocked,

269
00:16:50.088 --> 00:16:52.288
so I was waiting in front of the door.

270
00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:55.188
Then the fireworks started.

271
00:16:55.188 --> 00:16:56.988
I pulled away from the door,

272
00:16:56.988 --> 00:16:59.488
I tried to look at the fireworks from a window nearby.

273
00:16:59.488 --> 00:17:01.288
It was at that moment!

274
00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:04.188
A strange person wearing a long coat with

275
00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:07.788
comes out of the toilet.

276
00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:10.788
And did you see the face of that person?

277
00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:13.988
No, the face was covered with the hood and a muffler.

278
00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:17.388
If the killer shot the gun and muffled it with the sound of fireworks

279
00:17:17.388 --> 00:17:20.588
and wore a long coat as disguise when fleeing,

280
00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:23.188
this must be planned murder!

281
00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:26.188
Please come to another room

282
00:17:26.188 --> 00:17:29.488
so that I can separately ask you questions.

283
00:17:29.488 --> 00:17:33.888
Then we can figure out who suggested to come to this amusement park.

284
00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:37.888
Hey, just a minute! We all decided together to come here!

285
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:41.788
Well... you can talk more about it during questioning.

286
00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:45.188
No, that's not necessary!

287
00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:49.188
It hit upon me the minute I came to the scene.

288
00:17:49.188 --> 00:17:52.988
But, Sonoko's remark just now verified my feelings.

289
00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:57.488
The one who shot Ms. Itami to death is...

290
00:17:57.488 --> 00:17:58.988
Ms. Izumi.

291
00:17:58.988 --> 00:18:01.788
-What? -It's you.

292
00:18:01.788 --> 00:18:04.388
Wait a minute! Don't be ridiculous!

293
00:18:04.388 --> 00:18:06.088
Why me?

294
00:18:06.088 --> 00:18:09.988
There are three factors why you are the killer.

295
00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:14.288
First is this ladies' toilet which is the scene of the crime.

296
00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:16.888
The killer hung the cleaning sign on the door to keep other people away,

297
00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:21.088
then you kept the victim inside.

298
00:18:21.088 --> 00:18:25.788
Which means the killer is a woman!

299
00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:29.288
Second is your relationship with the victim.

300
00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:32.288
You two were constantly arguing.

301
00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:35.788
You both just couldn't get along with each other, isn't that right?

302
00:18:35.788 --> 00:18:37.688
What're you talking about?

303
00:18:37.688 --> 00:18:40.488
Are you going to set me up as the killer just like that?

304
00:18:40.488 --> 00:18:42.488
Lastly, the most conclusive evidence is

305
00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:46.688
the trace of blood on the wall beside the face of the victim.

306
00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:47.988
Trace of blood?

307
00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:51.188
To you, it may have looked like the trace of blood

308
00:18:51.188 --> 00:18:52.988
that was made when the victim struggled.

309
00:18:52.988 --> 00:18:56.188
But, it was clearly legible to my eyes.

310
00:18:56.188 --> 00:18:59.088
Left behind before she ceased to breathe,

311
00:18:59.088 --> 00:19:01.188
her dying message!

312
00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:05.988
The "S" of the name Sano!

313
00:19:05.988 --> 00:19:10.688
I asked you for your name before the Inspector got here.

314
00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:16.088
The only one who has the letter "S" in the name is you!

315
00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:17.388
Is that not right?

316
00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:20.288
I don't think so!

317
00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:21.688
Why?

318
00:19:21.688 --> 00:19:24.488
I think you can tell just by looking,

319
00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:26.488
the victim has been shot in the chest

320
00:19:26.488 --> 00:19:28.288
and has died on the spot.

321
00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:32.388
Therefore, it's impossible for her to write a message on the wall

322
00:19:32.388 --> 00:19:34.388
after she was shot.

323
00:19:35.688 --> 00:19:37.188
I guess you're right.

324
00:19:37.188 --> 00:19:42.188
Besides, if a woman had relayed a message telling someone to wait here,

325
00:19:42.188 --> 00:19:45.488
the person could've been a man.

326
00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:49.088
Then, the letter "S" is...

327
00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:53.388
Yes, someone left it there

328
00:19:53.388 --> 00:19:57.388
to set Ms. Sano up as the killer.

329
00:19:57.388 --> 00:20:01.188
Besides, the shotgun that was used as the murder weapon was also hers.

330
00:20:01.188 --> 00:20:03.788
But, doesn't something bother you?

331
00:20:03.788 --> 00:20:06.088
Sonoko knocked the door

332
00:20:06.088 --> 00:20:08.088
just before the murder was committed, didn't she?

333
00:20:08.088 --> 00:20:11.088
If the killer had the gun pointed at the victim all the while

334
00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:12.988
before the fireworks went up,

335
00:20:12.988 --> 00:20:16.888
why didn't she shout and call for help?

336
00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:20.888
The killer was probably hiding in the toilet next door

337
00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:22.688
until just before the fireworks went up.

338
00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.488
What?

339
00:20:24.488 --> 00:20:27.688
Something sticky is on it.

340
00:20:27.688 --> 00:20:30.088
See, at the tip of the gun.

341
00:20:30.088 --> 00:20:32.188
This... this is saliva!

342
00:20:32.188 --> 00:20:35.088
I get it! The killer had the gun

343
00:20:35.088 --> 00:20:37.488
pushed into the victim's mouth for a while

344
00:20:37.488 --> 00:20:40.088
until the fireworks went up!

345
00:20:40.088 --> 00:20:43.688
As the fireworks went up, the gun was moved to her chest...

346
00:20:43.688 --> 00:20:45.988
If so,

347
00:20:45.988 --> 00:20:48.988
then we three are not the killer!

348
00:20:48.988 --> 00:20:53.988
Because we were at the skating rink with her before the fireworks went up.

349
00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:56.188
Isn't that right, Ran?

350
00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.288
Yes.

351
00:20:57.288 --> 00:20:59.688
Were they really with you from the start?

352
00:20:59.688 --> 00:21:03.788
It doesn't take 30 seconds from here to the rink.

353
00:21:03.788 --> 00:21:06.088
But, all three of them were there

354
00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:09.088
when the fireworks went up the first time.

355
00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:10.988
It was no more than 10 seconds

356
00:21:10.988 --> 00:21:12.688
between the first fireworks and the second.

357
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:16.188
And where were you then?

358
00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:17.988
I was by the bench near the rink

359
00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:21.988
with my back turned against the fireworks and smoking.

360
00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:24.688
He is the only one without an alibi.

361
00:21:24.688 --> 00:21:27.088
But, we still have no proof.

362
00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:29.888
We don't know his relationship with the victim yet, either.

363
00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:33.688
But, it's easy to tell that she doesn't like being cold.

364
00:21:33.688 --> 00:21:36.788
See! She's about to be shot,

365
00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:39.488
and yet she has her hand in her pocket!

366
00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:42.688
A cellular phone?

367
00:21:42.688 --> 00:21:45.388
There is nothing on the display.

368
00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.488
Maybe she was shot before dialing 911.

369
00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:50.488
Why don't you try re-dialing?

370
00:21:50.488 --> 00:21:54.188
Then, maybe you can find out where she called last?

371
00:21:55.888 --> 00:21:58.188
Let's give it a try.

372
00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:06.488
KIX?

373
00:22:06.488 --> 00:22:11.088
There are eight "#" symbol in the phone number row.

374
00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:14.788
She probably tried to search her way through the numbers

375
00:22:14.788 --> 00:22:17.388
but she failed to do it.

376
00:22:17.388 --> 00:22:20.688
KIX?

377
00:22:20.688 --> 00:22:25.388
KIX? Wait a second.

378
00:22:25.388 --> 00:22:27.688
I have seen this from somewhere before.

379
00:23:58.488 --> 00:24:00.688
"Next Episode" -Suicide?

380
00:24:00.688 --> 00:24:04.088
But wasn't that supposed be an accident?

381
00:24:04.088 --> 00:24:09.088
It's a lie that she always uses to get herself out of hot water!

382
00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:11.188
KIX.

383
00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:15.188
Don't tell me that's a dying message left behind by the victim!

384
00:24:15.188 --> 00:24:18.488
Therefore, the killer is...

385
00:24:19.888 --> 00:24:23.088
none other than you!

386
00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:24.688
Next Conan,

387
00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:28.488
"Dying Message Revives (Part 2)"

388
00:24:29.106 --> 00:24:32.106
Next Conan's Hint:

389
00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:33.506
"A five yen coin"

390
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:35.706
And here's a word from Sonoko about the next episode.

391
00:24:35.706 --> 00:24:38.306
Make sure you don't get the wrong number!
