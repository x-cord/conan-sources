1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,240
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,440
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,140
Four Porsches just like the ones those guys have.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,240
The case far surpasses all expectations!

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,840
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:54,868
"Four Porsches (Part 1)"

9
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,968
Since she came back home, she's running a fever.

10
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,068
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:28,068
It's just a cold.

12
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:31,368
It's not something you have to go out of your way to come see me for.

13
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,368
So much has been going on recently

14
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,468
that she probably just psychologically tired.

15
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:42,468
By the way, are you okay?

16
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:43,968
What?

17
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:47,368
Remember the guys the other day that were tailing us?

18
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,468
If they tail you back here and find this house,

19
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,168
we'll get Dr. Agasa into trouble, too.

20
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:56,768
Don't worry. I wasn't tailed by anyone.

21
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,968
And nobody's watching over this house either.

22
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:06,068
She should go see a doctor, but...

23
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:07,968
Today is Sunday.

24
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:10,568
And the hospitals around here are all closed.

25
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:15,268
Right. We could ask Dr. Araide, what do you say?

26
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:18,168
Yes. I called him a while ago, but he wasn't in.

27
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:23,468
He's probably busy because the trial for that case is coming up.

28
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,368
Come to think of it, there's a hospital

29
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:29,768
inside the Tohto Department Store in Haidocho.

30
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,168
So maybe we should take her there.

31
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,368
If I remember correctly, their day off is Thursday.

32
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:38,768
You don't have to go out of your way to take me to the hospital.

33
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:39,968
Well, there's nothing better than

34
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,268
getting rid of your cold as soon as possible.

35
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,468
Like they say, colds may lead to all kinds of diseases.

36
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,168
What?

37
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:02,968
You mean we can't see her right away?

38
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:06,968
No. We have a lot of patients today.

39
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,568
You'll have to wait about two hours if you come now.

40
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:12,068
Well, it can't be helped.

41
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,668
Let's put in an appointment anyway, Dr. Agasa.

42
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:19,368
Excuse me. We'd like to make an appointment.

43
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,268
Yes.

44
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:25,068
I guess we can kill time in the department store then.

45
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,368
Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:33,368
I guess so.

47
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,868
I'm getting kind of hungry, too.

48
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,568
There's the shop that is famous

49
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,768
for serving great egg porridge in the restaurant arcade here.

50
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:49,168
I'm sure that eating it will make Ai feel a little better

51
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:51,068
and start recovering.

52
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,268
Okay, Doc.

53
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,868
All right...

54
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,668
All right...

55
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:15,668
Stop.

56
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,468
Okay. We're here, Ai.

57
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,968
Here. Hang on to me.

58
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,368
You're still feeling unsteady, aren't you?

59
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,168
Hey. I'm not that hopeless, okay?

60
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:50,168
Never mind. Will you just move out of my way?

61
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,868
Yes.

62
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,568
I can manage to get off the car...

63
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,868
There you go again.

64
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,468
By myself.

65
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:07,768
Porsche.

66
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,468
356 A.

67
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,768
Gin's car.

68
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,468
Hey, Ai.

69
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,868
Hey, Ai.

70
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:34,768
Ai.

71
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:40,168
That is undoubtedly the same model as that of Gin's.

72
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,268
But his is black and this is green.

73
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,868
The color is different.

74
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:47,268
And besides,

75
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:50,468
since all three Porsches are parked so close together...

76
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,968
I'm sure that a bunch of Porsche lovers got together

77
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,068
to eat at the department store.

78
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,568
Another Porsche.

79
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,668
It's a 911.

80
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,268
Okay, we're here.

81
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,168
"Yoshihito Kureko (45)" -We're here, Mr. Banba.

82
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:20,568
Mr. Banba.

83
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:25,668
Darn. Another O.B.

84
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:28,668
"Yukiya Banba (41)" -Hopeless.

85
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:30,768
It's hopeless.

86
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:33,368
Well, it's not something unexpected though.

87
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:36,068
Okay then, why don't we do some shopping or something like always

88
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,668
until Banba's booze wears off?

89
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,168
Hold it.

90
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,068
Let me go back to the car and get my wallet.

91
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,168
Yes.

92
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:44,368
I guess I'll go, too.

93
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,368
Excuse me, mister.

94
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:52,968
Are the four Porsches parked here all yours?

95
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,468
Yes.

96
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:57,868
That green, old one is Mr. Hotei's.

97
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,568
"Eiji Hotei (39)" -Porsche 356 A.

98
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,068
The new car to the right edge

99
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,468
is Ms. Taiyama's Porsche Boxter.

100
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,268
"Kaoru Taiyama (34)"

101
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,768
And this is my dear car.

102
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,368
Porsche 911.

103
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,268
And this red one

104
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,868
is Porsche 928 that belongs to Mr. Banba

105
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,468
who is asleep in my car.

106
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:23,068
But why were all four men riding in your car?

107
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,568
Well, that's because...

108
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,368
We're all Porsche lovers

109
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,368
as well as friends who play golf together.

110
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,668
When all four of us go golfing, we gather here,

111
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:36,468
then take Kureko's car and head off together in one car.

112
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,768
The more the merrier

113
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,468
and the highway fee is cheaper that way, too.

114
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:46,668
Even the parking fee here is free

115
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,768
if we shop in this department store, too.

116
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:51,568
Besides, after we make half a round,

117
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,768
there's someone here who gulps down more beer.

118
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:57,768
By the time we're done, someone is completely drunk.

119
00:08:57,768 --> 00:09:00,068
We have no other choice but go shopping or something

120
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,768
until he sleeps it off.

121
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:06,168
Well, this parking lot is crowded on Sunday

122
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,868
and it's difficult to find an open stall.

123
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:11,368
So it's like we're saving a stall for ourselves.

124
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,568
Hey, it's time we get going.

125
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,568
Yes.

126
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:15,568
See you.

127
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,468
Saving a stall?

128
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,568
I guess he means that nobody has guts enough

129
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,468
to park their car between two Porsches.

130
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:28,568
I see.

131
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,368
Okay, Ai. Shall we start off, too?

132
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:36,368
Ai?

133
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,068
Count me out.

134
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:40,468
What?

135
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,668
I don't feel too well.

136
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:43,968
So I guess I'll wait here in the car

137
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,668
until the time for my appointment with the doctor.

138
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,568
Hey, Ai.

139
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:54,868
It can't be helped.

140
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:58,868
She was tailed by people she doesn't know the identity of.

141
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:02,268
It's no wonder she's all worked up.

142
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,268
Which means that...

143
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,368
the ones who were tailing us were the Men in Black.

144
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:11,068
Could be, although I'm not all that sure myself yet.

145
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,368
I've got to at least find out

146
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,868
whether it's me or Ai that they're after.

147
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,468
Otherwise, I can't make any moves.

148
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:31,468
There was robbery in the Tokyo metropolitan area last night before dawn.

149
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,168
The killer is still on the run.

150
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:36,068
The police are collecting the information from an eyewitness.

151
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,968
Me or Ai?

152
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,590
I think it was the 10th floor.

153
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,590
I wonder if it's okay, though.

154
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,090
We left Ai back there alone.

155
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,790
We had no other choice, did we?

156
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,490
Kyoto type ramen.

157
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,290
They serve western style food here.

158
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,890
Italian food.

159
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,490
Chinese food.

160
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,790
There sure is a lot of variety, isn't there?

161
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,390
What is it?

162
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,990
Boy, what a long line.

163
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,390
Tarugatei.

164
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,690
Here it is.

165
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,290
Hey, hey. You got to be kidding.

166
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,190
Look at this line, Dr. Agasa.

167
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,790
Just as would be expected of a shop famous for egg porridge.

168
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,490
We can kill time just standing in line.

169
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,990
Huh?

170
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,090
Oh, no. I left my cell phone in the car.

171
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,790
I'll go get it.

172
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,290
You guys go on inside.

173
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,790
I'll be right back.

174
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,490
They're the people we just saw a while ago in the parking lot.

175
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,990
Hey!

176
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,190
Cool kid.

177
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,190
Long time no see.

178
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,590
Jo...

179
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,690
Jodie?

180
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,590
Ran and Sonoko, too.

181
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,890
-Hello. -Hello.

182
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,690
What's up?

183
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,390
What brings you here?

184
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,590
We came to eat the egg porridge of Tarugatei.

185
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,990
Bug you?

186
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,790
No, not at all.

187
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,790
I wasn't referring to you, Sonoko.

188
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,490
We told Jodie that it's really delicious.

189
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,890
Then she said she wanted to come and eat it.

190
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,890
Yes. Japanese food is healthy and very good.

191
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,390
I see.

192
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,590
And why are you both here, Conan?

193
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,590
You were saying that you were going to visit Ai

194
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,190
who is in bed with a cold.

195
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,290
Well...

196
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,790
Ai?

197
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,490
Yes. Actually, Ai was...

198
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,690
Going here with us to eat the egg porridge.

199
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,490
But her cold is so bad and she didn't look like she could make it.

200
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,090
So we left her behind.

201
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,990
Right, Dr. Agasa?

202
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,290
That's the story.

203
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,290
For those watching "Wild Sunday" at home,

204
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,790
please look at this.

205
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,090
Look at that long line of people.

206
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,190
This is the restaurant arcade inside the Tohto Department Store.

207
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,990
-The line you see... -See.

208
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,690
-is in front of Tarugatei. -It's even popular on TV.

209
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,890
So we had an urge to come eat here.

210
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,990
She's Tomomi Kato of the Gourmet Corner.

211
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,690
You're right.

212
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,590
Hey, hey. Listen to me, will you?

213
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,590
Okay, I'll start my interview right away.

214
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,590
The serial arsonist hasn't been arrested yet.

215
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,490
The Metropolitan Police Department is asking the people

216
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,990
in the vicinity to be very careful.

217
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,790
What I'm saying is that everyone was dumb.

218
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,390
Thank you very much.

219
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,790
So here is Yuka Mitsueda

220
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,090
with "The Place I Promised to Meet You".

221
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,590
And so let me go

222
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,490
and interview someone else now.

223
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,190
Boy, could I talk to you for a minute?

224
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,990
Did you come to here to Tohto Department Store to eat egg porridge, too?

225
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,390
Yes. But since there are so many people in line,

226
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,890
I guess I'm not.

227
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,690
Really? Is that right?

228
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,490
Did you come to eat egg porridge here at Tarugatei, too?

229
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,990
Yes.

230
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,090
That's it. We're leaving.

231
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,490
Come on, Dr. Agasa.

232
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,090
Let's go. Quick!

233
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,690
Hey!

234
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,090
Wait!

235
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,990
Hey.

236
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,290
Conan!

237
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,290
People go in and out of this shop quite quickly,

238
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,490
so you'll be able to eat soon.

239
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,490
Let them be, Ran.

240
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,790
Yes, but...

241
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,590
Kids wouldn't really know the difference in taste anyway.

242
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,390
Hey.

243
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,490
What's up?

244
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,890
All of a sudden.

245
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,490
Hey, Shinichi! Shinichi.

246
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,190
The person I saw a while ago.

247
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,390
He came back.

248
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,890
Dr. Agasa and Shinichi.

249
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,890
What's up?

250
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,090
Why does he look...

251
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,790
so dreadfully serious?

252
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,590
Shinichi!

253
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,990
Mr. Banba!

254
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,590
What is this?

255
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,490
What's the matter?

256
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,690
Shinichi.

257
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,190
No good.

258
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,890
He's been strangled.

259
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,190
Hello. Is this police?

260
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,290
I'm calling from the basement parking lot of the Tohto Department Store

261
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,290
from my cell phone.

262
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,390
-I'll stay back here. -Yes.

263
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,290
So take Ai and and get away from here, Dr. Agasa.

264
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,890
Why?

265
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,590
My face was taken by the TV cameras a while ago.

266
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,290
If the guys who were tailing us the other day were the Men in Black,

267
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,190
we can't be too sure that they won't come here after seeing me, right?

268
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,990
Don't worry.

269
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,790
The TV program just a while ago is the afternoon wide show.

270
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,290
The viewer rating is only about 10 percent.

271
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,590
It's not a live broadcast that's aired during golden time.

272
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,790
It's most probable that they're not watching.

273
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,990
Fool!

274
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,290
The number of TV viewers in the Kanto District

275
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,090
is approximately four million people.

276
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,690
Even if the viewer rating were to be one percent,

277
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,690
the number of people watching would be about 400,000.

278
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,690
10 percent makes it 4 million people.

279
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,090
There's no guarantee that they wouldn't be watching.

280
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,490
True.

281
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,990
So now that you understand, hurry and get Ai out of here.

282
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,390
If you look around Tokyo,

283
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,490
I'm sure you'll be able to find a hospital that is open even on Sunday.

284
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,990
I feel sorry for Ai.

285
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,090
But she'll just have to hold up till then.

286
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,690
"Tarugatei"

287
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,490
It sure rains a lot, doesn't it?

288
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,790
Hey, look.

289
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,890
There are police cars parked in front of this department store.

290
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,890
I wonder if something happened.

291
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,690
Don't tell me that the glasses kid

292
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,390
is messed up in some case again.

293
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,390
No way.

294
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,990
Seeing is believing.

295
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,490
Which means seeing is believing.

296
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,990
Shall we go check?

297
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,590
What?

298
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,090
Hey, how come you're not letting us out?

299
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,690
Well, we were contacted by the police a while ago.

300
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,990
There's been a grave incident inside this parking lot

301
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,490
that I can't let anyone out of here.

302
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,390
So now you know,

303
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,490
we can't get out of here until the killer is caught, Shinichi.

304
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,890
It can't be helped.

305
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,090
Find an empty lot and wait there.

306
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,490
But what if they come?

307
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,490
Don't worry. I'll solve the case right away.

308
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,490
Don't move till then.

309
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,990
Hey, Shinichi.

310
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,190
Shinichi.

311
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,390
Don't worry.

312
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,890
I'll solve the case right away.

313
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,090
"Next Episode" -Reddish...

314
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,490
Brown hair.

315
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,590
I can't make it out.

316
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,090
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba

317
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,790
and how they retrieved the murder weapon?

318
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,490
This is it!

319
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,290
I've got to contact Dr. Agasa right away

320
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,390
and get Ai out of here fast.

321
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,690
What?

322
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,990
Dr. Agasa and Ai are both gone!

323
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,690
Next Conan, "Four Porsches (Part 2)"

324
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:25,958
Next Conan's Hint:

325
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,158
"Power Window"

326
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,758
Repeat after me.

327
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:31,158
Power window.

328
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:32,804
-Power window... -Yes.
