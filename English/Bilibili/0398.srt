1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,740
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,440
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,040
A secret-filled cell phone.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,840
There are tricks everywhere in the mails as well as the conversations.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,640
An entangled baffling case!

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:01,225
I know that I shouldn't send this.

10
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:04,025
Maybe I should just take my time and see what happens?

11
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:06,925
I know I may have a chance to come in touch with their boss eventually.

12
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,825
That chance will come. I'm sure.

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,725
Conan!

14
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:15,925
You're still in your pyjamas.

15
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,425
I told you to hurry and get changed because we're going out, didn't I?

16
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,425
Come on, never mind the cell phone.

17
00:02:23,425 --> 00:02:24,825
Okay.

18
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,725
Gosh.

19
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,225
Oh, right.

20
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:33,425
I guess I'll send Shinichi a mail before going out.

21
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:37,025
Because he may show up out of the blue while we're out.

22
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:40,425
We're going to accompany Dad today to cover a case.

23
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:45,825
If it turns out to be a tough one, I may be asking you for advice.

24
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,625
Conan's cell phone is ringing.

25
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:58,425
He just got mail.

26
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,025
Don't tell me it's the mail I just sent?

27
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:06,025
It can't be because I sent mine to Shinichi's address.

28
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:09,725
But the timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:17,225
"Request from a Queer Family (Part 1)"

30
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,925
Did you look at the contents?

31
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,625
No, I didn't.

32
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,925
It sounded like you got incoming mail,

33
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:32,425
so I just wondered who it was from.

34
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,725
I'm sure it's from Doc!

35
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,525
Just as I thought.

36
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,025
He's repairing the Youth Detective Squad badge. I asked him to do so.

37
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,025
It's from Ran!

38
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,425
Then, don't tell me...

39
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,725
Don't tell me that...

40
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,425
Oh, no.

41
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,725
Give me a break.

42
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:57,625
Do you guys have to tag along like this each and every time?

43
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,225
But your client requested that you come along with family, right?

44
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:05,925
Besides, we may come up with some idea that may help you out again, too.

45
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,725
Right, Ran?

46
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,325
True.

47
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:11,725
With a fantastic deduction that is just as good as some great detective

48
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,725
that is usually God knows where.

49
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,425
Going all out like that.

50
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,925
There's something fishy about that mail that you got a while ago.

51
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,825
He's probably taking measures so that the mails that I sent him

52
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:26,425
won't be seen by someone he doesn't want them to be seen by.

53
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,425
He told me that he couldn't give me his phone number because he's busy

54
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,825
and can't answer the phone,

55
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,625
but he gave it to Conan after all.

56
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:37,125
If he had been contacting Conan all the time,

57
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,925
Conan's fantastic deductions

58
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,125
and for some strange reason, knowing things about me,

59
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,225
all fall into place.

60
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,825
That Shinichi is taking advantage of a child.

61
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:50,325
I'll never forgive him.

62
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,825
Cell phone?

63
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,125
Yes, I'd like you to find it for me.

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,225
If possible, by today.

65
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:04,325
If not, I may end up

66
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:06,725
"Tomoko Kariya (39)" -not being able to stay here anymore.

67
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,125
Why would that be?

68
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,125
Well, the thing is...

69
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,125
What?

70
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,425
You'll be getting a mail from your lover tonight?

71
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,225
You're the one who needs to hush up.

72
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:24,025
I'm worried that the mail may be seen by my jealous husband,

73
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:29,625
my strait-laced father-in-law or talkative younger brothers.

74
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,825
Then why don't you contact your partner immediately

75
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:35,125
and tell him not to send you mail?

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:39,625
Well, he's the one who calls me from his side all the time,

77
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,125
and his number is an unlisted number.

78
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,025
He always sends me mail over the weekends,

79
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:47,425
but he rarely looks at the mails that I send him from my side.

80
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:50,725
I have no way of contacting him from my side.

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,525
He sounds pretty selfish.

82
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:57,425
But there are egotistical people like that around.

83
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,325
Right, Conan?

84
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,025
Really?

85
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,925
And where and when did you lose it?

86
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,525
I don't know.

87
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,325
I just realized it two days ago.

88
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:12,225
But I'm pretty sure that someone in this house has it.

89
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,825
What do you mean?

90
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:17,825
I called my cell phone as soon as I lost it.

91
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:21,625
After about 10 rings or so, somebody answered the phone

92
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,825
but said nothing and hung up right away.

93
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:28,125
But I heard it on the other side of the line,

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,825
the sound of my father-in-law blowing his unskilled bamboo flute.

95
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,025
Listen to this.

96
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,425
He sure sounds terrible.

97
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:41,625
Moreover, he only plays the flute in his room.

98
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,125
So the fact that this sound was heard on the phone

99
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,525
means that the cell phone is somewhere in this house.

100
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:51,225
But no matter how many times I called after that, I get no answer.

101
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:54,325
Then why not get everyone in the house together and...

102
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:56,825
Yes. Of course I already asked everyone.

103
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,925
But they've all told me that they don't know.

104
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:01,925
I'm sure that they're waiting for me to goof.

105
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:05,625
Somebody probably doesn't like me and wants to chase me out of this house.

106
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,725
If divorce comes up, God knows how much alimony will be demanded of me.

107
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:11,025
Why don't you call the phone company

108
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,325
and have them stops your phone service?

109
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,925
Even so, I wouldn't be able to erase the mails

110
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,525
that he had sent me from the memory.

111
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:20,525
I do have it locked just in case, so no one gets to look at them.

112
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,425
If I stop the phone, it would probably breed more suspicion

113
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,525
and the lock may be undone.

114
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,425
But how should I go about looking for it?

115
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,925
You're her friend from your junior high school days.

116
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,025
Yes, sir! I'm Mouri.

117
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:38,825
Rather, Goro Mori.

118
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,025
Mr. Mori will be building a house soon,

119
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:45,725
so he wanted to see this house that you designed for reference.

120
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,525
"Daisaku Kariya (68)" -Oh, I see.

121
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:52,125
Please help yourself and look around to your heart's content.

122
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,325
I see.

123
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,325
That's why she asked him to bring the family with him.

124
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:58,125
I'll let you listen to my flute.

125
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,125
I really don't think...

126
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,725
Can you tell if you hear your cell phone ring?

127
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:07,025
Yes, but it could be on manner mode.

128
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,025
Okay, ring it.

129
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:23,225
At this age,

130
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:25,425
you need to go to the restroom so often that it's a bother.

131
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,525
Excuse me for a moment.

132
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,825
Don't tell me that father...

133
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,525
I don't think so.

134
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,425
Because whoever answered the phone just now

135
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,325
hung up right away.

136
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:43,925
He sure doesn't look to be such a strait-laced person.

137
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:46,425
He looks that way, but he is actually a very scary man.

138
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,225
Even the incident that happened 12 years ago.

139
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,325
It was because of father to begin with.

140
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:55,525
12 years ago?

141
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,125
Oh, well. Never mind.

142
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,425
Shall we look elsewhere then?

143
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:03,525
Your classmate?

144
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,825
You mean your ex-boyfriend or something?

145
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,425
Of course not.

146
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,925
So you write novels?

147
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,125
Yes.

148
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,225
I'm still an unknown writer.

149
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,225
But in three months,

150
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:22,225
you may be hearing my name whether you like it or not.

151
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,625
Shigehide Kariya.

152
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,125
You mean you're the one who writes those pure love novels?

153
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,925
So the rumour about your novel being aired on TV is true.

154
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:34,225
But I expected you to be much older.

155
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:38,025
Your novel's going to be dramatized. How wonderful.

156
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,625
Hey, Ran. Make the call.

157
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,525
Oh, it's from the publisher.

158
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,525
Yes, hello.

159
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,825
How about it?

160
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:59,025
No, he isn't the one. Because that person hung up right away again.

161
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:02,125
Huh? A meeting?

162
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,825
I see.

163
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:06,625
I'll meet you at the family restaurant in front of the station then.

164
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,625
What timing though. A while ago and even now,

165
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,225
talk about a string of coincidences.

166
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:14,025
Right, coincidences happen a lot.

167
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,825
Things that seem to happen by chance are called coincidences

168
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,725
because they don't usually happen.

169
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,525
I guess you're right.

170
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,725
But Mrs. Kariya, if it's this type of investigation,

171
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:26,025
you may as well get yourself another cell phone and try calling yourself.

172
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,125
Are you saying that I go out and get myself another cell phone?

173
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:32,325
I don't have much money that I can use freely.

174
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,525
I decided to hire a professional

175
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:37,825
instead of relying on my friends to protect my privacy, too.

176
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,125
So your husband is an illustrator.

177
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,825
He doesn't seem to be around though.

178
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:52,125
If he's not around, this is our chance.

179
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,825
See. Coincidences don't keep on happening.

180
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,425
This picture sure looks familiar.

181
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,525
Oh, that's it.

182
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:04,025
The painting of Tsugutaka Kariya that was popular some time ago.

183
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,225
Oh, so you're familiar with my painting?

184
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:09,425
Just who are you all?

185
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,725
Dear, he is...

186
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:14,125
So you're Tsugutaka Kariya.

187
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,225
I expected you to be a lot younger.

188
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,025
I guess you could say the paintings of the young people are like e-mails

189
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:22,725
whereas my paintings are letters.

190
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,725
The depth of colour differs.

191
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,725
A guest?

192
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,025
Leave it be.

193
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,325
I'm sure it's the publisher

194
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,325
that's come to pressure me to hand in my work.

195
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:38,925
It's been ringing for quite a long time.

196
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,525
Wasn't it a guest?

197
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:49,125
Well, I went to answer the door but there was no one there.

198
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,325
Do things like this happen often?

199
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,225
Sometimes.

200
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:57,825
Mrs. Kariya says it's some child playing a prank.

201
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,625
What're we going to do?

202
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,625
There no place to look for it anymore.

203
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,925
Mr. Mouri, no need to worry.

204
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,725
As you can see, I've found my cell phone.

205
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,025
-Huh? -What?

206
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,425
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:12,725
I'll make sure I deposit the payment to you.

208
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,125
Talk about a stupid case.

209
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:19,125
Right. There are people deceiving people behind their back, too.

210
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,725
Talk about stupid.

211
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,625
May I stay over at Doc's house tonight?

212
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,425
You're going to play games again with Doc?

213
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,725
No, you can't.

214
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,625
Because I have a lot of things I want to talk over with you tonight, Conan.

215
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,325
Okay, then. Can we just stop by for a little while?

216
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,925
Because my badge is repaired.

217
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,325
Shinichi, what's up at this time of day?

218
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:46,225
Bummers, I'm in a fix.

219
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,925
It's seems that Ran called my cell phone.

220
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,925
Tonight at around 7:00,

221
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:52,325
a woman's body was found in a car parked along the Teimusu River.

222
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:56,225
The woman has been identified from her belongings

223
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:59,425
as Mrs. Tomoko Kariya, 32 years old, a housewife residing in Haidocho.

224
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,325
The police have concluded this to be a murder case.

225
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,325
There seems to be strange things found at the scene so...

226
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,825
What?

227
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,288
The victim is Mrs. Tomoko Kariya.

228
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,888
According to the medical examiner,

229
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,988
she was stabbed in the stomach

230
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:23,188
then later hit on the head with a blunt instrument.

231
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:24,988
She was stabbed then later assaulted?

232
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:27,988
Yes, sir. There's a possibility that there could be more than one culprit,

233
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:30,888
because it's unnatural to think that the culprit wound stab someone

234
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:32,788
then use another weapon to attack her again.

235
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:34,788
Wait a second.

236
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:38,288
I think there was similar case like this in the past.

237
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:43,188
Her bag and cash are nowhere in sight, so it may be a robber.

238
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,588
We can't be too sure, Officer Takagi.

239
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,288
Oh, Mr. Mouri?

240
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,388
Hey, hey. This is work for the police to handle.

241
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:54,488
I wish you passersby outsiders keep out of this.

242
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:56,488
No, no, Inspector.

243
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:59,188
I am no outsider to this case.

244
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,888
Actually, that woman asked me to do work for her.

245
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,688
What? Mrs. Kariya was having an extra-marital affair?

246
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:07,788
No way.

247
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,988
Unfortunately, it seems to have been so.

248
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,688
Then, did her partner killed her?

249
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,788
No, we don't know for sure yet.

250
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,088
Would you have any idea who it could've been?

251
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,388
Come to think of it,

252
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:21,388
a guy with a moustache accompanied by a child came around.

253
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,888
Right, I think his name was Goro Mori or something like that.

254
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,588
Goro Mori?

255
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:28,288
Well, that's...

256
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,588
It's him!

257
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,388
How dare you!

258
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:36,088
You've got me wrong.

259
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:40,088
Kogoro Mouri, that renown detective.

260
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,888
Yes, sir. When I came this afternoon,

261
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,488
I couldn't reveal my name because of certain reasons.

262
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:48,788
Does that mean that you already arrested the one who killed Tomoko?

263
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,288
No, not just yet.

264
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:54,988
Excuse me, but where were you last night at around 7:30 in the evening?

265
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,788
Me?

266
00:14:56,788 --> 00:15:00,788
I was here all the while. Isn't it right, Mr. Nakamura?

267
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:01,788
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,188
He was blowing his flute from a little before 7:00 when everyone came,

269
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,788
all the way to about 8:00.

270
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:12,888
He stopped blowing for a little while around 7:30 when I served him dinner.

271
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,688
Did you actually see him then?

272
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,988
No. When he's blowing his flute,

273
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,588
I am told to leave his dinner outside his room

274
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,988
so that I won't interrupt him.

275
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:27,188
But maybe he smelled the aroma of curry outside the sliding paper door?

276
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:30,888
It's been a long time since we had curry for dinner.

277
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,988
Around 7:30?

278
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:34,588
I was here.

279
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,488
I came back after the meeting ended at 6:00,

280
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,188
and was confined in this room working right through.

281
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,388
I think the two over there can testify to that?

282
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:43,788
Is that right?

283
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,488
Yes, that's correct.

284
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,288
Ever since the lights of the room was turned on around 6:30,

285
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,788
Shigehide's silhouette was in view from the sliding paper door.

286
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:55,388
Even when I brought him his dinner.

287
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,888
Which means you didn't actually see him in person.

288
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:02,888
No, because I'm told not to enter when he is working.

289
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:07,088
Is it really true that Tomoko was killed?

290
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,088
Yes. That's why we're investigating the case.

291
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:13,588
Then hurry on with it and get going.

292
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:17,588
Since you all came and keep going back and forth the corridor,

293
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:20,388
I can't seem to concentrate on my work.

294
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,888
He talks like that even though someone was murdered?

295
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:25,688
Which means...

296
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,688
the only people left in this house that we haven't questioned yet

297
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,388
is Tomoko's husband.

298
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,688
Yes, sir.

299
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:32,888
Huh?

300
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,188
His dinner is still left outside.

301
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:39,288
Mr. Tsugutaka Kariya, please answer us!

302
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,488
What's up?

303
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:43,388
Well, he won't say anything.

304
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,888
You asked me if I have any idea about it.

305
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,888
I don't know anything so I can't possibly answer that question.

306
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:51,588
It wasn't me to usually talk to her anyway.

307
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,188
It seems that you haven't touched your dinner, too.

308
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:56,488
Are you feeling sick or something?

309
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:59,588
No, I was absorbed in work that I simply forgot.

310
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:02,788
When you brought dinner to him, did you talk to him?

311
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,688
No. Well...

312
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:07,488
But I'm sure he was in his room

313
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,288
because I could smell the sweet aroma of his pipe.

314
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:14,688
Okay. Now that you're done, get going already.

315
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:18,088
His wife's been killed and he's still going to work.

316
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:22,288
Those three have an alibi.

317
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:23,288
Yes, sir.

318
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,388
It would take 20 minutes

319
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,788
even if you went full speed from here to the murder site.

320
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,688
They couldn't have committed the crime.

321
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:32,688
Which makes the man she was having an affair with the most suspicious.

322
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,188
But we have no idea of who, or where he is.

323
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,088
Shall we try tracing him starting with Mrs. Kariya's friends?

324
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:43,188
Hello?

325
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,088
Yes, this is the Kariya residence.

326
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:49,788
There's a phone call for Mrs. Kariya.

327
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:53,088
Hey, hurry and put Tomoko on the line.

328
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,488
Tell her to answer my mail.

329
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,488
This is the police.

330
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:01,388
What is your relationship with Mrs. Tomoko Kariya?

331
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:05,088
Yes...

332
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,788
He's innocent.

333
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:08,888
Huh?

334
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,588
He seems to have been at a pub in Hokkaido.

335
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:16,488
He says he called in rage because she didn't answer his mails

336
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:20,288
nor answer her cell phone today.

337
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,788
Then he didn't know about the incident?

338
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,488
But, Inspector,

339
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:27,388
it only takes one or two hours to Hokkaido by plane,

340
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:29,488
so if he flies straight to Hokkaido after committing the crime...

341
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:32,388
No, there were several of his colleagues

342
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:35,588
who said that they began drinking about at 8:00.

343
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,788
So he couldn't have committed the crime.

344
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,588
If so, who could've killed her?

345
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:42,288
How strange though.

346
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,588
All three people eat their meals in a different room.

347
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:46,588
Yes.

348
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:52,288
But everyone used to eat together until 12 years ago.

349
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,888
12 years ago?

350
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:57,888
Yes. When the third son, Eisuke was here, everyone always ate together.

351
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,488
Right.

352
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:01,388
Eisuke?

353
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:03,488
Eisuke Kariya.

354
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:05,788
I get it! Now I remember.

355
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,588
It's that case that happened 12 years ago!

356
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:08,988
Inspector?

357
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:14,088
There was an incident 12 years ago that seemed very similar to this case.

358
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:19,488
The one who was killed was Eisuke's fiance, Ms. Motoka Aida.

359
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:23,688
Like Tomoko, she was stabbed then later struck to death.

360
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:28,188
Back then, Eisuke who had disappeared was also thought to be a suspect,

361
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:32,488
but a large amount of his blood was also found near the phone booth.

362
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,188
Moreover, after the incident,

363
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:37,588
all the cash from Eisuke's account had been withdrawn.

364
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,288
So we thought that Eisuke had been kidnapped

365
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:43,288
and killed after the money was taken from him.

366
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:48,188
The murder site was a lonely place and there were no witnesses.

367
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,088
Investigation was at a deadlock.

368
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,788
Come to think of it, there was a call from Eisuke's friend last night.

369
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,588
For Eisuke?

370
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,988
-No. -For Mrs. Kariya.

371
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:04,088
Something about the caller, Eisuke and Tomoko

372
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,688
used to belong to the same drama club of the university they went to.

373
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:11,388
Back then, she seemed to be very annoyed.

374
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:15,188
I didn't call you. Cut out your stupid talk.

375
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:19,088
Something sure smells fishy.

376
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:22,388
Do you know the phone number of that person?

377
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,988
Is that so?

378
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:30,488
Okay, if something comes up I may get back to you. Thank you.

379
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:33,188
How was it?

380
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:36,688
He's innocent. He has a perfect alibi.

381
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:39,088
He seems to have received silent phone call last night,

382
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,188
so he checked the history of his incoming calls

383
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,988
and found that it was Tomoko's cell phone number.

384
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,088
He tried calling her back many times, but couldn't connect

385
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,588
so he decided to call her home phone.

386
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,188
Strange.

387
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,288
Mrs. Kariya's cell phone disappeared the night before yesterday

388
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,288
and it was supposed to have been locked.

389
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,388
Don't tell me that the person who had the cell phone

390
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:01,088
unlocked the phone and made the call?

391
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,088
If so, could that have been the motive of the culprit?

392
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:07,788
Several calls from her lover were found saved in her cell phone, too.

393
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,088
In other words, that person is the killer.

394
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:13,588
But you found her cell phone right away, didn't you?

395
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,688
No.

396
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,488
Mrs. Kariya is the one who found it

397
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:18,588
and I don't even know where she found it either.

398
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:20,488
I didn't bother asking her.

399
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:27,188
Okay, Conan. We got all the information we need.

400
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:29,488
You're going to call Shinichi, aren't you?

401
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,088
Go on and call him!

402
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,188
Right. Once you call him, that's it.

403
00:21:33,188 --> 00:21:35,688
I'm taking that cell phone from you

404
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,888
and talk to him directly myself.

405
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,888
You can't possibly do something like that.

406
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:42,888
What can't you do?

407
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:46,888
Because to lock the cell phone, you need to enter four digits.

408
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:51,588
There are 10,000 possibilities from "0000" to "9999".

409
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:54,588
I couldn't possibly try all those numbers out.

410
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:57,488
Well, maybe if I were so bored and had nothing to do

411
00:21:57,488 --> 00:22:00,888
and moreover, was an invisible man unseen by anybody, then maybe...

412
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,488
An invisible man?

413
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,988
It's true that if it were to take three seconds to try it once,

414
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,388
that would add up to 30,000 seconds.

415
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,588
8 hours.

416
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:11,188
I'd give up at that point.

417
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:13,688
Which means the one who unlocked the phone would be someone

418
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:16,588
who can stay without being bothered by anyone for a long period of time.

419
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:20,988
In other words, the three who are usually confined to their rooms.

420
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,688
"Next Episode" -I'm going to send that mail once more.

421
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,088
And this time for sure...

422
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,988
Then who was smoking the pipe?

423
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,788
Are you saying that there was Ninja or something around?

424
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:09,188
A Ninja?

425
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:12,688
Thanks to you police people, I haven't been able concentrate,

426
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,888
and haven't made any progress in my work!

427
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,488
If so, there is only one thing I can think of.

428
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,988
Conan himself...

429
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:23,588
is Shinichi.

430
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:29,588
Next Conan, "Request from a Queer Family (Part 2)"

431
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,515
Next Conan's Hint:

432
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,615
"The case of 12 years ago"

433
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:35,715
The ending theme is "June Bride".

434
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,015
It's our song, for sure!

435
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:39,515
-Officer Sato isn't here. -I know that!
