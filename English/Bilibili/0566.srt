1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,499
Sweet Potato!

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:07,399
-Delicious Potato! -Here you go.

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:08,599
I bet it's real good.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,899
-Piping Hot! -Geez.

5
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:14,299
You think crying can solve everything?

6
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,499
It's hot, so you need to blow on it before you eat it.

7
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:20,899
Like this. Here, have a bite!

8
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:27,199
Where... Where'd you go?

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,899
Santa?

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,899
The kid's two years old, name's Santa.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,399
About this tall.

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,599
Blue clothes and green pants.

13
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,999
Santa!

14
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,199
Where are you?

15
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,499
-Santa! -Be quiet.

16
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,099
Santa!

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,899
Santa!

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,399
Watch out!

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,399
There...

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,599
This isn't good, Santa!

21
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,699
You can't just do whatever you want.

22
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:11,599
There...

23
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,099
What? You want to look at the cars?

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,799
No...

25
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,099
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

26
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,199
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

27
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,199
A little companion with a cute name.

28
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,199
Conan's troublesome partner!

29
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,999
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,199
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

32
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:27,437
"Santa, My Companion"

33
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:30,837
-One, two... -Dad told you to?

34
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:33,237
Yes, he told me to watch this kid.

35
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,237
-Go on ahead. -Okay!

36
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:42,737
-One, two... -One, two...

37
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,537
What's your name?

38
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:46,937
Santa!

39
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,037
Santa?

40
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:52,037
You add honorific to your own name?

41
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,737
How old are you?

42
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,937
Two years old?

43
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,837
How cute!

44
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:05,637
Ran!

45
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,037
Dad?

46
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:08,737
So you're here, too.

47
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:10,837
-Mommy! -Conan!

48
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,937
You watched the kid like I told you to, right?

49
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,637
Yes.

50
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:17,237
Well, let me introduce her.

51
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:19,937
This is Ms. Shigeko Ishikawa.

52
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:23,537
"Shigeko Ishikawa (30)" -Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,437
What?

54
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:28,437
You were pushed over?

55
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:29,837
At the pedestrian bridge?

56
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:34,637
Yes, a person wearing a full-face helmet pushed me over from behind.

57
00:04:34,637 --> 00:04:38,737
I deliver clothes from a laundry shop as a part time job.

58
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,937
When I was in the middle of a delivery...

59
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:49,937
And that's when I happened to walk by.

60
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,537
It's a good thing she wasn't hurt,

61
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,037
but over the past few days

62
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:57,237
something suspicious has been going, she said.

63
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:00,537
I've been getting this feeling

64
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,637
of being constantly watched.

65
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:09,337
If he only watching from a distance, it wouldn't be a problem,

66
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,237
but pushing her over...

67
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,737
We undoubtedly have a case here.

68
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:16,737
Noticing this, I ordered Conan to watch out for the kid.

69
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,137
And I proceeded my investigation.

70
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:20,837
You're too much.

71
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,537
Are there any other family members around?

72
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,537
No, my husband died last year.

73
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:28,037
It's just me and my child.

74
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,337
Mr. Mouri, I know you're busy, and I'm sorry to bother you.

75
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,337
Don't say such a thing.

76
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:35,637
I am a single father with a kid, too.

77
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,237
I am living a life similar to yours.

78
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,237
Should anything bad happen to you,

79
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:44,137
this kid would be left all alone!

80
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:46,237
Something as troublesome as that

81
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:48,637
would never to tolerated by my conscience!

82
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:49,637
Never!

83
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:52,537
I know how you feel, but even if she's a beauty

84
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,337
I think you're getting carried away.

85
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:57,237
Say, do you have any idea

86
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,137
who the person with the full-face helmet is?

87
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,237
No. Not a clue.

88
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,237
Well, let's go!

89
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:07,537
I'll find that bastard and grab him by the neck!

90
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,737
One, two...

91
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,237
Hey...

92
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:21,837
Relax your shoulders and act as calmly as you can.

93
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:25,737
-Do not alert them to my presence. -Sure.

94
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,137
Alright. It's perfect so far.

95
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,937
"Mouri Detective Agency"

96
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:51,437
Darn, you're bringing me trouble after trouble.

97
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:54,237
Do you have a grudge against me or what?

98
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:12,037
On to the next news.

99
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:16,737
An adorable baby panda has been born in the zoo yesterday.

100
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,937
According to Suzuki, the zookeeper...

101
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:23,537
Good morning, I'm from Sun Sun Cleaning.

102
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:26,937
-Please come in. -Excuse me.

103
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:30,937
"Mouri Detective Agency"

104
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:37,437
Darn, why'd you do that?

105
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:41,437
What's wrong, Santa?

106
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,537
Potty?

107
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,537
Wait, hold it for a while.

108
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:50,637
Not yet...

109
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:06,837
-For me? -Yes.

110
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,437
Melted candy?

111
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,437
Potty, thankies!

112
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:13,237
No problem, don't mention it.

113
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,437
But I guess that was a surprise.

114
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:18,037
-What a turn of events. -Conan!

115
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:19,637
That kid is all right?

116
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:21,137
Santa!

117
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:23,537
Conan!

118
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,937
Santa!

119
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,637
What is it? Pop?

120
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,737
Conan!

121
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:30,237
You all right!

122
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:32,837
Shigeko was taken by a man!

123
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:34,737
-Taken? -Yes.

124
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:39,037
That bastard hid himself in her customer's house and jumped her!

125
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:42,237
What the heck is he thinking attacking a housewife like that?

126
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:44,637
Boy, I'm with you.

127
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,637
I'm reporting it to the police.

128
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,237
So don't worry!

129
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,437
Okay!

130
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:57,437
Well, have you found Shigeko Ishikawa yet?

131
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,737
No.

132
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:02,437
We found traces of blood in the backseat of the car.

133
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,337
She might have struggled and hurt herself.

134
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:09,137
The car was stolen from Haido City five days ago.

135
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:11,037
We received a report for this.

136
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:14,037
That full-face helmet guy again?

137
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:16,837
Judging from the untouched cash,

138
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:20,737
we can assume that the culprit's aim wasn't money.

139
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:23,437
Shigeko is quite a beauty.

140
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,437
The culprit may have taken a fancy to her,

141
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:29,237
but then he couldn't bottle up his desires anymore and took action.

142
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,937
It's a case involving twisted love!

143
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,137
Unforgiveable!

144
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,937
But would you push over someone you love?

145
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:38,537
Hey, Conan! How many times have I told you now?

146
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,137
You stay out of this!

147
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,537
Scat!

148
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,837
Fine!

149
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:47,437
Her bag was open and her things fell out.

150
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:49,937
No! They were scattered.

151
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,437
Was that guy after something in the bag?

152
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,837
Thank you, Santa.

153
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:16,037
As I thought.

154
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,937
The culprit was looking for something.

155
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:21,637
It happened around 1:30 pm.

156
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:25,437
Did he obtain the key after kidnapping Shigeko?

157
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,737
And what was the culprit looking for?

158
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,737
A bird feather?

159
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,437
Why is it there?

160
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,437
Santa, good afternoon.

161
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,337
I've brought a present for you.

162
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:43,737
What happened? It's a mess here.

163
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:46,537
We were just playing pro wrestling.

164
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:48,737
Are you friends with this kid, sir?

165
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:49,737
Yes.

166
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,137
"Minoru Moriwaki (22)" -I live upstairs.

167
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:52,937
My name's Minoru Moriwaki.

168
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,937
A vet med student at Beika University.

169
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:55,937
Nice to meet you.

170
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:59,237
Say, do they keep birds in this place?

171
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:02,037
I found this in the room,

172
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,637
but this place was locked,

173
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,137
so I wonder where it could've come from?

174
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:09,437
Perhaps it stuck on someone's body and got here that way.

175
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:12,837
For example, maybe on you or Santa.

176
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,837
Transfer from someone's body?

177
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:18,337
Could it be from the culprits?

178
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:21,737
I think this is the feather from a Japanese white-eye.

179
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:24,737
Let's take a look at Santa's bird book, shall we?

180
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:28,237
Book, look!

181
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:31,137
See, it's white around their eyes, thus the name white-eye.

182
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:34,037
They're in the passer family.

183
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:37,337
There's a bird called black-eye, too!

184
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:40,437
Oh, they're an endangered species.

185
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:41,937
I gave you a white-eye figure

186
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:44,937
from the capsule vending machine the other day, didn't I?

187
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,337
My friend, present!

188
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,537
You gave it away as a present?

189
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:53,637
A white-eye's feather and a white-eye figure.

190
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:55,237
Both involve the white-eye.

191
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:57,637
Do these coinciding facts have anything to do

192
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:01,237
with Shigeko's kidnapping?

193
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,737
Santa.

194
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:06,737
Which friend did you give the white-eye to as a present?

195
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:10,337
There, there and here!

196
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:13,437
What? You gave them everywhere.

197
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,437
Santa, which way?

198
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,837
The place where your friend is waiting for your present?

199
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:28,937
-Here! -It hurts...

200
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,437
It hurts.

201
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:33,137
At this rate I'm gonna get bunny ears.

202
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:45,737
Look.

203
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:49,037
No, they don't look like culprit.

204
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,137
I said don't pull my ears!

205
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,437
Look.

206
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:57,037
It hurts...

207
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:00,937
It hurts... So you'd like me to go straight?

208
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,437
-It's cute! -I want to see...

209
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,937
Santa, which way are we going?

210
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,637
What's wrong?

211
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,337
Santa, please wake up.

212
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,237
We're not quite finished here, Santa!

213
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,437
Sleepy...

214
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,137
I know you're tired,

215
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,337
but please try to stay awake for a while.

216
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:28,337
No! Sleepy...

217
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:31,037
I'm the one who wants to cry.

218
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:38,537
Pop Candy.

219
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:41,337
Pop Candy?

220
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:44,037
You mean the man who gave you this?

221
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:45,637
Yes!

222
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:47,037
I see.

223
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:50,037
"Yamanaka"

224
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,437
This is?

225
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:58,037
"Shop, 27th, 5 pm"

226
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,237
Today at 5 pm at the shop?

227
00:14:01,837 --> 00:14:04,037
4:30 pm.

228
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:05,937
I don't have much time.

229
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,437
Santa, you all right?

230
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,737
About your neighbor Mr. Yamanaka,

231
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,637
does he own a pet shop?

232
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:32,537
Yes, I've heard previously that he was selling birds and goldfish.

233
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,537
Could you please tell me the location and the name of the shop?

234
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:36,737
Please!

235
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:39,837
I think it was Beika City's 3rd District?

236
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,837
But it seems his shop already went bankrupt.

237
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,837
He's going to the shop that went bankrupt at 5 pm.

238
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:49,037
Could it be that Santa's mom is there?

239
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,859
Enjoying this, aren't you?

240
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,259
Well, beats crying at me.

241
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,659
"Pet Shop Yamanaka"

242
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:16,959
So that's why.

243
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,859
I actually prevented the kid from chasing that Pop Candy.

244
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,859
No wonder this little one was upset.

245
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,659
Hey, sir!

246
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,859
What is it, you kids?

247
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,459
We're looking for someone.

248
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,359
The mother of Santa...

249
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,359
-She's here, isn't she? -I don't think so.

250
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,959
Except for me, no one else is here.

251
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,559
I'm sorry but I'm very busy.

252
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,159
Can you please leave?

253
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,559
Say, about that bird in the cage,

254
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,259
isn't it a black-eye?

255
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,859
Black-eye?

256
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,959
No, it's a white-eye.

257
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,559
Is that so?

258
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,759
It's written right here.

259
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,159
The black-eye species is protected by our country.

260
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,859
It gets its name from the black patch around its eyes.

261
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:15,859
The yellow feathers from the neck to its chest are its characteristic.

262
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,259
Its favorite food is papaya.

263
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:19,959
No, it's wrong!

264
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,159
If that bird is really a black-eye, the endangered species...

265
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,059
It could sell for a fortune, right?

266
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,659
I said go home!

267
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,159
Sir, you were in this kid's home, weren't you?

268
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,359
This feather had fallen in the room.

269
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,459
My guess is it got stuck on your clothes

270
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,659
and was transferred there.

271
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,059
No! I don't remember!

272
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:43,759
Sir, I think you'll get a lighter punishment

273
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,959
if you turn yourself into the police.

274
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,459
The police?

275
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,059
Why do I have to go to the police?

276
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,359
I don't have time for kids!

277
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,659
If you don't leave, you'll regret it!

278
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,059
Listen to me for a little bit more.

279
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,559
I think you misunderstood.

280
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,759
About what?

281
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,659
This figure was near the door, right?

282
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,959
The one who put it there was Santa.

283
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,159
Santa.

284
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,659
This kid?

285
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,459
Sir, you gave Santa a piece of candy before, right?

286
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,659
This was a gift for you.

287
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:18,959
A gift?

288
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,159
The reason for the name "Santa"

289
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,759
is because this kid loves Santa Claus.

290
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,559
That why this kid wants to give others presents, too.

291
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
Santa Claus...

292
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
Presents?

293
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,759
The one who placed it there was this kid?

294
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,159
As a present...

295
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,359
I see.

296
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,959
That's what it was.

297
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:46,859
Sir, this Santa loves you very much.

298
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,859
I think you are highly trusted.

299
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,859
You can't let Santa cry, now can you?

300
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,359
Santa,

301
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,059
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,159
Mama!

303
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,759
My shop hasn't been doing well,

304
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,659
and my debts grew larger and larger.

305
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:19,859
That's why I didn't want others to find out,

306
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,559
and fled to the mountains in Ogasawara.

307
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,859
I found a black-eye there.

308
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,559
A bird that was said to be extinct from that Island.

309
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,159
So Kurata, the man I borrowed money from

310
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,359
said he'd sell it for me to an upstart colleague of his who loves animals.

311
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,859
But, soon afterward,

312
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,259
a black-eye figure is paced at my door by someone.

313
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:49,559
Then, I saw that woman walk away with a suggestive smile,

314
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,959
as if she knew everything.

315
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,359
That woman must've noticed the black-eye!

316
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,459
I thought the figure and her smile were a silent threat.

317
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:03,259
I was only getting my child back.

318
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,559
But you hired that media-buzzing detective.

319
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,759
I didn't want my deal to be broken off,

320
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,059
so I thought that, if you had any evidence against me,

321
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,959
I'd take it away. That's why I searched your home.

322
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,459
Santa was smiling so cutely

323
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,759
while looking into the capsule vending machines,

324
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,359
that I couldn't help but to hand out a candy.

325
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,659
And yet I misunderstood the figurine gift,

326
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,059
and the goodwill of the child.

327
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,759
Boy, I vow to become a man

328
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:41,559
who's suitable for getting presents from Santa.

329
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,259
Please take care of that black-eye.

330
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,959
Pops, here!

331
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,159
What?

332
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,959
A black-eye figure.

333
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,659
Sir, look closely.

334
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,259
That bird's a white-eye.

335
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,359
What?

336
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,759
White-eye?

337
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,459
No, the color around its eye is black,

338
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,859
so it's a black-eye.

339
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,259
Wrong.

340
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:06,159
It's just that the white paint fell off,

341
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,259
exposing the original black inside.

342
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,859
What?

343
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,259
It's true.

344
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,359
The paint merely fell off.

345
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,459
I viewed this with impure eyes,

346
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:21,859
that's why I failed to notice It.

347
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:25,259
Santa, I'll cherish it.

348
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,559
Cherish!

349
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,059
I've heard your entire stupid conversation.

350
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,759
You're going to the police.

351
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,359
-Then I'll take this black-eye. -You can't!

352
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,159
I'm returning this bird back to its island!

353
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,859
-Shut up! -Stop it!

354
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,559
Back off, brat.

355
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,759
I'm calling the police!

356
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,659
Call them if you can.

357
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,859
No!

358
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,259
Hang up the phone!

359
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,359
Understand, so please release my child!

360
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,859
Until I'm somewhere safe,

361
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,959
this brat is going to keep me company.

362
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,059
-Santa! -Kurata!

363
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,859
What? Did it malfunction because of the struggle?

364
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:08,559
Kurata, let go!

365
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,059
Don't move. Don't you move a bit!

366
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,159
Now!

367
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,259
Go!

368
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,359
Well, the police said they would consider Yamanaka's circumstances.

369
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,959
I see.

370
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:05,859
You've very considerate, Santa.

371
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,859
What's going on, Santa?

372
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,959
Wearing a ribbon like that.

373
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:13,459
It's a gift from Ran.

374
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,059
That fits you perfectly, Haruka.

375
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,759
Haruka?

376
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,259
Could it be that Santa is a girl?

377
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:21,959
Yes.

378
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,259
But I can't believe you figured that out.

379
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,859
It was when she first hugged me.

380
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,859
I've heard that baby girls hug

381
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,559
with their whole bodies.

382
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,059
Conan, so you've known that too?

383
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:39,459
No. I didn't.

384
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,759
Actually, I noticed that while we were in the bathroom.

385
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,159
You didn't notice even you were with her all this time?

386
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,159
Is that so?

387
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,559
Is this funny?

388
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,159
All right, come and have fun some other time!

389
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,059
And bring your mom.

390
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,659
"Bring your mom",

391
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,459
I know you'd say that.

392
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,359
Hot Spring Park?

393
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,459
It looks like fun!

394
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,959
Let's stop over there.

395
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,659
Let's check out the iron tub first!

396
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,359
Something strange.

397
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,559
Someone stood up on top of the cliff

398
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,359
and threw the rock off on Mr. Umezu.

399
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,159
This is not an accident but a murder!

400
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,459
I've figured out the trick that the culprit played on!

401
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:32,859
Next Conan,

402
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:36,683
"Murder Intent Raining on Outdoor Spa"

403
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,370
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,570
"Towel"

405
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,170
The stage for the next episode will be at an Outdoor Spa.

406
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,670
Mixed bath.

407
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,870
Pop.
