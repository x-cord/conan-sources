1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,866
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:04,566
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,466
The case at the "spider mansion" becomes more complicated.

4
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,466
Ran and Kazuha are in a danger situation.

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,966
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,904
We were called out to the Takeda's home

9
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,304
at Trick Ridge in Tottori Prefecture.

10
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:01,904
Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama

11
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,404
get lost in the forest

12
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:06,504
and meet up with an American by the name of Robert Taylor.

13
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:10,904
We happen to pass by and find out that

14
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,504
we had all been called out to the Takeda home

15
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,704
to solve the mystery of the curse at the "spider mansion".

16
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,504
On the night we arrive,

17
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,004
the eldest son of the Takeda family,

18
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:24,304
Nobukazu, commits suicide on the second floor of the doll storehouse.

19
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:28,304
Furthermore, someone suspicious appears behind Kazuha...

20
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:37,404
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 2)"

21
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:39,304
I'm sorry!

22
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,704
Kazuha! I've found the mascot I was looking for!

23
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,404
It was caught on the cover of the CD player.

24
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,604
Huh?

25
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:48,904
Kazuha? Where are you?

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,004
Kazuha's penlight.

27
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,504
Kazuha.

28
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,204
Kazuha?

29
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:58,804
Kazuha!

30
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:04,004
Hey, look at this!

31
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:07,304
Looks like he's been hit on the back of the head with something.

32
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,804
What?

33
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:12,104
Then, the murderer hit him and then...

34
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:16,104
The time of death is about 9pm.

35
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:20,404
Just around the time Nobukazu left the living room.

36
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:21,404
At that time,

37
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:24,704
he had already been called out by the murderer.

38
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,504
And, the murderer met Nobukazu here, hit him on the head

39
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:32,404
put him unconscious. Then, strung him up by the neck.

40
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:33,504
That's right!

41
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,604
He wrapped a lot of string around the body

42
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:39,104
to make it look like the curse of the Spider Empress.

43
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:42,804
But, I don't understand.

44
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,204
How did the murderer

45
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,904
escape from the room after he committed the crime?

46
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:50,704
Nobukazu's sandals and flashlight

47
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:54,504
scattered on the floor also bothers me.

48
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:57,104
It's also strange that there's no dust on the shelves and floor.

49
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,704
The room was supposed to have been left alone for three years.

50
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:03,204
Hey, kid.

51
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:05,704
Oh, that small window.

52
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,904
A child can barely fit through it,

53
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:11,504
but is there something to it?

54
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:14,404
A reason why it had to be left open...

55
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:17,004
No. I thought I heard

56
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:19,504
Ran's voice outside the window.

57
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,504
-Huh? -And, Kazuha's voice too.

58
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:23,804
Idiot!

59
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:28,904
Those two are probably in their room fast asleep.

60
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:31,004
Hey! What was that sound?

61
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,704
The stairs.

62
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,604
Someone's coming up the stairs.

63
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:41,604
Heavy feet... It's not Ran.

64
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,604
Who'd be coming here?

65
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,404
Never mind.

66
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:50,004
Let's meet him in person

67
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:52,304
and ask him what the reason is!

68
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:56,004
Good grief... it's the housekeeper.

69
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,104
What's the matter?

70
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,704
I thought you'd be hungry,

71
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,704
so I brought you some rice balls and tea.

72
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:04,704
Oh, this looks delicious.

73
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:08,604
Kazuha! Are you here?

74
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:11,004
Answer me if you're here.

75
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,604
Kazuha!

76
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:19,904
Misa Takeda who died three years ago, you knew her.

77
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:24,104
Yes, we were nurses at the same hospital

78
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:28,704
but, the work was too hard for me and I quit.

79
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:33,204
I became a housekeeper here through Misa's introduction.

80
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:34,704
Thank you.

81
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:37,804
Misa was a really a nice girl,

82
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,504
always alert and kind.

83
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:42,504
But... why?

84
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:45,504
Why does a person like that have to commit suicide?

85
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,804
Just maybe... that could be the reason.

86
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,604
Misa's father, Nobukazu,

87
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:55,804
came home from the hospital for some reason,

88
00:05:55,804 --> 00:06:00,204
he grabbed his wife, Kinuyo, and was in great anger.

89
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:04,904
He said, "You really deceived me for the past 20 years!"

90
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:07,904
Deceived him... about what?

91
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:11,504
Well... I have no idea.

92
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,004
And, that's when Misa got badly hurt.

93
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:16,404
Badly hurt?

94
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:20,004
Yes. Misa went between them to stop the fight,

95
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,804
but Nobukazu pushed her aside.

96
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,604
She hit her head on a pillar

97
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:26,404
and had to have 7 stitches on her forehead.

98
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:29,104
Misa became gloomy

99
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:31,804
and rested from work at the hospital

100
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:34,004
until she met Robert.

101
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,604
Robert?

102
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,804
The day of a landslide, three years ago...

103
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:41,804
Misa accidentally found him.

104
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:44,504
He was caught in a landslide while taking photos

105
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,504
and was badly hurt.

106
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:50,604
Unfortunately, the hospital rooms were filled that day.

107
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:53,904
Misa had no choice, so she had him treated at the hospital

108
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,704
and brought him here and took care of him.

109
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:00,004
In the beginning, she had a hard time taking care of him.

110
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,704
The inside of Robert's mouth was cut-up with the landslide

111
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,504
and he couldn't speak well.

112
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,404
Robert could speak Japanese,

113
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,204
but it seems he couldn't read or write it

114
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,604
and the conversation with Misa

115
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:16,004
took place on paper with Roman letters.

116
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:19,304
But, when Robert got better and was able to talk,

117
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,504
they seem to be enjoying things.

118
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:24,304
They told all sorts of jokes.

119
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,704
"Japanese foods are delicious,

120
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:30,104
especially on rainy days, dirt and sand are excellent"

121
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,704
or "I'm a prince of a certain country,

122
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:35,804
and I came to find a bride who is like a light".

123
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,304
By the time Robert's wounds had healed

124
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:39,204
and a farewell party was to be held,

125
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,904
Ryuji and his family were home

126
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,504
and he became friends with them too.

127
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,404
Misa also became bright again.

128
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:50,504
But, that makes it more confusing.

129
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,204
Wasn't it two to three days after Robert went home,

130
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,604
that Misa committed suicide?

131
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,304
I don't really know,

132
00:07:57,304 --> 00:08:01,704
but after Robert went home, Misa became gloomy again.

133
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,104
She suddenly disappeared

134
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:06,304
and everyone thought she ran away from home.

135
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:09,204
Yuzo is the one who found Misa dead

136
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,504
on the second floor of the storehouse.

137
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:15,404
And, several days later,

138
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:21,704
her mother, Kinuyo, also committed suicide in the storehouse.

139
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,304
After the two died,

140
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:26,204
was there anybody who had a change in attitude?

141
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:27,804
Well...

142
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:33,704
Nobukazu came to the funeral without tears or sad expression,

143
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,804
but on the other hand, Ryuji was the one who was a big problem.

144
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:40,404
He cried in a voice so loud it echoed

145
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,704
throughout the neighborhood.

146
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:45,804
The other would be Sae and Emi.

147
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,404
Oh, those twins.

148
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:52,504
Those two were such good friends with Robert, but...

149
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:56,004
2 years ago, when they came back to visit,

150
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,504
they suddenly started saying something strange.

151
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,604
It was Robert.

152
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:04,104
Robert is the one who killed Misa.

153
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:05,404
Isn't it terrible?

154
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:07,704
Terrible...

155
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:11,704
But, why did the children say something like that?

156
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:13,104
I don't know.

157
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,104
Mr. Negishi who came to pick up the dolls

158
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,104
was also surprised

159
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:19,204
because after they talked to him,

160
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,604
they suddenly started saying those things.

161
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,404
What did they talk about?

162
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,604
Well...

163
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:28,804
Mr. Negishi said they only asked him his name.

164
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:36,004
That's the Mr. Negishi who died in the barn the other day.

165
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:38,504
Everyone was at the neighborhood gathering.

166
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,404
Yoko came home ahead of the others to prepare dinner

167
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:43,704
and found him in the barn.

168
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:46,504
At that time, weren't you around?

169
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:49,804
Nobukazu and I were at the supermarket

170
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:51,504
buying the ingredients for dinner.

171
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,004
With Nobukazu?

172
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,504
Yes.

173
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,204
After his wife died,

174
00:09:56,204 --> 00:10:00,004
Nobukazu took control of the household money.

175
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:05,504
By the way, the rope used to hang Nobukazu

176
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,104
and the string around him...

177
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,604
can they be found in this storehouse?

178
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:12,204
Yes, if it's the string, there's a lot of it

179
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:16,204
because it's used to make the marionettes.

180
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:18,204
But, the ropes are in the barn.

181
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,804
Would you like to go and see them?

182
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,804
It's raining hard.

183
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:30,104
Hey, Kudo. Do you know who it is? The murderer?

184
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:32,704
Nope... not who the murderer is or the sealed room trick...

185
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,404
not a single lead.

186
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,704
After Nobukazu left the living room,

187
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,404
Robert went to the barn to get the car

188
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,804
and left with Ran and Kazuha,

189
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,204
he didn't go near the storehouse even once.

190
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:43,704
It's impossible to be him.

191
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:47,004
Yoko, who was in the bath with the twins,

192
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:50,104
the housekeeper who was cleaning up in the living room with us

193
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:53,904
and the old lady who was in her room are also clean.

194
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:57,804
The ones that could have done anything are

195
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:00,504
Ryuji, the one making the bath and...

196
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:03,804
Yuzo, who was looking all over the house for Nobukazu.

197
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,704
Those two...

198
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:08,504
But, something bugs me...

199
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,404
something...

200
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,904
The string, isn't it?

201
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,004
Right, right... that's it!

202
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,304
Why did the murderer have to use the string

203
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,004
to make it look a curse?

204
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:21,904
It was a sealed room.

205
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,604
If he didn't do a thing like that,

206
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:27,304
we would have thought it was a suicide.

207
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:30,604
And that request letter that was sent to you

208
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:32,604
also bothers me.

209
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,904
If that was sent by the murderer,

210
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:38,604
is he taking me lightly and putting up a challenge?

211
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:41,204
This case...

212
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:45,204
something fishy is running behind it.

213
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,304
Let's see... the rope is...

214
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:51,404
Is somebody there?

215
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,504
Ran?

216
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:58,404
What's that? Kazuha is missing?

217
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,704
Is she really?

218
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,104
Only her penlight was on the ground.

219
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:06,904
When I thought someone carried her off, I panicked...

220
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:10,504
Anyway, let's split up and search for her!

221
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:15,204
Kazuha! Where are you?

222
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:16,204
Hey!

223
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:18,404
Kazuha!

224
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:21,604
Hey! Have you found her?

225
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:23,604
Nope, she's nowhere...

226
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:32,604
What's the matter? Hattori?

227
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:34,304
The door to the storehouse.

228
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,404
I thought I closed it but, it's open.

229
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:46,804
This is...

230
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,804
Ka...

231
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,104
Kazuha!

232
00:12:58,493 --> 00:12:59,793
Kazuha!

233
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:01,693
Hey! Get a hold of yourself, Kazuha!

234
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:06,593
Kazuha...

235
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,193
Heiji...

236
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:09,393
Kazuha!

237
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,993
What happened to me?

238
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,293
If I'm not mistaken...

239
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,893
I was waiting for Ran in front of the storehouse, but...

240
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,893
I suddenly felt faint.

241
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:23,393
Be quiet! I'll cut you loose right now.

242
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:25,293
Kazuha!

243
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:27,393
You don't have to worry.

244
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:29,793
Looks like you were just hanging with the strings.

245
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,593
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Kazuha!

246
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:33,893
I didn't search hard enough,

247
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,893
and got you into this terrible situation.

248
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,993
Then the mascot?

249
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,093
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:43,193
I found it, it was caught in the cover of the CD player.

251
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:46,693
I'm really sorry... if I had taken a closer look...

252
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,793
I'm glad you found it...

253
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:51,093
Don't lose it again.

254
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:55,993
Hey, Hattori.

255
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,093
I know!

256
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,393
Old man! Please take care of Kazuha!

257
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:01,293
Huh?

258
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:02,593
What?

259
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,193
Don't you see?

260
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:08,093
He tried to use our blind-spot by hanging Kazuha up

261
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:11,293
in the storehouse we were in a while ago.

262
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:14,593
After we left, he brought Kazuha here

263
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,493
and wrapped her in the strings...

264
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,493
there all he had to do was put that rope around her neck

265
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,293
and the curse would be completed.

266
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:24,293
There's only one reason why he had to stop.

267
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:27,493
The murderer noticed my footsteps when I ran over here,

268
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,593
and he left in a hurry.

269
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,093
Which means...

270
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:37,293
The murderer is still in this storehouse.

271
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:45,893
Hey, Kudo! Are my deductions wrong?

272
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:48,793
No, nothing's wrong!

273
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:52,793
Then, let's have a look at the murderer's face.

274
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,093
Hey, is he around?

275
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,293
Nope.

276
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:02,993
That's strange,

277
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:06,593
it hasn't been 3 minutes since we came to this storehouse.

278
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:09,193
We were guarding the entrance on the first floor

279
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:11,693
and there's no place to hide.

280
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:14,993
The only place to escape from would be that tiny window.

281
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,893
Is it really possible?

282
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:21,393
Is there a way to get out from there in such a short time?

283
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,993
What? This time that girl from Osaka was attacked?

284
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,093
By who?

285
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,893
I don't know.

286
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,193
Kazuha is resting in the room right now,

287
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:35,193
but she may remember in time...

288
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:39,493
one of the faces among you.

289
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:42,393
One reason we had you gather here

290
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:45,193
is to prevent anymore murders from taking place

291
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:49,193
and the other is to confirm your alibis.

292
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,193
Alibis?

293
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:54,293
We were asleep in our rooms all this time.

294
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,693
It's the same for me.

295
00:15:55,693 --> 00:16:00,293
I was in my room too, but I wasn't asleep.

296
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,693
Where were you?

297
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:04,993
I didn't see you when we were searching.

298
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:07,493
I was searching outside the house.

299
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:10,993
In other words, everyone doesn't have an alibi.

300
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,893
You're kidding.

301
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,993
Yuzo isn't around?

302
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:20,093
Oh, if it's Yuzo, wouldn't he be in the workshop?

303
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,293
Oh, me?

304
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,993
I was here working all the time.

305
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,993
I was putting the finishing touches on the doll

306
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:31,193
that brother had to complete by tomorrow.

307
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:35,093
You can make dolls too.

308
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,993
Three years ago, my company went bankrupt

309
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,593
and I came back home.

310
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:42,793
Brother taught me all sorts of things

311
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:48,493
and let me do the simple constructions.

312
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,093
Three years ago...

313
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,693
that's the time of that incident.

314
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:56,693
Yes, I came home just after Robert had left.

315
00:16:56,693 --> 00:17:02,593
But, I wasn't allowed to make fixtures or do repairs.

316
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:05,993
Brother's marionettes cost $10,000 a piece

317
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:09,093
and he charged $7,000 for repairs.

318
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,593
He sold them for $10,000 and repaired them for $7,000?

319
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:15,293
Can he do business like that?

320
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:18,393
Yes, seems like there are some people

321
00:17:18,393 --> 00:17:21,093
who request repairs more than 10 times.

322
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:26,293
He charged quite a bit for the marionettes.

323
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,393
With the money he saved,

324
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:33,593
he often went abroad with Mr. Negishi to play.

325
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,893
After leaving the sales of the dolls to Mr. Negishi,

326
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:40,793
they began to sell at high prices.

327
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:45,093
What's that big doll?

328
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:50,993
Oh, that's the marionette of the Spider Empress.

329
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:54,593
When Father was alive, dolls of that size

330
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:59,593
were used at every festival to do plays of the Spider Empress,

331
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:02,293
but the number of people able to handle dolls that big

332
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:06,093
gradually disappeared and they quit doing it.

333
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:09,393
What are those boxes that are stacked up?

334
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,693
Oh, it's the dolls that Mr. Negishi

335
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,593
was suppose to take that day.

336
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,493
After Mr. Negishi died,

337
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:20,593
brother realized that he was one doll short.

338
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:25,293
The customer called directly

339
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:27,793
and he had to make one more.

340
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:33,793
Anyway, please stay in the room everyone is gathered in.

341
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,893
It's dangerous to be by yourself.

342
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:37,193
Sure.

343
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:40,993
All right, now's our chance.

344
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:43,793
The repair fees for the dolls are extremely high.

345
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:46,293
Despite the price, there are customer

346
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,793
who request repairs more than 10 times.

347
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:53,293
A simple puppet that's expensive means...

348
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,893
What's inside is probably...

349
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,493
narcotics.

350
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,593
As for the marionettes...

351
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,093
you can only put the narcotics in the head,

352
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,793
so the price is cheaper.

353
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:10,193
I've got it.

354
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,293
Now I know the reason why Nobukazu called a detective

355
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,293
to find out who the murderer is.

356
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:19,193
A large part of the entire picture has come into view.

357
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:22,793
What's left that we don't know is the sealed-room trick

358
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:26,293
and why Kazuha had to be attacked.

359
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,593
Sae!

360
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:28,893
Emi!

361
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:31,993
What is it? What's the matter?

362
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:34,693
The two daughters I brought to the restroom aren't here.

363
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,193
What's that?

364
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,093
Mother.

365
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:42,093
You worried me.

366
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,293
Didn't I tell you to wait in front of the restroom

367
00:19:44,293 --> 00:19:45,493
when you were through?

368
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:47,693
But, there was a smell.

369
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,893
There sure was... a funny smell.

370
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,593
It's probably the spider children burning in the furnace.

371
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,093
They're burning.

372
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,693
Grandmother said so, didn't she?

373
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:57,593
She did!

374
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,093
The furnace?

375
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:08,193
It's true, there's something strange burning in here.

376
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:11,993
Hey, come to think of it, what was the meaning of that?

377
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,593
You know, you said it, didn't you?

378
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:16,093
You told Robert... "murderer"

379
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:17,693
The day Robert was leaving,

380
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:20,993
Misa told us to go and ask him what his feelings were,

381
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,093
so we went to the bus stop.

382
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:27,093
We asked him, "How do you feel about Misa?"

383
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,493
Then, Robert wrote a terrible thing down on paper.

384
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:31,493
Didn't he?

385
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,993
A terrible thing?

386
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,793
He wrote, "Die!"

387
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:35,793
Die?

388
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:38,793
-It's terrible! -Terrible...

389
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:43,193
Don't let it bother you. The children probably saw wrong.

390
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:46,293
I shouldn't have shown that name card.

391
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,693
Name card?

392
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,393
Let's see... I'm sure I...

393
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:52,993
Here, this is it.

394
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:00,693
They found this name card inside the wallet

395
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,093
and made a lot of noise.

396
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:07,293
They asked, "Who did you get this from?", "Where is this person?"

397
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:08,793
Look at this.

398
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:12,593
I got it out somehow.

399
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:14,193
-Hey, this is... -No way...

400
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,793
You're kidding.

401
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,893
Isn't it a stun gun?

402
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,993
-Kazuha! -Oh, Heiji!

403
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,693
I feel much better now.

404
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,893
Take off your clothes!

405
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,293
-Huh? -Never mind, just let me see!

406
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:31,993
-What're you doing? -Wait a minute, Conan!

407
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,693
Why am I the only one to get hit?

408
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,893
Well, I'm a child.

409
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:41,593
It's here.

410
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,293
Small burn marks on her back.

411
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:47,293
She was knocked out with a stun gun after all.

412
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:50,293
And? Did she say anything else?

413
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:51,993
She didn't see the murderer,

414
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,793
but she said she found a strange ball in front of the storehouse.

415
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,193
Ball?

416
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:59,693
She said that it was a ball about this small.

417
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,293
BB shot!

418
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:03,293
That's it!

419
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:04,993
There was that method!

420
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,693
If that's so...

421
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,193
That thing...

422
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,893
Should be somewhere...

423
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,693
In this room.

424
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:15,293
I found it! Hattori, it's here!

425
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,993
The marks of a thumbtack!

426
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:19,493
I've found it too.

427
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:23,393
Strange string with loops on the beam ends.

428
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:26,293
It's just as we thought, isn't it?

429
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:33,793
There's no mistake. That person is the murderer!

430
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:08,593
The murderer didn't need to escape from here.

431
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,193
That's crazy!

432
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:13,793
It was to avenge Misa

433
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:17,493
who committed suicide in this storehouse three years ago!

434
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:20,093
Mi... Misa's revenge?

435
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:23,893
There's only one person who could have done it

436
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,293
without anyone noticing!

437
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:27,693
And, that's you!

438
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,493
Next Conan,

439
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:33,514
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Final)"

440
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,611
Next Conan's Hint:

441
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:38,411
"Roman letters"
