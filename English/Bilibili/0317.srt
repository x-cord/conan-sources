1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.140
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.740
The scene of the crime is filmed on videotape.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.940
Conan's deduction rips off the mask.

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:41.867
Ran and I accompanied Pops on the job

9
00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.367
to go see a professional wrestling match.

10
00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:47.167
The main event of the day was

11
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.767
the title match between junior heavyweight champion, Wolf Face,

12
00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.767
and the young ace, Hyota Nagase.

13
00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:57.967
However, just before the match...

14
00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.067
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

15
00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.167
Hey, Nagase!

16
00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:02.967
Hurry up and come out!

17
00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:09.767
Mr. Nagase was killed in the waiting room!

18
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:13.267
Coincidentally, the scene of the crime was videotaped.

19
00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.467
This is...

20
00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:18.867
Wolf Face?

21
00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:27.167
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 2)"

22
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:28.767
"Tohto Kokugikan"

23
00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.867
Is it true that Wrestler Nagase was killed?

24
00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.167
Tell us!

25
00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.667
What happened with the police announcement?

26
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.067
All right then, from the person on the right,

27
00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.667
please give me your name

28
00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.967
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

29
00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:45.967
Yeah.

30
00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.567
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -I'm Iwao Ushigome.

31
00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.167
At around 7:20 pm,

32
00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.867
I was watching the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

33
00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.767
Because he gets angry if I don't watch his match closely.

34
00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.067
Is there anyone else who was watching with you?

35
00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:00.467
No, I was alone.

36
00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:04.567
Well, someone in the audience may have remembered seeing me,

37
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:09.067
but they were all absorbed in watching the match.

38
00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.467
Same here, I was watching Mr. Kiba's match alone too.

39
00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.367
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -My name is Hiroyuki Sakuma!

40
00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.467
But right after Mr. Kiba's match,

41
00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:21.467
I came to this room to get Mr. Nagase!

42
00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.667
Because his match was right afterwards.

43
00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.067
Are you sure?

44
00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.267
It's true!

45
00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:32.067
I heard this man say, "Nagase, hurry up and come out!"

46
00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:36.567
But it's after the time the murder was committed.

47
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.567
Then, next, you, the one wearing the wolf mask!

48
00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:43.067
I'd like you to remove your mask and talk to us.

49
00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.267
Inspector, he doesn't speak Japanese.

50
00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:48.667
Because Wolf Face is Mexican.

51
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.067
And besides,

52
00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:52.967
he can't take off his mask in front of women and children.

53
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.867
It's fine, Sakuma.

54
00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:02.167
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -They already know who I am.

55
00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:07.367
You're the one with the handsome face

56
00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.467
but super weak wrestler, Takaharu Ogami?

57
00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.267
Yes.

58
00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.467
No way!

59
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:18.667
I saw you in the Tohto Sports Newspaper this morning too.

60
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:22.367
See! Here's a picture of you and Wolf side by side!

61
00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.967
That's...

62
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.167
That's Sakuma!

63
00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.467
He plays Wolf Face in my place to deceive

64
00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:31.967
all the reporters and fans who come to the gym and the match grounds

65
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:34.667
trying to reveal the identity of Wolf Face!

66
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.067
I see...

67
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:39.967
But the mask that you just removed

68
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:41.667
and the mask in the picture

69
00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.767
look somewhat slightly different.

70
00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.567
That's the mask I use when I eat!

71
00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:48.967
It's made of thinner material with less decorations on it,

72
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.867
and the opening of the mouth part is made larger to make eating easier!

73
00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:53.967
I see.

74
00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:55.367
But what a shock to find out that

75
00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:58.967
the identity of Wolf Face is Wrestler Ogami.

76
00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:00.267
Is this all right?

77
00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:05.967
Aren't you the one who lost to Wolf Face

78
00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:07.067
at Mascara Contra Mascara,

79
00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:10.067
and vanished soon after the match, Leonardo Rossi?

80
00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:11.467
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Yes!

81
00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:14.667
Mascara?

82
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.867
Mascara Contra Mascara.

83
00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.967
It's a match in which you fight to remove your opponent's mask!

84
00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:21.567
The loser takes off his mask!

85
00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:24.067
Well, what a surprise.

86
00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:26.467
I thought that you resigned.

87
00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:28.267
I'm more surprised that you know so much

88
00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:30.267
about professional wrestling.

89
00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:34.067
Leo had his mind set on resigning when he lost to me,

90
00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.167
but Mr. Kiba convinced him otherwise.

91
00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:38.767
And he debuted once again in Japan

92
00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.167
wearing a Wolf Face mask with a different color.

93
00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:45.567
Then, he gathered popularity as Wolf Face's shadow.

94
00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:48.467
He was supposed to be the junior heavyweight challenger

95
00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.767
after Nagase.

96
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.967
But who would've foreseen that anything like this would happen.

97
00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:59.967
And? Where were you all around 7:20 pm?

98
00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.967
Since it was just before I go out to fight the match,

99
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:04.067
I was alone doing warm-up exercises

100
00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:06.467
in the waiting room of the foreign wrestlers.

101
00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.167
All the other foreign wrestlers

102
00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.467
had gone to see Mr. Kiba's match.

103
00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:15.067
And were you watching Mr. Kiba's match too?

104
00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:17.967
Yes.

105
00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:21.967
Which means all four of you don't have an alibi.

106
00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.767
No, Inspector!

107
00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:28.767
This murder couldn't have been committed without Wolf Face's mask!

108
00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:29.967
Which means that the killer is

109
00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:31.567
one of the two who had free access

110
00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:34.467
in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

111
00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:39.567
No, Wolf Face's masks are kept inside a bag

112
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:43.067
and hidden in the toilet where only authorized personnel have access,

113
00:06:43.067 --> 00:06:45.767
so that we can wear the mask in secret.

114
00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:48.667
If not, people will suspect me for being Wolf Face,

115
00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.767
because they'll see me going in and out of the foreigners' waiting room.

116
00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:53.967
I see...

117
00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:57.967
Of course we handed the bag over to the forensic officers already.

118
00:06:57.967 --> 00:06:59.467
Darn it!

119
00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:03.867
Only if the victim left a dying message or something.

120
00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.667
What's the matter, Ran?

121
00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.967
Remember I said a while ago

122
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:12.967
about the professional wrestling skill that is popular in Karate club?

123
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:16.967
The name of the technique resembles Dying Message.

124
00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:20.967
Maybe you're talking about Diving Body Attack?

125
00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:23.567
The one that Mil Mascaras used to do!

126
00:07:23.567 --> 00:07:24.867
Oh, well.

127
00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:28.967
Then, what about Bruiser Brody's Flying Knee Drop

128
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:31.867
or Funk's Spinning Toe Hold?

129
00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:34.867
If I'm not mistaken, it was the technique of a Japanese wrestler.

130
00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:37.667
Then it must be Mr. Muto's...

131
00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.067
Well, putting that aside.

132
00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:50.067
We'll staying here a while longer and continuing investigations,

133
00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:54.367
so I need all of you to wait in another room with Officer Takagi.

134
00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.167
Please say something!

135
00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:03.567
Ran, take that brat with you and go outside too!

136
00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.467
Okay!

137
00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:07.267
I'm sorry, Officer Takagi.

138
00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:08.667
No problem.

139
00:08:10.767 --> 00:08:11.867
Is it true?

140
00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.667
Wait!

141
00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.767
Amazing. Look at the number of reporters here.

142
00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:21.067
It's the wrestler that did the bloody match.

143
00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.467
Are you all right, Mr. Kayama?

144
00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:27.967
You look like a mummy.

145
00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:29.867
It's you.

146
00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:32.167
It's nothing.

147
00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:35.667
By the way, is it true that Nagase was stabbed?

148
00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.467
Yeah.

149
00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:49.467
Hey, Officer Takagi.

150
00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:53.067
I have two things I want to ask you.

151
00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:54.067
What is it?

152
00:08:54.067 --> 00:08:56.767
You know the mask man...

153
00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:00.467
Yeah, that's right!

154
00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.167
I heard that they're all that way in the beginning.

155
00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.367
And all masks are more or less that way.

156
00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:07.867
The same goes for Wolf Face's mask!

157
00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.867
Conan, where are you going?

158
00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:13.567
I forgot something!

159
00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:17.667
What do you want?

160
00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:20.267
I forgot something.

161
00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:23.167
Now, where did I put it...

162
00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:33.767
Inspector! We got a report from the forensic officer!

163
00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:36.167
Okay!

164
00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:39.167
The blood on the mask that was found in the restroom

165
00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.467
was determined to be that of the victim's,

166
00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:45.967
and the remnants of hair and eyebrows that were found inside of the mask

167
00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:50.467
were the same as those found on the other Wolf Face masks,

168
00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:54.067
Which means that the mask was worn

169
00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:57.867
only by its original owner, Mr. Ogami.

170
00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:01.667
And what about the victim's nails?

171
00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.967
Although a thorough investigation was made,

172
00:10:03.967 --> 00:10:05.967
nothing was found.

173
00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:07.467
That's strange.

174
00:10:07.467 --> 00:10:10.467
If he tried to tear the mask off,

175
00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:15.167
the killer's skin or something should've been found left on his nails.

176
00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:17.867
Just as I thought.

177
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.667
There's no mistake about it!

178
00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:23.867
It's the one who couldn't become a wolf!

179
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:31.389
At any rate, Inspector!

180
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:34.889
It is an undeniable fact that inside of the Wolf Face's mask

181
00:10:34.889 --> 00:10:38.689
that the killer was wearing while killing the victim,

182
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:40.789
only the hair and eyebrows of Wrestler Ogami were found.

183
00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:45.789
We have no choice but to judge him to be the killer!

184
00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:49.589
But even Mr. Ogami knew that

185
00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:52.189
the TV station had set a video camera up in this room

186
00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:54.889
where the murder was committed, right?

187
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:57.289
Why would he go out of his way to wear his mask and commit the crime,

188
00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.789
knowing that it would draw suspicion to himself?

189
00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:04.489
That's probably exactly what he was after.

190
00:11:04.489 --> 00:11:07.289
He probably figured everyone would think so

191
00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.989
and used it to his advantage.

192
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:15.889
Well, I think that if we call Ogami back here again,

193
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:18.089
he'll confess what he did!

194
00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:21.189
Because he doesn't seem to be such a bad person to begin with.

195
00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:22.689
What is this?

196
00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:25.989
There's something strange about this mask!

197
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:27.089
See.

198
00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:30.889
Look in the back of the mask that the killer was wearing.

199
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.789
In the back?

200
00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:38.889
The design of the mask is different

201
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:41.789
from the one that Mr. Ogami was wearing a while ago.

202
00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:43.189
Design?

203
00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:45.989
You're right.

204
00:11:45.989 --> 00:11:49.789
The mask a while ago had more fur at the back.

205
00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:53.089
The mask in this video doesn't.

206
00:11:53.089 --> 00:11:55.489
Then... Do you mean this mask is an imitation?

207
00:11:55.489 --> 00:11:59.589
Probably a replica or something that was sold at stores for fans.

208
00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:01.189
No, I don't think so.

209
00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:03.789
Wrong!

210
00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.089
This mask is the one

211
00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:08.289
that was around when Wolf Face made his debut!

212
00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:13.189
Mr. Ogami said that the old masks were also in the bag,

213
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:17.589
so the killer probably just happened to pick this old mask.

214
00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:22.689
Hey, I thought I told you to keep an eye on the four suspects?

215
00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:26.089
Well, Ran asked me to come check

216
00:12:26.089 --> 00:12:28.889
because Conan didn't come back so...

217
00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:31.189
Which means that the design of the mask

218
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:34.289
has nothing to do with the murder?

219
00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:36.489
Yes, probably not.

220
00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.689
So, he says.

221
00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:39.889
So, that's...

222
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:44.689
Then what was that for, kid?

223
00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:47.089
You idiot!

224
00:12:47.089 --> 00:12:48.989
All you ever come up with

225
00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:53.289
are ideas that confuse the investigation!

226
00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:55.889
Understand?

227
00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:57.389
I guess you're right.

228
00:13:02.089 --> 00:13:04.589
No, wait.

229
00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:08.689
I see! So that's what it was!

230
00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:10.689
I'm sorry. After you change this room

231
00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:13.589
according to my directions,

232
00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:17.189
can you bring the four suspects in the other room here, please?

233
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:19.789
Don't tell me that...

234
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:24.189
So, shall we peel off the mask of the killer wolf

235
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:30.089
that stabbed Mr. Nagase to death in this room, Inspector?

236
00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:34.389
Hey, look!

237
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:36.789
The four are going in again.

238
00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:41.389
Just a while ago, Kogoro Mouri also went inside too.

239
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:44.689
Maybe the Sleeping Kogoro's deduction performance is about to begin?

240
00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:46.689
We can't miss this.

241
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:50.789
Please let us interview you!

242
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.389
You're putting on a deduction performance, aren't you?

243
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:54.489
Let us in!

244
00:13:54.489 --> 00:13:57.189
Officer Chiba, don't let anybody in!

245
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:59.489
Conan is still inside!

246
00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:03.789
Just what is it with you officers?

247
00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:06.189
Summoning us like this again.

248
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:09.489
Don't tell us you've figured out who the killer is?

249
00:14:09.489 --> 00:14:11.389
Yeah, well sort of.

250
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:14.389
No, not just yet.

251
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:17.089
Hey! You just said a while ago that...

252
00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:20.289
But, we'll soon find out.

253
00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:21.789
All I need you to do is

254
00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:23.989
to disguise yourself as Wolf like the killer did

255
00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:27.189
and come walking toward me.

256
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:31.489
First, let's start with Mr. Ogami, who is Wolf Face himself.

257
00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:34.889
Please wear that mask you are holding.

258
00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:36.589
Please do as you are told.

259
00:14:36.589 --> 00:14:38.389
Yes, sir.

260
00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:45.389
Please come towards me.

261
00:14:46.989 --> 00:14:49.289
Come a little more.

262
00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:51.389
Closer.

263
00:14:54.489 --> 00:14:57.189
What next?

264
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:59.189
Okay, that's fine.

265
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:01.089
Next, Mr. Sakuma!

266
00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:04.289
Please take the mask from Mr. Ogami and do the same thing.

267
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:05.789
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:13.189
Inspector.

269
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:15.589
Do you notice any difference between the two?

270
00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:17.589
No. Not at all.

271
00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:20.789
Let us in!

272
00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:22.589
Wait.

273
00:15:30.989 --> 00:15:33.589
-Okay? -Yes.

274
00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:42.489
Then, the last one, Mr. Ushigome.

275
00:15:42.489 --> 00:15:43.689
Yeah.

276
00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:46.789
I wear this and walk towards you, right?

277
00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:50.489
Mr. Mouri.

278
00:15:50.489 --> 00:15:53.389
I'm sure you have your reasons.

279
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:56.989
But unless you tell me where and how to look carefully,

280
00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.589
I don't have the slightest idea.

281
00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:13.689
Are you okay, mister?

282
00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:14.789
It's me.

283
00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:17.689
It's you, sonny.

284
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:19.389
I'm fine.

285
00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:24.289
Will this do, Detective?

286
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:26.889
Yes. I more or less thought it would come out this way,

287
00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:29.789
but now I'm positive.

288
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:31.489
That Mr. Ushigome...

289
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:37.089
You're the one who killed Mr. Nagase!

290
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:42.689
What?

291
00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:44.589
It's the same

292
00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:47.089
as the killer who was in the video.

293
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.489
He kept looking around!

294
00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:50.289
Looking around?

295
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:51.689
Yes.

296
00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:53.889
You'll find out when you wear it,

297
00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:56.789
but a wrestler's mask has narrower vision than is actually thought to be!

298
00:16:56.789 --> 00:16:59.489
Unless you're used to wearing it,

299
00:16:59.489 --> 00:17:01.789
you tend to look around,

300
00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:04.589
trying to make out the situation of the surroundings

301
00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.889
or trip over things that are at your feet

302
00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:09.289
because it is a blind spot.

303
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:10.789
In other words,

304
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:14.589
Mr. Ogami who is used to wearing the mask of Wolf Face,

305
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.289
Mr. Rossi who is used to wearing the mask of Nega Wolf

306
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:22.889
and Mr. Sakuma who usually pitches in for Mr. Ogami.

307
00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:25.889
They have all been ruled out as suspects.

308
00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:31.089
You're the only one who's not used to wearing the mask!

309
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:34.989
You mean I'm branded killer

310
00:17:34.989 --> 00:17:37.089
just because I looked around and tripped!

311
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.089
The evidence is right there on the videotape!

312
00:17:41.089 --> 00:17:45.789
Remember what Conan said about behind the mask a while ago.

313
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:48.989
Do you see that extra something?

314
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:53.389
There are four strings sticking out from behind the mask?

315
00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:54.589
I get it!

316
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.189
The killer was wearing the thin mask

317
00:17:56.189 --> 00:18:00.289
worn when having meals under another mask!

318
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.289
That way,

319
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.089
the hair and eyebrows of the killer won't stick to the inside of the mask

320
00:18:04.089 --> 00:18:07.189
that has the blood splatters!

321
00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:09.089
I see.

322
00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:13.389
That's why although the victim tore half the mask off,

323
00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:14.789
no remnants of skin of the killer

324
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:17.089
were found in the nails of the victim.

325
00:18:17.089 --> 00:18:20.289
Isn't this the mask for meals that you're talking about?

326
00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:24.589
It was sticking out of your pocket when you fell.

327
00:18:24.589 --> 00:18:26.089
Oh, no.

328
00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:29.889
That's the mask I keep in order to scare the young wrestlers

329
00:18:29.889 --> 00:18:32.489
and not the one that the killer was wearing.

330
00:18:32.489 --> 00:18:34.389
It's strange.

331
00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:37.089
Wolf Face's mask is black and white,

332
00:18:37.089 --> 00:18:40.789
but there's a red spot by the right eye.

333
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:42.389
Oh, I get it!

334
00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:45.389
The right eye part of the mask that you were wearing on top got ripped

335
00:18:45.389 --> 00:18:47.889
so the blood splattered on here!

336
00:18:47.889 --> 00:18:49.589
You brat.

337
00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:51.889
Okay, that's it!

338
00:18:51.889 --> 00:18:53.589
We'll hear you out at the station.

339
00:18:53.589 --> 00:18:55.689
Shut up!

340
00:18:55.689 --> 00:18:57.289
Hey, Mr. Ushigome?

341
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:59.189
I'm telling you to shut up!

342
00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:03.889
That's right.

343
00:19:03.889 --> 00:19:05.789
I did it.

344
00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:09.089
I killed the betrayer

345
00:19:09.089 --> 00:19:11.789
who wanted to transfer to the Bankoku Pro Wrestling Team!

346
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:14.389
Cool it, Mr. Ushigome.

347
00:19:14.389 --> 00:19:16.089
That's not all!

348
00:19:19.189 --> 00:19:22.489
I was going to take the mask away from you by framing you up,

349
00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:25.289
a young wrestler with no name, as the killer!

350
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:28.489
So that I become Wolf Face!

351
00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:31.389
Didn't you hear a strange sound just now?

352
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.389
Right.

353
00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:37.489
As long as I get to wear this mask I can become...

354
00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:40.089
You can never become the Wolf!

355
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:43.989
You may be able to hide your face with the mask,

356
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:47.089
but you can't hide your heart that's full of soot and rotten to the gut,

357
00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:48.889
having no respect for professional wrestling.

358
00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:56.189
Excuse me...

359
00:19:56.189 --> 00:19:57.789
Conan?

360
00:20:02.189 --> 00:20:04.389
Kid, what do you know about me?

361
00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:05.889
Stop it!

362
00:20:25.189 --> 00:20:28.489
Shining Wizard?

363
00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:29.589
Right, that's it!

364
00:20:29.589 --> 00:20:31.789
That's the name of the technique!

365
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.089
I'm glad.

366
00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:35.289
I finally remember the name!

367
00:20:41.289 --> 00:20:42.989
And then after that,

368
00:20:42.989 --> 00:20:44.989
the killer, Mr. Ushigome,

369
00:20:44.989 --> 00:20:47.789
was slapped once in the cheek by a speechless Mr. Kiba.

370
00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:51.989
He was then escorted

371
00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:55.089
from the white mat to a dimly lit jail.

372
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:34.189
But things are going to get rough for you from now on.

373
00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:37.089
The mass media is going to bash you from now on saying things like

374
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.989
you're a murderous professional wrestler and stuff.

375
00:22:39.989 --> 00:22:41.889
I'll be fine.

376
00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:45.689
We, wrestlers, are tough.

377
00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:47.889
We're used to being bashed and hit.

378
00:22:50.889 --> 00:22:52.489
So, I'll see you all then.

379
00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:55.289
I wish you luck.

380
00:22:55.289 --> 00:22:56.589
Yes.

381
00:22:56.589 --> 00:22:59.289
They're the toughest guys around.

382
00:23:00.989 --> 00:23:04.589
It's no problem for them to overcome difficulties like this.

383
00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:09.189
And, so long as Wolf Face keeps on winning,

384
00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:12.289
his identity will stay undercover.

385
00:23:13.889 --> 00:23:17.489
Then you see, Mr. Ogami from the top rope.

386
00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:18.989
Mr. Ogami?

387
00:23:18.989 --> 00:23:21.289
I thought you were talking about Wolf Face?

388
00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:26.689
So you know wolf! Mr. Wolf! (Ogami is Homonym of Wolf)

389
00:23:26.689 --> 00:23:28.389
Because he's a wolf?

390
00:23:28.389 --> 00:23:31.889
Yes...

391
00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:36.189
Wolf Face's identity will probably

392
00:23:36.189 --> 00:23:39.089
never be revealed.

393
00:23:39.089 --> 00:23:40.589
I think.

394
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:47.389
"Next Episode"

395
00:23:47.389 --> 00:23:48.889
This is...

396
00:23:48.889 --> 00:23:50.589
Please move away!

397
00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:52.589
Are you all right, Mr. Umetani?

398
00:23:54.889 --> 00:23:57.189
What? The knife fell out!

399
00:23:57.189 --> 00:23:59.189
What's going on?

400
00:24:02.989 --> 00:24:04.489
This is...

401
00:24:04.489 --> 00:24:07.489
The knife poked into the cigar case!

402
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:09.189
Next Conan,

403
00:24:09.189 --> 00:24:13.489
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 1)"

404
00:24:14.157 --> 00:24:17.057
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:17.057 --> 00:24:18.557
"Brake"

406
00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:20.057
The stage of the next episode is in Izu.

407
00:24:20.057 --> 00:24:21.957
This is out of my jurisdiction.

408
00:24:21.957 --> 00:24:23.257
Mine too.
