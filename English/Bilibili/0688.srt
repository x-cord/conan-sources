1
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.140
I think I overate a bit from morning.

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.640
I guess I'll run home then.

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.040
Good morning.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440
Good morning, sir!

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.140
Good morning, you're out early.

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.940
I'm not anyone suspicious.

7
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.040
Did somebody drop it?

8
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
It looks to be so.

9
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.140
My!

10
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040
I won't steal this.

11
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.240
It's exactly 30,000,000 yen!

12
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.040
Nobody's reported anything missing yet?

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.140
No.

14
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.040
But, I'm glad that you're the one who picked it up, Mr. Takagi.

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.240
So, you're a police detective.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

17
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.740
So, you're running that course every morning, Ms. Sasamoto?

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.940
Yes, but I sure hope that it's returned

19
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.540
to the person who dropped it as soon as possible.

20
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.740
Yes.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.540
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

22
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.440
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

23
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.040
30,000.000 yen is in the bag that is picked up.

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.140
What was the real purpose of the owner?

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

26
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

27
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.340
His name is Detective Conan!

28
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:30.295
"Officer Takagi Picks Up 30,000,000 Yen"

29
00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:34.295
If I know a person who was carrying a brown bag.

30
00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.295
Yes, although it's not even certain

31
00:03:36.295 --> 00:03:39.295
that the one who dropped it lives around here either.

32
00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.495
I'll try asking the neighbors for you too, then.

33
00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.895
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:45.795
You did it, Officer Takagi!

35
00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.895
I heard you picked up a huge sum of money?

36
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.495
You folks, why do you know about that?

37
00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:53.595
After all, we're members of the Youth Detective Squad.

38
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.995
If the person who dropped it doesn't appear,

39
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.695
then six months later it's going to become yours, isn't it?

40
00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:00.695
You'll be a billionaire!

41
00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:04.095
No, it won't turn out that way.

42
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:07.695
Because it's the duty of a police officer to turn in lost and found goods.

43
00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.895
Shoots, you mean I can't get you to treat me eels over rice?

44
00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:12.795
I told you so.

45
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:16.795
We'll help you look for the person who dropped it too, then.

46
00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:18.795
We don't have school today so we've got a lot of time too.

47
00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:19.795
Okay!

48
00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:22.295
You picked it up early this morning, is that right?

49
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.395
Yes, about 6:00 am.

50
00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:25.695
Since today is my day off,

51
00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:28.895
I slept over last night at my friend's house near here.

52
00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:34.195
Then while I was jogging along with a woman called Ms. Sasamoto,

53
00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:36.495
I found it right about here.

54
00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:38.295
Right in the middle of the road?

55
00:04:38.295 --> 00:04:39.295
Yeah.

56
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:45.495
What an idiot, to drop a bag full of cash.

57
00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.795
Takagi, let's me and you join hands.

58
00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.795
If we tell them that I, a civilian picked it up...

59
00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.295
Hello.

60
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.695
Yes. That's right.

61
00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.695
The person who dropped the bag appeared?

62
00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:01.295
So, if you're ever in trouble again,

63
00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:03.195
just holler.

64
00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:05.095
I wonder what he came for?

65
00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:09.395
"Toshiyuki Hiranuma (45)" -Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma.

66
00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:11.495
He's the one who dropped the bag, correct?

67
00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:12.895
Correct.

68
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.995
It seems that Mr. Hiranuma's wife recently passed away of an illness,

69
00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:20.395
and the 30,000,000 yen was money from the life insurance.

70
00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:21.795
I see.

71
00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:25.595
But, Mr. Hiranuma, how did you happen to drop that money?

72
00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.695
Well, it's an embarrassing story but...

73
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.395
I have a friend in Beikacho

74
00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:34.195
and I was going to show it to him.

75
00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:37.395
You mean you took 30,000,000 yen just to brag about it?

76
00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:38.995
Yes, sort of.

77
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:42.095
So, I drank up and came back in a good mood.

78
00:05:42.095 --> 00:05:43.495
When I got up this morning,

79
00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.095
I realized that the bag was gone and went pale.

80
00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.895
Which means that you dropped it not this morning, but last night?

81
00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:51.295
Yes.

82
00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:52.695
I understand.

83
00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:55.095
However, because the cash amount is large,

84
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:57.595
we can't give it back to you right away.

85
00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.195
I see.

86
00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:01.295
Is that paint?

87
00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:06.295
Thank you. I wonder where I got it on?

88
00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:09.595
Okay, then, after preparations to give the bag back to you are made,

89
00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:11.295
the station will contact you.

90
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:12.295
Thank you.

91
00:06:12.295 --> 00:06:15.095
It's not that I'm in a rush so that's fine.

92
00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:20.395
The person who dropped the bag came out quite easily.

93
00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:23.295
We, the Detective Squad didn't get a chance to help.

94
00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:24.795
No fun.

95
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:31.495
Officer, I was just about to go to the police box now.

96
00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:33.095
Granny that I saw this morning.

97
00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:35.995
It wasn't there?

98
00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:39.395
Yes. I think it was about 5:00 am.

99
00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:42.795
When I passed there to deliver newspaper,

100
00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:45.195
there was nothing like that there.

101
00:06:45.195 --> 00:06:48.195
Which means that Mr. Hiranuma probably dropped it

102
00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:50.395
after the newspaper delivery man passed there.

103
00:06:57.895 --> 00:06:59.195
Creepy.

104
00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:01.795
Is there anything there, Conan?

105
00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:04.195
I can't tell yet but...

106
00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:09.395
Could this be the traces of Mr. Hiranuma's shoe prints?

107
00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:13.595
It's true that Mr. Hirnuma's shoes were dirty.

108
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:14.995
And besides...

109
00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:18.195
The trace of this paint...

110
00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:21.195
is the same one that was on Mr. Hiranuma's shoulder.

111
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:26.795
Ouch.

112
00:07:26.795 --> 00:07:31.095
Then, Conan, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma was here this morning?

113
00:07:31.095 --> 00:07:35.795
Yes. And he put the bag here just before you came, Officer Takagi.

114
00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:36.795
Put it here?

115
00:07:36.795 --> 00:07:38.695
Because it's hard to believe that no one passed by here

116
00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:40.995
between nearly an hour's time that the newspaper delivery man passed here

117
00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:44.295
to when you passed by,

118
00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:47.495
no matter how early it was in the morning.

119
00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:49.195
I see.

120
00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:51.995
If he dropped it right before I got there,

121
00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:54.995
I should've seen Mr. Hiranuma when I picked it up.

122
00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:56.095
Right.

123
00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:58.595
In other words, back then, Mr. Hiranuma was...

124
00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:00.795
In order to make someone pick up the bag

125
00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:02.395
he checked the time using his watch,

126
00:08:02.395 --> 00:08:04.595
put the bag in the middle of the road,

127
00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:07.695
and was checking things out from this dilapidated building.

128
00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:11.195
Did somebody drop it?

129
00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:12.995
It looks to be so.

130
00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:18.295
But, why did he want Officer Takagi to pick it up?

131
00:08:18.295 --> 00:08:21.295
I see! Ms. Sasamoto!

132
00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:23.795
I passed here by coincidence,

133
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:27.695
but Ms. Sasamoto said that she jogs here every morning.

134
00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:29.495
Then, does it mean that he was trying to make

135
00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:31.995
Ms. Sasamoto pick up the 30,000,000 yen?

136
00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:35.295
But, it still strange, being that it's such a large sum.

137
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:36.595
Right.

138
00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:42.495
"Hideko Sasamoto" -If so, you can return it to the person who dropped it?

139
00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:43.795
I'm glad.

140
00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:46.795
It's a man called Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

141
00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:49.295
but don't you know him, Ms. Sasamoto?

142
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.995
Mr. Hiranuma?

143
00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:53.295
No, not that I know of...

144
00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:54.895
What about him?

145
00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:56.795
Who is that man?

146
00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:59.395
It seems he's from the police or something.

147
00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:00.795
Police?

148
00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:05.895
It didn't look as if she was playing dumb.

149
00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:08.695
Officer.

150
00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:11.095
Yes. What is it?

151
00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:13.395
"Kunitaro Oba (50)" -Did you find the culprit?

152
00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:15.895
Culprit?

153
00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:19.695
That's not what you're here for?

154
00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.695
My name is Oba.

155
00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:26.295
I'm the floor chief for this supermarket.

156
00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:29.695
And, what's this about Mrs. Sasamoto's husband's case?

157
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:34.995
Mrs. Sasamoto's husband was killed.

158
00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:38.295
It's been 15 years already after the 30th of last month,

159
00:09:38.295 --> 00:09:41.895
and the culprit still hasn't been caught.

160
00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:42.995
If it were in the past,

161
00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:44.695
the statute of limitations would've already run out.

162
00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:46.595
Yes.

163
00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.795
She's become cheerful now,

164
00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:51.595
but back then she would hardly smile

165
00:09:51.595 --> 00:09:53.995
and was always looking down.

166
00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:03.395
The fact is, I'm getting married with Hideko.

167
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:06.695
She turned me down when I first proposed to her

168
00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:09.195
saying that she felt apologetic to her late husband

169
00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:12.395
if only she alone became happy.

170
00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:15.195
But, that's strange, don't you think?

171
00:10:17.995 --> 00:10:23.195
Only recently, she has begun to think about her own happiness.

172
00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:27.695
The other day, we both went to her husband's grave

173
00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:31.895
to ask him to set her free.

174
00:10:31.895 --> 00:10:36.195
But it doesn't work out that easily, does it?

175
00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:38.095
If that culprit were to appear...

176
00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:42.595
To think that we have to continue hating him again...

177
00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:45.595
Chief!

178
00:10:45.595 --> 00:10:47.695
Sorry, I'll be right there.

179
00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:55.195
15 years and still unsolved?

180
00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.095
That case and the 30,000,000 yen...

181
00:10:58.095 --> 00:11:00.495
I wonder if there's no connection.

182
00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:02.195
That's too outrageous.

183
00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.095
How would they be connected?

184
00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:06.395
I still don't know yet but...

185
00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:08.695
I get it.

186
00:11:08.695 --> 00:11:11.595
I'll try checking on that case then.

187
00:11:12.695 --> 00:11:14.795
The case occurred on a certain night 15 years ago

188
00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:18.495
on the 4th floor of an office in a multi-functional building.

189
00:11:18.495 --> 00:11:20.995
He was probably afraid of the surveillance camera

190
00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:22.695
because the culprit climbed up to the 4th floor

191
00:11:22.695 --> 00:11:25.295
using a pipe connecting one building to the other.

192
00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:27.495
And broke into the office from the veranda.

193
00:11:27.495 --> 00:11:31.195
Then, killed Mr. Akio Sasamoto who was working over time alone

194
00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:34.295
and stole 5,000,000 yen in cash.

195
00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:36.895
But, since the shoe prints of the shoes

196
00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:38.995
that the culprit was wearing was left behind,

197
00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:41.695
the purchaser's list of the sneaker was made

198
00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:45.395
and a thorough investigation was carried out.

199
00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:50.095
Mr. Hiranuma's name was also on the purchaser's list.

200
00:11:50.095 --> 00:11:52.895
I see, so that's the story.

201
00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:54.395
What do you mean?

202
00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:56.995
For compensation of that case,

203
00:11:56.995 --> 00:12:01.595
he tried to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto, his bereaved wife.

204
00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:03.095
He wanted her to pick it up.

205
00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:05.695
He figured that if he didn't appear as the one who dropped it,

206
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:08.495
it would become hers in 6 months.

207
00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:13.095
Then, are you saying that Mr. Hiranuma is the culprit of that case?

208
00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:14.495
No.

209
00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:17.695
I thought the same thing at first,

210
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:22.195
but, Conan, Mr. Hiranuma wasn't the culprit.

211
00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:35.846
It was impossible for Mr. Hiranuma to commit the crime.

212
00:12:35.846 --> 00:12:37.046
What do you mean?

213
00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:39.146
When the investigators visited him,

214
00:12:39.146 --> 00:12:42.746
Mr. Hiranuma had a broken leg.

215
00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:45.046
They confirmed at the hospital that he commuted to

216
00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:48.146
and found that his broken leg was put into a cast

217
00:12:48.146 --> 00:12:50.746
three days before the incident occurred.

218
00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:55.646
He couldn't have climbed up to the 4th floor with a broken leg.

219
00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:56.646
With a cast on,

220
00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.446
he wouldn't have been able to wear sneakers either.

221
00:12:58.446 --> 00:13:01.146
Yeah. The case that occurred 15 years ago

222
00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:04.946
and Mr. Hiranuma's 30,000,000 yen isn't connected after all.

223
00:13:04.946 --> 00:13:08.146
Thinking that Mr. Hiranuma wanted her to pick it up,

224
00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:11.246
was just an incorrect assumption, I guess.

225
00:13:12.446 --> 00:13:14.546
Telephone. It's from pops.

226
00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:17.746
Hello. Pops, what is it?

227
00:13:19.746 --> 00:13:24.146
It seems that Pops Kogoro was also concerned about that 30,000,000 yen.

228
00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:26.046
When I told him about what I heard just now,

229
00:13:26.046 --> 00:13:29.546
he said for me to tell you Officer Takagi to check on something.

230
00:13:29.546 --> 00:13:32.646
He said he wanted you to check to see

231
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:36.346
if there was someone else who also had a broken leg back then.

232
00:13:37.746 --> 00:13:40.746
If Mr. Mouri says so I'll try and check but...

233
00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:43.746
He asked if the Youth Detective Squad would help out too.

234
00:13:43.746 --> 00:13:46.046
He wants information on Mr. Hiranuma,

235
00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:48.546
no matter what it may be.

236
00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:51.446
We're going to help the famed detective?

237
00:13:52.446 --> 00:13:55.846
-Aye! Let's start investigation! -Aye!

238
00:13:55.846 --> 00:13:57.246
See you later, then.

239
00:13:57.246 --> 00:13:59.746
"Store Closure Notice"

240
00:13:59.746 --> 00:14:00.846
"Organic Food Store, Hiranuma"

241
00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:04.346
It seems like this store closed about a month ago.

242
00:14:04.346 --> 00:14:06.646
It seems that his wife who was sick all the while,

243
00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:07.946
passed away at around the same time too.

244
00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:11.046
It seems Mr. Hiranuma is a very serious and nice man.

245
00:14:11.046 --> 00:14:14.446
Only, there's one strange thing about him lately.

246
00:14:14.446 --> 00:14:17.546
It seems he said that he was going to go on a trip for a while,

247
00:14:17.546 --> 00:14:21.046
and yet, it seems he came back that very same day.

248
00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:23.646
It seems to have been about a week ago.

249
00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:24.946
A week ago?

250
00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:25.946
"Cleaner, Speed Cleaning"

251
00:14:25.946 --> 00:14:27.746
Oh, that.

252
00:14:27.746 --> 00:14:31.146
At the end of last month, on the 30th if I remember correctly.

253
00:14:31.146 --> 00:14:33.646
But, come to think of it now,

254
00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:37.146
Mr. Hiranuma was saying some weird meaningful things

255
00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:39.346
from the night before.

256
00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:42.046
You really did a good job taking care of her.

257
00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:45.246
But, take it easy from now on.

258
00:14:45.246 --> 00:14:49.346
I'm sure your late wife is thinking likewise too.

259
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.646
I would like to if I could I've been planning to do so

260
00:14:50.646 --> 00:14:52.946
since some time ago and yet,

261
00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:55.446
when the time comes I get scared.

262
00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:57.846
What're talking about?

263
00:14:57.846 --> 00:15:01.846
I... I'm such a wretch.

264
00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:07.546
All he did after that was keep saying,

265
00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.546
"It's not something I can undo with money"

266
00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:13.146
And the following morning after that...

267
00:15:15.546 --> 00:15:19.946
Mr. Hiranuma, carrying a bag are you going to a hot spring or something?

268
00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:22.646
No, I think I'll go somewhere far away for a while.

269
00:15:22.646 --> 00:15:25.846
Then, you take care too, Mr. Morita.

270
00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:32.546
It sounded like he was bidding farewell to this world or something.

271
00:15:33.546 --> 00:15:36.046
In spite of that, at sundown the same day,

272
00:15:36.046 --> 00:15:39.246
he came back saying that he couldn't go on the trip.

273
00:15:39.246 --> 00:15:42.046
What does that mean, Conan?

274
00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:46.946
Officer Takagi.

275
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.046
Hello.

276
00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:51.746
Kanzaki, drinking beer from daytime?

277
00:15:51.746 --> 00:15:53.446
It's my day off today.

278
00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.546
-Hello. -Yes, welcome.

279
00:15:55.546 --> 00:15:58.346
-Plain soba, please. -One plain soba!

280
00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:05.746
And?

281
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:10.246
Well, I missteped on the stairs and broke my right leg.

282
00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:12.146
Back then, Mr. Kanzaki,

283
00:16:12.146 --> 00:16:15.946
I assume you didn't have your health insurance card with you?

284
00:16:15.946 --> 00:16:19.246
Who are you? Who told you that?

285
00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:24.646
That day Mr. Hiranuma found out...

286
00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:27.446
That's why he did what he did.

287
00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:35.946
And? What does the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri want with us?

288
00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:38.446
I have no idea, either...

289
00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:40.646
Let me introduce you.

290
00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:42.846
This is Mrs. Hideko Sasamoto.

291
00:16:42.846 --> 00:16:46.146
She's the one who picked the bag in question up with me.

292
00:16:46.146 --> 00:16:47.746
Hey, Takagi!

293
00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:49.746
What's with calling me out suddenly like this.

294
00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.346
I'm busy too.

295
00:16:51.346 --> 00:16:54.246
What? But, Mr. Mouri, you're the one who...

296
00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:58.546
What did I do...

297
00:16:58.546 --> 00:16:59.846
It's come!

298
00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:02.746
He fell asleep.

299
00:17:02.746 --> 00:17:05.046
For a Detective as good as I am,

300
00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:06.846
I can see through things just by information

301
00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:10.846
that I have heard from others, Mr. Hiranuma.

302
00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:12.646
Just what're you talking about?

303
00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:15.646
Of course, what else but the murder robbery

304
00:17:15.646 --> 00:17:18.646
that you committed 15 years ago.

305
00:17:18.646 --> 00:17:21.246
-Don't tell me that... -It's exactly that.

306
00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:25.846
But, it was impossible for him to do it, Mr. Mouri.

307
00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.546
Three days before the incident occurred,

308
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.246
Mr. Hiranuma had broken his leg.

309
00:17:30.246 --> 00:17:31.746
Just because the medical records

310
00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:34.546
and the X-Ray were in Mr. Hiranuma's name,

311
00:17:34.546 --> 00:17:38.846
that's no guarantee that they were really his.

312
00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:42.146
Are you saying that Mr. Kanzaki borrowed the health insurance card?

313
00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:43.946
Then, what about the cast?

314
00:17:43.946 --> 00:17:47.946
He probably put it together by himself after committing the crime.

315
00:17:47.946 --> 00:17:50.146
-But... -There's no proof!

316
00:17:50.146 --> 00:17:51.646
But, Takagi...

317
00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:54.146
If Mr. Hiranuma is innocent,

318
00:17:54.146 --> 00:17:57.546
why hasn't he even once retorted since a while ago?

319
00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:03.646
I thought it up when Kanzaki broke his leg.

320
00:18:04.646 --> 00:18:07.346
It really hurts.

321
00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.346
I'm sure it's broken.

322
00:18:09.346 --> 00:18:12.146
Really, the least you can do is pay your health insurance bill, stupid!

323
00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:13.246
I'll lend you mine.

324
00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:14.346
I'm not going to get caught, am I?

325
00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:17.246
No way. There's no photo on it either.

326
00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:21.646
Right, it's me.

327
00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:24.446
I did it.

328
00:18:24.446 --> 00:18:26.646
I'm so very sorry.

329
00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:33.446
Back then, I was unreliable, a coward,

330
00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.546
and a hopeless punk.

331
00:18:36.546 --> 00:18:38.646
But,

332
00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:40.146
after meeting a certain woman,

333
00:18:40.146 --> 00:18:42.146
I was reborn.

334
00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:44.146
I married that woman,

335
00:18:44.146 --> 00:18:47.046
and worked with all my might.

336
00:18:47.046 --> 00:18:52.246
And, although small, I was able to open a shop of my own.

337
00:18:52.246 --> 00:18:56.246
But the more, we became happier,

338
00:18:56.246 --> 00:18:59.246
the more I started to regret the wrongs I did in the past.

339
00:19:01.446 --> 00:19:05.246
I thought of turning myself in many times

340
00:19:05.246 --> 00:19:07.746
but, I couldn't.

341
00:19:09.246 --> 00:19:11.646
My wife fell ill.

342
00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:13.346
Since my wife was totally alone with no family,

343
00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:14.646
without me caring for her,

344
00:19:14.646 --> 00:19:17.846
she would have no one to look after her.

345
00:19:17.846 --> 00:19:22.246
She passed away a month ago.

346
00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:25.746
What I got after that was that 30,000,000 yen.

347
00:19:25.746 --> 00:19:29.146
Then, you didn't drop that money after all,

348
00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:31.846
but intentionally put it there.

349
00:19:31.846 --> 00:19:32.946
Yes.

350
00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.746
But, why'd you do something so roundabout?

351
00:19:35.746 --> 00:19:38.446
Right! If you felt apologetic,

352
00:19:38.446 --> 00:19:41.246
all you had to do was give it to her directly.

353
00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.746
I was a coward.

354
00:19:43.746 --> 00:19:46.946
I was scared of being arrested by the police.

355
00:19:46.946 --> 00:19:49.246
Wrong, Mr. Hiranuma.

356
00:19:50.846 --> 00:19:54.946
You came here a week ago, didn't you?

357
00:19:54.946 --> 00:19:58.346
And, you were going to give the 30,000,000 yen to Mrs. Sasamoto,

358
00:19:58.346 --> 00:20:01.346
then turn yourself in right after.

359
00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:04.146
But, you couldn't do so.

360
00:20:05.846 --> 00:20:11.246
Back then I heard, when I was here.

361
00:20:11.246 --> 00:20:17.046
Mr. Sasamoto, I proposed to Hideko.

362
00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:19.846
But, she said...

363
00:20:19.846 --> 00:20:21.646
She feels bad if she alone becomes happy.

364
00:20:21.646 --> 00:20:24.546
She says she feels guilty.

365
00:20:24.546 --> 00:20:26.446
I understand how you feel.

366
00:20:26.446 --> 00:20:30.546
But, today already makes 15 years.

367
00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:36.446
Please won't you set her free from being the bereaved wife of a victim.

368
00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:39.646
It's not that I can forget you but,

369
00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:43.646
I'll put the case behind way deep in the drawer of my heart

370
00:20:43.646 --> 00:20:46.646
and try to forget it.

371
00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:48.146
Please forgive me.

372
00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:50.846
Let's go.

373
00:20:50.846 --> 00:20:52.246
Yes.

374
00:20:52.246 --> 00:20:55.146
I couldn't come up front.

375
00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:59.446
Because the bereaved is trying to forget the incident.

376
00:20:59.446 --> 00:21:02.146
You ended up not being able to give her the money for compensation,

377
00:21:02.146 --> 00:21:07.446
apologize to her, or even to turn yourself in.

378
00:21:07.446 --> 00:21:10.846
If a culprit's that's been on the run for 15 years turns himself in,

379
00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:14.546
the media would most naturally avalanche over to the bereaved family

380
00:21:14.546 --> 00:21:18.546
when she's trying to make a new start.

381
00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.946
But, Mr. Hiranuma...

382
00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:26.146
No matter how you may convince yourself,

383
00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:29.346
you can never erase your past.

384
00:21:32.646 --> 00:21:36.546
But, this case is special.

385
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:39.346
Although we cannot erase the fact that it happened,

386
00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:42.046
we could bring it to a close.

387
00:21:42.046 --> 00:21:45.046
By you serving your sentence, Mr. Hiranuma

388
00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:48.646
and by Mrs. Sasamoto accepting that.

389
00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:50.346
And, once you've settled things,

390
00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:52.546
there's no need for you to carry the burden of it anymore.

391
00:21:52.546 --> 00:21:56.546
Both of you can start off anew.

392
00:21:56.546 --> 00:21:58.246
Right, Takagi?

393
00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:01.346
Mr. Toshiyuki Hiranuma,

394
00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:03.046
please come to the station,

395
00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:04.946
you are charged with homicide robbery.

396
00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:05.946
Yes.

397
00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:14.646
That 30,000,000 yen... won't you please accept it?

398
00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:18.646
Please use it when you make a new start.

399
00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:47.346
-Bye. -See you tomorrow!

400
00:23:47.346 --> 00:23:48.746
Bye, bye!

401
00:23:53.746 --> 00:23:55.046
I forgot!

402
00:23:58.946 --> 00:24:01.246
Where is this?

403
00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:04.846
Sorry, pops.

404
00:24:09.746 --> 00:24:11.246
Is anything wrong?

405
00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:18.246
Mr. Tsuge.

406
00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:20.346
I think it's about here.

407
00:24:21.446 --> 00:24:22.846
I'll go take a look.

408
00:24:22.846 --> 00:24:24.246
Conan!

409
00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:27.746
Is that it?

410
00:24:27.746 --> 00:24:31.346
So, that's what the culprit took from the crime scene.

411
00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:32.846
Next Conan,

412
00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:36.846
"Message from a Client".

413
00:24:52.646 --> 00:24:54.846
Next Conan's Hint:

414
00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:56.946
"Fox".

415
00:24:56.946 --> 00:24:58.146
Mr. Mouri, were you also found lying on the ground?

416
00:24:58.146 --> 00:24:59.946
I'm entitled to 10 percent of the 30,000,000 yen too!

417
00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:01.646
I don't think you should pick him up.
