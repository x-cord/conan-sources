1
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.020
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.480
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.550
Today's case is animal protection!
Folk tales have deep meanings!

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.350
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.490
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.999
"The Crane That Returned
a Favor Murder Case."

8
00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.539
Hey, are you really
sure this is the road?

9
00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.549
Yeah! They should be
in the marsh just ahead!

10
00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.909
Ugh. Here we are in Hokkaido,
so why no crabs or hot springs?!

11
00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.969
We can see cranes
at the zoo any old time!

12
00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.999
Tanchou cranes are a protected
species and only found in Hokkaido!

13
00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.979
So what?!

14
00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.709
Feeding Ground

15
00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.329
Another one is flying! How cool!

16
00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.799
Are we done yet?
We gotta find a place to stay

17
00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.329
or we'll be sleeping
in the car tonight!

18
00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.259
Hey!

19
00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.889
Who gave you
permission to be here?!

20
00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.929
Permission? Is this private property?

21
00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.329
That's right!

22
00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.619
I'm so sorry!

23
00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.899
We heard tanchous don't like people,
so we came here to watch them...

24
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:51.069
I hope you're not crane thieves...

25
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.289
Do I look like that kind of person?

26
00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.529
Yes!

27
00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.959
Say, why is this window
made of tempered glass?

28
00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.489
It's the same kind
used in planes, right?

29
00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.459
Some people like
to break windows for fun...

30
00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.619
Do you like the tanchous?

31
00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.509
Yeah!
Yes!

32
00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.119
What's so fun about
taking care of cranes?

33
00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.799
Old people make no sense.

34
00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.499
Hey, Dad! He asked
if we'd stay the night!

35
00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.769
There's even an open-air bath nearby!

36
00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.999
Ran-kun and Conan-kun did help me,
and the tanchous are overjoyed.

37
00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.439
It's our way of saying thanks.

38
00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.069
Does that mean... it's free?

39
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.649
Leave if you don't like it.

40
00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.619
Nothing of the sort!
We'd be glad to stay!

41
00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.659
It's the cranes' return favor!

42
00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.499
Yeah!

43
00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.329
That there is my home.

44
00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.999
I live alone now.

45
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.049
Your wife passed
away five years ago?

46
00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.159
I've lived all alone ever since.

47
00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.509
This thing looks alive!

48
00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.579
I stuff tanchous that
die from injuries or illness

49
00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.979
and donate them
to schools and museums.

50
00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.649
Hello, there!

51
00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.329
This is my brother, Tamotsu. He started
sponging off me ten days ago.

52
00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.609
He's a worthless painter.

53
00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.029
Didn't need the
"worthless" part, Brother.

54
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.239
I just told the truth.
You lack observational skills.

55
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:23.369
It's your fatal flaw.

56
00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.829
This here is Mori-san from Tokyo.

57
00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.289
I'm a detective.

58
00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.949
Detective?

59
00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.709
Machida Tamotsu (53) Painter
Detective?

60
00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:33.089
Are you the famous Mori Kogoro-san?
Machida Tamotsu (53) Painter

61
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.129
My reputation's even
made it to Hokkaido, has it?!

62
00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.169
No.

63
00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:39.829
Eh?!

64
00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:42.169
Tamotsu is from Tokyo.

65
00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.349
Oh, I see...

66
00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.309
What is this tempered
glass for, Mister?

67
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:53.749
I'm going to use it in that window,
so I can watch the tanchous from it.

68
00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.499
Dad!

69
00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.159
Why are you two here?!

70
00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.789
Are you really donating
your estate to the village?!

71
00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.159
It's not true, is it, Dad?!

72
00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:09.579
It's true.

73
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.589
I want it to take care of the tanchous
and other migratory birds forever!

74
00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.619
Boutique Manager
Office Worker
What?! What about taking care of me?!

75
00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.709
Dad! Help me! My boutique's
going to be taken over!
Boutique Manager
Office Worker

76
00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:22.549
Dad! Help me! My boutique's
going to be taken over!

77
00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.459
Quit it! We have company!

78
00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.179
Damn! All any of
you want is money!

79
00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:32.619
Come on, we're family!

80
00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.259
Hey, why isn't there a fire going?!

81
00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.439
Don't, Hiroshi-kun!

82
00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.019
Eh?

83
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.689
Stop!
Eh?

84
00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.489
What was that for?!

85
00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.209
A turtledove made its nest
on the chimney last spring!

86
00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:46.949
She's since left it, though.

87
00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:49.959
She might come back this spring!

88
00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:54.919
You're not to touch anything
in this house, not just the fireplace!

89
00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.159
Bird, birds, birds! Are birds more
important than your own children?!

90
00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.379
What a great parent!

91
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.589
Tamotsu, did you call these two here?!

92
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.619
Yeah. I knew you wouldn't like it,

93
00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:13.309
but I felt it was best to discuss
this sooner rather than later...

94
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.749
How egotistical.

95
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.749
Your Uncle Tamotsu probably told you,

96
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.289
but an attorney is bringing
the form here at 5:00 today.

97
00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.739
The minute I stamp it, my 300 million
will go to the village once I die!

98
00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.449
300 million?!

99
00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:31.999
Then I'll talk with that attorney!

100
00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.039
300 million for tanchous?!
You're out of your mind!

101
00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.909
There's no point!

102
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:41.009
I've already given you your amount
of inheritance required by law!

103
00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.829
You haven't been here in a while.

104
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:47.179
It wouldn't hurt to
visit your mother's grave!

105
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.659
Damn him! Now what do we do?!

106
00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.849
I'll talk to the attorney!
I will put an end to this!

107
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.149
Geez. This is some place
we wound up staying at...

108
00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.529
You'll be all better soon!
Just hang in there!

109
00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.659
He used to be a CEO?

110
00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:12.079
Yeah. He had a
car dealership in Tokyo.

111
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:17.879
My sister fell ill eight years ago
and moved here with him to recuperate.

112
00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.339
Just the two of them?
What about their kids?

113
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.369
Noriko and Hiroshi
didn't want to leave Tokyo,

114
00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.679
so my brother gave them
their inheritance early.

115
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.979
And they used it all up?
I'm so jealous...

116
00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:45.819
Stop! What're you--

117
00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:51.869
Quiet! It ain't loaded!
Or are you blind?!

118
00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:54.999
Move!

119
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.919
What a horrible son.

120
00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:06.879
I'm alive again...

121
00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:11.499
But, there's something missing...

122
00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.519
I don't like the sound of this...

123
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.189
Geez! Get your own sake, will ya?!

124
00:08:25.409 --> 00:08:26.149
Huh?

125
00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.289
That hits the spot!

126
00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:39.579
What do you think, Mori-san?
Isn't it a great hot spring?

127
00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:42.249
The best! No complaints from me!

128
00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:43.769
Glad to hear it!

129
00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:44.769
Where are you headed?

130
00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:50.869
Actually, I've been here for ten days,
but my sketchbook is still blank.

131
00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.999
Thought I'd head to the feeding
ground to sketch some tanchous.

132
00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:55.349
Well, enjoy yourselves--

133
00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:57.949
Here you go!

134
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:59.329
Thanks!

135
00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:03.329
Oh, yeah. I'll stop by again at
around 5:00 when the attorney arrives,

136
00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:05.359
so please enjoy yourselves until then!

137
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:08.659
Sure! I'll enjoy myself plenty!

138
00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:15.989
Dad! You should get
out before he gets here!

139
00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:22.669
Not yet! There's no telling when
I'll get to visit another hot spring!

140
00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.819
It's your own fault
if you wind up fainting!

141
00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:32.839
Hiroshi-san...
Is he going back to Tokyo?

142
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:38.059
So dizzy...

143
00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:41.499
Haven't you ever heard of limits?!

144
00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:43.019
I don't feel so good...

145
00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:44.619
Of course you don't.

146
00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:47.999
You were in there for two hours
and swam after drinking!

147
00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:49.989
Is he all right?

148
00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:55.409
He's just dizzy! Anyways,
did you get any drawings done?

149
00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:57.119
Yep. As you can see...

150
00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:01.149
Wow! You're really good!

151
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:08.959
Well, I should be going back.
Take your time, now.

152
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.089
Thanks...

153
00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:16.659
Yamagami Tatsuo (58) Attorney

154
00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:19.639
Evening, Tamotsu-san! Is Shuzo-san home?
Yamagami Tatsuo (58) Attorney

155
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:23.899
Yeah, he should be
waiting for you. Come on in.

156
00:10:33.819 --> 00:10:35.219
The window's broken!

157
00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:41.699
Brother!

158
00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:43.459
Oh, no!

159
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:50.709
No good! It's locked from the inside!

160
00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:52.669
What's going on?

161
00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:55.009
My brother's been
killed with an arrow!

162
00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:59.469
You can't be serious...

163
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:06.969
Dad!

164
00:11:06.969 --> 00:11:07.999
Don't come in!

165
00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:10.689
Uncle! Hiroshi ran off!

166
00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:12.869
Calm down, Nori-chan!

167
00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:17.749
You look for Hiroshi-kun! I'll tell
Detective Mori at the hot spring!

168
00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:20.459
You call the police
with the phone by the door!

169
00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:21.839
Right...

170
00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:30.289
So, the crossbow
was shot from outside...

171
00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:35.339
The window is locked, and the
door was locked from the inside?

172
00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:40.049
Yes. He always locks it
at 4:00 to watch his videos.

173
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:44.329
He would watch videos
of my late sister every day.

174
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:50.419
He probably didn't want
anyone to see him visiting her...

175
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.869
So, he had the windows
made of ground glass?

176
00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:58.079
He was about to put in tempered
glass so he could finally

177
00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:02.119
get over the sadness and watch
his tanchous whenever he wanted...

178
00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.969
But he was murdered
just before he could...

179
00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:07.869
There's a mark on it...

180
00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:11.169
The arrow was shot from this window?

181
00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:14.879
What's this?!

182
00:12:15.499 --> 00:12:18.579
Why are the shards all lined up?!

183
00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:20.799
And there's another mark on the floor...

184
00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:22.459
Uncle Tamotsu!

185
00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:23.389
Where's Hiroshi-kun?!

186
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:24.579
I can't find him anywhere!

187
00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:26.389
And our car is gone!

188
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:30.459
We saw Hiroshi-san
drive off just after 5:00...

189
00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:31.359
How'd he seem?!

190
00:12:31.659 --> 00:12:34.789
He seemed in a real hurry...

191
00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:35.989
Suspicious...

192
00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:39.859
Soot?

193
00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:46.459
There's soot gone in some places!

194
00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:50.369
An unburned wood chip?

195
00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.539
Alright, you!

196
00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:54.299
No nosing around the crime scene!

197
00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:04.349
Hiroshi!

198
00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:05.219
Hiroshi-kun!

199
00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:07.619
I'm Ezomatsu, of the Hokkai Police.

200
00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:12.769
This man has confessed to killing
his father with this crossbow.

201
00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:13.829
Confessed?!

202
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:15.039
Who are you?

203
00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:19.489
I'm the famous Tokyo
detective, Mori Kogoro!

204
00:13:19.749 --> 00:13:22.949
Famous detective? Mori what?

205
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:25.039
Kogoro...

206
00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:28.409
Guess my name really
hasn't spread to Hokkaido...

207
00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:29.999
It's strange!

208
00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:32.879
What is it?!
Something's not right!

209
00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:38.709
I just meant to scare him, not kill him!

210
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:44.179
I aimed for that stuffed tanchou...

211
00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:48.499
I thought if I scared him,
he wouldn't donate his fortune away...

212
00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:51.889
So, you took the crossbow
from the workshop?!

213
00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.559
When I peeked inside,

214
00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:57.959
I saw him on the sofa,
watching a video of Mom...

215
00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:03.609
I aimed at the tanchou,
took two steps back, and shot!

216
00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:07.619
That scare ya?!
Next time it won't be a--

217
00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:13.079
I didn't want to do it!

218
00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:15.789
But my sister kept telling me to!

219
00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:19.499
What?! I never said to kill anyone!

220
00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:21.909
And that was only
because Uncle Tamotsu said

221
00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:24.639
Dad might change his
mind if we really scared him!

222
00:14:25.079 --> 00:14:29.409
Hold on, Nori-chan!
I would never say anything like that!

223
00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:31.599
There must be some
misunderstanding.

224
00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:36.979
A feather in his back pocket...
Is it a tanchou feather?

225
00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.439
Feather?!

226
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:47.479
I thought so!
But, this isn't enough to--

227
00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.579
Wait! The skylight!

228
00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:01.659
Yes! I found it!

229
00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:03.719
The peculiar tanchou sketches...

230
00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:05.179
The mark on the tempered glass...

231
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:08.639
The lined-up glass shards
and mark on the floor...

232
00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:11.099
And, the wood chip in the fireplace!

233
00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:13.659
One thing connected them all!

234
00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.569
Hiroshi-san isn't the killer!

235
00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:24.109
Believe me! I really
didn't mean to kill him!

236
00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:28.529
Alright, alright. We can continue
this discussion back at the station.

237
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:34.489
And, I must ask you to come as well.
You're suspected of abetting him.

238
00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:36.199
You can't be serious...

239
00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.949
That alright with you,
Mr. Famous Detective?

240
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:45.789
Of course! After all, he himself
confessed to the murder...

241
00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:48.879
A mosquito this time of year...

242
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:51.989
Not so fast, Detective Ezomatsu.

243
00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:55.349
Hiroshi-san did not murder Shuzo-san!

244
00:15:56.619 --> 00:16:00.809
What kind of nonsense is this?
He's already admitted to it...

245
00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:06.769
Then, how do you explain
the glass shards his arrow made?

246
00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:09.819
Glass shards?

247
00:16:09.819 --> 00:16:11.569
These? What about them?

248
00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:14.029
Don't you find it odd?

249
00:16:14.029 --> 00:16:15.819
The arrow was shot from outside,

250
00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:19.489
and the resulting glass
shards are all lined up.

251
00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:24.869
This is why I don't like amateurs,
they tamper with crime scenes.

252
00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:27.209
There was something lying here!

253
00:16:27.449 --> 00:16:31.169
Yes! The tempered glass
had been placed there!

254
00:16:31.169 --> 00:16:33.699
Tempered glass?

255
00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:34.869
This?

256
00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:44.439
And, just like that, Hiroshi-san
fired the crossbow from outside!

257
00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:48.399
And then the glass
shards fell to the ground...

258
00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.319
What?!

259
00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:53.319
Hold on! Wouldn't the arrow
hit the tempered glass, too?!

260
00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:58.199
Yes. The arrow hit
the glass and struck the floor.

261
00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:08.749
As tempered glass is clear,
Hiroshi-san didn't notice from outside.

262
00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.569
Then where did the arrow
in the victim's chest come from?!

263
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.219
From inside the fireplace.

264
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:19.179
Inside it is a part with soot removed.

265
00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:23.199
That's because a crossbow
had been set up there.

266
00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:25.639
But, how was it shot from inside here?!

267
00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:26.849
This.

268
00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.489
It was lying inside the fireplace.

269
00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:32.279
What's a wood chip
got to do with anything?

270
00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.489
First, you stick a wood
chip with a string around it

271
00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:39.409
behind the trigger of
the crossbow in the fireplace.

272
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:43.449
Next, you attach a strip
of rubber around the trigger.

273
00:17:43.449 --> 00:17:48.499
The string tied to the wood chip
is led up the chimney and outside.

274
00:17:48.499 --> 00:17:52.449
The person with that string
then looked through the skylight

275
00:17:52.449 --> 00:17:57.129
and checked that Shuzo-san
was sitting in his usual spot...

276
00:17:57.129 --> 00:18:02.679
and then pulled the string just
as Hiroshi-san fired his crossbow.

277
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:05.639
That arrow struck Shuzo-san in the chest.

278
00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:09.809
The string left distinct
marks inside the chimney.

279
00:18:10.369 --> 00:18:16.279
The arrow had fireplace soot on it,
so analysis should confirm it.

280
00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:19.089
This was a premeditated murder?!

281
00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:22.069
Yes. A carefully premeditated one.

282
00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:26.789
So, the killer took care of the
glass and crossbow after the murder?!

283
00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:29.869
Hiroshi-san couldn't
have done it, he had run off.

284
00:18:29.869 --> 00:18:32.249
In other words, he's not the killer.

285
00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:34.819
The one who murdered Shuzo-san,

286
00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:40.179
and cleared away the glass,
and crossbow in this locked room...

287
00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:43.179
was you, Machida Tamotsu-san!

288
00:18:43.179 --> 00:18:47.029
But, three people were at the scene!

289
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:50.139
They would've noticed the
tempered glass had been moved!

290
00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:51.569
No.

291
00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:55.069
The first thing most people
at a crime scene notice

292
00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:58.029
is the victim.

293
00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:01.109
By quickly forcing them back into the hall,

294
00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:03.699
they wouldn't be able to
recall the condition of the room.

295
00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:07.559
Moreover, you gave them
orders to leave the scene.

296
00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:13.419
Afterward, you took care of
the tempered glass and crossbow.

297
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:16.369
Your reason for murdering Shuzo-san

298
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:19.379
was likely because he
refused to loan you money.

299
00:19:19.819 --> 00:19:22.639
Damn! All any of you want is money!

300
00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:28.989
He didn't say that in regard
to just them, but to you as well!

301
00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:33.189
So, you lured them here, into a trap.

302
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:40.149
After all, you wouldn't get any
inheritance if you killed him yourself.

303
00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:45.369
Sorry, Mori-san, but when
my brother was murdered,

304
00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:48.579
I was at the feeding ground
drawing pictures, as you can see.

305
00:19:49.529 --> 00:19:55.429
The reason I suspected you
was because of those drawings!

306
00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:58.799
The reason being that
tanchous' tails aren't black!

307
00:19:59.159 --> 00:20:02.259
Their plumes are black,
and their tails are white!

308
00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:08.569
What's more, tanchous face
the wind when they sleep.

309
00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:11.819
But, they're sleeping against
the wind in your drawings.

310
00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:15.569
That's because you didn't draw
them at the feeding ground,

311
00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:17.909
you drew this stuffed one instead!

312
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:20.899
Probably several days earlier, too!

313
00:20:22.069 --> 00:20:25.619
To make us think
you drew them today,

314
00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:29.539
you showed us
an unused sketchbook.

315
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:31.329
Am I wrong?

316
00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:37.029
It's true, I might've drawn
their feathers incorrectly,

317
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:42.049
but you haven't proven
I didn't draw these there, either!

318
00:20:42.369 --> 00:20:47.599
Remember when you dropped
your sketchbook at the hot spring?

319
00:20:48.199 --> 00:20:52.679
When you did, Conan caught
it and gave it back to you.

320
00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:57.769
Yes. Conan's fingerprints
should be on your sketchbook.

321
00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:01.739
Assuming it's the same one, that is!

322
00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:04.989
I wiped it down when it got dirty later!

323
00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:09.909
Very well. The proof is the
feather in your back pocket!

324
00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:12.249
A tanchou feather...

325
00:21:12.249 --> 00:21:15.669
No, it's not a tanchou feather.

326
00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:20.799
It's a feather of the turtledove
that made a nest atop the chimney.

327
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:26.679
It probably got there when you
stuffed the string in your pocket.

328
00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:32.679
Ergo, there should be
soot in your pocket, as well.

329
00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:39.229
Unbelievable. Being suspected
because of my drawings...

330
00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:43.939
I guess I never did
have any artistic talent...

331
00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:48.869
Just like my brother said,
I lack observational skills.

332
00:21:48.869 --> 00:21:50.869
I've finally realized it.

333
00:23:18.989 --> 00:23:23.919
Entire Fortune Donated!!
Migratory Bird Foundation Created.

334
00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:28.409
But, it's great that his children
decided to follow in his footsteps

335
00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:30.629
and take care of the tanchous...

336
00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:33.279
But 300 million?

337
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.599
I wanna be a tanchou
and get taken care of...

338
00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:42.909
This guy never changes his ways...

339
00:23:44.769 --> 00:23:50.389
Most of Mr. Dorakura's
novels feature vampires,

340
00:23:50.389 --> 00:23:53.349
so his nickname is "Mr. Dracula."

341
00:23:59.719 --> 00:24:03.229
All the windows were
locked from the inside.

342
00:24:03.229 --> 00:24:05.849
Which means the killer...

343
00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:07.689
...is an insider!

344
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:13.489
On the next Conan: "The Dracula
Manor Murder Case (Part 1)."
