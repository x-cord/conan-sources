1
00:00:01.257 --> 00:00:02.857
The House of Hope.

2
00:00:02.857 --> 00:00:07.557
Six talented young people used to live there in the past.

3
00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:09.057
However, three years ago

4
00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:12.657
when one of the women there died of a heart attack,

5
00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:17.257
people began calling the House of Hope the House of Death instead.

6
00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:20.857
Another tragedy occurs at the house.

7
00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:22.757
The husband of the woman who died,

8
00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:24.357
called Mr. Shusaku Akashi

9
00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.557
was found locked up and starved to death in one of the rooms.

10
00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:30.857
Just before he passed on,

11
00:00:30.857 --> 00:00:35.357
Mr. Akashi painted the wall on one side entirely red.

12
00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:38.657
What on earth does this mean?

13
00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:40.457
We deduced that the culprit

14
00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.957
must be among the four who used to live in the house in the past,

15
00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:46.357
and went to talk to the suspects together

16
00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:48.657
with Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, rival to Inspector Yamato

17
00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:50.657
of the Nagano Prefectural Police Station.

18
00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:54.857
Among them, Mr. Shiro Naoki acted quite suspiciously.

19
00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:58.057
So, we visited his apartment again the following day,

20
00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:01.357
but found that Naoki was murdered.

21
00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:03.857
Just like Mr. Akashi, he was seated in a chair,

22
00:01:03.857 --> 00:01:07.357
facing the wall that was painted red.

23
00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:08.557
The only difference was,

24
00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:12.757
the chair that Naoki was seated on was not painted white,

25
00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:15.457
and that there was no black chair in the room.

26
00:01:15.457 --> 00:01:18.357
Moreover, it looked to be that the culprit,

27
00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:21.757
not the victim had painted the wall.

28
00:01:21.757 --> 00:01:25.457
Is the killer challenging the police?

29
00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:26.657
Or...

30
00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:30.657
Love is magic, attack the mystery.

31
00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.157
Click Conan on Saturday at 6:00.

32
00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:35.157
Inspector Koume is attacked by the culprit.

33
00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.557
The mystery of the red wall is finally solved.

34
00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:39.057
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.857
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:43.357
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

37
00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.967
But, if you don't want him to go all out when investigating,

38
00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.167
why don't you go along with him?

39
00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:35.067
I think he wants to watch him in hiding.

40
00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:37.467
Last night when we went to look over the place

41
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.167
where Inspector Morofushi and the suspects were,

42
00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.467
there was a strange car following us too.

43
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.867
That's a car from the police, right?

44
00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:47.167
Yeah.

45
00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.267
But why would you want to keep watch?

46
00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.467
We just told you that the three in question

47
00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:56.867
knew about the red wall that was left behind at the scene, right?

48
00:03:56.867 --> 00:04:02.067
Of course, we police personnel know of the facts.

49
00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:05.667
Moreover, if that guy liked Aoi Kobashi

50
00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:07.667
and worked at the police station,

51
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.067
wouldn't it be natural to keep watch over him?

52
00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.267
Then, don't tell me...

53
00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:16.667
Yeah. Takaaki Morofushi

54
00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.267
is also a suspect!

55
00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:26.267
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Koume Dies)"

56
00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:32.867
What? You mean? Really, are you serious?

57
00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:35.867
Yeah, so I'd like to confirm...

58
00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:38.567
Where and what were you doing

59
00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.367
between 10:00 to 11:00 last night?

60
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:41.567
About that time,

61
00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:45.567
I was in my room reading the script for my next drama.

62
00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:47.467
When I completed it and went to bed,

63
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.967
I think it was after 2:00 am.

64
00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:54.167
I mean, don't tell me you're suspecting me?

65
00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:56.467
This is just in case.

66
00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:59.867
Can somebody testify for you?

67
00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.267
My wife was already sleeping at 9:00 pm, so...

68
00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:05.867
But a family member cannot testify for you.

69
00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:10.267
Was there something strange about Shiro recently?

70
00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:12.267
Like, him being jittery or something.

71
00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:15.567
I wonder because I haven't seen him for a while.

72
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.467
But, Shusaku seems to have been seeing him frequently.

73
00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:22.067
It seems that Shiro's band was not doing well.

74
00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:24.767
And Shusaku said that he used to come frequently,

75
00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:26.567
begging for money.

76
00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:27.767
Oh.

77
00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:34.367
What was I doing last night between 10:00 and 11:00?

78
00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.867
Oh my, so you suspect me of having killed Shiro too?

79
00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:40.667
You suspect me too, you say?

80
00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:43.467
An officer with slant eyes and a mustache came last night

81
00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.667
and asked me the same question, so this is what I told him!

82
00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:50.967
"I was here alone designing, bug you?"

83
00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:54.467
That Koume, beat me to it.

84
00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:56.467
Koume...

85
00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.167
you mean the name of that officer is Koume?

86
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:01.567
Yeah! His nickname is Koume,

87
00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:04.867
a classmate of Aoi Kobashi that you know well too!

88
00:06:04.867 --> 00:06:08.767
Then, the famous detective who appeared in Aoi's book is...

89
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:13.767
And? That man Shiro Naoki, was he acting strange recently?

90
00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:18.167
I wonder... I heard that he was having money problems but...

91
00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:19.367
Oh, that's right!

92
00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.267
He was saying he was going to take a trip abroad!

93
00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:26.167
I asked him if he could come up with the cash needed to travel too.

94
00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:30.967
Gosh, an officer again?

95
00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:34.267
Like I just said a while ago, from 10:00 to 13:00 last night

96
00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:37.267
I was crashed out on the sofa in the next room.

97
00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:40.167
So, Koume already came here too.

98
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:43.267
Then, can anyone testify for you?

99
00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:48.467
Try asking my friends who came to wake me up every hour!

100
00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.667
Well, I did have a blanket over me,

101
00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:55.267
so they may not be able to tell you if I was really there or not.

102
00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:58.367
Then, was Mr. Shiro Naoki

103
00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.867
acting strange or something lately?

104
00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:02.467
Beats me.

105
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:06.367
It was some time ago that he came to persistently beg me for money.

106
00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:09.867
So, I bawled him out and never saw him since.

107
00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:12.667
Oh, but it seems he came up with the money.

108
00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:16.367
He was saying that he was going to a place in Italy called Lecce.

109
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:17.767
He sent me a mail saying that

110
00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:20.967
"If I'm gone, try searching me there."

111
00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:22.867
Lecce in Italy?

112
00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:26.467
By the way, is it true that the slant eyed, officer with a mustache

113
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.467
is the model for the famous detective

114
00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:31.067
that appears in the book that Aoi wrote?

115
00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.367
Yeah but, how did you know?

116
00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.267
Because Yamabuki called me just a while ago,

117
00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:40.267
saying that Midorikawa was surprised too.

118
00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:47.567
We went around asking the three suspects questions

119
00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:50.567
but all three of them virtually had no alibi.

120
00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:51.767
Right.

121
00:07:51.767 --> 00:07:56.367
We have to solve the mystery of red wall after all.

122
00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:58.567
Red wall.

123
00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:03.067
If that was really Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message,

124
00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:06.867
why did he paint the entire wall red?

125
00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:08.767
I can see why he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

126
00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:11.667
so that everyone could obviously see it, but...

127
00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:27.067
Right, he didn't leave the culprit's name behind

128
00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:31.667
because it's most likely that the culprit would be the first one

129
00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.467
to come visit here, after he starved to death.

130
00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:37.267
That means he was afraid that the culprit would find it and erase it...

131
00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.567
Erase...

132
00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:39.767
red...

133
00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:40.967
wall...

134
00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:42.767
Wall?

135
00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:06.267
I see.

136
00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.967
Koume is not necessary in this murder performance.

137
00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:34.767
I need you to leave soon.

138
00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:40.367
What? You lost track of Koume?

139
00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.067
What the heck do you think you're doing, Uehara?

140
00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:44.867
Sorry! Just as we were entering Gojo Forest,

141
00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:46.967
he suddenly stepped on the gas and...

142
00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:50.967
Gojo Forest is where that house is!

143
00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:53.067
I'm sure Koume's headed for the house!

144
00:09:53.067 --> 00:09:54.167
Go there on the double!

145
00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:55.967
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:55.967 --> 00:09:59.467
A mail from Koume.

147
00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:02.367
Maybe he figured out who the culprit is.

148
00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:05.967
What? What's written?

149
00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:11.667
Koume... dies...

150
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:15.867
That doesn't sound very pleasant.

151
00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.867
Hey, Uehara, did you find Koume?

152
00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:23.667
Well, I just arrived at the house now, but...

153
00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:29.967
It's on fire... the House of Death!

154
00:10:29.967 --> 00:10:33.167
What? The house is on fire?

155
00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:34.967
What?

156
00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.667
And, Koume? What about Koume?

157
00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.567
I don't know,

158
00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:42.067
although his car was parked in front of the house.

159
00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:46.867
The house was already in flames when I got here!

160
00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:48.567
Koume, don't tell me that you...

161
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:51.767
He beat us to it, again.

162
00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.767
Inspector Morofushi!

163
00:11:16.847 --> 00:11:19.347
Ko... Koume.

164
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.647
If he's in there, he's probably already...

165
00:11:23.647 --> 00:11:25.547
Oh, no.

166
00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.547
As soon as I solve the mystery of the case,

167
00:11:30.547 --> 00:11:33.847
I'll contact you first thing.

168
00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:38.747
Koume, you haven't contacted me and reported on the case yet!

169
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:39.947
Darn it!

170
00:11:39.947 --> 00:11:41.647
Hey, you?

171
00:11:41.647 --> 00:11:44.147
Don't, Inspector Yamato!

172
00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:46.247
No use going in now.

173
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.447
Shut up! You can't tell unless you go in.

174
00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:52.247
Look.

175
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:56.347
I don't think there's any point in going in now, is there?

176
00:11:56.347 --> 00:11:58.347
Ko... Koume!

177
00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.847
Hey! What happened?

178
00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:08.147
I went around the backdoor because it wasn't on fire yet,

179
00:12:08.147 --> 00:12:10.147
and found him in that room in question.

180
00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:13.547
He seems to have been hit by someone.

181
00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:16.147
Koume, who was it? Who did this to you?

182
00:12:16.147 --> 00:12:19.847
No use. He completely passed out.

183
00:12:19.847 --> 00:12:23.047
But, he was struck on the back of his head.

184
00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:25.047
If he was attacked from behind,

185
00:12:25.047 --> 00:12:26.847
he may not have seen the attacker.

186
00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:32.647
But, maybe the attacker is one of the people that are here.

187
00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:35.147
Hey. What brings you all here?

188
00:12:35.147 --> 00:12:36.347
Well, you see.

189
00:12:36.347 --> 00:12:38.347
We were summoned.

190
00:12:38.347 --> 00:12:40.447
By cell phone text mail.

191
00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:41.847
By text mail?

192
00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:44.147
Who sent you the mail?

193
00:12:44.147 --> 00:12:46.347
You, inspector.

194
00:12:46.347 --> 00:12:47.847
What?

195
00:12:47.847 --> 00:12:50.647
It said that you wanted us to come here

196
00:12:50.647 --> 00:12:53.947
because you wanted to confirm something at this house where Shusaku died.

197
00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:55.347
Am I right?

198
00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:57.747
Yes. At 14:00.

199
00:12:57.747 --> 00:13:01.347
And, when we got here, the house was up in flames.

200
00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:05.647
Didn't you think it was strange that I would send you mail?

201
00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:08.347
Well, it did bother me a bit but...

202
00:13:08.347 --> 00:13:12.247
When I called the two, they said they both got the same mail so...

203
00:13:12.247 --> 00:13:14.747
The contents and the mail address were the same

204
00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:17.047
so I had no doubts.

205
00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:19.647
Then, you all came together?

206
00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:22.747
No. It said to come alone.

207
00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:24.647
That's what was written in the mail.

208
00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:34.947
"Arano Hospital"

209
00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:39.047
Mr. Shiro Naoki's cell phone?

210
00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:42.647
The text mail was sent to the three from his cell phone?

211
00:13:42.647 --> 00:13:43.847
Yeah.

212
00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:46.447
The culprit probably after killing Shiro Naoki,

213
00:13:46.447 --> 00:13:49.847
stole his cell phone, changed the mail address

214
00:13:49.847 --> 00:13:54.147
and sent the same mail to all of them including himself.

215
00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:55.847
I see.

216
00:13:55.847 --> 00:13:58.147
The suspects are

217
00:13:58.147 --> 00:14:01.847
Mr. Naoki Midorikawa, Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

218
00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:04.547
and Mr. Takuto Momose.

219
00:14:04.547 --> 00:14:06.747
By summoning the other two,

220
00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:09.447
the culprit wouldn't be the only one without an alibi

221
00:14:09.447 --> 00:14:12.247
when the house was set on fire.

222
00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:15.447
But, why did the culprit have to set fire to the house?

223
00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:17.547
Maybe he figured it out?

224
00:14:17.547 --> 00:14:22.247
That the dying message of the red wall that Mr. Akashi painted

225
00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:25.147
indicated who he was!

226
00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:28.447
So, he decided to burn the house down.

227
00:14:28.447 --> 00:14:30.647
And Koume unfortunately happened to be there.

228
00:14:30.647 --> 00:14:32.447
Therefore, the culprit had no choice

229
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:37.247
but to knock him down and decided to burn him to ashes house and all.

230
00:14:37.247 --> 00:14:38.347
And?

231
00:14:38.347 --> 00:14:40.947
What is the meaning of that red wall?

232
00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:42.447
You've figured it out, haven't you?

233
00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:45.047
I wish.

234
00:14:45.547 --> 00:14:50.347
Deadly attack Drill Punch!

235
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:51.947
Conan!

236
00:14:51.947 --> 00:14:56.747
Talking like you know it all when you don't know a thing!

237
00:14:56.747 --> 00:15:00.147
Well, the first murder site was burned to ashes,

238
00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:02.947
but we got another hint.

239
00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:06.847
The message that Koume sent to my cell phone.

240
00:15:08.647 --> 00:15:11.347
Koume dies.

241
00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:15.447
But, it could be that the culprit deliberately sent it to you.

242
00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.247
I don't think so.

243
00:15:17.247 --> 00:15:19.847
Because that message is cut part way

244
00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:21.947
and it also says that he will contact Inspector Yamato

245
00:15:21.947 --> 00:15:23.947
when he solves the mystery.

246
00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:27.247
That's why I think that Inspector Morofushi who got hold of something

247
00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:31.047
was planning to inform Inspector Yamato about it by mail

248
00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:33.047
but got attacked by the culprit.

249
00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:36.947
I think he tried to send it out before he passed out.

250
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:39.547
Why did he stop part way?

251
00:15:39.547 --> 00:15:41.947
Maybe the culprit sent it as a pun

252
00:15:41.947 --> 00:15:43.847
using the name of the great strategist Koume Shokatsuryo,

253
00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:45.747
and the nickname of Inspector Takaaki Morofushi, Koume

254
00:15:45.747 --> 00:15:47.647
and sent it?

255
00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.747
The message, "Koume dies".

256
00:15:49.747 --> 00:15:53.147
"Koume's men follow his orders even after his death!"

257
00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:56.147
Huh? What does that mean?

258
00:15:56.147 --> 00:16:02.647
Seeing strategist Koume Zhuge Liang's men (Shoku) stopped battle,

259
00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:04.747
the general of (Gi) the opposing forces, Yi Sima

260
00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:07.247
who confirmed that Koume had died of an illness,

261
00:16:07.247 --> 00:16:09.647
immediately counter-attacked with a large number of men

262
00:16:09.647 --> 00:16:12.747
but since Koume's men, stuck to orders given by Koume

263
00:16:12.747 --> 00:16:15.847
as if he were still alive, and showed signs of counter-attacking,

264
00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:18.247
the men of the opposing forces believed that Koume was not dead,

265
00:16:18.247 --> 00:16:21.147
and suspected that this was some kind of strategy against them,

266
00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.747
so they retreated!

267
00:16:23.747 --> 00:16:27.347
In other words, the power and influence of a person

268
00:16:27.347 --> 00:16:30.647
will keep his opponents in fear even after death.

269
00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:34.947
Which means that "Koume dies"

270
00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:37.547
refers to Mr. Shusaku Akashi who was starved to death

271
00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:40.247
and "living men" refer to the culprit.

272
00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:41.247
In other words, Mr. Akashi

273
00:16:41.247 --> 00:16:45.347
was trying to scare the culprit using the red wall,

274
00:16:45.347 --> 00:16:48.947
and white and black chairs that were nailed to the floor.

275
00:16:48.947 --> 00:16:51.247
It's difficult to figure out what his intention was.

276
00:16:51.247 --> 00:16:54.647
Yeah. And more so what baffles me is...

277
00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:58.347
why did the culprit deliberately leave only

278
00:16:58.347 --> 00:17:03.347
the message using the red wall behind, when he murdered Shiro Naoki.

279
00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:07.447
If that was a message to provoke the police...

280
00:17:07.447 --> 00:17:09.947
Was he all that sure,

281
00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:12.047
that the police would never figure out it was him

282
00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:13.447
just by looking at the red wall?

283
00:17:13.447 --> 00:17:15.047
Was he all that confident?

284
00:17:17.347 --> 00:17:20.047
I wonder if the culprit's motive for killing

285
00:17:20.047 --> 00:17:21.747
was really for Aoi?

286
00:17:21.747 --> 00:17:25.047
Could it be that it had to do with something red,

287
00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:26.847
so he painted the wall red?

288
00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:30.347
No doubt his motive was to avenge Aoi's death.

289
00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:31.647
I told you, didn't I?

290
00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:33.147
That when Aoi had a heart attack

291
00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:36.747
at the warehouse of that house three years ago,

292
00:17:36.747 --> 00:17:41.547
she died because her husband Shusaku Akashi left her there to die.

293
00:17:41.547 --> 00:17:43.647
It's exactly the same as

294
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:45.747
when Shusaku Akashi was locked in the room

295
00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:49.047
and left to starve to death.

296
00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:50.947
But, I don't think that's enough.

297
00:17:50.947 --> 00:17:53.647
On the day that Aoi passed away,

298
00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:55.747
it seems that the three suspects

299
00:17:55.747 --> 00:17:58.947
as well as Mr. Shiro Naoki who was killed last night,

300
00:17:58.947 --> 00:18:02.047
got a call from Aoi,

301
00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:05.147
asking them if they remembered where her husband Shusaku

302
00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:08.347
put the drawing that she modeled for him for.

303
00:18:08.347 --> 00:18:10.447
So, the thing that Aoi was looking for in the warehouse

304
00:18:10.447 --> 00:18:12.947
on the day that she died was...

305
00:18:12.947 --> 00:18:16.747
Yes. She was looking for her portrait.

306
00:18:16.747 --> 00:18:19.847
She also seems to have asked Shusaku for its whereabouts,

307
00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:22.147
but he practically ignored her

308
00:18:22.147 --> 00:18:24.647
saying he was busy working on a piece of artwork.

309
00:18:27.347 --> 00:18:29.547
It seems that Aoi used to take that portrait out

310
00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:33.647
on her birthday every year and hang it in her room.

311
00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:36.347
She died a day before her birthday

312
00:18:36.347 --> 00:18:40.147
so it's not surprising if someone held a grudge against what happened.

313
00:18:40.147 --> 00:18:43.347
Well, if Koume regains consciousness,

314
00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:45.747
we'll know whether this "Koume Dies"

315
00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:48.647
was sent by Koume himself or not too.

316
00:18:48.647 --> 00:18:52.447
If it's so, I can understand the meaning but...

317
00:18:52.947 --> 00:18:54.447
According to the doctor,

318
00:18:54.447 --> 00:18:57.147
he says that if Koume doesn't regain consciousness by tomorrow,

319
00:18:57.147 --> 00:18:59.147
they'll re-examine him again.

320
00:18:59.147 --> 00:19:00.347
I see.

321
00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:05.347
Sorry that although I asked you to come all the way out here,

322
00:19:05.347 --> 00:19:07.247
you practically have no chance to do your thing.

323
00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:11.547
Oh no, I'm sorry that I can't be of much help.

324
00:19:11.547 --> 00:19:13.147
After all,

325
00:19:13.147 --> 00:19:15.147
I guess the one that you really wanted to call over

326
00:19:15.147 --> 00:19:18.347
was this glasses kid, right?

327
00:19:18.347 --> 00:19:20.647
Yeah. I thought that the boy

328
00:19:20.647 --> 00:19:24.347
would be just the right one to keep watch over Koume.

329
00:19:24.347 --> 00:19:27.147
Because once he starts making deductions,

330
00:19:27.147 --> 00:19:29.647
he gets so engrossed in it that he loses track of his surroundings,

331
00:19:29.647 --> 00:19:30.647
and once he makes up his mind,

332
00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:33.847
he'll cross a dangerous bridge as if it were nothing.

333
00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:37.247
So, even if he won't listen to you or me,

334
00:19:37.247 --> 00:19:39.747
I figured that he may lend an ear to the warnings

335
00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:41.647
of an innocent kid.

336
00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.747
But, he fled off on his own again this time

337
00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:45.347
and did it again.

338
00:19:45.347 --> 00:19:48.747
I'm so sorry that I'm not of much use.

339
00:19:48.747 --> 00:19:51.747
Well, if I figure out the mystery of the red wall,

340
00:19:51.747 --> 00:19:53.547
I'll let you know first thing.

341
00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:54.547
Yeah.

342
00:19:55.947 --> 00:19:58.447
Doctor, how's my wife?

343
00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:02.247
She'll be fine! The surgery was a success.

344
00:20:02.247 --> 00:20:03.347
What's wrong, Ran?

345
00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:07.047
Oh, well, I was just wondering why surgical gowns

346
00:20:07.047 --> 00:20:10.047
are all light green colored!

347
00:20:10.047 --> 00:20:11.847
-Huh? -You see,

348
00:20:11.847 --> 00:20:15.647
all the other doctors and nurses wear white lab coats, don't they?

349
00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:19.247
True but why now?

350
00:20:19.247 --> 00:20:23.847
Well, the incident this time has to do with color, right?

351
00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:26.647
So, I was thinking about color.

352
00:20:26.647 --> 00:20:29.047
Oh, I know why!

353
00:20:29.047 --> 00:20:31.547
Surgical gowns are light green

354
00:20:31.547 --> 00:20:34.447
because during surgery you see a lot of blood.

355
00:20:34.447 --> 00:20:37.047
If you keep looking at the blood...

356
00:20:37.047 --> 00:20:38.747
The after image of the color...

357
00:20:38.747 --> 00:20:41.047
Makes you lose concentration.

358
00:20:49.547 --> 00:20:50.847
I get it!

359
00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:52.747
Only looking at this red wall

360
00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:56.547
will not lead to figuring out what the dying message is!

361
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.447
You can only figure out the message

362
00:20:58.447 --> 00:21:02.147
by considering the white wall a pair!

363
00:21:02.147 --> 00:21:05.147
What's wrong, both of you?

364
00:21:08.147 --> 00:21:11.647
The mysterious incident that occurred at the House of Hope.

365
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.647
The illustrator, Mr. Shusaku Akashi who lived in that house

366
00:21:14.647 --> 00:21:18.047
was locked in his room and starved to death.

367
00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:20.747
Strangely, one side of the wall at the site,

368
00:21:20.747 --> 00:21:23.347
was painted entirely red by Mr. Akashi.

369
00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:25.047
There were two chairs

370
00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:28.747
one black and one white nailed to the floor.

371
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:32.047
Mr. Akashi was found dead seated in the white chair

372
00:21:32.047 --> 00:21:33.947
facing the red wall.

373
00:21:33.947 --> 00:21:39.247
This seems to be a dying message left behind by Mr. Akashi.

374
00:21:39.247 --> 00:21:40.747
The start of the incident seemed to be

375
00:21:40.747 --> 00:21:43.747
because of a grudge held against Mr. Akashi

376
00:21:43.747 --> 00:21:47.047
for leaving his wife, maiden name Aoi Kobashi

377
00:21:47.047 --> 00:21:49.847
to die of a heart attack three years ago in the warehouse.

378
00:21:49.847 --> 00:21:51.747
That was not the end of the incident, though,

379
00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:54.447
as soon as we started the investigation,

380
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:57.947
a former resident of the house, Mr. Shiro Naoki

381
00:21:57.947 --> 00:22:00.347
was murdered at his apartment.

382
00:22:00.347 --> 00:22:02.947
Moreover, his body was seated in a chair,

383
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:06.847
and the door of the closet in front of him was painted red.

384
00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:10.147
Yes. The culprit had reproduced

385
00:22:10.147 --> 00:22:13.347
the scene of when Mr. Akashi's dead body was found.

386
00:22:13.347 --> 00:22:16.347
Could he be challenging the police?

387
00:22:17.147 --> 00:22:19.147
The suspects are three of the six

388
00:22:19.147 --> 00:22:22.747
who are still alive that used to live in the house before.

389
00:22:22.747 --> 00:22:25.147
Actor Mr. Naoki Midorikawa.

390
00:22:26.147 --> 00:22:30.347
Fashion designer Mr. Shoji Yamabuki

391
00:22:30.347 --> 00:22:33.647
and CG creator Mr. Takuto Momose.

392
00:22:34.847 --> 00:22:38.247
That person's name is undoubtedly

393
00:22:38.247 --> 00:22:42.047
indicated in Mr. Shusaku Akashi's dying message!

394
00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:06.147
Mr. Shiro Naoki said,

395
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:09.847
he was leaving for a place called Lecce in Italy, right?

396
00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:12.547
I've got a good idea, then.

397
00:24:12.547 --> 00:24:14.147
I've got one too.

398
00:24:14.147 --> 00:24:16.947
Why don't you indicate your strategy with one letter

399
00:24:16.947 --> 00:24:19.047
and show to each other using your cell phones?

400
00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:22.747
This is after all...

401
00:24:23.447 --> 00:24:26.047
The Empty Fort Strategy!

402
00:24:27.647 --> 00:24:29.047
Next Conan,

403
00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:32.929
"The House of Death, Red Wall (Empty Fort Strategy)"

404
00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:50.975
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:50.975 --> 00:24:52.975
"Italy"

406
00:24:52.975 --> 00:24:53.975
Talking of Italy...

407
00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:54.975
What comes to mind is of course wine.

408
00:24:54.975 --> 00:24:55.975
Red, white and rose.

409
00:24:55.975 --> 00:24:58.175
Is drinking all you can think of?
