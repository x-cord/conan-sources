1
00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:04.224
Officer Takagi went off

2
00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:07.424
"Meet with parents" -without telling anyone where he was going.

3
00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:09.824
The following day, the members of the Youth Detective Squad

4
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:13.524
were scheduled to meet Officer Takagi in front of the MPD.

5
00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:16.424
However, Officer Takagi didn't show up.

6
00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:18.324
Then, a man approached.

7
00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:22.424
Do you know Officer Wataru Takagi, children?

8
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.624
Yes, we do. But why?

9
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.624
I couldn't have asked for better.

10
00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:32.724
He asked me to hand this over to his detective girlfriend.

11
00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:36.024
Could you do so for me?

12
00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:40.324
Are you referring to Officer Sato whom we were just talking about?

13
00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.324
Do you mean you also know that female detective?

14
00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:44.324
Yes.

15
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:47.224
I'm sure they're getting married soon!

16
00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:50.124
-Right! -They're really in love, you see!

17
00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:54.824
Then, please relay this message from him to the happy female detective.

18
00:00:56.224 --> 00:00:59.724
He said that it's perishable, so open it as soon as you can.

19
00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:01.724
He also said that it will be no good

20
00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:04.424
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

21
00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:06.424
We opened the package

22
00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.324
and found a tablet computer inside it.

23
00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:12.324
When we switched it on, the screen displayed...

24
00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:16.824
Officer Takagi?

25
00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.524
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

26
00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:23.624
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

27
00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:25.424
Officer Takagi cannot budge an inch.

28
00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.324
He is exhausted and is in a pinch.

29
00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:29.024
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.024
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.724
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:24.004
"A Life-Risking Love Broadcast (Crisis)"

33
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.404
Hey, how is he?

34
00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:29.204
Is Takagi okay?

35
00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:30.204
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:33.904
Since three hours ago, he has been lying on his stomach.

37
00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:37.604
But he looks very exhausted and weak.

38
00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:42.004
Hasn't anyone reported to have found the police memo book

39
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.204
that he dropped back then?

40
00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:46.904
No. Not as of yet.

41
00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:50.504
Did you manage to contact the bereaved family

42
00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:52.204
of the three people who committed suicide

43
00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:54.104
that Takagi was looking through in the reference room last week?

44
00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:55.604
Well...

45
00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:57.504
For the first case, the parental home of the medical student,

46
00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.104
Ms. Yuko Tokugi was in Kochi.

47
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:02.204
However, it seems like they moved six months ago,

48
00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:04.704
and we don't know their whereabouts yet.

49
00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:07.704
As for the second one, Ms. Natalie Kuruma,

50
00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:09.404
she was born in Hokkaido.

51
00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:11.604
Her only family, which were her parents,

52
00:04:11.604 --> 00:04:14.504
were on their way to picking up their daughter's body,

53
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:18.004
when both of them got involved in a traffic accident and passed away.

54
00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:21.004
As for Ms. Kyoka Hikoue who worked as a hostess,

55
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:23.704
it seems she lied about where she was from,

56
00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:25.204
so her background is still unknown.

57
00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:28.004
But according to stories from her fellow workers,

58
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:30.404
she seemed to speak with a Hakata dialect at times.

59
00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.604
Shikoku, Hokkaido and Kyushu.

60
00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:36.304
All those places are far enough that one would need to stay overnight.

61
00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:38.204
If I remember correctly, all three suicides

62
00:04:38.204 --> 00:04:40.304
occurred on the same day, right?

63
00:04:40.304 --> 00:04:41.504
Yeah.

64
00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:44.704
It'll be a year the day after tomorrow.

65
00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:47.304
What's wrong?

66
00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:49.604
The... The image suddenly started shaking.

67
00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:50.804
What?

68
00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.104
Is... Is this an earthquake?

69
00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:54.604
Contact the meteorological agency

70
00:04:54.604 --> 00:04:56.404
and confirm where the epicenter is.

71
00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:59.604
If this is a live image, we can narrow down the location!

72
00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:01.004
Yes, sir!

73
00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:04.004
It... It's shaking quite a bit.

74
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.204
Hang on, Takagi!

75
00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:09.504
Shiratori! Have you found nothing yet?

76
00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:11.404
Well...

77
00:05:11.404 --> 00:05:14.804
From yesterday up until now,

78
00:05:14.804 --> 00:05:18.104
no earthquake has been detected in all 47 prefectures

79
00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:19.404
throughout the nation.

80
00:05:19.404 --> 00:05:21.204
What?

81
00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:23.104
Don't tell me...

82
00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:25.704
Could he be abroad?

83
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:35.904
The shaking seems to have stopped.

84
00:05:35.904 --> 00:05:38.804
This... This is a crow.

85
00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:40.604
What on earth does this mean?

86
00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:44.604
It's likely that the stick or whatever the camera is fixed to

87
00:05:44.604 --> 00:05:49.504
was shaken because the crow perched on it.

88
00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:51.604
I see.

89
00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:54.104
Anyway, it is highly probable that someone related to the suicide cases

90
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:59.804
did this because he bears some sort of grudge against Takagi!

91
00:05:59.804 --> 00:06:01.404
Work with the district police station

92
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:02.804
which has detailed information on the cases

93
00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:05.404
-and nail the suspect! -Yes, sir...

94
00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:13.204
I'm sorry to have kept all of you until so late today.

95
00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:15.204
I'm sure you're all tired from the interrogation, aren't you?

96
00:06:15.204 --> 00:06:16.504
No.

97
00:06:16.504 --> 00:06:18.804
By the way, aren't you worried?

98
00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:21.704
Officer Takagi will get sleepy when nightfall comes, right?

99
00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:22.804
That's right.

100
00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:25.204
If he rolls over while he sleeps...

101
00:06:25.204 --> 00:06:29.304
He'll be fine. He doesn't move much when he sleeps.

102
00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:31.304
Have you slept with him before?

103
00:06:31.304 --> 00:06:33.904
You really get along well, don't you?

104
00:06:33.904 --> 00:06:36.504
You see. We take short naps together

105
00:06:36.504 --> 00:06:38.904
when we're staking out.

106
00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:42.304
Maybe the culprit has a grudge against Officer Takagi

107
00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:44.904
because of one of the suicide cases.

108
00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.104
Maybe the case was actually a homicide,

109
00:06:47.104 --> 00:06:49.104
but Officer Takagi concluded it as suicide...

110
00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:52.004
I don't think so.

111
00:06:52.004 --> 00:06:55.004
If that's the case, the culprit would have a grudge

112
00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:56.804
against all the other police detectives who rushed to scene,

113
00:06:56.804 --> 00:06:59.104
as well as the forensic officers.

114
00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:00.904
Besides, it doesn't seem like anybody has requested

115
00:07:00.904 --> 00:07:04.104
for any of the three cases to be re-investigated.

116
00:07:04.104 --> 00:07:05.404
I guess you're right.

117
00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:07.304
All three suicides occurred the day

118
00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:09.204
after Officer Date got into the accident.

119
00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:12.104
Since Officer Takagi was still dazed because of the incident,

120
00:07:12.104 --> 00:07:13.704
the one who concluded that it was suicide

121
00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:15.404
was me, the assistant inspector.

122
00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:18.004
If anyone were to be hated, it would be me.

123
00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:22.304
Maybe it's the lady who went to medical school?

124
00:07:22.304 --> 00:07:25.804
Maybe she committed suicide because she ran over Officer Date?

125
00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:29.104
The person who ran over Officer Date was arrested on the spot.

126
00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:30.804
Ms. Tokugi that you were referring to

127
00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:32.204
was involved in a different accident.

128
00:07:32.204 --> 00:07:34.204
How about the English conversation teacher?

129
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.204
Maybe she was dating Officer Takagi or something.

130
00:07:37.204 --> 00:07:39.004
No way.

131
00:07:39.004 --> 00:07:41.304
Although the word "DATE" was written

132
00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:44.304
all over the calendar in her room,

133
00:07:44.304 --> 00:07:47.904
there's no way that an officer could go on dates every day like that.

134
00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:51.004
Then, maybe it's the hostess?

135
00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:52.904
She probably committed suicide

136
00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:55.004
because her boyfriend was arrested by that Officer Date, right?

137
00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:57.804
Moreover, Officer Takagi was good friends with Officer Date.

138
00:07:57.804 --> 00:07:59.704
It's true that Officer Date

139
00:07:59.704 --> 00:08:02.904
was the one who arrested Ms. Hikoue's boyfriend.

140
00:08:02.904 --> 00:08:04.004
But it was a day after Officer Date passed away

141
00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:05.704
when she found out through the newspapers

142
00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:08.104
that her boyfriend was a marriage swindler,

143
00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:10.504
and hung herself in despair.

144
00:08:10.504 --> 00:08:13.704
There's no reason why the police should be hated for that.

145
00:08:13.704 --> 00:08:16.704
Hey. I think it'd be better to ask around

146
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:20.704
for more detail about that Officer Date.

147
00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:22.204
Why?

148
00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:24.004
Something is bothering me.

149
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.604
Especially the fact that Officer Date

150
00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:29.604
has the same first name, "Wataru", as Officer Takagi.

151
00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.404
It's night time already.

152
00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:44.304
It's so cold. I'm freezing.

153
00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:46.904
I wonder if I'm going to die here.

154
00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:49.204
Well, I'm to be blamed for all this.

155
00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.904
So, I guess God's judgment was passed on me.

156
00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:54.404
Takagi...

157
00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.404
This...

158
00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:01.804
I'm leaving this to you...

159
00:09:06.804 --> 00:09:09.204
Officer Date!

160
00:09:09.204 --> 00:09:12.104
I... I'm counting on you.

161
00:09:13.804 --> 00:09:16.104
No. Get a hold of yourself.

162
00:09:16.104 --> 00:09:18.204
I've got to get out of here somehow

163
00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:20.304
and relay the message to that person!

164
00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:26.904
For Officer Date's sake,

165
00:09:26.904 --> 00:09:28.704
I have to reveal the truth.

166
00:09:35.104 --> 00:09:37.204
Bad news, superintendent!

167
00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:39.604
I contacted the provider, and found out

168
00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:42.404
that the image is being transmitted via a server abroad after all.

169
00:09:42.404 --> 00:09:46.304
We're asking the local investigators to help us on this matter.

170
00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:48.404
Does it mean it's going to take some time?

171
00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:50.604
Moreover, even if we do figure it out,

172
00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:53.104
if the transmission is being sent via several countries...

173
00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:55.404
More time will be needed for an investigation.

174
00:09:55.404 --> 00:09:59.304
And by the time we find out, Takagi could have frozen to death.

175
00:09:59.304 --> 00:10:00.904
How is Takagi doing?

176
00:10:00.904 --> 00:10:02.804
He seems very weak.

177
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.704
He has been trying to get up

178
00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.104
and was moving his body all night.

179
00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:08.404
I understand how cold he must be,

180
00:10:08.404 --> 00:10:10.604
but he'll tire himself out that way!

181
00:10:21.304 --> 00:10:24.004
"Police Station" -It wasn't a date?

182
00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:25.604
Did Officer Takagi really say so

183
00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:28.404
two days ago before he left?

184
00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:29.404
Yes.

185
00:10:29.404 --> 00:10:31.004
Yumi teased him by asking

186
00:10:31.004 --> 00:10:33.904
if he was going on an overnight date at a hot spring.

187
00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:35.804
But he answered with a slightly scary face,

188
00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:38.604
"It's not a date".

189
00:10:40.504 --> 00:10:43.704
By the way, you mentioned on the phone

190
00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:45.104
that you noticed something.

191
00:10:45.104 --> 00:10:48.604
The way the man who handed us the tablet talked

192
00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:50.504
was a bit strange.

193
00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:52.404
He said, "It will be no good

194
00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.704
by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

195
00:10:55.704 --> 00:10:57.404
It sure sounds strange.

196
00:10:57.404 --> 00:10:59.504
"Tomorrow, or at the latest, the day after tomorrow."

197
00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:01.004
That's how it's normally said.

198
00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:04.304
Maybe he's a foreigner who speaks Japanese well.

199
00:11:04.304 --> 00:11:07.204
But he looked just like a Japanese, didn't he?

200
00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:09.304
Yeah.

201
00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:10.704
Well...

202
00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.004
Was there anyone who's related to Hokkaido

203
00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:15.804
among the three women who committed suicide?

204
00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:17.004
Yes.

205
00:11:17.004 --> 00:11:19.404
The English conversation teacher, Ms. Natalie Kuruma

206
00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:21.904
was from Hokkaido.

207
00:11:21.904 --> 00:11:24.404
Then, maybe someone close to her

208
00:11:24.404 --> 00:11:27.104
is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

209
00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:29.404
-What? -Why is that so?

210
00:11:29.404 --> 00:11:30.804
In the Hokkaido dialect, "the day after tomorrow"

211
00:11:30.804 --> 00:11:35.304
is said as "tomorrow or the day after tomorrow".

212
00:11:35.304 --> 00:11:37.104
But why?

213
00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:40.504
The teacher was probably Officer Date's girlfriend.

214
00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:42.704
Girlfriend? Officer Date's?

215
00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:46.204
The word that was written on the calendar every day

216
00:11:46.204 --> 00:11:47.804
was not the English word "date".

217
00:11:47.804 --> 00:11:51.004
The word "date" is spelt D-A-T-E.

218
00:11:51.004 --> 00:11:53.804
But when it's read as a Romaji, it's pronounced as "Da-Te".

219
00:11:54.704 --> 00:11:56.104
It was probably a marker showing

220
00:11:56.104 --> 00:11:57.804
when Officer Date would go and spend the night.

221
00:11:57.804 --> 00:12:01.404
So, just like Officer Takagi said, he didn't go on a date.

222
00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:02.904
I see.

223
00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:04.304
Since she was an English teacher,

224
00:12:04.304 --> 00:12:08.204
I assumed that the "DATE" written there

225
00:12:08.204 --> 00:12:10.004
meant the English word "date".

226
00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:12.304
Also, you mentioned that she had a date scheduled

227
00:12:12.304 --> 00:12:15.604
on the day she committed suicide, right?

228
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.504
-Yes. -If she had planned

229
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:21.704
to go out somewhere with Officer Date that day...

230
00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:26.204
she probably would've kept waiting without knowing

231
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.204
that Officer Date got into a traffic accident.

232
00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.104
And she might have ended her own life out of despair,

233
00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:33.104
thinking that he dumped her.

234
00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:34.704
No way.

235
00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:38.704
A year later, Officer Takagi probably finally realised what happened,

236
00:12:38.704 --> 00:12:42.504
and wanted to tell her bereaved family about it.

237
00:12:42.504 --> 00:12:44.204
Come to think of it,

238
00:12:44.204 --> 00:12:46.204
Officer Takagi seems to have been in tears

239
00:12:46.204 --> 00:12:48.604
while looking at the photo in the memo book.

240
00:12:48.604 --> 00:12:51.504
It's very likely that he just confirmed the photo was of Ms. Natalie's

241
00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:55.904
after he went through the papers last week.

242
00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.904
But wait!

243
00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:00.604
This is about Officer Date, isn't it?

244
00:13:00.604 --> 00:13:03.004
It has nothing to do with Takagi, right?

245
00:13:03.004 --> 00:13:04.304
What if she had told her parents

246
00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:08.004
that Officer Date's name was not Date,

247
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:09.504
but rather, "Wataru",

248
00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:12.504
because it would be mistaken as "date"?

249
00:13:12.504 --> 00:13:14.004
If Officer Takagi had contacted Ms. Natalie's family

250
00:13:14.004 --> 00:13:17.504
saying that he had something to report about her,

251
00:13:17.504 --> 00:13:20.404
and that he would like to meet them, what would happen then?

252
00:13:20.404 --> 00:13:22.504
They could've mistakenly thought that the Officer Wataru from the MPD

253
00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:25.004
who dumped their daughter and drove her into suicide

254
00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:28.604
had the nerve to appear to meet them a year later.

255
00:13:28.604 --> 00:13:32.004
That's why they did what they did to Officer Takagi.

256
00:13:32.004 --> 00:13:34.304
But Ms. Natalie's parents

257
00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:37.604
got into a traffic accident on their way to pick up her body.

258
00:13:37.604 --> 00:13:40.304
Then, who picked up her body?

259
00:13:40.304 --> 00:13:41.504
If I remember correctly,

260
00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:44.504
it was a middle-aged man who was also an English teacher.

261
00:13:44.504 --> 00:13:47.504
He took her belongings with him, too.

262
00:13:47.504 --> 00:13:50.504
That reminds me, we just got a report from the district police station

263
00:13:50.504 --> 00:13:53.004
saying that when that teacher came to get the body,

264
00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:55.204
he broke down in tears.

265
00:13:55.204 --> 00:13:56.804
They also come from the same hometown

266
00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:57.904
and he treats her like his daughter.

267
00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.104
Then there's no doubt about it.

268
00:14:00.104 --> 00:14:03.004
He is the one who kidnapped Officer Takagi.

269
00:14:03.004 --> 00:14:05.704
He probably found the text mail among Natalie's belongings

270
00:14:05.704 --> 00:14:07.804
and misunderstood that Officer Takagi had dumped her,

271
00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:10.704
and made her commit suicide!

272
00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:20.655
We've pinned down the suspect.

273
00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:23.155
His name is Ryusaku Fuemoto.

274
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:26.855
He quit his job as an English conversation teacher due to an illness

275
00:14:26.855 --> 00:14:30.255
and is thought to have left for his hometown in Hokkaido last month.

276
00:14:30.255 --> 00:14:32.955
His residence in Hokkaido is unknown,

277
00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:37.255
but considering that he hasn't moved from the flat he used to live in,

278
00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:39.955
it is highly likely that he's hiding there.

279
00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:41.355
Go there on the double,

280
00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:43.555
and take him into custody as soon as you find him.

281
00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:45.455
Make him spit out Takagi's location!

282
00:14:45.455 --> 00:14:46.755
Yes, sir...

283
00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:04.755
"Fuemoto"

284
00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:09.955
Please come in. The door's open.

285
00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:18.155
Finally.

286
00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:21.555
You've finally found me.

287
00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.155
While waiting for you, I was about to doze off

288
00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:28.255
and accidentally push the switch of the bomb.

289
00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:31.455
How about it? Is he the man?

290
00:15:31.455 --> 00:15:32.755
Yeah!

291
00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:35.455
-There's no mistake! -He's the man!

292
00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:38.055
Okay, now talk.

293
00:15:38.955 --> 00:15:40.655
Tell us where Officer Takagi is.

294
00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:43.555
Are you the one?

295
00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:48.655
The officer who is the superior of Officer Wataru Takagi?

296
00:15:48.655 --> 00:15:50.055
I see.

297
00:15:50.055 --> 00:15:54.155
Just like he said, you're quite a beauty.

298
00:15:54.155 --> 00:15:58.855
But it doesn't mean he's right for dumping Natalie...

299
00:16:01.055 --> 00:16:04.655
Now, listen well before I knock you over!

300
00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:07.255
The man you kidnapped is Wataru Takagi,

301
00:16:07.255 --> 00:16:09.655
and Natalie's boyfriend was Wataru Date!

302
00:16:09.655 --> 00:16:12.555
Besides, she wasn't dumped!

303
00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:14.755
But in a mail that she sent out, she said

304
00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:16.455
that Wataru wouldn't come anymore!

305
00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:18.155
Of course, he wouldn't!

306
00:16:18.155 --> 00:16:20.055
It was because he was run over by a car

307
00:16:20.055 --> 00:16:21.455
and passed away that day!

308
00:16:21.455 --> 00:16:23.555
That... That can't be!

309
00:16:23.555 --> 00:16:26.655
So, hurry up and tell us where Officer Takagi is.

310
00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:33.255
Don't tell me...

311
00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:35.155
Don't tell me that there was poison in the wine?

312
00:16:35.155 --> 00:16:36.955
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

313
00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.355
-Yes, madam! -Hang on!

314
00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:40.855
He is...

315
00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:42.655
Where? Where is he?

316
00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.755
-Hurry up and tell me! -He...

317
00:16:50.055 --> 00:16:51.855
Where is he?

318
00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:58.055
Hey, Sato! What's going on?

319
00:16:58.055 --> 00:17:01.255
Please report the situation! Did you take custody of the suspect?

320
00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:03.655
What's the matter? Say something, Sato!

321
00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.955
-Sato? -Superintendent.

322
00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:07.555
I'm sorry to say

323
00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:09.455
that the death of suspect,

324
00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:12.755
Ryusaku Fuemoto was confirmed a while ago.

325
00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:14.855
It seems that the wine Fuemoto was drinking

326
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:18.855
when we raided the place was laced with poison.

327
00:17:18.855 --> 00:17:20.655
The suspect has passed away?

328
00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:22.655
Did someone poison him?

329
00:17:22.655 --> 00:17:24.955
No, a bottle of poison was found

330
00:17:24.955 --> 00:17:27.255
near the wine bottle.

331
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.055
It seems that he was determined to kill himself

332
00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:32.755
when the police arrived to start with.

333
00:17:32.755 --> 00:17:35.355
Judging from the fact that he had a bomb on him,

334
00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:37.955
he probably planned to blow himself to death

335
00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:39.155
if he was taken by force.

336
00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:40.855
But if he was to be given a chance to talk,

337
00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:44.855
he would drink the poison and see us grieve.

338
00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:47.855
The suspect seemed to have held a grudge against the police.

339
00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:50.655
Did you tell him that he had it all wrong?

340
00:17:50.655 --> 00:17:51.755
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:53.955
I told him that Officer Wataru Takagi whom he kidnapped,

342
00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:55.955
was an officer at the MPD where Officer Wataru Date also worked at,

343
00:17:55.955 --> 00:17:57.855
and that he had mistaken the two.

344
00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.655
And the motive of why he thought Natalie had committed suicide

345
00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:02.555
was not because Date had dumped her,

346
00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:05.655
but was because Date had died in a traffic accident.

347
00:18:05.655 --> 00:18:07.755
But by the time I explained it to him,

348
00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:09.455
he had already drunk the poison,

349
00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:13.355
and I wasn't able to find out where Takagi is being confined.

350
00:18:13.355 --> 00:18:17.355
Have you found any clue from the suspect's room?

351
00:18:17.355 --> 00:18:18.555
No.

352
00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:21.255
We're investigating right now, but nothing yet.

353
00:18:21.255 --> 00:18:22.755
The only thing we've found

354
00:18:22.755 --> 00:18:24.955
was Officer Takagi's cell phone which must've been taken by the culprit

355
00:18:24.955 --> 00:18:26.855
when he was kidnapped.

356
00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:30.455
There are several text mails from the suspect in his mailbox,

357
00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:31.955
and among them, there's one saying

358
00:18:31.955 --> 00:18:35.655
that the suspect had planned to come and see Officer Takagi in person.

359
00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:38.655
However, he fell ill, so he felt very apologetic.

360
00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:41.455
But he wanted Takagi to go to his place

361
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:45.155
with the airline ticket that he had bought for himself.

362
00:18:45.155 --> 00:18:46.955
I also found a text mail addressed to me,

363
00:18:46.955 --> 00:18:49.555
which I think was written by the suspect.

364
00:18:49.555 --> 00:18:51.355
It says, "I left your gift from Officer Takagi

365
00:18:51.355 --> 00:18:55.655
in the bushes in front of the MPD".

366
00:18:55.655 --> 00:19:00.555
So I think he intended to hand me the tablet that way.

367
00:19:00.555 --> 00:19:01.955
But since he coincidentally ran into

368
00:19:01.955 --> 00:19:03.955
the children who knew Takagi,

369
00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:06.155
he decided to ask them to deliver the tablet instead.

370
00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:09.055
Yes. That way, he didn't have to risk

371
00:19:09.055 --> 00:19:11.155
anyone stealing it while it was left there.

372
00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:12.355
Are there any other mails

373
00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:16.055
that could serve as clues on where Takagi may be?

374
00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:18.755
No. All it says is they'd meet up

375
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:19.755
when Takagi got to the airport.

376
00:19:19.755 --> 00:19:22.955
Then, continue investigating the residence.

377
00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.455
Roger!

378
00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:27.455
It's most likely that nothing will be found.

379
00:19:27.455 --> 00:19:28.555
Yeah.

380
00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:30.055
All the culprit has done

381
00:19:30.055 --> 00:19:32.655
is giving us a tablet which we can only use

382
00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:35.655
to view the image of Takagi who has been kidnapped.

383
00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:37.555
Almost all its functions have been disabled,

384
00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:40.455
and everything written on the back has been scratched off.

385
00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:44.155
The image is transmitted by a server abroad

386
00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:45.855
and its source hasn't been identified yet.

387
00:19:45.855 --> 00:19:49.455
If he had planned to commit suicide in front of the police to begin with,

388
00:19:49.455 --> 00:19:51.955
I don't think he would leave anything behind

389
00:19:51.955 --> 00:19:54.055
that would give away Takagi's location.

390
00:19:54.055 --> 00:19:56.655
If anything, it would most likely be the suspect's hometown,

391
00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.255
which was Hokkaido, but...

392
00:19:58.255 --> 00:20:00.855
Well, I also asked the local construction site workers

393
00:20:00.855 --> 00:20:03.255
to check the buildings, just to be safe.

394
00:20:03.255 --> 00:20:07.155
But as of now, we haven't received any report of Takagi being seen

395
00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:10.355
in a four-storey building as seen in the image.

396
00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:15.455
The only clue we have left is the image of Takagi.

397
00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:17.755
If it either rains or snows,

398
00:20:17.755 --> 00:20:19.755
perhaps we could narrow down the location.

399
00:20:19.755 --> 00:20:22.455
The only thing that showed up in the image was a crow.

400
00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:24.555
A crow showed up in the image?

401
00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:25.555
Yeah.

402
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:29.355
If you have the recording, could you show it to us, too?

403
00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:30.755
When it comes to animals,

404
00:20:30.755 --> 00:20:32.855
I think children know more about them.

405
00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:34.055
-Yeah! -Yeah!

406
00:20:37.955 --> 00:20:40.455
It's just a plain crow, isn't it?

407
00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:41.755
That's right.

408
00:20:41.755 --> 00:20:45.555
But look, its neck is grey, see?

409
00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:48.255
This is a Western jackdaw!

410
00:20:48.255 --> 00:20:50.755
But if I remember correctly, this type of crow...

411
00:20:50.755 --> 00:20:52.055
I'm back!

412
00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:54.355
So? Did you find out anything?

413
00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:55.755
No.

414
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.455
It seems all the data in his computer has already been deleted.

415
00:20:58.455 --> 00:21:01.455
I'm having them search where the bomb was attained,

416
00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:02.655
but nothing has been found yet.

417
00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:04.355
I see.

418
00:21:04.355 --> 00:21:06.255
So, how is Officer Takagi doing?

419
00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:08.655
Don't worry. He's still alive.

420
00:21:08.655 --> 00:21:11.255
Although he looks quite weak.

421
00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:15.155
-Nice! -What... What's going on?

422
00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:17.855
Officer Takagi's been moving all the while since yesterday.

423
00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:20.555
I thought he was moving about because he was cold.

424
00:21:20.555 --> 00:21:22.755
But actually, he was trying to cut the rope at his feet

425
00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:24.555
using the corner edge of the board.

426
00:21:24.555 --> 00:21:26.655
He finally succeeded in doing so!

427
00:21:26.655 --> 00:21:27.755
I see.

428
00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:30.155
If he hangs his legs out towards both sides,

429
00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:31.855
it'll keep him from falling off easily.

430
00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:33.355
He did it...

431
00:21:35.255 --> 00:21:38.155
But what's this? What is he doing with his leg?

432
00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:41.255
He seems to be pulling the sheet covering the board towards him.

433
00:21:41.255 --> 00:21:42.355
If he covers himself with it,

434
00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:45.055
he could stop his body temperature from dropping too low.

435
00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:51.555
No! He dropped it.

436
00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:52.955
Why?

437
00:21:55.055 --> 00:21:58.855
Maybe he wants someone to notice the sound of the sheet falling?

438
00:21:58.855 --> 00:22:02.755
Officer Takagi, what are you trying to do?

439
00:22:04.555 --> 00:22:06.455
Somebody...

440
00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:08.255
Please notice that.

441
00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:11.455
That's...

442
00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:14.655
Wait a second! What is that?

443
00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:40.655
That's...

444
00:23:40.655 --> 00:23:43.255
Wait a second! What is that?

445
00:23:45.155 --> 00:23:47.555
-A bomb? -What?

446
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:11.655
If the timer had been set to explode at that time...

447
00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:14.455
I wonder if the shaky image was checked?

448
00:24:14.455 --> 00:24:16.355
The sun pillar phenomenon.

449
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.355
Where are you, Officer Takagi?

450
00:24:18.355 --> 00:24:19.655
Don't tell me...

451
00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:22.455
If I remember correctly, the estimated time of death

452
00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:24.655
was around 10.00 am.

453
00:24:24.655 --> 00:24:26.055
Mr. Date...

454
00:24:27.255 --> 00:24:28.655
Sato!

455
00:24:28.655 --> 00:24:30.955
Takagi!

This is more than I can take.

What do you think you're saying?

461
00:24:58.755 --> 00:25:00.155
That's why you're called a sissy!

462
00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:01.555
That's tough.
