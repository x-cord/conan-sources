1
00:00:00.808 --> 00:00:04.138
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.168
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:10.048
Today is the mole solution!
People's feelings connect underground!

4
00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:11.428
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.558
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:16.048
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:58.741
Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi,
and I were playing baseball

8
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.911
in the parking lot of an
unfinished apartment building.

9
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.411
We went to get the ball after
it landed in the yard next door,

10
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:10.381
but the house's owner,
Watanuki Yoshikazu, sent us away.

11
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:16.031
Waiting for us back at the
detective agency was Koda Masao,

12
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.551
who looked just like the
Mole Alien from Masked Yaiba.

13
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:26.021
He claimed that his missing
sister had been killed by Watanuki

14
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.221
and buried somewhere in his yard,
so he wanted help finding her.

15
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:35.441
But sneaking onto others' property
and digging things up is illegal.

16
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:40.531
After his request was turned down,
Koda Masao left angrily.

17
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:46.451
But, convinced he would dig up the yard

18
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.871
while Watanuki was at the hospital,
we continued our stakeout!

19
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.021
Just then, a jewel robbery took place!

20
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:57.621
And the robber was
none other than Koda Masao!

21
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.861
Just what is his true objective?!

22
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:10.691
"The Mystery of the Mole Alien (Part 2)."

23
00:03:11.931 --> 00:03:14.351
Saturday

24
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.481
What's taking the Mole Alien so long?

25
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:20.021
Come on, let's stop calling him that.

26
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:21.821
He only looks like one.

27
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.361
What? You're the
one who first mentioned it!

28
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.941
It's him!

29
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:33.161
He really is a Mole Alien!

30
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.671
What do we do, Genta-kun?!

31
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.461
Let's have a look for now!

32
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.261
What's he doing?

33
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:54.711
Wasn't he going to dig up the yard?

34
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.331
Then should I lend him my shovel?

35
00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.481
Wait. Let's watch a little longer...

36
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.321
If my theory is correct, Koda-san is...

37
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:15.411
Beika Central Hospital

38
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:23.001
What? No one called me?

39
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:29.121
That's right. We don't call
patients about such things here.

40
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:32.471
Then who was that call from?

41
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.461
Take me to 1st Street in Beika! Hurry!

42
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.361
R-Right!

43
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:54.451
Genta-kun! This is Mitsuhiko!
Do you read me?!

44
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.961
Team leader here!
What's going on, Mitsuhiko?

45
00:04:56.961 --> 00:05:00.291
Oh, brother. The old man
just headed back there in a taxi!

46
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:01.831
Got it!

47
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:03.461
What now, Ayumi?

48
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:06.711
It might be best to let him know.

49
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.761
Hey! Mister! Watanuki-san
is gonna be back soon!

50
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.841
He's gonna see you
if you don't hurry and run!

51
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.851
Conan-kun!

52
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.351
Just as I thought!

53
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:25.771
What do you mean, Conan?

54
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.231
Koda-san is--

55
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:42.121
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

56
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.871
I'm about to prove what you did!

57
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:46.581
What?

58
00:05:56.181 --> 00:05:59.141
Whoa! He punched the Mole Alien!

59
00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:03.731
Get out! Get out this instant!
That goes for you, too!

60
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.831
Yikes...

61
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:07.441
What's that?!

62
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:10.091
Something's sparkling!

63
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.461
Sanae's earring!

64
00:06:22.621 --> 00:06:23.951
A glass shard...

65
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:26.791
Damn it!

66
00:06:34.211 --> 00:06:36.931
I'll make the call for you, Mister.

67
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:43.851
You're turning yourself in, right?
I know an inspector there!

68
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.361
Inspector Megure, correct?
I've been expecting you.

69
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:54.821
What is this, Koda-san?
Did you really commit a jewel robbery?

70
00:06:54.821 --> 00:07:00.921
Yes. The jewels I stole are
buried throughout Watanuki's yard.

71
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.081
I don't remember where I buried them,

72
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:06.291
so you'll have to dig
up the yard to find them.

73
00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:08.171
What?!

74
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:11.751
What are all those holes?!

75
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:17.081
Koda-san made them!
The jewels are buried in some of them!

76
00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:22.351
So, you'll have to dig the
whole yard up to find them all!

77
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:23.921
Koda-san!

78
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:28.961
Don't tell me you did the robbery
to have the police dig up this yard?!

79
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:32.061
Then you never intended
to escape from the start?!

80
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.741
Koda-san just wanted enough
time to dig holes in the yard.

81
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:41.251
That's why he left a
jewel on the station stairs

82
00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:43.241
and made it look
like he escaped by train!

83
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.791
This is the model
gun I used in the robbery.

84
00:07:51.121 --> 00:07:54.171
Watanuki Yoshikazu-san, correct?

85
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:55.251
Yes.

86
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:59.251
Mori-kun there has told me
about your incident with Koda-san.

87
00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:01.801
Do you mind if we dig up your yard?

88
00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.011
Y-You can't be serious!
What gives you the right?!

89
00:08:05.011 --> 00:08:09.251
It's absolutely necessary for
the investigation of the jewel robbery.

90
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:14.441
Or is there some reason digging
up your yard would be bad for you?

91
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:17.441
O-Of course not!

92
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:21.251
In that case... Takagi-kun!
Contact headquarters!

93
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.111
Yes, sir!

94
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:23.751
Alright!

95
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.081
Good for you, Mister!

96
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:26.081
Yeah!

97
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:34.461
What's that smile for?!
Don't tell me he--?!

98
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:41.631
The jewels are quite small!
Dig everything up!

99
00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:53.441
Inspector!

100
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:56.461
Only the jewels have turned up.

101
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:59.081
I don't think there are
any bodies buried here...

102
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.611
That can't be!

103
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:03.081
Look harder!

104
00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:08.121
We are looking hard!
Where else are we supposed to dig?!

105
00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:11.581
Oh, you've really dug everything up.

106
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:15.631
Maybe I should use this opportunity
to start a vegetable garden.

107
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.001
Right, Inspector?

108
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.091
Dammit!

109
00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:21.121
Koda-san!

110
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:35.351
Koda-san...

111
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:41.541
Shut up! Sanae is here! I know
she's buried in this yard somewhere!

112
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:46.491
I can understand how you feel,
but there's no point in continuing this.

113
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:50.491
Sanae...

114
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:52.541
Sanae!

115
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:01.461
The police took Koda-san into custody?!

116
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:07.751
Yeah, no matter what his reason,
he did commit a jewel robbery.

117
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:10.751
But why didn't the body turn up?

118
00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:14.691
Because there was
never one to begin with.

119
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.081
Koda-san was mistaken.

120
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:25.071
Watanuki-san didn't kill her; she went
missing for some other reason.

121
00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:29.451
No! Watanuki-san definitely killed her!

122
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:32.911
That smile then...

123
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:35.961
That look was more proof than anything!

124
00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:41.171
But it's a fact she said she was
going to visit Watanuki-san's house

125
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:45.461
before heading home
on the night of May 8th, right?

126
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:48.681
Yeah, that's what her co-worker said.

127
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:53.521
Eh? You went to her company?
Did you find anything out?!

128
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:56.081
The only other thing I learned

129
00:10:56.081 --> 00:11:02.941
was that that co-worker gave
her some cosmos seeds during lunch.

130
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.941
Cosmos seeds?

131
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:11.621
Yeah, don't you remember?
Koda-san said she loved cosmos flowers.

132
00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:15.581
Anyways, the most likely possibility

133
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:19.621
is that she was caught up in
some incident and went missing

134
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:23.091
on her way to Watanuki-san's
house from her company.

135
00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:26.731
Supposedly, the police are going
to investigate from that angle, too.

136
00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:28.211
The next day (Sunday)

137
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:32.511
Then you think that old man killed her, Conan-kun?
The next day (Sunday)

138
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.971
Yeah, I'm almost certain of it.

139
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:37.961
But they never found her body.

140
00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:43.941
Hmm, maybe it was buried under
a floorboard instead of the garden?

141
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:49.151
No. There wouldn't have been
a digging sound in the back alley.

142
00:11:49.421 --> 00:11:51.571
Hey, let's check out the library.

143
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:53.291
L-Library?

144
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.081
Yeah!

145
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:58.041
If we check the newspapers from May 8th,
we might find something!

146
00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:02.501
Yeah! But we don't want to
check newspapers from the 8th.

147
00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:07.621
Because news from the night of
the 8th won't be in that day's paper.

148
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:18.711
There's a Masked Yaiba show at
Toto Dept. Store the 23rd and 24th!

149
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:19.681
We gotta see it!

150
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:24.111
Genta-kun. You're reading
last month's paper.

151
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:27.371
Not to mention,
we all went to that show!

152
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.831
Oh, really?

153
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.111
Yes, really!

154
00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:35.751
I don't see any pertinent articles...

155
00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:36.621
Conan-kun.

156
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:42.581
There was a strong easterly wind
from the night of the 8th to the 9th.

157
00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:46.121
What's that got to do with this case?

158
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:47.251
No, I don't know...

159
00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:50.371
There don't seem to be any clues here,

160
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:55.461
so let's go see the Mochida-san
person who heard the digging sound!

161
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:57.251
lt was a month ago, and I was drunk,

162
00:12:57.251 --> 00:13:00.331
Mochida Shinichi (35)
lt was a month ago, and I was drunk,

163
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:02.021
so I don't remember clearly.
Mochida Shinichi (35)

164
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:06.731
You entered the alley from this road, right?

165
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:12.081
Yeah, there was loud
construction on this road that night.

166
00:13:12.081 --> 00:13:17.221
So I hurried into this alley,
and lit a cigarette a little ways down.

167
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:22.661
That's when I heard a
shovel by the house to the left.

168
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:27.001
You're certain it was this house?

169
00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:29.211
Well, I was drunk, so...

170
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.471
Yeah. I'm certain of it.
I heard it coming from my left.

171
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:43.121
Could you act out what you did again?

172
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:44.191
Yeah, okay.

173
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:49.251
There was a construction
truck parked there.

174
00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:52.241
So I went into the alley while
thinking what a nuisance it was.

175
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:56.951
Yeah, it was around
here where I lit my cigarette.

176
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.911
Wait a minute! This way is east!

177
00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:03.871
Say! Was there a strong
wind coming straight at you?!

178
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:07.171
Oh, now that you mention it...

179
00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:12.421
The wind was so strong it kept putting out the lighter,

180
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:14.581

The wind was so strong it kept putting out the lighter,

181
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:16.911
so I turned around to light it.

Main Road West Apartments

183
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:20.891
Huh? Does that mean...

184
00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:24.751
Left was right, and right was left?

185
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:25.891
Conan-kun!

186
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:28.271
Oh! So that's why he--!

187
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:38.911
Alright! This manhole
will be the home plate!

188
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:45.791
All right! I figured it out!

189
00:14:54.886 --> 00:14:57.556
Eh?! You know where the body is?!

190
00:14:58.186 --> 00:15:01.566
Yes! We, the Junior
Detective League, found it!

191
00:15:01.566 --> 00:15:03.726
So, where is it?!

192
00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:07.446
Forget 'em. The brats are
obviously spewing nonsense.

193
00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:11.536
But Shinichi-niichan said
there was no doubt about it, too!

194
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:12.596
What?!

195
00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:14.996
You saw Shinichi, Conan-kun?!

196
00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:18.386
No, I talked to him on the phone just now!

197
00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:22.766
He said he would call Inspector Megure!

198
00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:25.716
So, you two should come along!

199
00:15:26.436 --> 00:15:28.456
Come along where?

200
00:15:32.516 --> 00:15:37.606
What is this about, Inspector?!
I'd like an explanation!

201
00:15:37.606 --> 00:15:39.306
R-Right...

202
00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:42.096
Are you kids really sure about this?

203
00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:46.776
I never would've agreed to
this had Shinichi-kun not called me...

204
00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:50.806
Leave it to us, Inspector!

205
00:15:50.806 --> 00:15:52.536
Okay, let's begin!

206
00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:58.136
The night of May 8th,
Koda-san's sister, Sanae-san,

207
00:15:58.136 --> 00:16:01.496
stopped by this house
after work, just like she had said.

208
00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:04.666
And, just as Koda-san surmises...

209
00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:07.636
...Watanuki-san killed her.

210
00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:14.596
Ridiculous! What nonsense!
They dug up the entire yard yesterday!

211
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:20.016
But you buried the body not
in your yard, but somewhere else!

212
00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:24.646
Tell me! Where is my sister buried?!

213
00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:27.516
The answer to that is upstairs!

214
00:16:27.516 --> 00:16:29.486
Follow me!

215
00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.136
Hey! Wait!

216
00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:56.596
Hey, Conan! Where in
this room could she be?!

217
00:16:56.976 --> 00:16:58.556
She's not in here.

218
00:17:00.596 --> 00:17:01.896
Here!

219
00:17:06.436 --> 00:17:07.476
What's that?

220
00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:13.656
An unfinished apartment building.

221
00:17:13.936 --> 00:17:17.516
Your sister's body is buried there.

222
00:17:18.936 --> 00:17:24.336
At the time of the incident,
its construction was going as scheduled.

223
00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:29.596
Burying a body there would mean
it wouldn't be dug up for decades.

224
00:17:29.596 --> 00:17:31.796
This fact was a relief to him.

225
00:17:31.796 --> 00:17:36.766
But something unexpected
happened half a month later.

226
00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:40.556
The apartments' construction
was suddenly canceled.

227
00:17:40.556 --> 00:17:44.726
Eh?! Then they're
going to be demolished?!

228
00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:49.096
It's very possible. And the
body would be found right away.

229
00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:51.976
I'm so worried I can't sleep at night!

230
00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:53.946
Let's watch the place with binoculars!

231
00:17:54.596 --> 00:17:58.136
And that's why Watanuki-san
stopped leaving the house

232
00:17:58.136 --> 00:18:00.436
for everything but hospital visits.

233
00:18:00.436 --> 00:18:04.916
And it's why he watched the
premises with these binoculars.

234
00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:11.186
But I have no way to enter those premises!

235
00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:16.716
The area is fenced off,
and the gate was locked that night!

236
00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:19.266
You speak as if you
investigated these things.

237
00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:22.766
But there's a hole in the back!

238
00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:25.516
No, that was made just recently.

239
00:18:25.516 --> 00:18:28.106
Conan, how did he get in there?

240
00:18:28.476 --> 00:18:31.436
Koda-san has the answer to that.

241
00:18:31.436 --> 00:18:35.326
By sheer coincidence,
he used the exact same method!

242
00:18:36.936 --> 00:18:38.036
You mean...?!

243
00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:39.306
Oh!

244
00:18:39.306 --> 00:18:40.136
I get it!

245
00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:41.366
The sewer system!

246
00:18:43.266 --> 00:18:47.886
That night, there was a construction
truck parked in the alley,

247
00:18:47.886 --> 00:18:51.796
so this house's back entrance
couldn't be seen from the main street.

248
00:19:31.016 --> 00:19:34.756
I see! So the sewer
system connects here!

249
00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:39.636
The night of May 8th,
major construction covered the main street,

250
00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:44.766
so the sound of a shovel digging
wouldn't seem suspicious to anyone.

251
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.726
To anyone but Mochida-san, that is.

252
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.436
Isn't that right, Watanuki-san?

253
00:19:52.186 --> 00:19:54.016
Damn you!

254
00:19:54.016 --> 00:19:55.936
Why did you kill Sanae?!

255
00:19:55.936 --> 00:19:56.696
Stop it!

256
00:19:57.136 --> 00:19:58.946
D-Do you have proof?!

257
00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:04.536
This is all nothing
but that child's conjecture!

258
00:20:04.936 --> 00:20:08.496
So what if I could've
entered this parking lot?!

259
00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:12.956
Anyone could've used
that method to get in here!

260
00:20:12.956 --> 00:20:16.386
And besides, where is the body anyway?!

261
00:20:16.386 --> 00:20:17.926
Right here.

262
00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:22.636
The body of Koda-san's sister
is resting beneath this plant.

263
00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.266
What?!

264
00:20:26.386 --> 00:20:29.766
But, Conan-kun!
How do you know it's here?!

265
00:20:29.766 --> 00:20:30.766
Look!

266
00:20:33.476 --> 00:20:34.636
A cosmos...

267
00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:40.446
Oh, yeah! A coworker gave your
sister some cosmos seeds that day!

268
00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:44.786
And one must've fallen out
and sprouted after she was buried...

269
00:20:53.346 --> 00:20:56.046
I didn't mean to kill her...

270
00:20:56.596 --> 00:21:00.856
I snapped that night when
she refused to compensate me...

271
00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:06.346
Then our deal is off!

272
00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:08.726
Leave!

273
00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:11.976
W-Wait! Watanuki-san!

274
00:21:15.636 --> 00:21:16.726
Watanuki-san!

275
00:21:16.726 --> 00:21:18.066
Shut up!

276
00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.146
Sanae...

277
00:21:40.726 --> 00:21:47.766
That night, his sister's body was
found beneath the cosmos seedling.

278
00:23:17.816 --> 00:23:25.316
After that, Koda-san was given
a suspended sentence for his robbery.

279
00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:30.666
He decided to return to his
hometown with the cosmos seedling.

280
00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:32.996
It won't bring his sister back,

281
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:36.706
but he said he'll take
great care of it, as if it were her.

282
00:23:38.036 --> 00:23:41.816
And thus the mystery
of the Mole Alien was solved!

283
00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:45.666
By the way, Conan-kun.

284
00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:48.456
Yes, Ran-neechan?

285
00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:51.596
You said you talked to
Shinichi on the phone, right?

286
00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.376
Y-Yeah...

287
00:23:53.376 --> 00:23:54.056
Uh oh!

288
00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:57.456
Tell me... where is he?

289
00:23:57.456 --> 00:23:59.586
Oh, uhh, actually...

290
00:23:59.586 --> 00:24:01.566
Answer me, Conan-kun!

291
00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:05.376
She's scarier than Mole Aliens!

292
00:24:12.466 --> 00:24:14.176
Hey! A car's coming!

293
00:24:16.886 --> 00:24:18.836
Ayumi! Damn!

294
00:24:25.336 --> 00:24:30.106
Ishikura-san's killer
was you, Shishido-san!

295
00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:35.046
On the next Conan--

296
00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:37.856
"The Great Detective League Pursuit Case."
