1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,540
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,440
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,740
A fun-filled masquerade party suddenly

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,840
takes a turn and turns into a homicide!

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
A sad story of a clown.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:46,545
How about it? Pretty good, don't you think?

10
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:51,045
You do know that huge theme park called "Anime Land", right?

11
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,345
I was appointed one-day theme park chief there.

12
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,645
I figured that it's no fun just doing the part,

13
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,845
so I decided to add some "fizz" to it.

14
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,745
That surprise "fizz" that I added took on extremely well.

15
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,545
And I was asked to be one-day theme park chief the next year,

16
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,045
the year following and forever!

17
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:07,045
I'm going to come rent costumes again when the time comes

18
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,245
so don't go out of business!

19
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:14,045
Nobody said anything like that.

20
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:17,645
Because you're strange old man, they couldn't differ you from an idiot.

21
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:25,445
"Picture Mail from a Clown"

22
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,145
I guess this is good.

23
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:31,345
I'll give it to you as a gift, with my autograph on it.

24
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:32,845
No, thank you.

25
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,345
What's this dance?

26
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:38,345
This was taken around 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

27
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:40,145
It sure was a big shake.

28
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:42,345
I'm sure that was about five on the the seismic intensity scale.

29
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,245
Are you all one-day theme park chief?

30
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:52,345
"Minoru Kijima (30)" -No.

31
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,145
"Make-up artist" -We going to a party.

32
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:56,545
They're engagement party for these two!

33
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,745
Oh, a costume party?

34
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,945
"Jiro Ishikawa (28)" -Well, it's quite embarrassing, though.

35
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,945
"Cameraman" -But, there's a person saying that "a mere party is boring."

36
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:06,045
"Yoko Nakamura (25)" -We can't refuse the request,

37
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:07,745
"Fashion model" -because she's a big shot.

38
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,045
Smiling on the outside, crying on the inside.

39
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,645
Tears are hidden by make-up, just like a clown.

40
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:16,545
Oops, I forgot the hat.

41
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:19,945
I wonder what kind of costume I should wear next time.

42
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,745
This? No, maybe this...

43
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:25,745
It's from Ms. Umeda.

44
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,645
It's from the host of the party.

45
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,745
I was surprised at the earthquake

46
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,745
but preparations for the party are in progress.

47
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,045
The chief editor hates earthquakes.

48
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,645
She said, "This is my costume."

49
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,745
A clown.

50
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:43,245
Yes, this is the chief editor, Umeda.

51
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:46,245
Great, don't you think?

52
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,845
It's a mail from Ms. Umeda

53
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:49,845
saying that she'll leave the door open,

54
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,545
so to come in on your own.

55
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,945
Roger.

56
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:55,845
It's 4.30 pm now, so we'll get there at 5 pm sharp.

57
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,245
A party.

58
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,345
Well then, kid.

59
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,945
Let's go play pachinko,

60
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:09,645
and go eat something good afterwards.

61
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,245
Yes!

62
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,645
Excuse me.

63
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,745
Could you keep this for us too?

64
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,445
Okay.

65
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,645
See you then.

66
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,045
Bye.

67
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:27,945
What about going to eat something good?

68
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,745
You used all the money you had on pachinko.

69
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,745
Talk about heartless.

70
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:36,045
What's the big deal about picking up balls on the floor?

71
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,245
What a wretched world, really.

72
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,245
I wonder who's more wretched.

73
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:55,245
Yes. A picture of a woman dressed in a clown outfit was displayed

74
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,345
on the women's cell phone at around 4.30 pm.

75
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:12,645
The cause of death is suffocation from the neck being choked.

76
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,545
In other words this is murder by strangulation.

77
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:18,245
This is the woman I saw on the display of the cell phone.

78
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:23,745
Mr. Mouri had seen the mail from the victim at 4.30 pm.

79
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,945
The dead body was found at 5 pm.

80
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:28,345
Judging from various angles,

81
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:32,345
I guess it would be safe to say that she was killed between 4 pm and 5 pm.

82
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,745
Hey, what do you mean by various angles?

83
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:38,045
Conan, sticking your nose in from the side again.

84
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:40,245
I'm sorry, just ignore him.

85
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,945
Oh no, it's okay.

86
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:46,245
The muscles of people become hard when they die.

87
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,345
It's rigor mortis, right? I read about it in a book.

88
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:53,545
The body usually starts to harden from about 2 hours after death.

89
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,945
But, if outside during summer

90
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:59,345
or in places that are warm like this room

91
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,345
where the heater is on, it starts much faster.

92
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:06,745
But, this person has begun to harden at all.

93
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:10,945
Which means not much time has passed since she died.

94
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,445
Since it's 5.30 pm now,

95
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,445
we can deduced that she died after 4.30 pm,

96
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,545
that is, about an hour ago.

97
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:21,645
And, who is this Ms. Umeda?

98
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:25,645
A competent chief editor of a women's fashion magazine.

99
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:30,245
Ms. Kijima who found the corpse is a popular make-up artist.

100
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,845
The victim is the one who found him

101
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:35,345
and brought him to where he is now.

102
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,345
And, Mr. Ishikawa who was with her,

103
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,045
is a cameraman for that magazine.

104
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,945
Likewise. Yoko Nakamura, who was with her used to be a fashion model.

105
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,545
Rings and necklaces seem to be missing

106
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:51,245
from the victim's jewelry box.

107
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,645
Maybe the young man that we saw stole them?

108
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,445
Did they see the killer?

109
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:03,645
They seem to have seen a man fleeing out of the condo

110
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:04,845
when they all got here.

111
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,545
It was 5 pm.

112
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,745
Just when we parked the car in the parking lot

113
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:11,045
and was heading for the condo.

114
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:16,045
He was wearing a black leather jacket.

115
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:18,845
A robber?

116
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,545
Looked like it.

117
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:21,945
Or, maybe a killer.

118
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:24,445
Come off it, Mr. Kijima.

119
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,645
He's only kidding.

120
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:29,345
Good evening, Chief editor.

121
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,645
Wow, it sure is warm.

122
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:33,045
It's cold outside, so it sure is relieving.

123
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,345
What's this?

124
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:37,345
Footprints? Don't tell me that!

125
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:43,445
Chief editor, there are footprints on the corridor,

126
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,545
but what seems to be the matter?

127
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:48,145
Chief editor?

128
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,345
Chief editor!

129
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,645
Don't move around!

130
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,945
We don't want to erase the killer's footprints.

131
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,045
Where'd the phone?

132
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:04,945
Darn!

133
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,845
The killer did this.

134
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:08,945
I didn't bring my cell phone with me.

135
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,045
What about the chief editor's cell phone?

136
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:11,945
There' s no way it would be here.

137
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:14,545
Ishikawa, let's us two split up

138
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,445
and go look for a public phone.

139
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:20,045
No, we can't leave Yoko alone here.

140
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,845
Please stay here, Mr. Kijima.

141
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,445
So, they both went to look for a public phone.

142
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,245
It wasn't easy to find.

143
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,945
But we finally found one in front of the station.

144
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,745
The case was reported to the police at 5.15 pm.

145
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:39,445
We arrived here at 5.30 pm,

146
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,845
and Ms. Umeda was already dead.

147
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:45,645
How come nobody had their cell phone with them?

148
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:47,845
You had it on you a while ago, miss.

149
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:51,045
You keep out of this, kid.

150
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:54,345
Yes, that's what I was just about to ask you too.

151
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:55,745
We left our phones at the rental costume shop

152
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,445
that we were at a while ago.

153
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:01,145
The chief editor never liked cell phone all that much.

154
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,545
Because she would be chased around everywhere at all times.

155
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,345
Especially when it came to parties,

156
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,745
she never allowed people to bring in their cell phones.

157
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,845
She even cautioned me against receiving e-mails.

158
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,245
I see.

159
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:14,545
About 5 years ago,

160
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,345
you could find public phones almost anywhere.

161
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,945
But now, they're not easy to find.

162
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,645
It sure has become a strange world.

163
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,045
I don't know if it's gotten more convenient or not.

164
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:25,745
So much for that.

165
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,545
Whether the killer knew about it

166
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:28,745
or whether it was a mere coincidence,

167
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:31,945
he entered this roomed that happened to be unlocked.

168
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,545
Ms. Umeda was absorbed in making preparations

169
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,345
that she didn't notice the killer sneaking up on her.

170
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:50,145
She was attacked from behind

171
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,945
when she was setting the things for this seat.

172
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:54,745
I'm sure she would've noticed

173
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,845
if someone came in from the front door.

174
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,345
And, she fled.

175
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:07,945
But there are no signs of struggle in this room.

176
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:09,945
The room is in exactly the same condition

177
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:11,045
it was when you all got here, rigtht?

178
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,945
Right, I recalled a scene

179
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,345
in a mystery program that was on TV.

180
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,645
I don't know!

181
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,445
I didn't do it!

182
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,645
I didn't do anything.

183
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:24,045
It's him! He's the one!

184
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,745
He's the one that came running out of the condo!

185
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,245
I saw him at the park in front of the station

186
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,145
and since he looked jittery,

187
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:34,245
I questioned him, then he tried to flee on me,

188
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,045
"Masataka Shimizu (25)" -so I nabbed him on the spot.

189
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:38,945
"Underemployed" -I don't know anything.

190
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,445
He had these on him.

191
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,645
Officer Sato,

192
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:45,245
could you have Mr. Kijima and the others take a look at this?

193
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,445
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,545
It matches exactly even the way the sole has worn away.

195
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,745
Yes, there's not mistake about it.

196
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:56,345
These are all her favorite jewelry.

197
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:57,945
Thank you very much.

198
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:00,145
Please wait here just a little while more.

199
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,745
You were asked to do so, on the Internet?

200
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,445
Yeah, I just happened to find something good written.

201
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,445
The content of the job was to come here at 5 pm,

202
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,045
and take the jewelry that is on the table

203
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,445
to the park in front of the station.

204
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,445
Stop making up stories.

205
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:18,345
You killed her because you were after cash, isn't that it?

206
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,845
No!

207
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,545
When I got here that clown was already dead!

208
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:26,145
I fled because I didn't want to get involved.

209
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,845
What a stubborn guy.

210
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:32,945
But, isn't it strange

211
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,845
that he didn't flee too far away from the scene,

212
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,545
and stayed sticking around the park?

213
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,245
It could be that he was really hired by somebody.

214
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:47,245
Serving one-day theme park chief can sure be tiring.

215
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:50,545
I'm starting to get sleepy.

216
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,245
Hey, hey. He fell asleep.

217
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:02,945
Beef stew.

218
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,145
It's cold.

219
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,245
The fire's been out for quite some time.

220
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,445
But the dial shows that it should've been on simmer.

221
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,545
Officer, please believe me.

222
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:17,645
All right.

223
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,345
What's this?

224
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:22,245
What's the matter?

225
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,945
Conan. Be quiet.

226
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,045
Mr. Mouri's going to start his show soon, isn't he?

227
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,145
I wonder.

228
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:32,045
Nothing's going to start, because he's really asleep this time.

229
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,145
It's the usual.

230
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,945
By the way, do you happen to know what this is?

231
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:39,845
This is...

232
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,545
I asked the manager of this condo about it,

233
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,945
and was told that it's an earthquake detector to switch off the gas.

234
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:46,845
An earthquake detector?

235
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,045
Yes, when an earthquake occurs it will automatically

236
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,945
switches off the gas to prevent fire.

237
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,945
Ms. Umeda seems to have requested to have it installed yesterday.

238
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:57,245
It switches the gas off when it detects a intensity of 3.

239
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:59,945
Oh, it probably switched off because of the earthquake in 3 pm,

240
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,245
and she forgot to turn the fire back on.

241
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:04,645
She forgot to turn the fire back on?

242
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:07,545
Rather, maybe she couldn't.

243
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:11,045
She may have been dead by 3 pm when the earthquake occurred.

244
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:14,845
But, the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

245
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,545
If she died around 3 pm,

246
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,845
rigor mortis would've already happened

247
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,845
when Inspector Megure and the others got here at 5.30 pm.

248
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:26,345
The heater was on in this room,

249
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:29,345
and rigor mortis would've occurred even faster.

250
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,745
However, there were no signs of rigor mortis at all.

251
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,545
What does this mean?

252
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,645
Was it left in a cold place?

253
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,745
It can't be.

254
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,145
But the only cold place thinkable in an ordinary house is...

255
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:49,245
In order to delay rigor mortis...

256
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:53,845
What're you looking for?

257
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,545
Shall we help you look for it?

258
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:59,045
No, I'm fine. I'll look for it myself.

259
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:07,245
There's no space under the bed.

260
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,245
It's also impossible in the closet.

261
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:19,745
Could it be here?

262
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,945
Hey, is there a ladder in this house?

263
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:26,045
A ladder? I don't know.

264
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,545
Wait, it should be on the veranda.

265
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:30,345
I used it to take pictures last week.

266
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,245
On the veranda, right? Thank you.

267
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,345
It's grease paint.

268
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,645
It's still new.

269
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,545
It's so cold.

270
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,145
Conan? Where's Conan?

271
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,245
Artificial hair?

272
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,245
The ladder was not needed.

273
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,345
That person's the killer!

274
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,066
Please wait, officer.

275
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,766
Please believe me.

276
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:18,766
You came here. But, you didn't kill the victim.

277
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,366
Who's going to believe something like that?

278
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,166
We'll hear you out all you want at headquarters.

279
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,766
Hey, Officer Takagi!

280
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:29,866
Officer, may we be excused too?

281
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,966
I guess so. You may go.

282
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,866
What a disaster.

283
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,566
Your costume party's gone down the drain.

284
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,766
More than that, you've lost a precious person...

285
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:44,766
Mr. Mouri.

286
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,066
I wonder if he just fell asleep again?

287
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:51,966
No, the previous one was just a rehersal.

288
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:55,866
Now, let me show you the Sleeping Kogoro cut the Gordian knot.

289
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:02,366
Mr. Kijima, we can't have you leaving just yet.

290
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,866
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mouri?

291
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:09,666
Mr. Ishikawa, where at what time did you meet Mr. Kijima today?

292
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,566
At 3 pm in front of the Beika Department.

293
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,366
Mr. Kijima, before 3 pm,

294
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:17,366
where and what were you doing?

295
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,266
Well, I was doing a lot of things.

296
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:23,166
It sort of sounds like you're checking on my alibi?

297
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,466
Exactly, I'm checking on your alibi.

298
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:29,566
Inspector, Mr. Shimizu who was brought in a while ago

299
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:31,866
is not the killer.

300
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,866
The one who killed Ms. Umeda is

301
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,666
Mr. Kijima, over there.

302
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,366
Just what are you talking about, all of a sudden?

303
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,266
Mr. Kijima was with us right through.

304
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:46,366
He had no time to kill the chief editor.

305
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,266
The only time we acted separately

306
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,266
was when we went to look for a public phone.

307
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:55,266
But, chief editor was already dead at that time.

308
00:16:56,466 --> 00:17:00,466
No, Ms. Umeda was killed much earlier.

309
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,966
Most probably, even before you both met Mr. Kijima.

310
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:08,166
But the estimated time of death is between 4.30 pm to 5 pm.

311
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,566
And besides,

312
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:12,966
didn't you see the mail from Ms. Umeda too?

313
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:19,066
All he did was use Ms. Umeda's cell phone.

314
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,766
It doesn't necessarily mean that she sent it herself.

315
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:26,066
But, Mr. Mouri, rigor mortis hadn't started.

316
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,466
Ms. Umeda's body was not in this room.

317
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:34,066
It was somewhere in a cold place until just before you came here.

318
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,166
In order to delay rigor mortis.

319
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,766
Just what are you talking about!

320
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,066
I saw the dead body here together with everyone else!

321
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,066
What was that dead clown that we saw supposed to be then?

322
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:51,066
A doll with the make-up of a clown of a size similar to Ms. Umeda.

323
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:53,066
Who is the one that suggested today's party was to be

324
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:56,166
a costume party, in the first place?

325
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,266
The chief editor.

326
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:02,266
Mr. Ishikawa, did the editor tell you directly?

327
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:07,166
No, Mr. Kijima told us that the editor said so.

328
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,966
By the way, Mr. Kijima.

329
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,166
Did you know that gas appliances in this house

330
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,366
were equipped with an earthquake detector device?

331
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,766
Earthquake?

332
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:19,166
You didn't know, did you?

333
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,966
Officer Sato, will you bring the pot

334
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,566
with the half-cooked stew in it over here?

335
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,666
Yes, sir.

336
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:32,866
Please explain the contents of the pot to us.

337
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,766
She seems to have been making beef stew,

338
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,466
but it is not cooked yet at all.

339
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,966
If left as is, I don't think it would've been ready

340
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,666
for the party to be held at 5 pm.

341
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:46,866
Ms. Umeda was making preparations to make it in time for the party.

342
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,166
As proof of this,

343
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,666
the dial of the gas stove was set at simmer.

344
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,166
She was probably planning to cook it slowly on simmer.

345
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,866
However, the fire went out because of the earthquake detector.

346
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:02,266
But, she never turned the gas stove back on.

347
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,666
Rather, she couldn't.

348
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,466
Why? Because she was already dead.

349
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:10,466
Mr. Kijima, killed by you.

350
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:11,866
What proof do you have?

351
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,466
This is ridiculous, I'm going home!

352
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,566
Mr. Mouri hasn't finished what he is saying.

353
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:24,166
Mr. Kijima, before meeting with Mr. Ishikawa and Yoko,

354
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,566
you came here strangled and killed

355
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:28,066
Ms. Umeda who was absorbed in making preparations,

356
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,966
from behind and switched her

357
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,366
with the doll you had prepared, beforehand.

358
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,666
Why did you do that?

359
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,766
Yes, you did so because

360
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:43,266
you had to leave Ms. Umeda's body in a cold place.

361
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,966
In order to make everyone believe

362
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,066
that she was killed before you all arrived,

363
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,466
you couldn't leave her body in a room that was heated.

364
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:57,066
Mr. Kijima, you left the room without turning off the gas

365
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,466
because you had to make sure that the stew was ready

366
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,766
when Ms. Umeda's body was found later.

367
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:05,066
However, there was an earthquake at about 3 pm,

368
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,166
and the gas stopped.

369
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,666
Unaware of this, you went shopping,

370
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,366
then went to the rental costume shop.

371
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:16,166
With Ms. Umeda's cell phone that you had taken from her,

372
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,766
you sent the mail just to make

373
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,966
it look as if she were alive.

374
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:22,466
And finally, made everyone give you their cell phones.

375
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,066
Then you tried to go look for a public phone

376
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:31,266
together with Mr. Ishikawa.

377
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:34,266
But, that was already what you had calculated beforehand.

378
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,966
You knew that Mr. Ishikawa would not leave his girlfriend behind

379
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,266
with a corpse.

380
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:40,566
That is, you remained in the room,

381
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,466
under extremely natural circumstances.

382
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,666
You then, finally brought the actual body of Ms. Umeda

383
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,866
that you had hidden out on the veranda inside,

384
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,266
and got rid of the doll.

385
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:56,266
The grease paint of the make-up of that clown...

386
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,666
Was found on the curtain.

387
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,866
That's a lie!

388
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,566
It's all just assumption.

389
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,166
You have no proof!

390
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,966
There is proof.

391
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,166
Please go out to the veranda.

392
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,266
Officer Takagi.

393
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,766
Mr. Kijima, this is your car, isn't it?

394
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,966
Darn!

395
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,166
That woman's to blame!

396
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,466
It's true that she brought me to where I am now.

397
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:36,966
But, each time I find a new girlfriend she gets in the way.

398
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,266
She tells me that if I split with her,

399
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:42,166
she'll make sure that I can't find a job in this line of work.

400
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,166
I was a indeed a clown.

401
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,466
No more than a clown.

402
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:51,466
That always hid my true feelings under my make-up.

403
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,866
"Mouri Detective Agency"

404
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,666
One-Day Chief of Firefighters?

405
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,766
He sure never learns.

406
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,566
Maybe this is...

407
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,166
Just as I thought.

408
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:45,466
"Firefighters"

409
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,266
"Next Episode"

410
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:50,366
The transmitter switched off.

411
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,466
Which means that they're going to assassinate somebody after all.

412
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:58,066
Pop is in danger!

413
00:23:58,066 --> 00:23:59,666
90 m more!

414
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,066
Please make it in time!

415
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,266
Haibara, do you know?

416
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:05,866
Who's DJ?

417
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,866
Next Conan Special,

418
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:16,366
"Black Impact! (The Moment the Black Organization Reaches Out)"

419
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,234

00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,634
"Transmitter and wire-tap"

421
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,334
