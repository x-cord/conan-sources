00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,230
Spring, the season when new things begin.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,940
This is the story of a group of new police
recruits who joined the academy in the spring.

4
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,100
I'm surprised you're still
standing after taking my punches.

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,450
I could say the same thing.
Matsuda Jinpei (22)

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,010
I could say the same thing.

10
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,370
Blondie!

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,390
I don't know what it is about
me that you don't like,

12
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,880
but I have to become a police officer.

13
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,890
Don't get in my way.

14
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,760
There it is.

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,770
That I-love-cops attitude
is what I hate about you.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,820
That's ridiculous.

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,820
You joined this academy so you
could become a police officer, too.

18
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:08,480
Who could it be at this hour?

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,780
Morofushi Hiromitsu (22)
Who could it be at this hour?

20
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,940
It's two in the morning.
Morofushi Hiromitsu (22)

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,520
It's two in the morning.

22
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,940
Huh? There's nobody here.

23
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,590
Huh? Z-Zero?

24
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,380
Sorry, Hiro. I ran out of band-aids.

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,670
If you've got any, could
you share some with me?

26
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,360
H-How'd you get those injuries?

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,010
Someone picked a fight
with me, so I fought back.

28
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,240
They really got you good.

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,900
So, think you'll be able
to get along with them?

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,200
What? You must be joking.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Wait in my room.

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,640
I'll go get the medicine
box from the infirmary.

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,330
Thanks. I owe you one.

34
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,410
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

35
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,540
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,240
This is the adolescence of
Amuro Toru and his friends,

37
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,910
and the story of their unbreakable bond!

38
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,540
Always determining the one truth

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,330

and the mind of an adult,

Welcoming new students primarily
in April and October,

50
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,530
it's a vocational school where roughly 1,200
students annually receive instruction and training,

51
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,930
in order to become fully-fledged
law enforcement officers.

52
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,040
Assemble in three columns!

53
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,190

57
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,260
You wanna hear the story?

58
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,140
Yes, I'd love to hear it.

61
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,520
Last night, a bunch of cockroaches
appeared in the room.

62
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,900
They were so caught up in exterminating
them that they hit their heads on desks.

63
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,320
They had a terrible time.

64
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,530
I see. Howeverâ€”

65
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,760
That said, as punishment for
damaging school furnishings,

66
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,170
Onizuka's class will run an extra lap.

67
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,120
Let's go.

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,860
Got it.

69
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Hey, wait.

70
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,040
Two columns. Start running.

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,630
Wait. I'm not done talking to you.

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,670
Hey, Jinpei-chan.

73
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:03,960
What happened to your face?

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
Hagiwara Kenji (22)
What happened to your face?

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,420
You've ruined your good looks.
Hagiwara Kenji (22)

76
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,980
You've ruined your good looks.

77
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,460
Shut up, Hagi.

78
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,750
You even lost your false
tooth. It's hilarious.

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,100
That Furuya guy's pretty tough.

80
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,860
He put up quite a fight, and you
were trained by your pro boxer dad.

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,610
So, who won?

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,990
Well, obviously...

83
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,420
I did.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,190
What? Are you sure getting hit too many
times didn't make you lose your mind?

85
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,580
Are you talking about yourself?

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,240
What was that?

87
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,620
I don't know what happened between you guys,

88
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,660
but invite me to join you next time.

89
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,380
Hey, idiots!

90
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,290
You'd better be running properly!

91
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,750
One, two. One, two. One, two.

92
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,890
Instructor Onizuka, you've taken
on some troublesome students.
One, two. One, two. One, two.

93
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,640
Not only that, but five at once.
One, two. One, two. One, two.

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,850
Yeah.

95
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,000
I drew the short end of the stick this time.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,770
They're a peculiar bunch.

97
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,400
With A's in all subjects,

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,220
he entered the academy with exceptional grades
unprecedented even in the academy's long history.

99
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,950
Perhaps because of his overly
serious attitude and hair,

100
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,040
class representative Furuya can't stop
getting into fights with other students.

101
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,920
Morofushi, whose older brother is an
excellent officer with the Nagano police,

102
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,800
has a strong sense of justice but is
still traumatized by his parents' case.

103
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,470
Second to Furuya in overall ability,
Date has leadership qualities,

104
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,310
but can't let go of his father's
retirement from the force.

105
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,750
Hagiwara has exceptional observational
and communication skills,

106
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,820
but he only uses them to chase skirts.

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,930
Finally, there's Matsuda.

108
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,770
He made up for his poor interview
with his studies, practical skills,

109
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,390
and high level of specialized knowledge,

110
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,830
but his outrageous behavior and
lack of cooperativeness are fatal.

111
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,110
I'm worried about the future.

112
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,590
Anyway, police gather eyewitness information
from the area around the crime scene.

113
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:11,860
Instructor Onizuka

114
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,340
Does anyone know what you should
be careful of while doing this?
Instructor Onizuka

115
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,250
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,690
Tell me, Furuya.

117
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,470
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,530
It's important to note that
with eyewitness information,

119
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,730
the stress of being present
during a crime, preconceptions,

120
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,820
or leading questions from the police
can twist a witness' testimony.

121
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,410
Because of this, rather than
blindly believing their testimony,

122
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,930
it's necessary to obtain supporting evidence.

123
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,490
Exactly. Impressive as always, Furuya.

124
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,500
It's questionable if this academy's graduates

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,690
are actually capable of doing that.

126
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,220
Hey, Matsuda!

127
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,130
What do you think the police are?

128
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,300
Well, obviously...

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,550
They serve the people with
a sense of pride and duty,

130
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,680
respect human rights, justly and
considerately carry out their duties,

131
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,850
fairly uphold the law,
strengthen cooperation,

132
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,150
cultivate their character, raise their
skills, work on improving themselves,

133
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,590
and maintain a lifestyle of
integrity and reliability.

134
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,530
That's what police officers do, right?

135
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,560
As long as you understand.

136
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,540
That's all for today's lecture.

137
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,960
Make sure you review the
material on your own.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,550
Here you go. One chicken and egg stir
fry meal with a small serving of rice.

139
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,710
Thank you.

140
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,310
You're going to sit there? Hey.

141
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,720
If no one's sitting here, doesn't
that mean this seat is open?

142
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,680
Here.

143
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,710
You've been spacing out a lot recently.

144
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,400
Thanks.

145
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,040
Why are you sitting here, too?

146
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,770
What? Isn't this seat open?

147
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,150
Man, I'm hungry.

148
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,160
Team leader, I don't want
this. You can have it.

149
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,610
You don't?

150
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,770
Yeah. I don't have much
of an appetite right now.

151
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,670
Then don't mind if I do.

152
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,040
Hey, have you got any sauce at this table?

153
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,090
Here.

154
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,720
I thought procuring supplies
was your specialty.

155
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,400
For some reason all the other tables are out.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,620
Thanks.

157
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,900
Jinpei-chan, you're ruining your good looks.

158
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,460
What are you doing?

159
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,650
You shouldn't rub that with those hands.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,540
Mind your own business.

161
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,320
Here. Do it yourself, then.

162
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,170
That's it. Men shouldn't quibble.

163
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,100
Hagiwara-kun!

164
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,370
Yes?

165
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,680
Can we eat lunch with you?

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,250
Of course.

167
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:51,840
Here's the sauce.

168
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,260
What's with the change of heart
you had during class earlier?
Here's the sauce.

169
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,550
All the tables are out, so you can use this.
What's with the change of heart

All the tables are out, so you can use this.

171
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,800
If I recall correctly,
you hate police officers.

172
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,830
Don't tell me you're hot-and-cold for them.

173
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,980
You can't seriously be
blond at a police academy.

174
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,290
Leave it.

175
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,680
I'm not.

176
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
I still hate them at heart.

177
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,930
Police officers can eat shit.

178
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,670
Found it.

179
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,190
<b>Murder
Pro Boxer
Matsuda Jotaro
Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

180
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,210
This is it.
<b>Murder
Pro Boxer
Matsuda Jotaro
Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

181
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,670
<b>Murder
Pro Boxer
Matsuda Jotaro
Suspect Matsuda Arrested</b>

182
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,670
Pro boxer Matsuda Jotaro,
arrested for murder.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,030
That case caused quite an uproar at the time.

184
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,050
Hiro.

185
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,870
Reference Room

186
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,560
You're looking into Matsuda's father, huh?
Reference Room

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,270
Yeah. I wanted to know why
he hates cops so much.

188
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,820
I heard about it from
Matsuda's friend Hagiwara.

189
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,690
Apparently it was a mistaken arrest.

190
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,950
What? A mistaken arrest?

191
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,070
On his way home from the gym,

192
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,950
Matsuda's pro boxer father saw
some men engaged in a scuffle.

193
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,310
Because he had a title match coming up, he
avoided getting involved and left the area.

194
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,460
But the next day, one of the men
was found dead at the scene.

195
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,200
Because witnesses claimed to have seen

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,500
Matsuda's father near the area
when the crime took place,

197
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,020
the victim was a former boxer
who had history with him,

198
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,220
and the victim was bludgeoned to death,
the police arrested Matsuda' father.

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,450
Later, the true culprit was arrested,
and he was cleared of charges,

200
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,310
but his scheduled title match was called off.

201
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,890
He quit boxing and drowned himself
in drink like a changed man.

202
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,970
I see. So that's why he hates the police.

203
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,210
But why would he want to
become a police officer?

204
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,110
Who knows? Even Hagiwara admitted
that was a mystery to him.

205
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,170
Whoops, look at the time.

206
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,630
It's a bit early, but shall
we head to the classroom?

207
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,000
You go on without me, Zero.

208
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,330
There's something I want to look up here.

209
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,640
I see. Don't be late.

210
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Case Type: Murder
Location: Nagano Prefecture, Family Home
Damage Report: One Man and
Woman (Married Couple) Dead
Case Status: Unsolved
Nagano Family Murdered

211
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,970
Hiro...

212
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,910
Listen closely. What you're
holding right now is a Sakura.

213
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,320
This five-round revolver is the official
firearm of the Japanese police.

214
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,410
In this shooting test, you'll
fire four sets of five rounds.

215
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,170
Your score will be the total
of your two best sets.

216
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,670
A score of less than 70 is a failing grade.

217
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,280
Five shots practically right in the middle.

218
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,890
Nice shooting, Furuya-chan.

219
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,820
Furuya, you've got a knack for shooting, but don't
forget that there's always someone better than you.

220
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,320
There's a genius who scored full
points on his first testâ€”

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,150
in other words, he fired all
20 shots right into the middle.

222
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,320
He must currently be a top
cop in Division 1, then.

223
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,830
Actually, he quit the force and currently
runs a detective agency in Beika City.

224
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,280
Damn it, I can't hit the thing at all.

225
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,920
What's wrong, Matsuda?

226
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,220
You're quick to fight, but handling
a gun's too difficult for you?

227
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,470
Are you sure someone didn't drop this gun?

228
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,010
Revolvers are sensitive to being dropped.

229
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,350
Maybe the cylinder stop's broken.

230
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,770
Don't be ridiculous! Hurry up and shoot!

231
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,060
You're always quibbling over everything.

232
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,400
H-Hey, Matsuda.

233
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,170
I knew it. The cylinder stop's broken.

234
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,000
The barrel and cylinder
were out of alignment, too.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,990
No wonder I couldn't hit anything.

236
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,070
Matsuda, put that thing
back together immediately!

237
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,790
Huh?

238
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,170
Yeesh, he's at it again.

239
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,070
Again?

240
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,920
Yeah.

241
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,930
Jinpei-chan's an analysis fiend.

242
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,470
He's always had to analyze
everything since he was a kid.

243
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,980
Because of it, he knows a lot
about gadgets, especially bombs.

244
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,770
The shooting test is canceled!

245
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,020
Return your firearms immediately!

246
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,530
Matsuda, stay there!

247
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,390
What? One bullet hasn't been returned?

248
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,160
Yes, sir.

249
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,410
I recounted all the guns, but
I came up one round short.

250
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,920
Well, I say all of them, but I still
haven't collected Matsuda's gun.

251
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,440
Matsuda! Why haven't you
put it back together yet?

252
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,590
What? You're the one who
told me to stay here.

253
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,030
Forget it. Just hand over
the bullet you swiped.

254
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,140
I don't have any bullets on me.

255
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,430
I fired all my rounds. I even
handled over my empty cartridges.

256
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,020
Don't lie to me!

257
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,190
Huh?

258
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,620
Now, now. Out of consideration for your
team leader, let's lay down our arms.

259
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,770
I promise we'll return the bullet.

260
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,950
Excuse me, Instructor Onizuka.

261
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,450
Is it all right if I check
on the roof repairs?

262
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,220
Sure, I'll show you the way.

263
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,640
You'd better make him turn
in that bullet voluntarily.

264
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,490
Yes, sir.

265
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,590
What? You think I did it, too?

266
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,540
It wasn't you, right?

267
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,640
No.

268
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,870
Then hold your head high.

269
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,930
I'll uncover the true culprit and
make them turn themselves in.

270
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,390
You're too soft on him, team leader.

271
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,370
Make him prove his own innocence,
or he'll end up like his father.

272
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,560
You don't know the first thing about my dad.

273
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,910
Yeah, so why don't you tell me about him?

274
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,820
While you're at it, you can tell me why
you're trying to become a cop, too.

275
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,950
Sure, I'll tell you,

276
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,780
after I knock you on your ass!

277
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,060
This isn't good. The lifeline's
wrapped around the instructor's neck.

278
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,290
The worker who fell looks unconscious.

279
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,520
We're going to go get help!

280
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,150
Will you make it in time?

281
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,290
We have to climb up to the
roof and cut the rope!

282
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,150
You idiot, there's no time for that!

283
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,380
But at this rate, the instructor...

284
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,780
You guys know what to do, right?

285
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,160
Get a gun.

286
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,160
Find a bullet.

287
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,660
Take the shot.

288
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,410
I'll be the foundation.

289
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,170
Does that make me the
supporting rod on top of you?

290
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,830
Yeah! Come on, guys!

291
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,750
Let's go!

292
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,260
Morofushi!

293
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,100
You should be able to breathe
a little easier now.

294
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,470
Our friends are will be here to help us soon.

295
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,230
Try not to die until then.

296
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,940
How long?

297
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,820
Huh?

298
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,460
How long does it take you
to assemble that gun?

299
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,360
Well, generally...

300
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,780
One round.

301
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,720
One round? Three minutes? That long?

302
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,460
Yeah. Just assembling the thing
wouldn't take me 30 seconds.

303
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,350
But not only is the gun broken to begin with,

304
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,370
it needs to be precise enough to
fire accurately without test firing.

305
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,100
We need you to shoot that rope
with a single shot, blondie.

306
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,850
You'll use the bullet
Hagiwara's finding right now.

307
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,180
Excuse me.

308
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,520
Huh? What's this?

309
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,900
Hey, there's a bullet lying right here.

310
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,370
Bingo.

311
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,100
H-Huh? It's still here.

312
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,010
You're the one who swiped
the bullet, aren't you?

313
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,590
S-Sorry. I wanted something to remember
my first firearms training by.

314
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,550
Damn it.

315
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,170
Something's still not right.

316
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,660
Don't panic.

317
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,180
A person's respiratory center stops
functioning within a minute of being strangled,

318
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,820
but the heart continues to
beat for several minutes.

319
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,760
Even if their heart stops, as long as lifesaving
measures are performed within three minutes,

320
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,580
it's entirely possible to save a
person without any brain damage.

321
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,120
Let's go, Furuya-chan!

322
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,960
Catch!

323
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,090
Take this, too. The gun's perfect.

324
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,180
If you miss, I'll kill you, Zero.

325
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,270
Sir, we brought help!

326
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,040
Sir! Instructor Onizuka!

327
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,320
There was a serious violation
of firearm handling rules,

328
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,080
but at Instructor Onizuka's recommendation,
they're going to overlook this incident.

329
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,070
Of course they are.

330
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,390
We dragged him back from the brink of death.

331
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,650
Apparently your father
was arrested mistakenly.

332
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,030
Hagi told you, didn't he?
He's got a big mouth.

333
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm sorry about the mistaken
arrest, but in that caseâ€”

334
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,160
It's likely the murder wouldn't have
occurred if he'd stopped the fight, right?

335
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,840
I know that,

336
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,710
but I can't forgive the police for acting like
nothing happened after crushing my dad's dream.

337
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,060
So, why do you want to
become a police officer?

338
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,520
That's obvious.

339
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,060
Because I want to kick his ass and
dispel these pent-up feelings.

340
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,550
The boss of the MPDâ€”the chief of police.

341

That won't be easy.

to me who suddenly disappeared.

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,340

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Right?
