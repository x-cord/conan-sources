1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,340
Doc is pretty reliable, isn't he?

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,940
I agree.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,740
To think that he had such a rich friend.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,540
I was surprised.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,940
It seems that Doc helped

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,840
that person's company out with his invention.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,640
That's why that person went out of his way to do us this favor.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
He makes inventions for adults at times too, does he?

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,340
Poor thing to say something like that about him.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,140
Thanks to him, we get to practice soccer.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,540
At times his pun quizzes are annoying though.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,240
There used to be a mansion standing on that open lot, right?

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,840
If the ground is bumpy, won't it be difficult to practice?

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,540
There was a downpour last night, too.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,840
Right.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Thunder struck several times and there was a black-out, too

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
It was scary, wasn't it?

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,540
Don't worry.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,540
No problem, even if it's after rain.

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,640
Everything besides the pool has been leveled.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,240
I hear drainage is good, too.

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Huh?

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,340
I wonder if it's a case or something?

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,540
Is the vacant lot up ahead?

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
No.

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,540
We're headed over there.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,140
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,240
Love and cases come from the same origin.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,340
A strange locked room without a ceiling.

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,140
The Youth Detective Squad's Deduction Battle.

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,740
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,750
"Detective Squad's Locked Room Deduction Battle"

35
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,050
Doc!

36
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,550
Huh?

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,050
You folks.

38
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,150
Doc, what happened?

39
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,350
A man was found dead in the pool of this vacant lot.

40
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,250
A murder?

41
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,350
I just came here a while ago

42
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,150
to unlock the door so you could come in.

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,950
But to my surprise, I saw a man afloat in the pool.

44
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,950
A corpse was in that pool?

45
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,550
-Yes. -How scary.

46
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,650
Which means that you're the first discoverer, Doc?

47
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,250
Yes, I guess so.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,450
We shouldn't get in the way.

49
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,050
Let's talk over there.

50
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,950
Is it a case? Or is it an accident?

51
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,750
Was there water in the pool?

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,550
Yes, but it's shallow.

53
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,950
It's from last night's rain.

54
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,750
How big is the pool?

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,550
It's a family size, so maybe about 10 meters long.

56
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,850
The width having two courses.

57
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,750
This gate is the only way to get to the pool?

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,650
Yes, that's right.

59
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,250
But when I came, the gate was securely locked.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,550
Who has the key?

61
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,450
According to my friend who lent me this place,

62
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,750
this is the only key there is.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,350
Then, how did the person who died get in here?

64
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,250
Inspector Megure's in a fix because of that, too.

65
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,450
How was it?

66
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,650
It seems that this entrance

67
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,050
hasn't been opened at all for these past three days.

68
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,050
But the victim died last night before midnight.

69
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,250
Have you confirmed the cause of his death?

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,150
We'd have to wait till after the autopsy for the details.

71
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,750
But the blow to the back of his head seems to have been lethal.

72
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,450
If this is murder,

73
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,050
we have no idea as to how the perp fled either.

74
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,950
Indeed.

75
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,550
In other words, this vacant lot was a locked room without a roof.

76
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,650
A locked room.

77
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,450
Just saying it gets me excited!

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,350
It's okay to get excited,

79
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,450
but if it's the site of a crime,

80
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,650
we can't use it to practice soccer.

81
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,950
But he died in the pool, right?

82
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,550
We're not using the pool, you know!

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,150
I wonder if the Inspector would think so.

84
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,150
It's just as Conan says.

85
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,550
Be the victim or the perp,

86
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,050
in order to go to the site,

87
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,250
you'd have to go through this vacant lot.

88
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,350
It's off-limits until the case is closed.

89
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,750
What? Seriously?

90
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,950
Our class soccer tournament is next week, you know!

91
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Isn't there anything you can do, Inspector Megure?

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,750
I feel sorry for you, but no.

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,550
But, if you the members of the Youth Detective Squad solve the mystery,

94
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,450
it'll be a different story.

95
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,850
Inspector's cold!

96
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,050
After Doc got this all set up for us.

97
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,350
It can't be helped.

98
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,350
Then let's solve the case!

99
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,350
Inspector Megure said so himself, didn't he?

100
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,250
Hey. He was only joking.

101
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,150
If we figure out how the victim got here,

102
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,150
I'm sure the Inspector will have second thoughts, too!

103
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,150
She's right. Let's do it!

104
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,150
Okay, let's do it!

105
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,250
It's all for soccer, Conan!

106
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,950
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad is on our way!

107
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,250
Wait, where do we go?

108
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,150
This is the blueprint of this place that I got from my friend.

109
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,450
I wonder if this will be of help?

110
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,950
Of course, it will!

111
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,650
This gate was locked, right?

112
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,850
Beyond the pool on the other side of the fence,

113
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,550
it looks to be a road.

114
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,450
An 8th story building seems to be there.

115
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,350
No, between it there's a narrow road.

116
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,850
That cars can't go through.

117
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,950
Can you come from that road,

118
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,450
climb the fence and come into the vacant lot?

119
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,550
No way.

120
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Since the fence is reinforced with glass and barbed wire.

121
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,850
Wait.

122
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,650
I see a crane truck over there.

123
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,650
Next door seems to be getting ready to start construction, too.

124
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,150
Then, how about if that crane truck were used?

125
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,150
If you grab on to the tip of it and go over the fence...

126
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,750
No, I don't think so.

127
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,950
They say that the crane truck came this morning.

128
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,550
Right!

129
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,550
A pool has a drain, doesn't it?

130
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,250
He could've snuck in from there!

131
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,250
It wasn't big enough for humans to get through.

132
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,850
Besides, it's covered with a lid.

133
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,250
On top of that it was stuck with trash.

134
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,150
That's why the pool was filled with rainwater.

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,350
Then, he must've come down from the sky after all!

136
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,750
He flew here by helicopter and got down from there...

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,850
Fly a helicopter in the middle of the night?

138
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,650
The noise is going to be unbearable, you know.

139
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,750
-Hey! What are you doing! -Cut out the noise!

140
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,450
Cut out the noise!

141
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,350
Maybe if it were a glider, there would be no sound.

142
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,350
You can't possibly land on a cramped place like this.

143
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,650
What about if you fly something by radio control?

144
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,150
If you fly about 10.

145
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,850
I wonder if you can fly that many radio controlled devices

146
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,850
and stay in control.

147
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,150
Maybe a hot-air balloon would do!

148
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,050
Hot air balloons float using air heated by the burners.

149
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,450
There was a downpour last night, right?

150
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,550
Moreover, there was thunder.

151
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,850
Then, what about a blimp?

152
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,950
I like blimps, too.

153
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,150
This is not a matter of what you like or don't like!

154
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,950
By the way, you guys forgot something important.

155
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,750
What is it?

156
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,250
You're wondering why he snuck into the pool

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,150
despite having to overcome all the obstacles before him.

158
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,150
Right?

159
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,850
Yes, that's right.

160
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,650
The victim didn't come into the vacant lot,

161
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,050
but was trying to sneak in somewhere maybe?

162
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,250
Don't just give out titbits when you already know.

163
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,850
Sneak in somewhere. Where?

164
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,350
I see! There was no murderer to begin with!

165
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,750
I see.

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,450
Because the blow to his head was lethal...

167
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,650
Yes! I got it, too!

168
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,850
Darn it!

169
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,450
I don't get it!

170
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,850
Here's a hint.

171
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,650
At first that pool was empty.

172
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,550
Of course.

173
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,850
Because the rain during night filled the pool up...

174
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,950
I see!

175
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,250
The victim wasn't punched,

176
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,050
but came falling from the building next door

177
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,150
and bumped his head on the bottom of the pool.

178
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,950
To put it exaggeratedly,

179
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,050
the murder weapon was the earth.

180
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,950
I think I've read this mystery story somewhere before.

181
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,250
Okay! We've solved the case!

182
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,250
Let's go tell Inspector Megure to check the building next door!

183
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,550
Too bad, members of the Youth Detective Squad.

184
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,450
We've already arrived at that conclusion, too.

185
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,950
Did you already check the building then?

186
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,450
We checked.

187
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,850
We undoubtedly check it but...

188
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,050
All the windows up to the 7th floor

189
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,750
were all fixed fitted and wouldn't open.

190
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,050
There's a bay window on the 8th floor!

191
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,250
He fell from that window.

192
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,750
But that window wouldn't open either.

193
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,214
It's true, it won't even budge.

194
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:05,214
I heard unsettling rumours, so I had the windows modified.

195
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,114
Just yesterday.

196
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,414
We found out from the questioning, we just did a while ago.

197
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:13,614
Then, where did the man who died fall from?

198
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:14,714
What about the roof?

199
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,614
That's not possible either.

200
00:12:16,614 --> 00:12:20,414
There's a high fence around the roof,

201
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,714
and it's blocked off so that no one can enter.

202
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:27,114
He couldn't have fallen into the pool from there then.

203
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:30,514
-Yes. -I don't get it!

204
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:31,814
Wait a sec.

205
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:36,114
Maybe the unsettling rumour that the old lady heard...

206
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:38,314
Oh, that?

207
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,114
It was on the news.

208
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,814
That there's a burglar breaking into buildings.

209
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,014
I know about it.

210
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,614
It's the Geko Man, right?

211
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,814
Yes.

212
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:49,514
If the guy who fell is that Geko Man,

213
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:50,914
he didn't fall from the window,

214
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,914
but rather from the wall of the building.

215
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:58,414
They call him the Geko Man because he can climb any kind of wall.

216
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,314
I was so scared, you see.

217
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,014
I understand.

218
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:06,714
It was wise of you to fix fit all your windows.

219
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,914
The man was identified a while ago.

220
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,214
It was the Geko Man.

221
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:16,014
Where did the Geko Man practice climbing any kind of wall?

222
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,214
I'm sure it's bouldering.

223
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,814
Huh? What's this about bolt?

224
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,214
Bouldering.

225
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:24,114
Haven't you seen it on TV?

226
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,614
It's a sport where you climb the bumps

227
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,614
that are set out on the wall.

228
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:28,814
I know.

229
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:32,514
There's a training gym in Beikacho, too. It just opened.

230
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,014
Oh, that!

231
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:38,714
You climb the wall just like in rock climbing with your bare hands.

232
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,714
We found that Geko Man

233
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:44,414
seemed to be making money as a street artist abroad.

234
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:46,314
I don't understand again.

235
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:49,514
They're people who put on performances in the city.

236
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:50,814
In Geko's case,

237
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:54,414
his talent was walking on tightrope from building to building.

238
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,914
That's amazing!

239
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:59,414
But when he was trying to walk on tightrope between two buildings

240
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:01,614
that had a river between them,

241
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:04,314
it seems he failed.

242
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:34,214
Back then he was petrified with fear

243
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,914
that he could never perform the same feat ever again.

244
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:38,114
Since he was unable to make money,

245
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,514
Geko Man returned to Japan

246
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:42,614
and decided to burglarize building by using his talent.

247
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,514
But he can't sneak into buildings

248
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:46,314
even if he climbs wall, right?

249
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,614
That's it!

250
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:51,414
He didn't know that the windows were remodeled.

251
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,414
I'm sure he was planning to break in through the bay window.

252
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:56,514
If he was a serial building burglar,

253
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,014
I'm sure he would've checked beforehand?

254
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:04,414
I'm sure he would, but the window was remodeled only yesterday.

255
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,614
I see.

256
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:09,914
When he came to check, it was before the remodeling.

257
00:15:09,914 --> 00:15:11,514
He went through the trouble of climbing up,

258
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:14,014
but the windows wouldn't open.

259
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,614
So he was surprised and slipped?

260
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,814
Would a professional fall

261
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,614
just because of something like that?

262
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,114
Come to think of it, something's not right.

263
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:25,314
But he actually did fall.

264
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:29,614
That's actually the part that we're not convince of yet either.

265
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,714
As long as we can solve that one point,

266
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,514
the case would be closed.

267
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,714
It's a shame.

268
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:38,514
I guess you won't be able to practice tomorrow either.

269
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:44,614
What shall we do?

270
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:47,014
Should we give it up?

271
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,814
Who's gonna give up?

272
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,014
That's right.

273
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,714
Let's think up something again together.

274
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:57,414
Right! Besides, we've got a secret weapon!

275
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,614
Right?

276
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,014
They're talking about you.

277
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,414
Me?

278
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,714
Eye-witness?

279
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:12,114
Yes. I wonder if there was no eye-witnesses?

280
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:17,314
Unfortunately, the entire area had a black-out just around that time.

281
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:20,314
The substation was experiencing trouble because of the thunder.

282
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,014
I'm sure that's the reason.

283
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,114
Geko Man was struck by thunder and fell!

284
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:30,814
Isn't that strange?

285
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:34,014
Thunder falls on the top of buildings, right?

286
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,514
No, that!

287
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:38,014
-What? -What?

288
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,814
A lightning rod is up there.

289
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:42,014
The lightning rod

290
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:45,414
should be connected to the ground by a ground wire.

291
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,314
And the Geko Man...

292
00:16:55,414 --> 00:17:01,814
But all three lightning strikes struck the substation.

293
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:04,614
Is that so, too bad.

294
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:06,414
Too bad.

295
00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:09,714
Hey, how about this?

296
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,714
Geko Man got all the way up to the 8th floor.

297
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,914
Yes, and?

298
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:18,414
He looked into the room from the window.

299
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,514
And then?

300
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:23,514
He saw the old lady there.

301
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:28,414
And when she turned around...

302
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,214
That's not possible!

303
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,914
I know her from before,

304
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:43,914
but she's a quiet, kind old lady.

305
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:47,914
Her legs are weak so she has to use a cane or wheelchair,

306
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:52,114
but she's very neat and loves to wash clothes.

307
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,914
She's that kind of person, Mrs. Awaji.

308
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,614
I see.

309
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:59,514
Besides, it was during the black-out.

310
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,914
He couldn't have seen inside the room.

311
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,214
Oh, I see.

312
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,314
You went to the room of that old lady, right?

313
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:12,314
Yes, I'm the one who introduced her to Inspector Megure, too.

314
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,814
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:17,614
My sofa and curtains are drenched.

316
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:20,014
I was holding the hose while washing clothes

317
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,114
but my hands started to shake.

318
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:25,014
What a pain to age.

319
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,114
I'm sorry that you came all this way,

320
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:29,714
and yet I have no place for you to sit.

321
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:33,614
No, it's okay. Because we'll be leaving soon.

322
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:38,214
In other words, you didn't notice anything?

323
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:42,114
No. I'm sorry, I can't be of help to you.

324
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,514
The sofa, the curtains...

325
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:48,714
Everything on the side of the bay window was drenched?

326
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,814
But, if it's during the black-out,

327
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,914
she couldn't have seen outside from inside either.

328
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,014
You can see, can't you?

329
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,014
Huh?

330
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,514
If lightning flashes, you can see.

331
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,814
It struck a total of three times on the substation too after all.

332
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:07,614
I see. I got it.

333
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:13,714
What? What did you figure something out?

334
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:38,214
Excuse me, Mrs. Awaji.

335
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:41,214
I'm sorry for barging in on you.

336
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,914
As you know,

337
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,714
this morning at the pool of the vacant lot,

338
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:48,314
the body of a burglar, known as the Geko Man

339
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,314
was found in the pool of the demolished mansion next door.

340
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,814
It was initially thought to be a murder case,

341
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:57,814
but while he was climbing the wall of this condo trying to break in,

342
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:00,014
it was found that he happened to fall

343
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:04,714
and hit his head on the bottom of the pool and died.

344
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:08,014
Then, why did Geko Man fall?

345
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:10,114
Just as his name implies,

346
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:14,014
the Geko Man committed several thefts by climbing the wall

347
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:17,414
and breaking in through windows.

348
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:23,914
It's hard to imagine that Geko Man fall to his death over a mere slip.

349
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:27,114
I'm sure that you were surprised by the thunder last night.

350
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:29,514
Yes, sure thing.

351
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:31,114
Although the thunder didn't strike,

352
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:34,714
I think the sound would've been very loud.

353
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:38,714
Yes, I was just in the midst of washing clothes so...

354
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:40,914
Then, there was the black-out.

355
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,514
You went back to the living room.

356
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:48,514
Just at that time, a thunder bolt flashed.

357
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,314
When you looked outside,

358
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:06,214
you saw a man shining in the light glued onto the window.

359
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:10,414
You on reflex tried to shoot water onto the man.

360
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,814
The window wouldn't open

361
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,914
so there's no reason why he would get wet.

362
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:28,714
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:32,114
I didn't plan to do what I did.

364
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:33,614
I know.

365
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:36,114
You're not to blame for anything.

366
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,914
Still until the circumstances come clear,

367
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:43,114
we cannot close the case.

368
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:44,814
That's all there is to it.

369
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:46,814
Please rest assured.

370
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,614
Thank you very much.

371
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:16,714
Here we go!

372
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,514
There!

373
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:21,614
Here goes!

374
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,014
Pass!

375
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:24,214
Okay! Ayumi!

376
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:26,814
I can't!

377
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,814
Hey! Ayumi!

378
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,114
Just how long are they going to keep this up?

379
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:34,714
I'm sure it'll be till they won't be able to see the ball.

380
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,314
I see.

381
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,114
"Next Episode" -Listen.

382
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:49,414
This cash is to be exchanged for Reina.

383
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:53,314
How's the perp planning to transport the ransom?

384
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,114
A hundred million yen is pretty heavy, isn't it?

385
00:23:56,114 --> 00:24:00,114
No matter how heavy, it's only about 10 kilograms, no?

386
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:03,014
If he has a car ready, it's no big deal.

387
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,714
We will be there in five minutes.

388
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:08,714
Copy.

389
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:14,714
Next Conan, "Chase the Hundred Million Yen"

390
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:17,858
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,658
"Ant"

392
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,058
How many eels over rice can you eat with a hundred billion yen?

393
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:22,858
If it's 2,000 yen a bowl, you can eat 50,000 bowls!

394
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,358
Fast calculation!
