1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,740
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,640
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,340
Dr. Agasa's weird code

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,840
is tough for the Youth Detective Squad.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,840
Who's going to be the first to solve it?

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:57,625
One hot summer day,

10
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,525
we came to collect insects.

11
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,325
Doc gave us a code quiz "pill bug and a tent",

12
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,825
which would lead us to where the treasure is hidden.

13
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,025
But I couldn't solve the code either.

14
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:13,425
Meanwhile, I get a call from Ran and Sonoko who are at the beach

15
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:18,225
saying that there was a murder at the hotel that they're staying at.

16
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:24,325
Sonoko remembered that there was something written on the window

17
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:28,125
of the hotel room where the man was killed.

18
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,125
What kind of writing?

19
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,025
Something like a code.

20
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,825
And who found the body?

21
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:38,325
The three friends of Mr. Miyama who was killed.

22
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,825
Mr. Miyama and the three of them were planning to have dinner together.

23
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,425
So they went to his room to get him because he didn't come.

24
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:50,425
They found the door was unlocked and the window was broken.

25
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,425
Mr. Miyama was found on the floor near the window.

26
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,625
This is what they testified to the police.

27
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,125
Then we...

28
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:04,325
Then, is the "tent" in the code points to the Tento festival?

29
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:08,825
Even so, I still don't understand the pill bug part.

30
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,925
That's where...

31
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,325
Marumushi Hot Spring is located.

32
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,425
"Pill bug and tent..."

33
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,925
Does that mean to light it up?

34
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:28,725
"Shrine Torii Gate Surprising Code (Part 2)"

35
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,325
Huh?

36
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,425
There are a lot of people.

37
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,125
There must be some kind of a gathering, don't you think?

38
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,925
Stupid! Take a closer look.

39
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:45,325
Everyone is holding a basin.

40
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,425
It's true!

41
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,325
The villagers probably bought the closed down inn

42
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,925
and are using it as a public bath.

43
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,625
I see.

44
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,325
Sento (Public bath)?

45
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:02,625
Maybe this "tento" (tent) means "sento" (public bath).

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,325
No matter how you look at it, Genta,

47
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:07,625
this "te" doesn't look like "se".

48
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,825
And it can't be "tentou"

49
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:12,325
because there's no "u" after the "tento".

50
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,425
"U"?

51
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:17,125
Darn it!

52
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,725
I don't get it!

53
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,625
Genta, don't lie down in despair.

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,625
I'm not in despair.

55
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:29,125
Doc told us to lie down and think it through,

56
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,225
and I just might get it.

57
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:32,725
But...

58
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:37,325
Ai was saying that if we still don't get it,

59
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,125
we should wash our faces and start anew.

60
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,725
Since there's a public bath,

61
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,725
why don't we go and wash our faces and our bodies?

62
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,125
That's a great idea!

63
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:50,325
It's no use.

64
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,525
Ai.

65
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,025
It's no use going to that inn. There's nothing there.

66
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,125
You guys have to try and think a little bit more.

67
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,025
Then tell us!

68
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:01,125
Where is the treasure?

69
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,125
Please tell us.

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,525
Sure, I can tell you.

71
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,325
Only if someone here gives up.

72
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,525
I'm not giving up!

73
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:15,925
A mail.

74
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,625
It's from Sonoko.

75
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,725
Huh?

76
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:24,025
I thought her cell phone was in the bag that was stolen.

77
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,325
I found this bag on the street

78
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,125
and since there was no ID,

79
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,825
I mailed the most recent person

80
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:39,825
the cell phone listed to have sent a mail to.

81
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,725
I want to send this bag to you,

82
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:46,125
so can you please give me your address and name?

83
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,525
It seems like the purse-snatcher just took the purse

84
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,225
and threw the bag away.

85
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:57,225
Wouldn't you usually ask for the address and name of the owner of the bag?

86
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,725
Why did this person send a mail?

87
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:00,925
Wouldn't it be quicker to look at the record of calls made

88
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,125
and call someone from that list?

89
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,025
Huh?

90
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,025
You give up, right?

91
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,125
Time out!

92
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:15,925
Take the bag to the police if you found it.

93
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,725
Hello, Ran?

94
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:22,325
I just got mail from the person who found Sonoko's bag.

95
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,325
Oh, really?

96
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:28,925
You'll probably receive a mail, too.

97
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,625
-So you can do something about it. -I'm sorry.

98
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,625
What's up?

99
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,925
My cell phone's battery is low.

100
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:37,225
I'm at the police station right now.

101
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,625
I'll get back to you when I return to the hotel.

102
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,925
Then did you tell them that the letters might mean "tel shite"?

103
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:50,425
The police and Mr. Miyama's three friends are saying that it makes sense.

104
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:54,125
But that doesn't help to specify the killer,

105
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,925
so we're going back to the hotel for now.

106
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,325
Hey, be careful.

107
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:02,025
The purse-snatcher is probably still roaming the streets.

108
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,225
We'll be all right!

109
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,325
I just asked Mr. Kanou

110
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:11,325
-to take me and your wife back to the hotel! -Wife?

111
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,525
Who's Kanou?

112
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,625
Ran was just talking to you about him.

113
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,825
Mr. Miyama's good looking friend.

114
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,025
A good looking guy!

115
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,625
-Sonoko. -What's the big deal? It's true.

116
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,325
The other two friends are with him, right?

117
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,725
It seems like he's alone.

118
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:31,025
Mr. Miyama's girlfriend, Miss Yanuma

119
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,425
is still being questioned by the police,

120
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:37,825
so Mr. Kanou was planning to wait for her in his car until she finished.

121
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,625
But Mr. Bito seems to have returned to the hotel already.

122
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:45,325
Since Miss Yanuma's questioning is taking time,

123
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:48,125
Mr. Kanou will be taking us back to the hotel

124
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,825
and return again to pick her up.

125
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,225
Okay.

126
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:54,325
I'm hanging up now. My cell phone is really running out of battery.

127
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,525
Come on.

128
00:07:57,525 --> 00:08:00,425
I should have gone to the beach, too.

129
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:01,725
Beach?

130
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:05,225
Talking about the beach, I found a jellyfish.

131
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,325
What are you talking about, Ayumi?

132
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,625
There are no jellyfish in the mountains.

133
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,025
Yes, there are.

134
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,225
See! Over there!

135
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:19,525
Really?

136
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,625
See. A jellyfish!

137
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,525
True.

138
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:31,425
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

139
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,225
-Right? -A jellyfish.

140
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,925
I can see it.

141
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:43,025
Turn the hot spring mark upside down and it looks like a jellyfish.

142
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,725
So that's it. That's what it is.

143
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:57,525
Lie down and wash you face.

144
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,125
How stupid of me.

145
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,825
Having trouble with a code like this.

146
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:10,825
Well, sometimes easy codes are difficult to solve.

147
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,425
Doc!

148
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:19,025
It's about time. Tell us the answer.

149
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,325
What is the meaning behind the code?

150
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,325
Alright.

151
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:28,325
No! I won't tell you until everyone gives up.

152
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,525
I'll give up so just tell me.

153
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:33,525
That's not fair, Genta.

154
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:34,825
Why Ran?

155
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,425
Conan!

156
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,725
Can't you solve it?

157
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:45,225
It's totally Greek to me, I haven't got a clue.

158
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,625
Then hurry up and give up!

159
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,325
Conan, just admit your defeat already!

160
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,725
You guys give up too easily.

161
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,925
It seems like Shinichi can't solve it either.

162
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,425
Anyway, let's think it over from the very beginning.

163
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,725
First, all these codes are written only in Katakana.

164
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:12,025
It's understandable that pill bug and tent are written in Katakana.

165
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,725
Don't you think its weird for the "ni" in between is in Katakana, too?

166
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,325
That's true.

167
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:22,425
Secondly, if you look closely, the letters are not balanced.

168
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:23,525
That's true!

169
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:26,825
Isn't that because Doc's handwriting is messy?

170
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,125
And thirdly,

171
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,525
the hint Dr and Haibara was talking about.

172
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,325
Did they give us a hint?

173
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:41,825
Yes. "Lie down and think carefully",

174
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:45,325
and "if you still don't get it, wash your face and start anew"

175
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:48,325
are things Doc and Haibara don't usually say.

176
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,025
It's obviously a hint!

177
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,225
Maybe it means to lie down and look at these letters.

178
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:55,225
Okay!

179
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,425
Lie down, right?

180
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,325
I don't see anything different.

181
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,725
What happened, Genta?

182
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:12,025
Did you get something?

183
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,525
What?

184
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,625
Genta, what's going on?

185
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,925
No, I thought I almost got it.

186
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:27,025
-Almost? -Which is it?

187
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,125
Shut up!

188
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,725
I thought I could almost read it when I lied down.

189
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,325
Close call, close call.

190
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,825
No.

191
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:38,825
That smile, that provoking annoying look.

192
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,325
He probably already knows it.

193
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,225
Nothing comes to mind even if I look at it from the side.

194
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:54,825
Then let's look at the other hint.

195
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:58,625
You mean the "go wash your face"?

196
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:03,425
But to wash your face in the middle of the woods...

197
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:04,725
Maybe...

198
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,625
Does it mean to go take a bath in the inn?

199
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Stupid.

200
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,925
Didn't Haibara and Doc said there was nothing at the inn?

201
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:16,125
Then where do you say we should wash?

202
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,325
That's right!

203
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:21,225
I don't know. Maybe it doesn't mean to actually wash your face.

204
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:24,225
Maybe it has something to do with what you do when you wash your face.

205
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,725
First of all, turn the faucet on.

206
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:30,025
Splash water on your face.

207
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,425
Wipe your face with a towel.

208
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:34,125
And then, after that?

209
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,425
After that is...

210
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,625
Let's see...

211
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,325
Let's eat!

212
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,925
Hey, Genta.

213
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:44,925
We're talking about when we are washing our faces.

214
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:47,425
You eat after you wash your face, don't you?

215
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,225
Mirror!

216
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,325
After that, I look in the mirror!

217
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:52,625
Mirror?

218
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,925
You can only see your face in it.

219
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,225
I'm getting more mixed up!

220
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:01,025
I think the mirror is on the right track.

221
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:02,225
Look.

222
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:05,925
Turn it upside down like that hot spring mark

223
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,725
and it looks like something totally different, like the jellyfish.

224
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,525
Even if I hold it upside down,

225
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,225
it doesn't look like a porgy or a flounder.

226
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,425
I can't even read what it says.

227
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,125
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,325
Could it be to wash your face while lying down?

229
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,825
To look at the mirror with the letters written downwards

230
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,025
by turning it sideways?

231
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,325
Turn it sideways,

232
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,825
reverse the paper and look at it through the mirror.

233
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,825
"Mura matsuri no torii."

234
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,225
The shrine gate of the village festival...

235
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,825
It's that shrine!

236
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:58,725
Isn't that right, Doc, Ai?

237
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,225
Correct!

238
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,025
You're correct!

239
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,625
We did it...

240
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,625
-We did it! -We did it!

241
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,225
Let's hurry and go there!

242
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,525
Treasure!

243
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:15,825
Oh, my.

244
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:21,025
You look like you taught the kids that they can do it if they try.

245
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,025
Don't I look great?

246
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,925
Shinichi, aren't you going to go see what the treasure is?

247
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,725
I bet you want to see it, too.

248
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:35,225
I don't have to see it to know what it is.

249
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,725
The place of the code

250
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:41,425
is the torii gate of the shrine that's lit up even late at night.

251
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:51,025
If we put sap on the pole of the torii gate...

252
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,225
I'll bet a lot will come.

253
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,425
I found it!

254
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,825
Amazing!

255
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:02,025
Unicorn beetles and stag beetles.

256
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,225
That's right!

257
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,625
Anyway...

258
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:12,525
you did a great job with the code.

259
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:15,025
This can be read from the front and back.

260
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:17,725
Thanks to Ai.

261
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:21,725
First, we were going to make it an animal code.

262
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:28,225
We thought of sticking paper with animal names on the window!

263
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:32,425
Watching that from the outside, Ai told me...

264
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,225
Isn't "sanso" (oxygen) a little bit hard for the kids?

265
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,725
Like that.

266
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:42,525
I see. The letters "kirin" (giraffe) looked like "sanso"

267
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,725
from the back and you thought of the code.

268
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,125
Shinichi?

269
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,825
Glass?

270
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,725
Back?

271
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,725
See through...

272
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,425
Wait a minute.

273
00:15:57,425 --> 00:15:59,225
This is...

274
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,925
Darn it! That's it!

275
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,925
-Shinichi? -Kudo?

276
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,425
So that was it!

277
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,325
That's why Ran's face crossed my mind.

278
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:13,625
Ran's in danger!

279
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:26,389
Shinichi?

280
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:27,889
Where am I?

281
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,389
Didn't I told you earlier?

282
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,089
We're returning to the hotel in Mr. Kanou's car.

283
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,889
What? Get out of the car now?

284
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,889
I got what "t, e, i, u" really means!

285
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:44,989
There was a little punctuation before the "t" in "t, e, i, u"!

286
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:47,789
Put that vertical and reverse it!

287
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,489
It's the killer's name.

288
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,689
Hey, Ran?

289
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:54,689
Ran! Ran!

290
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,589
The battery's dead.

291
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,189
What did your husband say?

292
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:02,689
Hey, Sonoko!

293
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,689
Get out of the car, make it vertical and reverse it?

294
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,089
What is it?

295
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,489
Maybe he's just jealous?

296
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,689
No way.

297
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,389
Ran and Sonoko are in trouble?

298
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:22,389
Yes. Sonoko saw it!

299
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,389
The letters written by the person murdered in the hotel room.

300
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,089
Letters?

301
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,089
It was in lower case alphabet written horizontally!

302
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,289
To be more accurate,

303
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,989
there's a comma before the "t" and a dot on "i" which supposed to be "l",

304
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,789
and the "u" is the "shi" in Hiragana.

305
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:41,489
It's the same as "mura matsuri no torii",

306
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:44,389
turn the horizontally written letters vertical,

307
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,889
and read it from the back.

308
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:48,789
It's "Maru mushi ni tento".

309
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,389
Make "sanso" vertical and read it from the back.

310
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:52,689
It's "kirin".

311
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,589
Then, what about "t, e, i, u"?

312
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,289
That is...

313
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:00,489
It becomes "Kanou".

314
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,989
Kanou.

315
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:12,389
Why did he leave such a difficult code as a dying message?

316
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,189
It's not a code!

317
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:17,689
The victim fell on the floor

318
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:20,489
and wrote the words on the window from the inside.

319
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:24,089
And Sonoko saw the letters from the outside.

320
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:28,289
Then we have to hurry and tell Ran.

321
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:31,589
Ran's phone is dead.

322
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:36,889
And the thing is, Ran and Sonoko are both in that Kanou's car!

323
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:49,089
Hey. This is not the way to the hotel.

324
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:52,189
Don't worry, it's a short cut.

325
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:56,189
Where's the hotel those two are staying at?

326
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:59,889
If I knew, I would call the police!

327
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,589
They told me they were going to the beach,

328
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,189
but I don't know where.

329
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,489
Darn it! I should've realized this earlier.

330
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,089
When I received the weird mail from Sonoko's cell phone

331
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,989
which was thought to be mugged!

332
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:16,789
The picture sent to my cell phone, he wanted to delete the picture

333
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,089
with the dying message.

334
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,689
That's why he asked for my address and name.

335
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:25,089
Wait a minute, then it must mean...

336
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,589
The guy you were talking about, Shinichi,

337
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,789
he's only in high school, yet he's a detective?

338
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,389
Yes, sort of.

339
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:35,289
It's great to have a detective boyfriend.

340
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:38,489
No, he's not my boyfriend.

341
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,789
They're so lovey-dovey.

342
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:47,189
That's why I sent her boyfriend a picture of her in her bathing suit.

343
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,589
Hey, Sonoko!

344
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,189
That's so unfortunate.

345
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,489
Shinichi is not here, right?

346
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:58,489
I would have liked to meet the detective.

347
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,689
-He must be devouring that photo right now. -Sonoko!

348
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:03,989
Nonsense!

349
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,789
If the killer is waiting for me to contact him,

350
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,789
he should be carrying Sonoko's cell phone around with it switched on.

351
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:15,889
Please realize it.

352
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,889
That's the man. He's the killer!

353
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,489
Huh? That tune is the same as Sonoko's.

354
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,689
Or rather, that is mine.

355
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,789
You're right!

356
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,989
Really? But why?

357
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,889
Of course.

358
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:39,689
I'm the one who snatched the purse from you.

359
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,889
To erase the evidence of the killing.

360
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,189
-What? - Huh?

361
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:52,489
When we go a little farther, I want you to talk to me.

362
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:55,589
And give me the address of the kid Shinichi, too!

363
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,589
He still won't answer?

364
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,389
Be quiet!

365
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,489
Okay.

366
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,389
He answered?

367
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,589
Hello? Hello?

368
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,289
Hello?

369
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,489
What do you mean hello?

370
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,289
Where were you when Ran needed you?

371
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:45,089
Hey, are you listening?

372
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,289
-Where... -Are you listening?

373
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,689
The car crashed into a tree, and it was so much trouble!

374
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,189
The car? Why'd it ram into a tree?

375
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,789
Don't ask me why. It just happened.

376
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,289
Ran side kicked the face of the killer

377
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:03,789
who was driving the car.

378
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,989
Is that right?

379
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:11,489
After that, the police that Sonoko called arrived

380
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,489
and the killer was taken into custody.

381
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:18,889
His motive for committing the murder was because his friend found out

382
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:21,089
about his illegal enrolment to the university and he was being blackmailed.

383
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,789
He committed a more serious crime to hide his first criminal act

384
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,089
which was a typical pattern for cases like these.

385
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,989
Then...

386
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,389
Huh?

387
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,189
I thought I saved it here.

388
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,489
If it's the picture of the lady in the bathing suit,

389
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,189
I've deleted it for you!

390
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,589
Why?

391
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:44,989
What do you mean by why? It's against the law!

392
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,389
Sorry. I asked Ai to delete it.

393
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:50,889
Haibara?

394
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,289
You...

395
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,289
Darn it!

396
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:01,989
"Next Episode" -"Detective Fluke" is interesting.

397
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:04,889
It's amazing how they can think up a trick like that.

398
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:09,889
That guy. He's one of the three scriptwriters, isn't he?

399
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,589
Those challenging eyes...

400
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,689
He's gotta be the suspect.

401
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:23,589
And he's confident about the trick he used.

402
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:29,589
Next Conan, "The Mystery of the Complete Half Crime"

403
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,316
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,616
"The two cups"

405
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,016
What's title of the next episode?

406
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:39,116
It's half of the complete, so if eel over rice is used as analogy.
