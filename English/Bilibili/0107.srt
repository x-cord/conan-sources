1
00:00:01.078 --> 00:00:04.458
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:05.988
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:10.078
Today's title is a bit unusual!
Can you solve the mystery in Part 1?!

4
00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:11.908
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:13.368
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:15.908
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.561
"The Mystery of the Mole Alien (Part 1)."

8
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.321
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

9
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.651
Is there really
an empty lot nearby

10
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:09.321
where we can play baseball?

11
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.411
There is!

12
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:15.331
C'mon, you guys. Play soccer
once in a while, will ya?

13
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:19.921
We're here!

14
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.471
Huh?

15
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:22.451
What do you mean?

16
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.061
Right here!

17
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:37.891
This is a construction site
for an apartment building!

18
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:43.141
That's right! Except they stopped
construction half a month ago!

19
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.441
Then we can
play baseball in here?!

20
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:46.771
Yes!

21
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:49.391
We can't get in
here because it's locked,

22
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:52.351
but I found another
way in yesterday!

23
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.401
This way!

24
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.271
Geez...

25
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.671
Here it is!

26
00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:09.081
There's a hole!

27
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:11.681
Whoa! You broke it, Mitsuhiko-kun?!

28
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.351
N-No!

29
00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:15.091
A car hit it.

30
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:19.551
See? There's paint
from a car on the fence.

31
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.221
A car must've hit
it and made this hole.

32
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:25.561
Alright! Let's check out the inside!

33
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:27.931
I'm going in first!

34
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.561
There's so much space!

35
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.571
C'mon! Pull like you mean it!

36
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.561
Go on a diet, geez!

37
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:46.391
Alright! This manhole
will be the home plate!

38
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.621
I'm batter!

39
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.971
I'm pitcher!

40
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.331
I'm infielder!

41
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.001
Fine. I'll be outfielder.

42
00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:59.971
Alright! Let's get started!

43
00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:02.141
Yeah.

44
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.891
Conan-kun! I can't hear you!

45
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:07.201
Yeah!

46
00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:07.811
All right!

47
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:10.771
Here it comes, Genta-kun!

48
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:12.231
Bring it on!

49
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:21.111
Conan-kun! It's headed your way!

50
00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:24.081
I'm just a ball-fetcher here...

51
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.881
Still, this is clearly
breaking and entering...

52
00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:37.671
If anyone sees us...

53
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:40.431
What's that?

54
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.561
Oh, crap! He's watching
with binoculars!

55
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:52.481
Whoops!

56
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.221
It went over the fence...

57
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.351
I don't see the ball anywhere.

58
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:04.321
Hey, could it have
gone over that fence, too?

59
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.001
That is quite possible.

60
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:12.021
Then let's ask the person
who lives there to let us get it.

61
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:15.461
Good idea. Let's see...

62
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.301
That seems to be
a back entrance, so...

63
00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:20.051
I think the front door
was facing the main street.

64
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.301
But what if a really
stubborn man lives here?

65
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:26.721
I don't know if he's stubborn or not,

66
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:29.521
but someone was watching from
the upstairs window with binoculars.

67
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:30.881
Binoculars?

68
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:34.481
Meaning someone is home, right?!
Let's give it a shot!

69
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.761
Alright!

70
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.631
It probably flew into this yard.

71
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.721
It looks like a haunted house.

72
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:51.621
Why would a haunted house
be right on a main street?

73
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:58.761
Hey, Conan-kun.

74
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.551
How do you read that?

75
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:05.011
Oh. Watanuki. Watanuki Yoshikazu.
Watanuki Yoshikazu

76
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:07.221
Oh?

77
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:08.471
I think he's coming out!

78
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:15.351
Whoa! He's scary!

79
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:17.761
H-He's all yours, Conan!

80
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:21.321
Geez. You got a big body,
but no guts at all.

81
00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:26.281
Excuse me! Our ball landed
in your yard! Could we get it?

82
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:28.471
Watanuki Yoshikazu (63)

83
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.751
Are you students at Teitan Elementary?
Watanuki Yoshikazu (63)

84
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:33.171
Yes!

85
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.711
You're not allowed in my yard!

86
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.881
That means leave!

87
00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:42.261
W-Wait, hold on!
Without that ball, we can't--

88
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:45.171
That's what you get
for playing baseball there!

89
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.551
If I catch you in there again,
I'm contacting your school!

90
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:51.641
You can't be serious...

91
00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:00.551
He wasn't a stubborn man.
He was a stubborn old man.

92
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:03.761
He could at least let
us look around the yard!

93
00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:06.321
Darn it! Give my ball back!

94
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:08.171
There's nothing we can do.

95
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:13.791
Like he said, we're the ones at
fault for going where we shouldn't.

96
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.381
Then it's Mitsuhiko's fault!

97
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:17.711
You better pay for that ball!

98
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:22.501
Hey! Let's forget about baseball
and play video games at Conan's place!

99
00:07:22.501 --> 00:07:27.381
Y-Yes, good idea! We can
have some snacks there, too!

100
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.201
Boxed eel lunches?

101
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:28.841
Yes!

102
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:31.181
Hey! Don't decide things on your own!

103
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.421
Alright! Let's go to Conan's place!

104
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:34.891
Yes! Let's!

105
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:46.321
Huh? There's someone there...

106
00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:49.281
So, there is. Is he a client?

107
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.121
Hey, Mister.

108
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:55.511
He looks mean...

109
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:57.911
Did you come to the
Mori Detective Agency?

110
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.381
Who're you?

111
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.881
I live here! I'll show you the way!

112
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:13.051
I'm home!

113
00:08:13.051 --> 00:08:14.051
Welcome back!

114
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:15.061
Oh, hello!

115
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.981
Hello!

116
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:20.071
Not those pests again.

117
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.771
Mister! You have a visitor!

118
00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:23.871
Visitor?

119
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:30.211
My name is Koda. My younger
sister went missing a month ago.

120
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.101
Now, now! Please have a seat first!

121
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:35.951
Ran! Make some tea!

122
00:08:35.951 --> 00:08:36.561
Right!

123
00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:43.891
I'm sorry, but could you guys
play outside a little while longer?

124
00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:45.681
Bah. We have no luck.

125
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.471
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:49.931
So, you want me
to find a missing person?

127
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:55.401
No. My sister was murdered!
By a man named Watanuki Yoshikazu!

128
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:56.981
Watanuki?!

129
00:08:57.681 --> 00:09:00.641
The Watanuki-san who lives
next to the construction site?

130
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.701
You know him?

131
00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:05.351
Are you kidding? We met him just now!

132
00:09:05.351 --> 00:09:09.181
He wouldn't let us get the
ball Genta-kun hit into his yard!

133
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.501
He said, "You're not allowed in my yard!"

134
00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:14.351
Just as I thought!

135
00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:18.051
He didn't let you in the yard because
my sister's body is buried there!

136
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:23.311
H-Hold on! Please explain
everything from the start.

137
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:23.841
Here you are!

138
00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:30.141
I've seen him somewhere before!

139
00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:34.231
But I can't
remember where from...

140
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.641
My name is Koda Masao.

141
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.721
Koda Masao (29)
My name is Koda Masao.

142
00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:40.021
I have just the one sister,
Koda Masao (29)

143
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.191
and I was born in Saku, Nagano Prefecture.
Koda Masao (29)

144
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:46.951
Oh, I know Saku! It
has the Cosmos Road, right?

145
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:50.971
Yes. My sister loved
cosmos flowers, too.

146
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:52.751
This is my sister, Sanae.

147
00:09:53.721 --> 00:09:56.751
Oh! She's very pretty!

148
00:09:56.751 --> 00:09:57.721
She really is! She looks nothing like her brother!

149
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:01.181
Koda Sanae (26)
She really is! She looks nothing like her brother!

150
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:02.211
She has white skin, too!
Koda Sanae (26)

151
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:04.931
You kids!

152
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:10.851
My sister moved here six years
ago to work for Toto Securities.

153
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:15.891
Two years ago, she became
head of the Beika branch office.

154
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:22.061
But on the night of the 8th of
last month, she left to go see a client

155
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:24.351
and has been missing ever since.

156
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:28.681
And this client was
Watanuki Yoshikazu-san?

157
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:29.831
Yes.

158
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:34.101
I came to town two
nights after, on a Sunday,

159
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:37.771
and learned about this
at her office the following day.

160
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:41.351
Around what time
did she leave the office?

161
00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:43.271
Around 8:00 pm.

162
00:10:43.271 --> 00:10:47.101
She supposedly said she was
going to stop by Watanuki's house

163
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:48.301
and then return home.

164
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:51.261
Why would she visit
a client at such an hour?

165
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:54.181
According to the branch manager,

166
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:56.971
the stock Watanuki had
bought had plummeted in value,

167
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:00.691
and he was pressuring her into
compensating him for his losses.

168
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.601
One of those so-called
"compensation payments," huh?

169
00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:08.531
Did you go to see Watanuki-san, then?

170
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.021
Yes. The branch manager and
I went on the afternoon of the 11th.

171
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:17.461
He says my sister never
showed up the night of the 8th!

172
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:23.721
But that's a lie! She went to his
house that night, but refused to pay!

173
00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:27.671
Watanuki snapped, killed her,
and buried her in his yard!

174
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:33.101
Say, why do you think
she was buried in the yard?

175
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:36.311
For two reasons.

176
00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:40.681
First, Watanuki doesn't
have a driver's license.

177
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:44.481
He couldn't take the
body far away without a car.

178
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:48.181
Second, late that night,
at about 2:00 am,

179
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:54.491
a businessman in the next
house overheard a shovel digging.

180
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:55.451
Digging?

181
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.891
A man named Mochida-san
who lives nearby.

182
00:11:58.891 --> 00:12:02.891
He says that construction
was being done on the main street

183
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.461
that night between
midnight and 3:00 am.

184
00:12:05.461 --> 00:12:10.431
Watanuki unquestionably used that
sound to dig his hole unnoticed!

185
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:14.761
I see. So, did you
tell the police about this?

186
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:17.021
Of course I did!

187
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:21.101
But Mochida-san had
been very drunk that night,

188
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:24.191
so the police said his
testimony wasn't credible.

189
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:30.701
In the end, they only
questioned Watanuki on ceremony.

190
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:37.851
He lives alone, and he's almost
never left his house since that night.

191
00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:42.021
But every Saturday
morning at around 10:00,

192
00:12:42.021 --> 00:12:46.641
he leaves for Beika Central Hospital
and is gone for two hours.

193
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:47.631
So, Mori-san...

194
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:52.891
Tomorrow is Saturday, so I'd like
you to come with me to his house

195
00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:56.181
and deduce where
he buried my sister's body!

196
00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:58.681
I'll dig her up myself, of course!

197
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.891
In other words, you want me
to sneak into his yard with you?

198
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:05.931
Yes.

199
00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:07.111
I'm afraid I can't.

200
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:12.201
It's illegal to enter others'
yards without permission.

201
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:18.021
Besides, skilled as I am, it'd be
impossible to tell, in such a short time,

202
00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:21.161
where a body was
buried over a month ago.

203
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.971
Koda-san...

204
00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.841
Very well.

205
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:29.721
Just forget it!

206
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:30.761
Koda-san...

207
00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:35.201
I'm sorry for bothering you.

208
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:39.431
Umm...

209
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:44.731
Now I remember!

210
00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:47.651
That person looks
just like a Mole Alien!

211
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:49.531
Mole?

212
00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:50.481
Alien?

213
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:51.641
Oh!

214
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:53.521
He does, come to think of it!

215
00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:58.451
Right?! Mole Aliens take on
friends' forms to trick Masked Yaiba!

216
00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:02.411
They suddenly come out
of the ground, just like moles!

217
00:14:02.721 --> 00:14:06.331
Oh! So that's why he
wanted to dig up the yard!

218
00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:09.681
Hey, now. That's not why at all.

219
00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:12.341
Are you just going to let him go, Dad?

220
00:14:12.681 --> 00:14:17.311
What am I supposed to do?
He told me to forget about it.

221
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:23.771
Besides, he's certain this Watanuki
killed his sister and buried her,

222
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:26.391
but there's no proof at all.

223
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:31.021
Even the shovel sound could've
come from the street construction.

224
00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:33.431
That's true, but...

225
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:36.991
Well, I guess
I can give it a quick check.

226
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.971
Yeah, there is some
truth to what the old guy says.

227
00:14:40.971 --> 00:14:43.391
We can't say anything for
sure, at this stage--

228
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:45.961
Alright! It's decided!

229
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:48.381
Let's do it!

230
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.061
I got a bad feeling about this...

231
00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:01.547
How did I know we'd be back here?

232
00:15:02.057 --> 00:15:05.887
First, we need to think of
a way to get inside somehow.

233
00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:09.257
We can assume the gate is locked, so...

234
00:15:09.257 --> 00:15:09.847
Huh?

235
00:15:12.217 --> 00:15:13.107
It's unlocked.

236
00:15:13.637 --> 00:15:16.257
Lucky! He must've gone somewhere!

237
00:15:16.257 --> 00:15:18.057
Alright! Now's our chance!

238
00:15:18.057 --> 00:15:19.597
W-Wait, you guys!

239
00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:28.137
Yes, there's no way to tell
where she's buried just by looking.

240
00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:32.627
Of course not! We don't even
know if she really is buried here!

241
00:15:32.967 --> 00:15:37.587
Then let's start digging up
the place! I'll go find a shovel!

242
00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:38.737
Wait! Genta!

243
00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:39.877
Hey, you!

244
00:15:47.387 --> 00:15:49.477
Beika Police Department

245
00:15:49.477 --> 00:15:54.257
Yes, that Koda fellow
gave us a bit of trouble, too.

246
00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:55.687
How so?

247
00:15:56.597 --> 00:16:00.717
Watanuki-san lost about 1.5
million yen in the stock market.

248
00:16:00.717 --> 00:16:04.697
That's a lot of money, but certainly
not enough to kill someone over.

249
00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:06.557
That's true...

250
00:16:06.557 --> 00:16:10.367
On top of that, he's certain
Watanuki-san is responsible

251
00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:13.967
and has been following
him around for a month now.

252
00:16:13.967 --> 00:16:17.707
The way we see it, Watanuki-san
seems more like the victim here.

253
00:16:25.137 --> 00:16:29.717
We're sorry! We just really
wanted our ball, so we snuck in...

254
00:16:29.717 --> 00:16:31.387
We're really sorry!

255
00:16:31.387 --> 00:16:32.727
We're sorry!

256
00:16:34.177 --> 00:16:39.687
It's all right. I was a bit on edge before.
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

257
00:16:41.097 --> 00:16:43.807
I found your ball earlier.

258
00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.137
I'll give it back,

259
00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.777
if you promise never to go to
those apartments to play again.

260
00:16:48.777 --> 00:16:51.427
Yes! We promise!

261
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.637
Just a minute.

262
00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:54.377
This is great!

263
00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:55.357
Yes!

264
00:16:58.307 --> 00:16:59.457
One message.

265
00:17:02.427 --> 00:17:05.007
This is Beika Central Hospital.

266
00:17:05.387 --> 00:17:09.467
You have a checkup scheduled
for tomorrow, so be sure to come.

267
00:17:10.557 --> 00:17:12.767
Hey, that sounded like--!

268
00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:17.727
What nonsense! I know that!
I don't need to be told!

269
00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:19.477
Here!

270
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.987
Now take it and get out of my sight!

271
00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.107
O-Okay...

272
00:17:27.507 --> 00:17:31.037
He was acting so nice at first,
but suddenly grew angry.

273
00:17:31.037 --> 00:17:33.717
He's one moody
old man, that's for sure.

274
00:17:33.717 --> 00:17:35.997
Hey! Did you hear that phone call?!

275
00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:39.457
Yeah. It sounded a
lot like Koda-san's voice.

276
00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:41.607
Eh? Koda-san?

277
00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:43.337
You mean that Mole Alien?

278
00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:45.507
There's no question about it.

279
00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:47.717
Koda-san plans to dig up the body

280
00:17:47.717 --> 00:17:50.967
while Watanuki-san
is at the hospital.

281
00:17:53.347 --> 00:17:57.137
But, is there really
a body buried in this yard?

282
00:17:58.057 --> 00:18:04.107
Even if there is, it'd be impossible
to tell where it is in just two hours.

283
00:18:04.887 --> 00:18:08.447
What exactly does
Koda-san plan to do?!

284
00:18:12.757 --> 00:18:15.347
The next day (Saturday)

285
00:18:19.257 --> 00:18:21.247
Hey! Conan! What time is it?

286
00:18:23.347 --> 00:18:25.387
Seven minutes to 10:00.

287
00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:27.427
Even after I told
them not to come...

288
00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:30.637
That certainly is a big shovel!

289
00:18:30.637 --> 00:18:34.387
I thought I'd help the
Mole Alien dig up the body!

290
00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:37.637
Say, what do you
plan to do, Conan-kun?

291
00:18:37.637 --> 00:18:41.217
I intend to stop Koda-san somehow.

292
00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:45.637
Whatever the reason, sneaking
onto others' property isn't right.

293
00:18:50.387 --> 00:18:52.617
Mitsuhiko! Follow him!

294
00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:57.717
If he decides to come back,
call us on your Detective League badge!

295
00:18:57.717 --> 00:18:59.757
Right! Understood!

296
00:19:07.137 --> 00:19:09.887
What's taking the Mole Alien so long?

297
00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:12.557
Conan, what time is it?

298
00:19:12.557 --> 00:19:14.677
10:10.

299
00:19:20.057 --> 00:19:21.147
That was Inspector Megure!

300
00:19:23.557 --> 00:19:25.677
Do you think something happened?!

301
00:19:25.677 --> 00:19:27.137
I'll check it out!

302
00:19:27.137 --> 00:19:28.067
Hey! Conan!

303
00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:31.627
Conan-kun...

304
00:19:35.387 --> 00:19:38.387
Let's have a look inside, Inspector.

305
00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:40.387
Inspector Megure!

306
00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:42.257
Oh, Mori-kun.

307
00:19:42.257 --> 00:19:43.247
Go on ahead.

308
00:19:43.247 --> 00:19:43.977
Yes, sir.

309
00:19:47.257 --> 00:19:49.717
I hear there was an armed robbery?

310
00:19:49.717 --> 00:19:53.807
Yes. It took place
about seven minutes ago and...

311
00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:57.097
Does this mean you weren't
here when it happened?

312
00:19:57.097 --> 00:20:01.507
No, I just happened
to be passing by right now.

313
00:20:01.507 --> 00:20:03.557
Oh, I see!

314
00:20:03.557 --> 00:20:05.637
I thought for sure you were at the scene
of the crime, yet again--

315
00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:06.817
Inspector!
I thought for sure you were at the scene
of the crime, yet again--

316
00:20:07.347 --> 00:20:09.507
The security camera got a
look at the robber's face!

317
00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:10.427
Really?!

318
00:20:10.427 --> 00:20:12.427
You know him too, Mori-san!

319
00:20:12.427 --> 00:20:13.047
Huh?

320
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:13.557
What?

321
00:20:13.557 --> 00:20:15.007
Just come inside!

322
00:20:24.257 --> 00:20:26.927
Inspector! Here he is!

323
00:20:26.927 --> 00:20:27.877
It's him!

324
00:20:27.877 --> 00:20:30.667
Just who is he, Mori-kun?

325
00:20:31.827 --> 00:20:33.627
Koda-san!

326
00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:37.887
This man's name is Koda Masao!

327
00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:41.307
But why is he doing a jewel robbery?!

328
00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:45.597
Whatever the case,
Koda ran off with a dozen or so jewels!

329
00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:47.217
Inspector Megure!

330
00:20:47.217 --> 00:20:50.817
The robber's motorcycle
was found near Beika Station!

331
00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:51.977
What?!
What?!

332
00:20:58.177 --> 00:21:00.057
No doubt about it, Inspector.

333
00:21:00.057 --> 00:21:03.467
The plate number matches
with the witness' testimony perfectly.

334
00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:04.707
Inspector Megure!

335
00:21:05.007 --> 00:21:07.167
We found this on the station stairs!

336
00:21:08.007 --> 00:21:09.127
A jewel...

337
00:21:09.677 --> 00:21:14.057
No question about it! He got on
the Loop Line from Beika Station!

338
00:21:14.057 --> 00:21:16.717
I want emergency deployment
at all stations on the Loop Line!

339
00:21:16.717 --> 00:21:17.597
Understood!

340
00:21:17.597 --> 00:21:20.967
Everyone else, continue
to scour the vicinity!

341
00:21:20.967 --> 00:21:21.557
Yes, sir!

342
00:21:21.557 --> 00:21:28.477
Is Ayumi right? Has Koda-san
fooled us just like the Mole Aliens?

343
00:21:29.307 --> 00:21:33.597
Was the whole story
about his sister a fabrication?!

344
00:21:35.057 --> 00:21:37.807
But why would he make that up?

345
00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:42.577
And, even if he had a reason,
why would someone so well-prepared

346
00:21:43.217 --> 00:21:48.887
commit the crime without sunglasses
or a mask to conceal himself

347
00:21:48.887 --> 00:21:52.167
and ditch his getaway
vehicle for everyone to see?

348
00:21:59.137 --> 00:22:03.467
A leaf? And it's fresh and green...

349
00:22:04.217 --> 00:22:10.257
The fact it's stuck here means
someone opened this not so long ago!

350
00:22:10.257 --> 00:22:11.387
Wait a minute!

351
00:22:11.387 --> 00:22:14.397
There was one by
Watanuki-san's back gate, too!

352
00:22:20.217 --> 00:22:21.447
Could it be?

353
00:22:22.057 --> 00:22:25.577
Is Koda-san's true objective...

354
00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:08.607
It's him!

355
00:24:08.607 --> 00:24:11.587
He really is a Mole Alien!

356
00:24:11.587 --> 00:24:14.207
Take me to 1st Street in Beika! Hurry!

357
00:24:14.207 --> 00:24:15.127
R-Right!

358
00:24:15.547 --> 00:24:18.587
Genta-kun! The old
man is taking a taxi back!

359
00:24:18.587 --> 00:24:22.307
Hey! Mister! Watanuki-san
is gonna be back soon!

360
00:24:23.637 --> 00:24:26.957
If my theory is
correct, Koda-san is--!

361
00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:29.587
On the next Conan--

362
00:24:29.587 --> 00:24:33.507
"The Mystery of the Mole Alien (Part 2)."
