1
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:06,272
Ridiculous. There's no such thing.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,102
Inspector!

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,222
It really is exactly
like two years ago.

4
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:13,312
The two side beams
are covered in dust,

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,312
and there are no signs of
anything touching them.

6
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,192
A bit of dust has been
knocked off the middle beam,

7
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:21,062
but that's because of
the rope tied to it.

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,652
There are no rub marks to
indicate he was hoisted up.

9
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:26,822
Do you suppose
this was a suicide too?

10
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,392
Suicide?

11
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,352
Yeah, you can manage
to get up there

12
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:34,682
if you climb across the beams
and use rope like that officer,

13
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:38,042
but it's a different story if you're
trying to carry someone up there.

14
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:42,682
The late priest Chunen and the
head priest weren't all that small.

15
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:47,182
Scaling the rope with them tied to
your back would be nigh impossible.

16
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:50,272
If you tied the noose around
their necks and hoisted them up,

17
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,852
it would leave marks on the beam.

18
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:57,102
Someone could have climbed
up first and then pulled them up,

19
00:00:57,102 --> 00:01:00,312
but that narrow beam is
the only place to stand,

20
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:01,562
so it's extremely unlikely.

21
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,022
Which means they must have
climbed the ropes themselves,

22
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:09,142
made a noose while on the beam,

23
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:13,182
and then jumped off with
the noose around their necks.

24
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:18,722
Some leftover rope and an axe
probably used to cut it

25
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,522
were found on the ground,

26
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,622
so it would seem that was the case.

27
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,892
But what has me wondering
is that hole in the wall...

28
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,962
...it's exactly like last time!

29
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,722
I don't know how
they broke the wall,

30
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:34,722
but they probably broke it and
hanged themselves from a tall ceiling

31
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:38,932
to make it look like that old legend.

32
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:41,142
Almost as if to suggest to us

33
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:46,022
that they were attacked
by the flying Kiri Tengu.

34
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,942
That ridiculous tale sends
everyone in a panic...

35
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:54,972
But doesn't this broken
wall seem strange?

36
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:58,472
There was a sliding panel here, right?

37
00:01:58,472 --> 00:01:59,042
Yeah...

38
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:06,422
For such a big hole in the wall,
there's almost no debris left.

39
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,052
That's true...

40
00:02:10,182 --> 00:02:13,102
They probably threw them over.

41
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:15,432
After all, these people
did make their suicides

42
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,012
look like the Kiri Tengu's doing.

43
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:20,472
Who knows what they were thinking.

44
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,482
Grandpa!

45
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,692
Grandpa! Grandpa!

46
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,272
Oh? Isn't she--

47
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:31,112
The head priest's
granddaughter, Kikuno-san.

48
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:35,062
Grandpa! Why did this happen?!

49
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:41,372
She cried two years ago too,
when she saw Priest Chunen's body...

50
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:46,932
Yes. She used to visit on
occasion back then,

51
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:50,212
but she suddenly stopped
coming after the incident...

52
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,422
Grandpa! Grandpa!

53
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,172
Who's he?

54
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:58,182
Kikuno-san's husband.

55
00:02:58,182 --> 00:03:01,352
They married only a few days ago.

56
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,182
I hear he's the
successor to a big temple

57
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:07,152
and the two of them were arranged
to be married since they were little.

58
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:12,852
I was really shocked when I heard
that from the head priest two years ago.

59
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:16,612
I had always thought that she
and Chunen-san were to be together.

60
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:19,122
The late Chunen-san?

61
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:20,562
Yes.

62
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:24,082
The two were so close they
seemed like real brother and sister.

63
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,182
It must have been a
real shock to Chunen-san

64
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:30,182
when he heard she
was going to be married.

65
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:32,052
That's probably why
he did that foolish thing...

66
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:36,682
Maybe the head priest had been
worrying about that this whole time--

67
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,472
...and killed himself like Chunen-san

68
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,572
mere days after Kikuno-san's wedding!

69
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,022
That is a possibility...

70
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:47,432
If so, then there should be
a will somewhere.

71
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,682
Then let's all split up
and look for it!

72
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,472
Suicide?!

73
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,472
Are you so sure?

74
00:03:57,472 --> 00:04:00,352
No matter how much
it looks like the old legend,

75
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:03,082
would anybody really hang
themselves from a place like that?!

76
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,702
And would they really
make such a big hole on purpose?!

77
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,122
What if it wasn't a suicide

78
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:13,592
and this big hole was
used for some sort of trick...

79
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:17,552
This incident and the one two years
ago were pulled off the same way.

80
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:23,642
Meaning Chunen and the head priest
were murdered by the same person.

81
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,312
What are you doing, little boy?

82
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,642
Shunen-san!

83
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:34,612
Come to think of it, this guy said
he came to this temple one year ago.

84
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:42,022
I doubt he could've made that
big hole with these scrawny arms...

85
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:46,912
Say, you said you were up
late last night reading a book, right?

86
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,022
Yeah. I was awake
until a little past 3:00.

87
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:52,632
Did you notice anything
strange during that time?

88
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:57,522
Like anyone sneaking
out of their room,

89
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,972
or an eerie sound
from something breaking,

90
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,682
or anyone screaming?!

91
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:04,192
No, I didn't hear anything.

92
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,262
Last night was a quiet night.

93
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:08,472
You really heard nothing?

94
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,722
Nope.

95
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:12,062
The head priest's
room is a little ways away,

96
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,352
but everyone's sleeping
quarters are next to each other,

97
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:16,692
so we'd know right
away if anything happened.

98
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:20,642
Don't tell me you're
suspicious of everyone?

99
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:21,432
Not really...

100
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,162
Hey, Shunen!

101
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:26,432
Stop lounging
around and help us look!

102
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,952
Oh, right!

103
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,222
Alright, just a little more!

104
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,522
You freaked me out when
you started to lose your grip there!

105
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:47,642
Sorry 'bout that!

106
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,432
Hey, officers!

107
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:52,272
That's the window
at the top of the room

108
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:53,602
where the head priest died, right?

109
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,932
Yeah...

110
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:00,352
You can't carry someone
through here onto the middle beam?

111
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:04,852
No, it'd be impossible without
leaving marks on the beam...

112
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,472
Besides, it'd be crazy
to carry someone in there

113
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:10,082
and try to do things on
top of something so narrow.

114
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,292
What's with this drainboard?

115
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,552
The cut is warped!

116
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:23,702
The rest are just fine, though...

117
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:28,972
Hey, little boy!

118
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:31,222
But the cut is old.

119
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,972
It was made quite a long time ago.

120
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,522
There are cherry blossom
petals stuck to the underside...

121
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,482
How?

122
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,442
Conan-kun!

123
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:45,662
Conan-kun! Where are you?

124
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,852
Conan-kun!

125
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,022
If you're looking for that boy,

126
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,892
he asked how to get to
the woods below the temple

127
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,082
and then left.

128
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:07,522
The only things
missing from the scene

129
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:10,182
were the fragments
from that broken wall!

130
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:14,312
If the killer threw
them over the side,

131
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:16,642
they would have landed
around here somewhere!

132
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,722
If I can find them,

133
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:22,612
I might figure out the reason
the killer had to get rid of them!

134
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:25,442
And then the mystery
behind the killer's trick!

135
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:37,122
Bingo! A piece of the wood!

136
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:41,212
This was part of that sliding panel...

137
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,382
There's tape on it... What for?

138
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,102
What are you doing down here?!

139
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,432
Ran!

140
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,682
What's with that dirty piece of wood?!

141
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,472
Get rid of it!

142
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,392
I can't!

143
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:04,182
Alright! Let's call it a day!

144
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:04,902
Yes, sir!

145
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,202
Say, where's Kikuno-san?

146
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:12,162
She went with the body
to the police headquarters.

147
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:15,792
But we can't seem to find his will.

148
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:19,622
That's okay. At least
we know it was a suicide...

149
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:23,182
No! It was a murder!

150
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:25,892
Something happened
in this room last night!

151
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,812
Something beyond imagination!

152
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:32,562
The wall which was destroyed
by an immense strength...

153
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,642
The warped cut on the drainboard...

154
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:38,182
And the dumped
piece of wood from the wall

155
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,062
and the tape that was stuck to it...

156
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:43,682
What is the key
that connects them all?

157
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:53,742
A cherry blossom?

158
00:08:56,162 --> 00:09:00,082
That's it! I've figured
out the killer's trick!

159
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:06,002
If that's the case, then the killer must've
spent the entire night in this room...

160
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:10,012
Ah! So that's why he said that!

161
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:15,012
He's the killer, no question about it!

162
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,638
The impossible crime...

163
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:26,888
...a work of foul art created at
the scene of the crime by a murderer.

164
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,888
The piece of art exhibited this time

165
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:32,018
was a room in a mountain temple
where the cherry blossoms fall.

166
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,438
Someone murdered
the temple's head priest

167
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:37,358
by tying him to an elevated
beam and then hanging him!

168
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,448
Naturally, there were no
marks of him being pulled up.

169
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,868
It seems utterly impossible for
a human to commit this crime...

170
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:48,788
Yes, the killer utilized a certain
technique to float in the air!

171
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,348
Just like the adroit flying Kiri Tengu!

172
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,928
Some unused rope
and an axe lay on the floor

173
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,928
of the room where
the head priest was killed.

174
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,928
But the strangest thing of all

175
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,758
was that although there
was a huge hole in the wall,

176
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:05,978
there was no debris from it.

177
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:08,598
Then there was the
drainboard with the warped cut,

178
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:11,838
and the piece of
wood from the sliding panel

179
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:13,548
and the tape that was on it...

180
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,738
What is the key
that connects them all?

181
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:22,908
A cherry blossom?

182
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,948
That's it! I've figured
out the killer's trick!

183
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:28,968
If that's the case,

184
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,958
then the killer must've spent
the entire night in this room!

185
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,168
Ah! So that's why he said that!

186
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:40,548
He's the killer, no question about it!

187
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,588
Please, Inspector Megure?

188
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:45,508
Alright, alright.

189
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,768
I'll take you
home in my patrol car.

190
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:51,598
I have to make them
notice before everyone leaves...

191
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:54,638
Hand over the
keys to the rental car

192
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:57,388
that just happened to
get a flat tire in the forest!

193
00:10:57,388 --> 00:11:00,298
I'll have one of my
men return it for you.

194
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,758
We owe a great deal
to your detective skills, after all.

195
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,578
Thanks a bunch!

196
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,138
I got the keys!

197
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:10,328
Get back here, kid!

198
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:15,288
Damn it, where'd that brat go?!

199
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:17,958
No drainboards!

200
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,678
Oops, he slipped
and knocked himself out...

201
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:25,928
Oh well.

202
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:28,638
Now I don't have to use the
Anesthetic Watch Gun on him!

203
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,758
This button acts as
a tiny wireless speaker.

204
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:38,778
Whatever you say into
your bow tie will come out of this.

205
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,968
I'll just stick this here...

206
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,568
Hey, little boy!

207
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,468
Officer!

208
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,258
You shouldn't come in
here without permission.

209
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,468
Perfect timing!

210
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:49,718
Mori-san said he wants
everyone to gather in the room

211
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,538
where the incident happened!

212
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,248
And do you have any tape?

213
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,208
Tape?

214
00:11:57,838 --> 00:12:00,508
What? You know who did it?!

215
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,718
Yes.

216
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:04,928
I know who killed the head
priest and made it look like a suicide.

217
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:06,338
Hey, now.

218
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:10,258
The head priest died after
he was tied to an elevated beam

219
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,388
and hanged!

220
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,938
If you're saying someone set that up,

221
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:17,228
how in the world did they do it?!

222
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,988
There were no marks on the beam
of him being pulled up, you know!

223
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,948
Of course there aren't any marks.

224
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:30,218
The killer floated directly up to
the beam along with the head priest

225
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:33,408
and then tied him to it!

226
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,548
Floated up?!

227
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,138
Don't tell me it
was the Kiri Tengu...

228
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:40,378
No human could
do anything like that...

229
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,798
Hear that sound?

230
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,838
Yes, it's the waterfall.

231
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:49,758
Yes. The waterfall that flows
directly next to the top window...

232
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,468
Wouldn't it be possible
to float to the ceiling

233
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:56,798
if you diverted the waterfall
through the window

234
00:12:56,798 --> 00:13:00,228
and filled the entire room with water?

235
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,938
Fill this entire room with water?

236
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,798
You have to be kidding me.

237
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,928
Both the killer and the
victim would be sopping wet,

238
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:12,788
but there were no signs
of wetness on the body at all!

239
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,998
An inflatable raft, Inspector.

240
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:17,078
An inflatable raft?

241
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:18,218
Kannen-san.

242
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:22,298
You said there was an inflatable
raft in the temple, correct?

243
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,588
Yes.

244
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:28,928
If the body was in the raft and covered
with a plastic sheet or something,

245
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,058
then it could have made it
to the top without getting wet.

246
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:36,048
But the waterfall and
the window are too far apart!

247
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,678
No matter how well things might fit,

248
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:40,518
nobody could divert
the water into the room...

249
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,988
The drainboard.

250
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:49,088
The killer covered the gaps in
the drainboard with tape, flipped it over,

251
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,448
and then redirected the
waterfall through the window.

252
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:55,798
As proof of this, the cut
on the drainboard is warped.

253
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:59,508
It was cut to make
it short enough to fit...

254
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:03,258
And there are cherry blossom
petals stuck to the board

255
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,918
in the spots where
the tape would have been...

256
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,428
The same petals that
are carried down the waterfall

257
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,458
from the trees at
the top of the mountain.

258
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,608
And it wasn't just the drainboard
that had flower petals stuck to it.

259
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,568
They should fall down
to your feet soon, Inspector.

260
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:30,508
The petals that got
stuck to the side of the wall

261
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:33,888
when the killer removed
the water, that is!

262
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:38,338
In other words,
after killing the head priest,

263
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,798
the killer carried
the body into this room,

264
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:40,888
put it into the inflatable raft,

265
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:44,798
covered the inner doorframe with tape,

266
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:48,718
and temporarily left the
room through the sliding panel.

267
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:51,428
Then the killer began
filling the room with water

268
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:53,678
from the 2nd floor window
using the method I just illustrated,

269
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,218
quickly returned to the 1st floor,

270
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,928
entered through the sliding panel,

271
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,728
and then covered it with tape too.

272
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:03,188
Otherwise, the water
would leak out through the panel.

273
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:07,588
After that, while taking
great care not to get the body wet,

274
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,648
all the killer had to do
was wait for the room to fill up.

275
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:14,758
After the room filled up enough,
the killer arrived at the beam,

276
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:16,758
tied the corpse to it,

277
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:20,618
and then escaped out the top window.

278
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,838
But how did the
killer get rid of the water?

279
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,838
By breaking the
sliding panel with the axe

280
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,088
that was left at the scene of the crime.

281
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:32,468
Yes. This room's floor
is about 4.5 tatami in area

282
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,638
and the walls are
about 10 meters high,

283
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:38,888
so its volume is 2.7 meters
by 2.7 meters by 10 meters,

284
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:42,008
or 72.9 meters cubed.

285
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,468
The specific gravity of water is 1,

286
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:48,978
so the weight of all the water in
the filled room would be 72.9 tons.

287
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:52,678
If you used an axe to break
a panel at the bottom of a room

288
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:53,718
with that much water,

289
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:55,778
you know what would happen.

290
00:15:56,968 --> 00:16:04,758
The cracked panel would fly out under
9.8 x 10 to the 4th Pascals of pressure!

291
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:06,498
Under the immense
strength of the water,

292
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,378
more and more of the wall would
erode off, creating a gaping hole!

293
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:14,218
9.8 x 10 to the 4th Pascals?

294
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:19,138
A huge amount of power--
like getting run over by a truck.

295
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,678
I see!

296
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:25,978
So that's why there's no debris
even though the hole is so big!

297
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:31,388
Conan found a fragment of the
wall in the woods below the temple.

298
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:32,188
He did?

299
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,158
Here you go, Inspector!

300
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,138
I see.

301
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,498
A piece of the sliding
panel with tape on it.

302
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:44,458
But who in the world
would do such a thing?!

303
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:48,798
It would take less than ten seconds
for the water to exit the room,

304
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,588
but filling the room,
that's a whole different story.

305
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,588
The amount of water
entering from the drainboard

306
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,888
is five to six times as
much as through a faucet.

307
00:16:55,888 --> 00:17:00,138
If we estimate that it filled
up 10 cubic meters per hour,

308
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:06,348
it would take seven hours
to completely fill this room!

309
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,138
The head priest's
estimated time of death

310
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:12,008
was between 10:00 pm
and 12:00 am last night.

311
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:16,358
And it was 8:00 am when
his body was discovered.

312
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:19,798
Even if you deduct the
time to set up the trick

313
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,088
and the time needed to release
the water and dry the room

314
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:30,338
the killer must have been in this
room between midnight and 6:00 am!

315
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:33,918
What does that have
to do with the killer?

316
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,088
Shunen-san.

317
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:39,588
You said you were
reading a book in your room

318
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:42,428
until 3:00 am last night, correct?

319
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:49,298
If so, then you too should've
heard a certain someone scream

320
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:52,438
when they saw the
Tengu mask from the bathroom!

321
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,088
Who screamed?!

322
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,898
Answer me!

323
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:58,838
Shunen...

324
00:17:58,838 --> 00:18:03,538
Of course I heard Ran-san scream!

325
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,508
It caught me by surprise!

326
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:09,388
I can't blame her
for being scared, though...

327
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,918
Shunen! Did you--

328
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,798
Shunen-san.

329
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,668
It wasn't Ran who screamed.

330
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,378
It was me!

331
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:25,138
But it's not your
fault you didn't hear me.

332
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,468
You were in here all night,

333
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,768
surrounded by the thunderous
roar of the water, after all.

334
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:33,478
But his testimony won't
hold as evidence, Mori-kun!

335
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,588
If it's undeniable
proof that you want,

336
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:38,298
then you're holding
it right now, Inspector.

337
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:39,448
This piece of wood?

338
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:44,468
By wiping the room off later,
the killer could destroy the evidence,

339
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:46,468
but he couldn't do
that with that piece of wood

340
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:48,408
since it went flying off.

341
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:49,508
Yes.

342
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:53,498
That is the only thing
the killer failed to recover!

343
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,588
I would bet my life as a detective

344
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:03,588
that they're still on
the tape stuck to that board...

345
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:06,678
Shunen-san.
I'm referring to your fingerprints!

346
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:12,428
But Shunen came to
this temple a year ago!

347
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:14,838
If this is the same trick
as the one two years ago,

348
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,838
then the same person did it!

349
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,398
Shunen couldn't have done it!

350
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:22,088
The incident two years ago
was probably the head priest's doing,

351
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:24,528
using the exact same trick as this time.

352
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,428
The cut on the drainboard was old,

353
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:32,168
and he was the one most
afraid to talk about the incident.

354
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:36,178
And if my instincts are correct,

355
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:41,378
the late Chunen-san and
Shunen-san were probably brothers!

356
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,468
It's true.

357
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:49,018
Chunen was my genuine blood brother.

358
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:52,388
It was only natural
that no one realized it...

359
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:55,468
To hide my origin,
I came as a priest-in-training

360
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:58,978
after studying at a
distantly-related temple first.

361
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:01,138
Naturally, my purpose
for coming to this temple

362
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:04,508
was to find out the truth
behind my brother's death

363
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,368
and find the real culprit!

364
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,718
I scoured the temple for half a year.

365
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:14,668
I had the trick figured out,
but I didn't know who did it.

366
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,378
Nobody wanted to talk about
the incident, you see.

367
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,878
But I realized it when you
came yesterday, Detective.

368
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:26,298
I knew once I saw the
head priest's strange attitude!

369
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:32,218
Afterwards, I went to his room
and found him drinking his night sake.

370
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:34,838
When I pressed the issue,
he told me about all sorts of things!

371
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:37,358
He had no idea I was actually
Chunen's younger brother!

372
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,798
The reason he killed my brother

373
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,138
was because he didn't want him
to take his granddaughter Kikuno-san,

374
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:47,068
who was to marry a
successor to a big temple.

375
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:52,838
Kikuno-san and my brother supposedly
even agreed to elope together,

376
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:55,288
but that doesn't matter now...

377
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,998
Anyway, when I asked the head
priest to give himself up, he--

378
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:06,548
There's no evidence left from what
happened two years ago anyway!

379
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:12,218
Besides, this temple has gained
prestige thanks to that incident!

380
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:16,488
It's known as the temple
where the Kiri Tengu appears!

381
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:21,298
When he said that,
I lost control of myself

382
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:26,178
and strangled him to
death with a belt in the room!

383
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:31,218
Yes. Just like he strangled my
brother two years ago...

384
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:33,008
...with him on my back,

385
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,118
to leave marks to make
it look like a hanging suicide...

386
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:40,178
With his corpse at my feet,
I had no other choice.

387
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:43,008
I would have to use the
same trick he used two years ago

388
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:45,088
to hide the truth...

389
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:54,978
It's too bad you didn't visit this
temple two years ago, Detective.

390
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,658
If you had, I would probably be...

391
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,198
The twilight would
know no weariness

392
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:12,328
if we talked about
romance all night long

393
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:20,698
There's no time to love,
the waves are surging this way

394
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:29,338
Even as I swim in my memories,
reality is cool and dry

395
00:22:29,338 --> 00:22:37,308
Where will I wander
to make sure of that love?

396
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:44,938
You're like an unattainable,
far-away cloud,

397
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:53,278
yet I shall follow you wherever
you go, I swear on my heart

398
00:22:53,278 --> 00:23:01,328
Even if you find out someday
and realize that I can love you

399
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:11,908
Even if we spend our
days constantly fighting

400
00:23:31,468 --> 00:23:35,488
You surprise me
every single time, Mori-kun!

401
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,948
I had no idea you knew
that much about physics!

402
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:44,908
Yeah, like when you talked
about Pascals or something...

403
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:45,708
"Pascals"?

404
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:47,128
What they mean is--

405
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:51,218
"Paical" is Chinese alcohol...

406
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:52,928
"Oscar" is from Takarazuka...

407
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:54,758
"Rascal" is a kind of raccoon...

408
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,748
What's a Pascal?!

409
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:01,688
Oh, you mean that TV magazine!

410
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:06,298
You dummy, that's "Telepal"!

411
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:08,888
And you only got the "al" right!
