1
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.740
"Makabe"

2
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.140
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

3
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Love and cases come from the same origin.

4
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.940
A smiling wife suddenly disappears.

5
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940
Will the thoughts of the members of the Youth Detective Squad reach her?

6
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.740
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:58.336
"The Secret of the Disappearance of the Young Wife"

10
00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.536
True, it sounds suspicious.

11
00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:04.536
Yeah, I'm sure that husband, you know, his wife...

12
00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:06.236
I think so too.

13
00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:08.736
I wonder about that.

14
00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:11.536
They live right in the middle of a residential district.

15
00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:13.636
Do you really think that someone would try

16
00:03:13.636 --> 00:03:15.736
to carry a corpse around in broad daylight?

17
00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.036
True.

18
00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.036
You can say that again.

19
00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:23.836
Conan! You're going home already?

20
00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.836
Sorry, I have something to do.

21
00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:26.936
See you!

22
00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:30.636
Come to think of it,

23
00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:33.936
today's the day that the "Detective Samonji" Series goes on sale.

24
00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:37.536
Which is more important to him? The book or us?

25
00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:39.336
I'll see you guys.

26
00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.536
Hey! You too, Ai?

27
00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:52.636
This is the house.

28
00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:54.936
It's kind of eerie, isn't it?

29
00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.736
Let's go see, anyway.

30
00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.436
I wonder if nobody's home?

31
00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.736
The car's not here either.

32
00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:10.636
The only ones living here are the husband, who's a musician,

33
00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:12.936
and his wife, right?

34
00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:14.036
Yes.

35
00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:16.836
The husband is half Japanese and half American.

36
00:04:16.836 --> 00:04:22.036
It seems he's frequently on the road and not at home much.

37
00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:24.936
Hey! Look!

38
00:04:26.836 --> 00:04:28.236
This is...

39
00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:31.436
Looks like traces of blood.

40
00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:34.036
You guys.

41
00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:36.136
What're you doing?

42
00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:38.536
"Jun Makabe (38)" -You shouldn't walk into other people's homes

43
00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:40.236
without permission.

44
00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.736
We were playing and our ball seems to have come into your yard.

45
00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:45.936
Right?

46
00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:51.336
You're Yoshida's daughter...

47
00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.536
Well...

48
00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.336
Where's your car?

49
00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:00.036
It's out for repair

50
00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:03.436
because I scraped it driving where I'm not used to driving.

51
00:05:07.136 --> 00:05:09.636
Oh, that's my wife's blood.

52
00:05:10.736 --> 00:05:13.136
Is... Is your wife okay?

53
00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:16.236
Of course.

54
00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:20.436
But, she's not feeling well now and is asleep.

55
00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:22.636
So, no need to worry.

56
00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:25.636
Is anything the matter?

57
00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:27.636
Oh, no...

58
00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:29.136
Is that right?

59
00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:30.736
Well, then no problem!

60
00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:37.136
Gosh, so it was nothing after all.

61
00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.036
But, honest, I...

62
00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.236
He's lying.

63
00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:44.236
I saw.

64
00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:49.936
There was not one shoe of his wife at the entrance.

65
00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:53.136
Then does that mean that his wife is not at that house?

66
00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:55.736
Yes, but that's not enough.

67
00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:01.936
Hey, that's that house we just went to, right?

68
00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:06.636
"Happy Everyday!" -A scream?

69
00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:07.836
Really?

70
00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:10.636
Yeah. It was yesterday...

71
00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:14.436
I think it was a bit earlier than today.

72
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.436
It got quiet right away,

73
00:06:19.436 --> 00:06:22.536
so I didn't really worry about it.

74
00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:25.636
Did you see the wife back then?

75
00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.736
Nope.

76
00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:31.236
Come to think of it, I haven't seen her recently.

77
00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:34.236
Did something happen to her?

78
00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:36.336
No, not really.

79
00:06:40.136 --> 00:06:43.736
The husband killed his wife after all.

80
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.736
The scream was when it happened...

81
00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:49.436
Okay! Let's go get him ourselves, then!

82
00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:51.136
But...

83
00:06:51.136 --> 00:06:53.436
He's a killer, you know?

84
00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:56.236
Do you think we can handle him ourselves?

85
00:06:57.336 --> 00:06:58.736
Hey!

86
00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.936
So, is this the house?

87
00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:01.936
Conan!

88
00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:03.036
Haibara!

89
00:07:03.036 --> 00:07:05.036
So, you came after all!

90
00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:07.236
I just coincidentally passed by.

91
00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:10.236
Me too, I just happened to be heading over to the bookstore.

92
00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:14.336
I thought the bookstore was in the opposite direction?

93
00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:15.336
-Never mind that, -Never mind that,

94
00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.036
-we've got trouble! -we've got trouble!

95
00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:26.836
That's the story!

96
00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:28.636
What do you think, Conan?

97
00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:30.536
Convinced, right?

98
00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:35.136
No, I wonder.

99
00:07:35.136 --> 00:07:38.136
Why? We even found traces of blood, you know!

100
00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:41.436
But, that doesn't mean that she was killed.

101
00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:43.536
She could've just gotten hurt.

102
00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:44.936
Same with the scream.

103
00:07:44.936 --> 00:07:47.036
Just because you heard a scream,

104
00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:49.736
it's too early to determine that something had happened.

105
00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:50.736
As for the wife's shoes,

106
00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:54.136
I'm sure they're just put away in the shoes cabinet.

107
00:07:55.236 --> 00:07:59.036
So, the sun's starting to set, it's about time we...

108
00:08:06.036 --> 00:08:08.836
What's with him? What a way to drive!

109
00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:12.136
It's going into that house.

110
00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:14.636
Hey!

111
00:08:14.636 --> 00:08:15.736
Geez...

112
00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:22.236
You guys, enough already.

113
00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.336
I'm sorry,

114
00:08:25.336 --> 00:08:27.036
I'm late.

115
00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:33.036
Where's Yuri?

116
00:08:33.036 --> 00:08:35.536
Oh... At Yamanonaka(in the mountains).

117
00:08:37.436 --> 00:08:38.436
Who's Yuri?

118
00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:40.336
His wife's name.

119
00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:44.336
What's the matter?

120
00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:46.236
Didn't you see some strange kids?

121
00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:48.936
Kids? No?

122
00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:51.836
Oh... Okay.

123
00:08:51.836 --> 00:08:55.136
Hey, let's hurry and go. I'm hungry.

124
00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:12.036
Edogawa...

125
00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:16.636
Yeah... Maybe we've got to think the whole thing over...

126
00:09:16.636 --> 00:09:20.836
-Which means... -But, we can't conclude we've got a case yet.

127
00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:24.336
It'll be a different story if we find the corpse of the wife

128
00:09:24.336 --> 00:09:26.036
or some solid evidence.

129
00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:28.936
Then, let's find it!

130
00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:32.036
It's time for the Youth Detective Squad to display how competent we are!

131
00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:34.336
But, how do you plan to find it?

132
00:09:35.436 --> 00:09:36.536
Well...

133
00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:40.436
Ayumi?

134
00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:49.436
This is the key to the backdoor.

135
00:09:49.436 --> 00:09:51.836
We can get into the house with this.

136
00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:53.136
But, how do you know?

137
00:09:53.136 --> 00:09:54.536
Never mind, let's go in.

138
00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:57.036
We better hurry or they'll come home.

139
00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:58.936
Hold it.

140
00:09:58.936 --> 00:10:00.136
What is it, Conan?

141
00:10:00.136 --> 00:10:01.536
I told you, didn't I?

142
00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:04.136
It hasn't been concluded to be a case.

143
00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:05.236
If we go in just like that,

144
00:10:05.236 --> 00:10:07.136
we'll be committing a crime.

145
00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:09.036
Just what're you talking about at this point!

146
00:10:09.036 --> 00:10:11.236
I'm sure he did it!

147
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:12.836
If so, the more so.

148
00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:14.436
It's too dangerous.

149
00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:17.936
I agree with Edogawa.

150
00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:20.436
I don't want to die here.

151
00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:21.836
Oh, no...

152
00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:23.936
What shall we do, Mitsuhiko?

153
00:10:25.436 --> 00:10:27.636
Hold on! Just what do you think you're doing?

154
00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:29.236
You can all go on home.

155
00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.436
I'll search for her alone.

156
00:10:33.836 --> 00:10:35.036
Ayumi...

157
00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:36.636
Why do you insist as much as you do?

158
00:10:38.936 --> 00:10:42.136
Until recently...

159
00:10:42.136 --> 00:10:44.336
I've been good friends with Yuri, his wife.

160
00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:45.536
Yuri...

161
00:10:45.536 --> 00:10:49.836
She cared for me as if I were her own child.

162
00:10:50.936 --> 00:10:54.336
"Pansy" -I've been coming over a lot to play to this house...

163
00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:57.836
That's why you knew where the spare key is?

164
00:10:57.836 --> 00:10:59.136
Yes.

165
00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.936
But from about six months ago,

166
00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:05.436
Yuri suddenly started to avoid me.

167
00:11:07.136 --> 00:11:10.736
I'm sure she had her reasons.

168
00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:14.836
But, I couldn't do anything for her.

169
00:11:14.836 --> 00:11:16.236
That's why...

170
00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:19.836
-Conan. -Conan.

171
00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:23.036
Okay.

172
00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:27.036
Oh, boy. Don't blame me for what happens.

173
00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:40.336
How're things there, Haibara?

174
00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:43.236
Everything's fine for now.

175
00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:44.236
If anything comes up...

176
00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.736
Let you know immediately. Right?

177
00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:47.936
Thanks.

178
00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:57.436
This must be the bedroom.

179
00:11:57.436 --> 00:12:00.436
See, his wife's not here.

180
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.836
What's up, both of you?

181
00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:19.636
Come on, it's just a doll.

182
00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:20.836
What was that?

183
00:12:20.836 --> 00:12:24.436
They don't have a child, do they?

184
00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:27.436
And yet why is there a doll here?

185
00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:30.636
I never saw that doll before.

186
00:12:37.536 --> 00:12:39.836
Hey, Conan.

187
00:12:39.836 --> 00:12:41.336
What's the matter, Genta?

188
00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:42.936
Don't tell me that this is...

189
00:12:42.936 --> 00:12:44.536
Blood?

190
00:12:48.736 --> 00:12:50.736
He's back!

191
00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:51.836
Hurry!

192
00:12:54.136 --> 00:12:55.836
This is bad! Turn off your lights!

193
00:12:58.136 --> 00:12:59.736
What're you doing, Genta?

194
00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:13.236
He's headed that way!

195
00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:16.236
"Incoming Call"

196
00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:18.436
It's Yuri's cell phone.

197
00:13:18.436 --> 00:13:21.836
No! Forget it, Ayumi!

198
00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:23.036
Darn!

199
00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:26.336
He's already at the front door!

200
00:13:26.336 --> 00:13:27.436
Hurry!

201
00:13:28.936 --> 00:13:30.036
Ayumi, this way...

202
00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:42.336
This is bad. He's coming this way!

203
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.570
That Genta!

204
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.170
Is somebody here?

205
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.470
"Incoming Call"

206
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.570
Where are Edogawa and Ayumi?

207
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.470
They're still inside!

208
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.570
Don't worry, I've got an idea!

209
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.670
Yes... Who is it?

210
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.870
-Hey! -Now!

211
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.970
This way!

212
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.070
Hurry!

213
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.270
Is somebody there?

214
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.370
My Youth Detective Squad badge?

215
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.670
Where's Ayumi?

216
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.270
Found it!

217
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.870
This is bad!

218
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:05.970
Darn it!

219
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.070
"Shinjuku 301, 82-10"

220
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.570
Hey, what's happening anyway?

221
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.770
Ayumi's been kidnapped!

222
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.870
I'm going to go after him!

223
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.570
-This is... -Terrible.

224
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.370
Don't tell me it's Ayumi's...

225
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.170
Just what're you talking about, Mitsuhiko!

226
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.470
But, look at this...

227
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.270
Wrong.

228
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.270
This blood is already dry.

229
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.970
It's not Yoshida's blood.

230
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.170
It's probably his wife's blood.

231
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.470
I think Yoshida was kidnapped because she saw this.

232
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.570
Which means...

233
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.970
Yes. Yoshida's in danger!

234
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.870
Did you hear me, Edogawa?

235
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.870
Yeah, you guys call the police!

236
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.070
I'll rescue Ayumi, no matter what!

237
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.070
I...

238
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.070
Darn...

239
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.370
Ayumi!

240
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.070
Don't come!

241
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.270
Ayumi!

242
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.570
Conan!

243
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.470
Help! Conan!

244
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.870
Get down! Ayumi!

245
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.870
Conan.

246
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.670
Are you hurt?

247
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.570
Oh, it's no big deal.

248
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.470
I'm sorry... All because of me...

249
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.570
What?

250
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.270
Thanks to you we were able to nab the killer...

251
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.270
Are you all right, Mr. Makabe?

252
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.070
Are you the one?

253
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.070
Who passed out at Mr. Makabe's house?

254
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.670
I got a call from Mr. Makabe a while ago,

255
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.170
that there's a girl who's passed out in his house,

256
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.970
so to please take a look at her right away.

257
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.970
"Yamanonaka (In the mountains) Clinic"

258
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.670
So by "in the mountains," he meant...

259
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.570
Are you all right?

260
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.670
Yeah. More importantly...

261
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.070
Ayumi?

262
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.570
Yuri?

263
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.670
"Yamanonaka Clnic"

264
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.470
-We're sorry! -We're sorry!

265
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.770
It's okay.

266
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.170
Your kick was a bit violent, though.

267
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.870
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.170
What a nuisance indeed!

269
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:35.970
To say that Yuri who was in the hospital to give birth was killed!

270
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.470
And on top of that, how dare you mistake me for my brother's lover?

271
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.070
Just why the heck do I have to end up

272
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.170
being the lover of somebody like him?

273
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.470
Hey...

274
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.670
But you were hugging each other and kissing.

275
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.670
Oh, that was just a greeting!

276
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.770
You mean this, right?

277
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.270
There's no such custom in Japan, you see.

278
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.370
It's understandable that they would make a mistake.

279
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.470
Yeah, but...

280
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.770
Cool it...

281
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.770
I'm sorry that I seemed to have scared all of you.

282
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.670
But why did you keep having the baby a secret?

283
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:23.570
Well, the fact is I miscarried some time ago.

284
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.770
Back then, I was really hurt

285
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.570
and caused everybody needless worry.

286
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.070
That's why this time I decided not to tell anyone

287
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.270
until the baby is born healthy.

288
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.570
So, my husband and I decided to do so.

289
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.570
Then your husband lied

290
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.170
and you suddenly stopped playing with Ayumi...

291
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.270
To hide the fact that you were pregnant until giving birth?

292
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.470
Yes.

293
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.370
I'm sorry I worried you, Ayumi.

294
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.370
I'm really sorry.

295
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.570
But, that day which was my due date,

296
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.270
I suddenly started bleeding...

297
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.270
So, the blood stain under the bed back then

298
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.370
was because you bled.

299
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.970
Yeah, it was in an inconspicuous place

300
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.370
and I was freaked out too.

301
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.970
I forgot to wipe it.

302
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.770
Then, the scream that the delivery milkman heard was also.

303
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.070
It's most likely what he heard back then.

304
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.970
And what I saw was...

305
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.070
Your husband desperately carrying you over to the car

306
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.570
after you fainted.

307
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.670
And yet I...

308
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.670
I'm really so very sorry.

309
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.470
Ayumi...

310
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.870
Here, carry the baby, will you?

311
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.070
How cute...

312
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.670
Come over anytime and keep me company, okay?

313
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.370
Is it okay? Because I...

314
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.370
It's okay.

315
00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.570
You're her older sister, aren't you?

316
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:06.970
Yes!

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.970

"Next Episode" -His wristwatch is broken and stopped at 11:50.

321
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.770
Sugiya, I think when I saw him this morning,

322
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.670
he was wearing leather shoes.

323
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.470
I didn't know he kept that picture.

324
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:09.670
Somebody must've cornered Mr. Kanbayashi over to the window and...

325
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.270
What was Mr. Kanbayashi doing here?

326
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.870
Standing on this window?

A couple who gets along with each other and is always together.

332
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.070
But, I hear that they were just putting on a front.
