1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.466
What seemed to be at first glance a simple request came in

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.666
through the newly opened website of the detective agency.

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.766
But the client send a text saying

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.766
he wanted to change the place of meeting,

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.966
Pops accompanied by Ran and I

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:18.266
and his disciple Amuro, set off to the designated place.

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.966
But the client doen't show up.

8
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.166
After that we returned to the agency,

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.666
where we were contacted again by the client

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.066
and got ready to leave, but...

11
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.766
Don't tell me that...

12
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.766
What?

13
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.166
It was thought that the man who came to the detective agency

14
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.766
and took the woman hostage, thinking he couldn't flee,

15
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.066
committed suicide by shooting himself.

16
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.166
After Kei finished undergoing interrogation,

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.366
we gave her a lift home.

18
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:59.066
There were a lot of wiretaps set up there.

19
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.566
As we continued to look for the wiretaps,

20
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.866
we find something under bed.

21
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.366
In the meantime, I tagged along with Kei

22
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.066
when she said she was going out shopping.

23
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:21.066
I almost end up drinking juice laced with sleep pills in the car.

24
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.866
But I saw through her scheme in the nick of time,

25
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.666
and found out her true identity too.

26
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.566
Her name is Serina Urakawa.

27
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.666
In order to avenge the death of her boyfriend,

28
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.266
Kenya Shono who was shot to death by the three bank robbers,

29
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.266
she had committed one murder after the other.

30
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.766
In the meantime, Pops and the others,

31
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.166
with the help of Amuro were getting close to the truth of the case.

32
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.866
Therefore, they were headed toward the remaining woman

33
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.766
who was thought to be one of the robbers.

34
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:53.166
Furthermore, Dr. Agasa and Ai who received contact from Ran,

35
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.766
come after us on Okiya's car.

36
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.266
Masumi, who was to join Ran and the others,

37
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.366
also sped along on her motorbike.

38
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.266
From here on, it's my imagination but...

39
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:08.166
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

40
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.366
you checked Kei's address

41
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.466
using Kenya's address book

42
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.366
and went to visit him, right?

43
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.366
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

44
00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.066
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in,

45
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.266
and you were greeted at the door

46
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.866
by a small framed man who was living with him.

47
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:28.266
Unluckily, you found his gun,

48
00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.866
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

49
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.666
he attacked you in order to silence you,

50
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.666
but was beaten to death by you instead.

51
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:43.266
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return

52
00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:44.866
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

53
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.466
being made in the living room.

54
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.266
So, afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

55
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.666
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

56
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.566
and set up wiretaps.

57
00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.766
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

58
00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:59.366
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

59
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:03.766
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

60
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.666
So he called the other robber

61
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:09.466
and suggested that they take the rest of the money and split.

62
00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.666
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

63
00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.566
he didn't know where the locker was.

64
00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:19.066
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

65
00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.766
So, Kei Kashizuka

66
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.166
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

67
00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:27.166
look for the locker!

68
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.466
That's why you tried to ambush Kei Kashitsuka

69
00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:30.966
at the detective agency

70
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:34.566
and get information out of him about the other partner.

71
00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:37.066
Is that right?

72
00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:41.466
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.866
I thought that I'd find out

74
00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:47.966
who that guy was talking with thanks to this phone's call history,

75
00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:52.066
but he was careful and erased it all.

76
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.866
In that case, we have no choice

77
00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:57.766
but to go see those three women that you called.

78
00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.866
Let's start with the closest one to us, Rinko Toyokita's flat.

79
00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:06.266
The vivid colored memories of summer

80
00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:06.997
solve mysteries all season round.

81
00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:10.924
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"

82
00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:17.224
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

83
00:06:17.224 --> 00:06:19.424
Yeah.

84
00:06:19.424 --> 00:06:22.124
What is it? What a nuisance.

85
00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:25.824
We moved to this apartment today.

86
00:06:25.824 --> 00:06:27.624
Right, Mom?

87
00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:30.824
This isn't much.

88
00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:32.124
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

89
00:06:32.124 --> 00:06:34.824
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

90
00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:37.824
and is normally asleep at this time...

91
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:40.324
so please be careful next time.

92
00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:41.324
Oh, wait.

93
00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:43.324
Something smells good.

94
00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:44.924
-It's omlette! -Hey.

95
00:06:44.924 --> 00:06:46.924
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

96
00:06:46.924 --> 00:06:48.924
Don't you ever come here again!

97
00:06:55.324 --> 00:06:57.924
I wonder if no one's home?

98
00:06:57.924 --> 00:06:59.224
Oh, my.

99
00:06:59.224 --> 00:07:03.024
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

100
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:06.124
We've come to say hello since we moved here.

101
00:07:06.124 --> 00:07:07.624
Oh, is that right?

102
00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:09.624
But, you don't have to do that

103
00:07:09.624 --> 00:07:12.924
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

104
00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:14.124
Why?

105
00:07:14.124 --> 00:07:16.624
I won the lottery.

106
00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:19.524
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

107
00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:23.224
Oh, that's right.

108
00:07:23.224 --> 00:07:26.424
I hate to trouble you but will you go throw this away for me?

109
00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:28.024
But, it seems that in this area,

110
00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:30.324
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

111
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:32.824
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

112
00:07:32.824 --> 00:07:34.724
Thanks for your help!

113
00:07:36.024 --> 00:07:39.024
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

114
00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:45.724
Yes, who is it?

115
00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:47.824
We just moved here today,

116
00:07:47.824 --> 00:07:49.524
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

117
00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:51.324
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:07:51.324 --> 00:07:54.124
I don't accept things like that.

119
00:07:54.124 --> 00:07:57.524
Hey, what do you do?

120
00:07:57.524 --> 00:07:58.624
I'm a writer.

121
00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:01.824
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

122
00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:06.124
All she eats are beef bowls.

123
00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:10.624
Oh, that's right, will you do me a favor?

124
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:14.124
Could it be that... you want me to take the trash out for you?

125
00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:18.024
So, how about it?

126
00:08:18.024 --> 00:08:20.324
Did you figure out who the robber is?

127
00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:21.924
Yep, of course.

128
00:08:21.924 --> 00:08:25.124
But, I can't tell you who it is.

129
00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:26.424
What do you mean?

130
00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:28.824
Why not?

131
00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:32.624
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

132
00:08:34.324 --> 00:08:38.124
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

133
00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:43.524
Were there any moves after that?

134
00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.324
Go left up ahead.

135
00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:51.524
It's about 5 kilometers straight.

136
00:08:51.524 --> 00:08:53.524
It seems they're moving

137
00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:55.724
but it seems that they walking judging from this speed.

138
00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:57.924
I see. If so,

139
00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.324
we'll probably catch up with them in about 10 minutes.

140
00:09:00.324 --> 00:09:04.024
I wonder what they're walking around for, though.

141
00:09:04.024 --> 00:09:05.024
I wonder.

142
00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:07.924
Since Conan's doing so,

143
00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:11.224
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.

144
00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.624
Ran.

145
00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.124
I don't think this would be of any comfort to you,

146
00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:27.224
but I don't think any danger will fall upon Conan just yet.

147
00:09:28.424 --> 00:09:32.524
If we don't heed the warning of the mail we got a while ago

148
00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:36.024
and decide to report this to the police,

149
00:09:36.024 --> 00:09:38.324
the culprit will need Conan as a hostage

150
00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:42.424
to get through the check point if there is any.

151
00:09:42.424 --> 00:09:48.324
But, if she's after killing the remaining robber,

152
00:09:48.324 --> 00:09:51.124
it may be that he is messed up in what she's about to do.

153
00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.224
Dad!

154
00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.724
Yes,

155
00:09:53.724 --> 00:09:57.624
that's why the fact that he's in a dangerous situation hasn't changed.

156
00:09:57.624 --> 00:09:59.024
Let's hurry.

157
00:10:09.124 --> 00:10:10.724
Don't be silly.

158
00:10:10.724 --> 00:10:12.724
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

159
00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:15.324
Saying you don't want me to die.

160
00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:19.824
Don't tell me that you think I'm planning to commit suicide

161
00:10:19.824 --> 00:10:22.124
after I kill the last of the bank robbers?

162
00:10:22.124 --> 00:10:24.224
Yep! Aren't you?

163
00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:28.324
I guess you thought so because you saw the sleeping pill case

164
00:10:28.324 --> 00:10:30.324
in the pocket of my coat.

165
00:10:30.324 --> 00:10:33.724
I had it on me because I find it difficult to fall asleep recently.

166
00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:37.324
It's a very small amount, and I could never die using that amount.

167
00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:41.424
It came in handy to use on you when I kidnapped you, so I used it.

168
00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:45.024
Although you figured it out and didn't fall asleep.

169
00:10:45.024 --> 00:10:49.524
See? Your crimes are too full of holes.

170
00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.924
The same goes for those sleeping pills.

171
00:10:51.924 --> 00:10:54.724
And the first man that you killed too.

172
00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:58.024
You did okay to the point where you hid him in the suitcase.

173
00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:00.024
But to hide the wiretap together with the corpse

174
00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:01.324
was not a good idea.

175
00:11:01.324 --> 00:11:06.024
You probably wanted to hear Kei Kashizuki scream in terror

176
00:11:06.024 --> 00:11:08.824
at finding the corpse

177
00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:11.824
but what you did, was like telling everybody

178
00:11:11.824 --> 00:11:13.324
you wiretapped the entire room.

179
00:11:13.324 --> 00:11:15.524
So, people would get wary on the contrary.

180
00:11:15.524 --> 00:11:17.024
Moreover, you were careless enough

181
00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:20.624
to leave the gun that you struck and killed the man with,

182
00:11:20.624 --> 00:11:25.824
that had its grip stained with blood inside the dashboard of your car.

183
00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:29.024
With the other gun.

184
00:11:29.024 --> 00:11:31.924
If you include the gun that you used to kill Kei Kashizuka

185
00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.424
at the detective agency,

186
00:11:33.424 --> 00:11:36.124
it would total three guns.

187
00:11:36.124 --> 00:11:38.624
Those guns that were used in the bank robbery,

188
00:11:38.624 --> 00:11:40.924
you found them in Kei Kashizuka's room

189
00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:43.224
and brought them with you, right?

190
00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:44.997
After you killed Kei Kashizuka,

191
00:11:44.997 --> 00:11:45.575
When people try to go over something,

192
00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.975
the first step is taken by the dominant foot,

193
00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:50.975
and most people have the same dominant hand and foot.

194
00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:53.375
She was holding the roll of masking tape with her right hand

195
00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.775
and pulling the tape out with her left.

196
00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:57.375
When the other robber fired the gun,

197
00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:00.275
the hand that she stretched over to her mouth was also her left hand.

198
00:12:00.275 --> 00:12:02.175
People try to calm themselves down

199
00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:05.375
by touching their faces when they are flustered

200
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.275
but the hand that they use unconsciously is their dominant one.

201
00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:11.075
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

202
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:13.875
by holding the gun with her right hand.

203
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.475
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

204
00:12:16.475 --> 00:12:18.375
Left-handed?

205
00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:24.175
Then, the culprit is...

206
00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:31.575
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

207
00:14:31.575 --> 00:14:34.275
by holding the gun with her right hand.

208
00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:37.175
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

209
00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.875
Left-handed?

210
00:14:41.475 --> 00:14:43.375
Then, the culprit

211
00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:46.475
is the first one we visited, Ms. Toyokita?

212
00:14:46.475 --> 00:14:49.475
She opened the door with her left-hand.

213
00:14:50.475 --> 00:14:52.875
If a door opens in that way,

214
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:56.075
there are times when a right-handed person would use her left hand.

215
00:14:56.075 --> 00:14:57.075
If the right hand is used,

216
00:14:57.075 --> 00:14:59.975
the hand would come in front of the body and would be in the way, you see.

217
00:14:59.975 --> 00:15:04.175
She would have to answer the visitor with her body faced sideways.

218
00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:08.575
In the first place, she's right handed.

219
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.675
The handle of the cup that was on the table

220
00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:13.175
was positioned for a right handed person when viewed from the chair.

221
00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:15.075
The handle of the frying pan was on the left

222
00:15:15.075 --> 00:15:16.975
and the spatula was on the right,

223
00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:19.075
which means she was cooking with her right hand.

224
00:15:19.075 --> 00:15:21.175
If the butter knife isn't used with the right hand,

225
00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:24.675
the butter wouldn't stick to the left side of the blade either.

226
00:15:24.675 --> 00:15:27.475
As for the second woman, Ms. Furuya, she's also right handed.

227
00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:30.975
Because she unlocked the door with her right hand.

228
00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:36.075
If so, the third person called Ms. Tegawa is...

229
00:15:36.075 --> 00:15:40.775
Yep! The handle of the cup on the table faced left.

230
00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:42.975
The memo pad was to the left of the telephone,

231
00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.875
and this means that she takes notes using her left hand.

232
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.875
The lamp was on the right of the desk

233
00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:51.375
so that her left hand wouldn't cause a shade when writing.

234
00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.075
The pen and side table were also on the left.

235
00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:56.575
Besides, she...

236
00:15:56.575 --> 00:15:58.975
In order to get rid of us right away,

237
00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:01.975
said that she was a writer pressed for deadline.

238
00:16:01.975 --> 00:16:04.575
But no matter how many times you tried calling her,

239
00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:07.575
her cell phone was switched off, wasn't it?

240
00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:10.275
No matter if she has a house phone.

241
00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:12.175
There's no way that a writer pressed for deadline

242
00:16:12.175 --> 00:16:14.575
would have her cell phone switched off.

243
00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:17.175
She found out that the man had died

244
00:16:17.175 --> 00:16:19.775
at the Mouri Detective Agency through the news

245
00:16:19.775 --> 00:16:23.675
and thought that Mouri had found out

246
00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:26.675
that Mr. Kei Kashizuka was a bank robber.

247
00:16:26.675 --> 00:16:29.175
So, afraid that the police would call her

248
00:16:29.175 --> 00:16:32.875
after finding her number from his cell phone contacts,

249
00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.375
she switched it off.

250
00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:37.875
That's right. I forgot to mention it,

251
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.775
but the main reason I figured that Kei Kashizuka

252
00:16:39.775 --> 00:16:41.675
was one of the bank robbers

253
00:16:41.675 --> 00:16:45.575
was the large amount of loose change and bills he had on him.

254
00:16:45.575 --> 00:16:47.275
5000 yen in loose change

255
00:16:47.275 --> 00:16:49.475
and 47 1000 yen bills

256
00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:51.875
is just too much for a person to be holding.

257
00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:57.175
That was because the serial number of the bills was known by the police.

258
00:16:57.175 --> 00:16:59.275
So, he shopped for a lot of cheap things

259
00:16:59.275 --> 00:17:02.875
and changed the 10,000 yens in question.

260
00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:05.775
That's the same reason Ms. Tegawa brought home a lot of beef bowl take-outs

261
00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.375
and ate only that.

262
00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.675
Moreover, the meal ticket vending machine at the beef bowl shop,

263
00:17:09.675 --> 00:17:12.575
takes 10,000 yen bills.

264
00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:16.075
If she buys take-outs, she doesn't have to stay back at the shop,

265
00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:18.675
thus, won't have to risk her face being remembered.

266
00:17:18.675 --> 00:17:21.275
Unlike convenience stores and brand-name shops,

267
00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:24.675
a lot of those shops are not equipped with surveillance cameras.

268
00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:26.275
Choosing those kinds of shops,

269
00:17:26.275 --> 00:17:30.675
even if they were to find out that the bills in question were used there,

270
00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.275
no images would be recorded.

271
00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:34.275
How about it?

272
00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:37.675
Are you convinced and willing to turn yourself in?

273
00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:40.975
Yes, I guess so.

274
00:17:40.975 --> 00:17:43.075
Out of respect for your deduction,

275
00:17:43.075 --> 00:17:45.775
I guess I'll go to the police.

276
00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:50.375
But your deduction just one part is wrong.

277
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:54.875
I only took two guns from the room of the man called Kei Kashizuka.

278
00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:58.975
The other one is a model gun that looks real

279
00:17:58.975 --> 00:18:01.475
that I got for self-protection from a gun mania friend of mine.

280
00:18:01.475 --> 00:18:03.475
Of course, there are no bullets for it.

281
00:18:03.475 --> 00:18:07.575
If so, where's the other real gun?

282
00:18:10.775 --> 00:18:15.975
You know too much, so I can't possibly let you go at this point.

283
00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:17.975
It was you after all.

284
00:18:19.675 --> 00:18:20.975
Just a little while more.

285
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:25.075
They're around the corner to the right, a little way up ahead.

286
00:18:25.075 --> 00:18:26.175
Okay.

287
00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:28.975
At any rate, let's tell Ran of this.

288
00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:31.875
I don't think so just yet.

289
00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:35.675
We don't know what condition Conan is in yet.

290
00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:37.475
I don't want to think of the worst,

291
00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:42.275
but I don't want to give her false hope.

292
00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:43.375
Oh no...

293
00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:47.075
Let's contact her after we get a hold of the situation ourselves first.

294
00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:48.275
Okay.

295
00:18:48.275 --> 00:18:51.675
And just in case, I'd like to warn you too that.

296
00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:55.275
Even if you find the car that he is riding or the car itself,

297
00:18:55.275 --> 00:18:57.675
don't do anything rash.

298
00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:01.775
Because by doing so, you may put his life in danger.

299
00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:03.775
I know!

300
00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:06.075
I'm not a child, you know!

301
00:19:06.075 --> 00:19:08.375
True.

302
00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.775
Come on, hurry and get this car going!

303
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.575
I'll take you to a nice place where there's nobody around!

304
00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:17.775
I didn't realize she was following us.

305
00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:21.575
Damn! My left hand is blocked and I can't fire my tranquilizer gun!

306
00:19:21.575 --> 00:19:25.175
Go on! Quit dilly-dallying.

307
00:19:27.175 --> 00:19:30.475
Did you just hear what sounded like a gun shot?

308
00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:34.075
It's that car!

309
00:19:34.075 --> 00:19:36.675
Conan's in that car.

310
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:40.675
Then, please contact Mr. Mouri about this.

311
00:19:40.675 --> 00:19:42.275
Not the police?

312
00:19:42.275 --> 00:19:43.575
They're the only ones

313
00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:47.175
who can accurately report what happened to the police.

314
00:19:47.175 --> 00:19:49.175
If they give the model, color and license plate number of the car,

315
00:19:49.175 --> 00:19:50.375
and ask the police to set up a checkpoint,

316
00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:52.375
we can stop them.

317
00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:54.775
But, what if she uses the hostage

318
00:19:54.775 --> 00:19:56.475
to bust through the checkpoint.

319
00:19:56.475 --> 00:19:58.175
If that should happen...

320
00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:04.775
If that should happen, we'll stop them by force.

321
00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:07.975
What?

322
00:20:07.975 --> 00:20:12.375
The car with the brat inside is headed up north along Ooishi Highway?

323
00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:14.875
Ooishi Highway, isn't it this road?

324
00:20:14.875 --> 00:20:16.875
And, what kind of car is it?

325
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:20.875
A blue compact car. The license plate number is?

326
00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.475
A blue compact car...

327
00:20:22.475 --> 00:20:23.975
Hang on!

328
00:20:33.575 --> 00:20:35.175
You rat!

329
00:20:46.275 --> 00:20:47.775
What?

330
00:20:47.775 --> 00:20:50.475
What is this feeling?

331
00:20:50.475 --> 00:20:52.075
Something is...

332
00:20:52.075 --> 00:20:54.275
It feels like something is closing in.

333
00:20:55.275 --> 00:20:58.075
Don't make that face.

334
00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:02.275
I won't let them get away.

335
00:21:02.275 --> 00:21:04.875
Doc, grab the wheel.

336
00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:07.775
The wheel? What?

337
00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:10.175
Subaru, just what're you up to?

338
00:21:23.975 --> 00:21:28.875
Mouri Sensei, please keep that seatbelt on the right fastened as is please.

339
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.575
Ran, please unfasten your seatbelt and come here.

340
00:21:32.575 --> 00:21:35.875
What? Unfasten it?

341
00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:40.275
Hey. What the hell?

342
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:54.175
What's with you guys?

343
00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:59.775
Go for it!

344
00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:04.875
What?

345
00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.875
I'm glad! You're okay!

346
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:09.975
How come she's here?

347
00:22:09.975 --> 00:22:12.375
Conan!

348
00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.375
How come they're here?

349
00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:26.975
Really now...

350
00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:28.875
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:56.675
I guess you've gained a bit of their trust, but...

352
00:23:56.675 --> 00:24:00.775
You'll keep your word with me, won't you?

353
00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:05.175
Bourbon.
