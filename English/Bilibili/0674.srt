1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,466
What seemed to be at first glance a simple request came in

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:07,666
through the newly opened website of the detective agency.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,766
But the client send a text saying

4
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,766
he wanted to change the place of meeting,

5
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:13,966
Pops accompanied by Ran and I

6
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:18,266
and his disciple Amuro, set off to the designated place.

7
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,966
But the client doen't show up.

8
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:23,166
After that we returned to the agency,

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
where we were contacted again by the client

10
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,066
and got ready to leave, but...

11
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,766
Don't tell me that...

12
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,766
What?

13
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,166
It was thought that the man who came to the detective agency

14
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,766
and took the woman hostage, thinking he couldn't flee,

15
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:51,066
committed suicide by shooting himself.

16
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,166
After Kei finished undergoing interrogation,

17
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,366
we gave her a lift home.

18
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:59,066
There were a lot of wiretaps set up there.

19
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,566
As we continued to look for the wiretaps,

20
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,866
we find something under bed.

21
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:14,366
In the meantime, I tagged along with Kei

22
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,066
when she said she was going out shopping.

23
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:21,066
I almost end up drinking juice laced with sleep pills in the car.

24
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,866
But I saw through her scheme in the nick of time,

25
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,666
and found out her true identity too.

26
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:29,566
Her name is Serina Urakawa.

27
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,666
In order to avenge the death of her boyfriend,

28
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,266
Kenya Shono who was shot to death by the three bank robbers,

29
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:38,266
she had committed one murder after the other.

30
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,766
In the meantime, Pops and the others,

31
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,166
with the help of Amuro were getting close to the truth of the case.

32
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,866
Therefore, they were headed toward the remaining woman

33
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:48,766
who was thought to be one of the robbers.

34
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:53,166
Furthermore, Dr. Agasa and Ai who received contact from Ran,

35
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,766
come after us on Okiya's car.

36
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,266
Masumi, who was to join Ran and the others,

37
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,366
also sped along on her motorbike.

38
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,266
From here on, it's my imagination but...

39
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:08,166
First of all, using the name Kei that Kenya mumbled,

40
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,366
you checked Kei's address

41
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,466
using Kenya's address book

42
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,366
and went to visit him, right?

43
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,366
You probably said something like, you came to pick up what Kenya forgot.

44
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:22,066
But Kei Kashizuka wasn't in,

45
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,266
and you were greeted at the door

46
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,866
by a small framed man who was living with him.

47
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,266
Unluckily, you found his gun,

48
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,866
and since he thought that you found out that he was a bank robber,

49
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:34,666
he attacked you in order to silence you,

50
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,666
but was beaten to death by you instead.

51
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:43,266
You were planning to wait for Kei Kashizuka to return

52
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,866
but you noticed that there were preparations for a party

53
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,466
being made in the living room.

54
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,266
So, afraid that a lot of his friends may be showing up.

55
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,666
You decided to hide the man's body in a suitcase

56
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,566
and set up wiretaps.

57
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,766
But Kei Kashizuka, even after the party

58
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,366
didn't notice that there was a corpse,

59
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:03,766
and thought that the small framed man fled from fright.

60
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,666
So he called the other robber

61
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:09,466
and suggested that they take the rest of the money and split.

62
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,666
Although he had the key to the locker where the money was stashed,

63
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,566
he didn't know where the locker was.

64
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:19,066
Only the small framed man knew where it was located.

65
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,766
So, Kei Kashizuka

66
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,166
decided to have the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri

67
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,166
look for the locker!

68
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,466
That's why you tried to ambush Kei Kashitsuka

69
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,966
at the detective agency

70
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:34,566
and get information out of him about the other partner.

71
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,066
Is that right?

72
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,466
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,866
I thought that I'd find out

74
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:47,966
who that guy was talking with thanks to this phone's call history,

75
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:52,066
but he was careful and erased it all.

76
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,866
In that case, we have no choice

77
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,766
but to go see those three women that you called.

78
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:01,866
Let's start with the closest one to us, Rinko Toyokita's flat.

79
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,266
The vivid colored memories of summer

80
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:06,997
solve mysteries all season round.

81
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:43,803
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Bourbon)"

82
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,101
Listen, Serina. Do just as I tell you, okay?

83
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,311
Yeah.

84
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,980
What is it? What a nuisance.

85
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,693
We moved to this apartment today.

86
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,486
Right, Mom?

87
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:03,698
This isn't much.

88
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:04,990
"Toyokita Rinko (27)" -Oh, really?

89
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,702
I work the midnight shift at the convenience store,

90
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,705
and is normally asleep at this time...

91
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,207
so please be careful next time.

92
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,208
Oh, wait.

93
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,210
Something smells good.

94
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,795
-It's omlette! -Hey.

95
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,797
-You brat! -It looks really delicious!

96
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:21,799
Don't you ever come here again!

97
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,808
I wonder if no one's home?

98
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,101
Oh, my.

99
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,896
"Furuya Sakae (31)" -What do you want with my room?

100
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:38,983
We've come to say hello since we moved here.

101
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,484
Oh, is that right?

102
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,486
But, you don't have to do that

103
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,781
because I'm moving out of here tomorrow.

104
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:46,991
Why?

105
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,493
I won the lottery.

106
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:52,371
So, I'm buying up stuff today too.

107
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,083
Oh, that's right.

108
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,295
I hate to trouble you but will you go throw this away for me?

109
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:00,880
But, it seems that in this area,

110
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,174
the day to throw the trash out is day after tomorrow.

111
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:05,676
But, I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

112
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,595
Thanks for your help!

113
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:11,891
It's full of lunch boxes bought from the convenience store.

114
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:18,606
Yes, who is it?

115
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,691
We just moved here today,

116
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:22,401
and if it's okay with you, we brought this as a gift.

117
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,195
"Tegawa Takayo (29)" -Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:26,989
I don't accept things like that.

119
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:30,409
Hey, what do you do?

120
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,494
I'm a writer.

121
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:34,705
It's just before deadline, and I'm having a tough time.

122
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:39,001
All she eats are beef bowls.

123
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:43,506
Oh, that's right, will you do me a favor?

124
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:47,009
Could it be that... you want me to take the trash out for you?

125
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:50,888
So, how about it?

126
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,182
Did you figure out who the robber is?

127
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:54,809
Yep, of course.

128
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,978
But, I can't tell you who it is.

129
00:06:57,978 --> 00:06:59,271
What do you mean?

130
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:01,690
Why not?

131
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,486
Because I don't want anyone else to die.

132
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:10,991
Ms. Urakawa, I mean you.

133
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,372
Were there any moves after that?

134
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:19,208
Go left up ahead.

135
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:24,380
It's about 5 kilometers straight.

136
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,382
It seems they're moving

137
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,592
but it seems that they walking judging from this speed.

138
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:30,803
I see. If so,

139
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:33,180
we'll probably catch up with them in about 10 minutes.

140
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,892
I wonder what they're walking around for, though.

141
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:37,893
I wonder.

142
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:40,771
Since Conan's doing so,

143
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:44,108
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.

144
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,490
Ran.

145
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,994
I don't think this would be of any comfort to you,

146
00:07:54,994 --> 00:08:00,082
but I don't think any danger will fall upon Conan just yet.

147
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:05,379
If we don't heed the warning of the mail we got a while ago

148
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,883
and decide to report this to the police,

149
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,176
the culprit will need Conan as a hostage

150
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:15,306
to get through the check point if there is any.

151
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:21,186
But, if she's after killing the remaining robber,

152
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,981
it may be that he is messed up in what she's about to do.

153
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,107
Dad!

154
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,609
Yes,

155
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:30,487
that's why the fact that he's in a dangerous situation hasn't changed.

156
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:31,906
Let's hurry.

157
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,584
Don't be silly.

158
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,586
Just what're you talking about, sonny?

159
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:48,172
Saying you don't want me to die.

160
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:52,676
Don't tell me that you think I'm planning to commit suicide

161
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:54,970
after I kill the last of the bank robbers?

162
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,097
Yep! Aren't you?

163
00:08:57,097 --> 00:09:01,185
I guess you thought so because you saw the sleeping pill case

164
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,187
in the pocket of my coat.

165
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:06,607
I had it on me because I find it difficult to fall asleep recently.

166
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:10,194
It's a very small amount, and I could never die using that amount.

167
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:14,281
It came in handy to use on you when I kidnapped you, so I used it.

168
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:17,910
Although you figured it out and didn't fall asleep.

169
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,373
See? Your crimes are too full of holes.

170
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,792
The same goes for those sleeping pills.

171
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,586
And the first man that you killed too.

172
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:30,881
You did okay to the point where you hid him in the suitcase.

173
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,883
But to hide the wiretap together with the corpse

174
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,176
was not a good idea.

175
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:38,889
You probably wanted to hear Kei Kashizuki scream in terror

176
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,684
at finding the corpse

177
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,687
but what you did, was like telling everybody

178
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,188
you wiretapped the entire room.

179
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:48,399
So, people would get wary on the contrary.

180
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,900
Moreover, you were careless enough

181
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,487
to leave the gun that you struck and killed the man with,

182
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:58,701
that had its grip stained with blood inside the dashboard of your car.

183
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,870
With the other gun.

184
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,790
If you include the gun that you used to kill Kei Kashizuka

185
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,291
at the detective agency,

186
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,003
it would total three guns.

187
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,505
Those guns that were used in the bank robbery,

188
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,799
you found them in Kei Kashizuka's room

189
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,093
and brought them with you, right?

190
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:17,886
After you killed Kei Kashizuka,

191
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:18,470
When people try to go over something,

192
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,848
the first step is taken by the dominant foot,

193
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:23,851
and most people have the same dominant hand and foot.

194
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:26,270
She was holding the roll of masking tape with her right hand

195
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,689
and pulling the tape out with her left.

196
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,274
When the other robber fired the gun,

197
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:33,152
the hand that she stretched over to her mouth was also her left hand.

198
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,070
People try to calm themselves down

199
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,282
by touching their faces when they are flustered

200
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:41,160
but the hand that they use unconsciously is their dominant one.

201
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,954
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

202
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:46,749
by holding the gun with her right hand.

203
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,376
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

204
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,253
Left-handed?

205
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,051
Then, the culprit is...

206
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:08,062
In other words, the culprit was trying to hide which hand was dominant

207
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,773
by holding the gun with her right hand.

208
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:13,650
But, in fact, she's left-handed!

209
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,360
Left-handed?

210
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,865
Then, the culprit

211
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,951
is the first one we visited, Ms. Toyokita?

212
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,954
She opened the door with her left-hand.

213
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,374
If a door opens in that way,

214
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:32,544
there are times when a right-handed person would use her left hand.

215
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:33,545
If the right hand is used,

216
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:36,465
the hand would come in front of the body and would be in the way, you see.

217
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:40,677
She would have to answer the visitor with her body faced sideways.

218
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:45,039
In the first place, she's right handed.

219
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,125
The handle of the cup that was on the table

220
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,627
was positioned for a right handed person when viewed from the chair.

221
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,546
The handle of the frying pan was on the left

222
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,423
and the spatula was on the right,

223
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:55,550
which means she was cooking with her right hand.

224
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,635
If the butter knife isn't used with the right hand,

225
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,139
the butter wouldn't stick to the left side of the blade either.

226
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,933
As for the second woman, Ms. Furuya, she's also right handed.

227
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,437
Because she unlocked the door with her right hand.

228
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,525
If so, the third person called Ms. Tegawa is...

229
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:17,238
Yep! The handle of the cup on the table faced left.

230
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,449
The memo pad was to the left of the telephone,

231
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,327
and this means that she takes notes using her left hand.

232
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,329
The lamp was on the right of the desk

233
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,832
so that her left hand wouldn't cause a shade when writing.

234
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,544
The pen and side table were also on the left.

235
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,046
Besides, she...

236
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,423
In order to get rid of us right away,

237
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:38,426
said that she was a writer pressed for deadline.

238
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,054
But no matter how many times you tried calling her,

239
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:44,057
her cell phone was switched off, wasn't it?

240
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,726
No matter if she has a house phone.

241
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,645
There's no way that a writer pressed for deadline

242
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,064
would have her cell phone switched off.

243
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:53,650
She found out that the man had died

244
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,236
at the Mouri Detective Agency through the news

245
00:12:56,236 --> 00:13:00,156
and thought that Mouri had found out

246
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:03,159
that Mr. Kei Kashizuka was a bank robber.

247
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,662
So, afraid that the police would call her

248
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:09,332
after finding her number from his cell phone contacts,

249
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,835
she switched it off.

250
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,337
That's right. I forgot to mention it,

251
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:16,256
but the main reason I figured that Kei Kashizuka

252
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:18,132
was one of the bank robbers

253
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:22,053
was the large amount of loose change and bills he had on him.

254
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,763
5000 yen in loose change

255
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,932
and 47 1000 yen bills

256
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:28,351
is just too much for a person to be holding.

257
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:33,648
That was because the serial number of the bills was known by the police.

258
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:35,733
So, he shopped for a lot of cheap things

259
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,362
and changed the 10,000 yens in question.

260
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:42,240
That's the same reason Ms. Tegawa brought home a lot of beef bowl take-outs

261
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,825
and ate only that.

262
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,160
Moreover, the meal ticket vending machine at the beef bowl shop,

263
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,038
takes 10,000 yen bills.

264
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,542
If she buys take-outs, she doesn't have to stay back at the shop,

265
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,128
thus, won't have to risk her face being remembered.

266
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,755
Unlike convenience stores and brand-name shops,

267
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:01,134
a lot of those shops are not equipped with surveillance cameras.

268
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,760
Choosing those kinds of shops,

269
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,140
even if they were to find out that the bills in question were used there,

270
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,726
no images would be recorded.

271
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:10,727
How about it?

272
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:14,147
Are you convinced and willing to turn yourself in?

273
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,442
Yes, I guess so.

274
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,527
Out of respect for your deduction,

275
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:22,238
I guess I'll go to the police.

276
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:26,826
But your deduction just one part is wrong.

277
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:31,331
I only took two guns from the room of the man called Kei Kashizuka.

278
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:35,460
The other one is a model gun that looks real

279
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,962
that I got for self-protection from a gun mania friend of mine.

280
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,923
Of course, there are no bullets for it.

281
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:44,052
If so, where's the other real gun?

282
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:52,435
You know too much, so I can't possibly let you go at this point.

283
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,437
It was you after all.

284
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,440
Just a little while more.

285
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,527
They're around the corner to the right, a little way up ahead.

286
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,654
Okay.

287
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:05,448
At any rate, let's tell Ran of this.

288
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,326
I don't think so just yet.

289
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:12,163
We don't know what condition Conan is in yet.

290
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,957
I don't want to think of the worst,

291
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:18,753
but I don't want to give her false hope.

292
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:19,837
Oh no...

293
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:23,549
Let's contact her after we get a hold of the situation ourselves first.

294
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,759
Okay.

295
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,137
And just in case, I'd like to warn you too that.

296
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:31,724
Even if you find the car that he is riding or the car itself,

297
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:34,143
don't do anything rash.

298
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,231
Because by doing so, you may put his life in danger.

299
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:40,233
I know!

300
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,527
I'm not a child, you know!

301
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,862
True.

302
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,240
Come on, hurry and get this car going!

303
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,035
I'll take you to a nice place where there's nobody around!

304
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,247
I didn't realize she was following us.

305
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:58,042
Damn! My left hand is blocked and I can't fire my tranquilizer gun!

306
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,629
Go on! Quit dilly-dallying.

307
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,926
Did you just hear what sounded like a gun shot?

308
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,555
It's that car!

309
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,141
Conan's in that car.

310
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:17,145
Then, please contact Mr. Mouri about this.

311
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,730
Not the police?

312
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,023
They're the only ones

313
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:23,651
who can accurately report what happened to the police.

314
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,653
If they give the model, color and license plate number of the car,

315
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:26,863
and ask the police to set up a checkpoint,

316
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:28,823
we can stop them.

317
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,242
But, what if she uses the hostage

318
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,952
to bust through the checkpoint.

319
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,662
If that should happen...

320
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:41,252
If that should happen, we'll stop them by force.

321
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,464
What?

322
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,843
The car with the brat inside is headed up north along Ooishi Highway?

323
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:51,345
Ooishi Highway, isn't it this road?

324
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,347
And, what kind of car is it?

325
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:57,351
A blue compact car. The license plate number is?

326
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,936
A blue compact car...

327
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,438
Hang on!

328
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,657
You rat!

329
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:24,253
What?

330
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,923
What is this feeling?

331
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,549
Something is...

332
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,760
It feels like something is closing in.

333
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,555
Don't make that face.

334
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,726
I won't let them get away.

335
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,354
Doc, grab the wheel.

336
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,232
The wheel? What?

337
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:46,651
Subaru, just what're you up to?

338
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:05,336
Mouri Sensei, please keep that seatbelt on the right fastened as is please.

339
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,048
Ran, please unfasten your seatbelt and come here.

340
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,343
What? Unfasten it?

341
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,722
Hey. What the hell?

342
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,653
What's with you guys?

343
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:36,242
Go for it!

344
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,330
What?

345
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,333
I'm glad! You're okay!

346
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,460
How come she's here?

347
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,838
Conan!

348
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:50,840
How come they're here?

349
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,436
Really now...

350
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,354
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,150
I guess you've gained a bit of their trust, but...

352
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,238
You'll keep your word with me, won't you?

353
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:41,659
Bourbon.
