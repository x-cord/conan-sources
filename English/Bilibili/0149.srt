1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,266
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,766
Today's trick is the bungee jump.

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:08,666
The case is solved with the courage to jump forward.

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,366
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,466
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,879
"The Amusement Park Bungee Jump"

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,779
"Nichiuri Amusement Park"

10
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,379
What's with this place, anyway?

11
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,079
You're the one who kept on saying

12
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,179
you wanted to come to an amusement park.

13
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:13,479
Yes, that's true.

14
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,379
This is an amusement park, Nichiuri Amusement Park.

15
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,279
Goodness. What I meant is an amusement spot like this.

16
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,079
Tropical Iand!

17
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,079
So, why do we end up here in Nichiuri Amusement Park?

18
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,379
What's the difference?

19
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,479
There are a lot of rides, too.

20
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,879
The contents is totally different.

21
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,879
Shut up, brat!

22
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,179
They have no attractions!

23
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,879
They do. That looks interesting.

24
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,479
Yaiba!

25
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,579
Yaiba Fight!

26
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,679
I'd like to watch a more sophisticated show!

27
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,679
A show is a show, what's the difference?

28
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:57,579
Anyway, you two go on. I'll be right back.

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,279
Huh?

30
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:05,679
How come you have a boat racing newspaper on you, Pops?

31
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:09,479
I wonder why that was in my pocket?

32
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,079
Dad.

33
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,779
Yaiba Kick!

34
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,579
Darn it! I'll get you for this, Yaiba!

35
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,779
Black!

36
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,879
Yaiba!

37
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,479
If it was me 10 years ago, I'd had really enjoyed it.

38
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,079
How lousy.

39
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,579
Hey, Conan.

40
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,779
Where's Pops?

41
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,679
See, over there.

42
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,679
Surprised? It's called Bungee Jump.

43
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:13,379
Gosh, that was startling.

44
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,779
It was super fantastic!

45
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,679
Conan, look over there.

46
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,379
Remember...

47
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:28,979
You better keep your word.

48
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,079
-What? -I told him...

49
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,979
that I'd go to the boat races with him if he bungee jumps.

50
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,679
I am scared.

51
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,779
But I'll do it!

52
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,379
Hey, mister, will you hurry up?

53
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,479
You're backing up traffic.

54
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,379
Hey, look out!

55
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,779
Are you going to be all right?

56
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,579
Maybe you'd better not try it.

57
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,779
No, I've got to do it.

58
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,979
I've got my reasons.

59
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,579
I thought Pops didn't like high places.

60
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,179
Is that so?

61
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,279
Just what do you think you're doing?

62
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,179
You've got your reasons, right?

63
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,379
There.

64
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,579
Will you please jump?

65
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,779
Shut up! It's up to me when I jump.

66
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,879
Masked Yaiba fled because he was afraid of me!

67
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,579
Now the world is ours, the Blackians!

68
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,014
Nevermind and just get out of the way, will you?

69
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,810
The victim is Yuta Hosono, age 28,

70
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,710
a member of HO Theater.

71
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,010
The rubber used when bungee jumping

72
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,310
during his performance as Yaiba

73
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,210
in the Masked Yaiba Show seems to have severed,

74
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,310
which lead him to drowned to death.

75
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,210
You're the one who set the rubber on the victim's feet?

76
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,310
"Akiyoshi Ishijima (25)" -Yes, I always do so.

77
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,510
Did you notice anything wrong with the rubber then?

78
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,810
If so, I wouldn't have made him jump.

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,610
Well, I guess so.

80
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,610
And you guys belong to the same acting team as Mr. Hosono, right?

81
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,510
"Shinpei Okubo (28)" -Yes, My name is Okubo.

82
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,610
I usually do onstage plays,

83
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,910
but that's not enough to make a living.

84
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,610
I see, that's why you're acting in the Yaiba Show.

85
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,710
So, Mr. Okubo is the bad guy.

86
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,110
And you are...

87
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,610
I am Kanako Harukawa acting as the Princess.

88
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,910
I'm Wataru Otake.

89
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,310
I do everything behind the scenes from sets

90
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,410
and special effects.

91
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,610
Special effects?

92
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,010
Special effects like exploding dynamite on stage and such.

93
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,710
And you?

94
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,810
"Seizou Fujita (40)" -I am Fujita,

95
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,210
the person in charge of the events

96
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,510
that are held at Nichiuri Land.

97
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,710
Huh?

98
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,010
Where is the person who was in the Yaiba costume

99
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,610
riding the roller coaster?

100
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,610
That's a doll.

101
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,310
We would actually like to hire and actor to do the part,

102
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,110
but we're short of hands now.

103
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,810
Why have we all been called here?

104
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,110
Hosono died of an accident, didn't he?

105
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,410
Well, as the investigation progressed,

106
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,910
it's starting to turn out that an accident is not the only possibility.

107
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,610
Yes.

108
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,810
This is apparently homicide!

109
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,710
And the killer is someone here!

110
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,310
There's got to be someone here

111
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,810
that has a grudge against Mr. Hosono.

112
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,910
Isn't that right, Mr. Ishijima?

113
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,110
Okubo argued with Hosono about the management of the the theater.

114
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,210
You're the one who borrowed money

115
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,410
from Hosono and were having problems!

116
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,510
Never mind about me!

117
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,210
Kanako was also upset

118
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,410
because Hosono kept asking her to go with him.

119
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,710
It just troubled me a bit!

120
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,610
Otake, you were pissed at Hosono, too.

121
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,310
Because he makes you run errands for him, weren't you?

122
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,910
Doesn't that go for all of you?

123
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,110
There was no trouble between Hosono and I.

124
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,910
Which means all of you

125
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,210
except Mr. Fujita have a motive to kill Mr. Hosono.

126
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,410
You're the one who killed Masked Yaiba, that is, Mr. Hosono!

127
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
You've got to be kidding!

128
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,610
Just because I operate the bungee jump,

129
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,510
is it my fault?

130
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,610
This rubber was severed because of the explosion.

131
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,810
You're the only one who can set an explosive onto his feet.

132
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,310
We can tell by looking at this.

133
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,310
What?

134
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,110
I borrowed this video tape

135
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,510
from someone who shot the scene of Yaiba diving.

136
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,410
I see. It could turn out to be evidence.

137
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,610
Let's take a look at it, Mouri.

138
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,510
Yes, I guess so.

139
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,010
I am sorry.

140
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,410
Stop!

141
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,810
This smoke is when the dynamite exploded.

142
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,810
It is most likely that

143
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,410
when the rubber was strapped to his feet

144
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,910
an explosive was rigged to his feet.

145
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,210
And after Yaiba jumped,

146
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,410
he pushed the switch of the explosive when the time came.

147
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,610
Why don't you admit it, Mr. Ishijima?

148
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,710
How can I admit something I didn't do?

149
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,610
What's the use resisting at this point?

150
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,810
Take a look at this.

151
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,110
See, right here

152
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,410
Doesn't it look like Yaiba is touching the rubber?

153
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,610
It does look that way.

154
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,410
How is it, Mouri? You were close by, aren't you?

155
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,010
Come to think of it,

156
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,810
Masked Yaiba did put his finger into the rubber.

157
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,310
Take a look at this, too.

158
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,110
Don't you notice something strange?

159
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,710
You're the one that's strange.

160
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,510
Although the fingers of his left hand are extended out,

161
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,110
the fingers of his right are grabbed into a fist?

162
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,810
Bull's eye!

163
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,210
Isn't that the way Yaiba poses?

164
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,710
No, this is the first time I've seen him posing like this.

165
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,610
Could it be that he was holding something in his right hand?

166
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,510
Something like a switch to set off explosives.

167
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,910
What?

168
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,010
That's suicide!

169
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,110
That's right, it is a suicide!

170
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,010
That's what Hosono did. Right?

171
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,210
That too, is a possible deduction.

172
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,210
Well, if you say so, Inspector.

173
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,010
No.

174
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,810
This is homicide.

175
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,710
Then, are you saying that the killer is Mr. Ishijima?

176
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,410
I am telling you I didn't do it!

177
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,410
Before we accuse anyone as being the killer,

178
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,710
let's check everybody's alibi.

179
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,410
First, Mr. Okubo.

180
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,010
I was acting as the Blackian on stage.

181
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,810
I was likewise on stage, acting as princess.

182
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,610
I was backstage and in charge of the fireworks.

183
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,710
Mr. Ishijima was on the gondola.

184
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,010
-Right. -What about you, Mr. Fujita?

185
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,610
I was here, putting my papers in order.

186
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,410
Can anyone testify that for you?

187
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,810
No, because I was alone.

188
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,910
I didn't mention it a while ago,

189
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,110
but you had trouble with Hosono too, didn't you?

190
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,310
What are you talking about?

191
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,510
In return for letting Hosono's acting team perform here,

192
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,210
you were getting commission, weren't you?

193
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,810
But Hosono didn't pay you the money, right?

194
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,910
Shut up!

195
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,410
Well, let's hear all of what Mouri has to say first.

196
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,510
As you already saw in the video,

197
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,710
there is a possibility that Masked Yaiba

198
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,910
set the explosive off himself.

199
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,310
Like I said, it's suicide.

200
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,210
No, even so, there still is a possibility of homicide.

201
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,510
If the person who was acting as Masked Yaiba

202
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,610
was not Mr. Hosono.

203
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,510
The killer probably waited until Mr. Hosono

204
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,310
was alone to attacked him,

205
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,810
and knocked him unconscious.

206
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,110
And while still wearing his costume,

207
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,310
the killer carried him to the river

208
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,310
and drowned him.

209
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,610
After that, the killer went over to the waiting room

210
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,210
and put on the extra Masked Yaiba outfit.

211
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,810
Then, he went on stage and acted as if he were Masked Yaiba himself.

212
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,410
The killer pretended to confirm the rubber strap

213
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,710
while on the gondola,

214
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,610
and after he stuck the explosive on,

215
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,010
he jumped!

216
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,910
He set the explosive off with the remote control switch

217
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,510
he was holding in his right hand.

218
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,110
The killer dove into the water

219
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,210
and swam to the back of the pump room,

220
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,910
changed costumes and went back to where everyone was.

221
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,710
But it's about 100 meters

222
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,310
from the position of the crane to the pump room.

223
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,410
A compact regulator was used.

224
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,910
That way, he can stay underwater for about 10 minutes.

225
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,210
Well? Can you point out any mistakes?

226
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,210
The one who killed Mr. Hosono

227
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,110
is you, Mr. Wataru Otake!

228
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,210
Ridiculous!

229
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,610
I was in charge of the explosives during the show, you know!

230
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,510
Did anyone see Mr. Otake around during the show?

231
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,510
-No, I didn't. -Neither did I.

232
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,910
Then, who took care of the explosives

233
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,410
that were used during the show?

234
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,610
The person that will answer that question

235
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,510
is a boy who is a fan of Masked Yaiba,

236
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,610
Tomohiro Takada.

237
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,910
Tell them, Tomohiro.

238
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,210
Okay.

239
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,010
I could tell right away

240
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,310
that the person who was wearing the Yaiba outfit

241
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,410
was not the usual person!

242
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,910
His movements were bad,

243
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,010
and his kick missed its target, too.

244
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,710
And besides, Yaiba always poses before an explosion.

245
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,810
He goes like this and like this!

246
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,710
That's his usual pose before the explosion.

247
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,310
Yes, but today it was different.

248
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,910
How?

249
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,210
The minute he placed his hand on his hip, it exploded.

250
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,110
He usually shouts Yaiba before the explosion.

251
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,910
Come to think of it, it was faster than usual.

252
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,110
I missed the timing a bit.

253
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,510
Besides...

254
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,610
Yaiba's pose was different from always.

255
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,010
Yaiba usually poses...

256
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,210
not by extending all the finger of his left hand straight,

257
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,510
but he points and the sky with his index finger!

258
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,610
It's different from the one on TV,

259
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,810
but he always poses that way at the show here.

260
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,910
When Yaiba came to our town,

261
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,110
it rained and the Yaiba Show was canceled.

262
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,310
So, he promised us this pose as a token of his apology.

263
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,510
In other words,

264
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,010
you remote controlled the explosion of the show

265
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,310
using the switch you had on your hips.

266
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,410
That's no proof!

267
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,610
The proof is on your body!

268
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,810
On your feet!

269
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,010
The burn marks from the explosives!

270
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,710
After all, you exploded something strong enough

271
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,310
to sever the super strong rubber used for bungee jumping.

272
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,810
-Excuse me. -No!

273
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,510
Wataru.

274
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,210
Let's go get some ice cream, Tomohiro.

275
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,910
That guy...

276
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,610
Hosono insisted that I could never handle the role of Masked Yaiba.

277
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,610
I can handle the movements of Masked Yaiba

278
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,310
just as good or better than you can, Hosono!

279
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,010
Don't think you can be Masked Yaiba just by looks.

280
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,810
You need certain qualifications to be a hero.

281
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,710
He had the nerve to squawk to me

282
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,510
about qualifications and what not's.

283
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,610
All it was is that he was jealous of me

284
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,210
and wanted to get rid of me!

285
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:38,210
He was probably referring to

286
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,310
is the qualifications of the "heart".

287
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,310
What?

288
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,610
It is impossible for a person with a heart like you,

289
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,910
who can't take the remarks of another

290
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,410
as meaning only evil to act out a hero.

291
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,810
Mr. Hosono's finger of his left hand which pointed at the sky

292
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,210
was a sign of friendship between Mr. Hosono and the children.

293
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,310
So, we didn't get to go after all.

294
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,810
I am going to go to Tropical Land next time with my boyfriend.

295
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,610
Boyfriend?

296
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,810
Don't tell me it's that detective brat?

297
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,710
Of course, it's not with Shinichi!

298
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,110
Then, who is it?

299
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,810
He's my boyfriend!

300
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,910
Well... well, I guess so.

301
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:19,110
"Next Episode"

302
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,010
Explosives were rigged to the car.

303
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,610
Explosives?

304
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,110
Just as I thought.

305
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,710
Huh? This person is...

306
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,610
Doesn't this look like that person?

307
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,210
Remember, the person who was driving the car

308
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,510
that overtook us on our way to Megumi's house.

309
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:41,431
Next Conan, "The Car Explosion Case (Part 1)"

310
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:44,512
Next Conan's Hint:

311
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,412
"Parking a car"

312
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:48,412
The next episode is full of surprises.
