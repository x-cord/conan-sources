1
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,194
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:07,904
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:09,698
Today's trick is the bungee jump.

4
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:11,574
The case is solved with the courage to jump forward.

5
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:13,285
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,370
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,664
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,722
"The Amusement Park Bungee Jump"

9
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,600
"Nichiuri Amusement Park"

10
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,230
What's with this place, anyway?

11
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,898
You're the one who kept on saying

12
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,026
you wanted to come to an amusement park.

13
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:16,319
Yes, that's true.

14
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,196
This is an amusement park, Nichiuri Amusement Park.

15
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:24,118
Goodness. What I meant is an amusement spot like this.

16
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:25,911
Tropical Iand!

17
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,914
So, why do we end up here in Nichiuri Amusement Park?

18
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:32,209
What's the difference?

19
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,295
There are a lot of rides, too.

20
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,713
The contents is totally different.

21
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,716
Shut up, brat!

22
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:41,010
They have no attractions!

23
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,721
They do. That looks interesting.

24
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,306
Yaiba!

25
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:49,393
Yaiba Fight!

26
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:53,522
I'd like to watch a more sophisticated show!

27
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,525
A show is a show, what's the difference?

28
00:02:56,525 --> 00:03:00,404
Anyway, you two go on. I'll be right back.

29
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,116
Huh?

30
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:08,496
How come you have a boat racing newspaper on you, Pops?

31
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:12,333
I wonder why that was in my pocket?

32
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:15,920
Dad.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,597
Yaiba Kick!

34
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,395
Darn it! I'll get you for this, Yaiba!

35
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,604
Black!

36
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,695
Yaiba!

37
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:46,325
If it was me 10 years ago, I'd had really enjoyed it.

38
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,910
How lousy.

39
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,415
Hey, Conan.

40
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,630
Where's Pops?

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,507
See, over there.

42
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:13,519
Surprised? It's called Bungee Jump.

43
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,230
Gosh, that was startling.

44
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:21,610
It was super fantastic!

45
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,529
Conan, look over there.

46
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:30,202
Remember...

47
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,829
You better keep your word.

48
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:33,914
-What? -I told him...

49
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:37,793
that I'd go to the boat races with him if he bungee jumps.

50
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,504
I am scared.

51
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,631
But I'll do it!

52
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:45,217
Hey, mister, will you hurry up?

53
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,303
You're backing up traffic.

54
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:56,228
Hey, look out!

55
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,606
Are you going to be all right?

56
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:01,400
Maybe you'd better not try it.

57
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,611
No, I've got to do it.

58
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,821
I've got my reasons.

59
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:09,408
I thought Pops didn't like high places.

60
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,035
Is that so?

61
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:15,122
Just what do you think you're doing?

62
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,999
You've got your reasons, right?

63
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,209
There.

64
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,426
Will you please jump?

65
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:30,596
Shut up! It's up to me when I jump.

66
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:36,727
Masked Yaiba fled because he was afraid of me!

67
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:40,397
Now the world is ours, the Blackians!

68
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,907
Nevermind and just get out of the way, will you?

69
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,119
I don't know what, but what a life saver.

70
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,915
Let's give them a great performance like always.

71
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:01,794
Yaiba are not going to come no matter how much you wait!

72
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,505
He fled leaving you behind!

73
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:06,507
There's no way!

74
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:10,302
Yaiba will surely come.

75
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,805
Help, Yaiba!

76
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,016
Yaiba...

77
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,309
Shut up!

78
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,312
Yaiba won't come no matter how much you call him!

79
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,897
Yaiba is here!

80
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:23,315
What?

81
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:26,694
Yaiba?

82
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,028
Yaiba!

83
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:33,617
When the doll on the roller coaster disappears like always,

84
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:34,910
you're on!

85
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,832
Sorry to keep you waiting, Blackian.

86
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,002
I'm not letting you do as you please!

87
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,795
This is quite a performance.

88
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,130
Yes.

89
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,925
I am sorry!

90
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,719
Please don't worry, Princess.

91
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,429
I'll rescue you right away!

92
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,816
Here goes, Yaiba.

93
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:11,822
Yaiba Jump...

94
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,919
I wonder if that was part of the performance.

95
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,505
-No, I don't think so. -Huh?

96
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:32,217
Because the audience can't see him diving into the water.

97
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,011
Hey, Hosono!

98
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,430
Are you all right, Hosono?

99
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,932
Oh, no! Get the rescue squad!

100
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:40,601
Hosono fell!

101
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,811
What? He fell?

102
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:51,028
It's already 20 minutes since he fell.

103
00:07:58,827 --> 00:07:59,995
What's that?

104
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:10,130
The cut rubber is burnt.

105
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,134
Which means that this is not an accident.

106
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:17,930
She's the one I bumped into.

107
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,307
Maybe...

108
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,228
Excuse me.

109
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:27,106
Hey, we found him!

110
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,828
Poor thing.

111
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:44,707
I think you should contact Inspector Megure.

112
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,209
Because maybe...

113
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,336
Is anything the matter, Conan?

114
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,422
Look at that.

115
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:55,426
That rubber looks like it's burnt from the inside.

116
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:58,929
If it was broken normally, it won't have burnt mark like that.

117
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,104
I see.

118
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:10,232
It didn't break naturally.

119
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:13,902
Is this homicide after all, Inspector Megure?

120
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:16,697
You're the one who said so, didn't you?

121
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:18,115
I guess so.

122
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,036
Officer Takagi, please get all those involved together.

123
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,121
Yes, sir!

124
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,711
So, that's where the corpse was pulled up from.

125
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,731
This water...

126
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:55,402
It's wet all the way from there.

127
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:06,497
He's the boy that looked bored watching the Yaiba Show.

128
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,916
Maybe...

129
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,626
Hey, you!

130
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,135
How was it, sir?

131
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,137
Yes. I just went and looked,

132
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:25,516
and I found just one that was drenched, like you said.

133
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:26,517
Just as I thought.

134
00:10:26,517 --> 00:10:28,936
But why are you asking me something like that, sonny?

135
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:30,938
Okay. Let's go, Tomohiro.

136
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:33,524
Hey, go where?

137
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,235
We're going to nab the bad guys!

138
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,737
For Yaiba!

139
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,035
The victim is Yuta Hosono, age 28,

140
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:50,913
a member of HO Theater.

141
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,206
The rubber used when bungee jumping

142
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,500
during his performance as Yaiba

143
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,418
in the Masked Yaiba Show seems to have severed,

144
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:58,504
which lead him to drowned to death.

145
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:02,424
You're the one who set the rubber on the victim's feet?

146
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:05,511
"Akiyoshi Ishijima (25)" -Yes, I always do so.

147
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,721
Did you notice anything wrong with the rubber then?

148
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,015
If so, I wouldn't have made him jump.

149
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,809
Well, I guess so.

150
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:15,813
And you guys belong to the same acting team as Mr. Hosono, right?

151
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,734
"Shinpei Okubo (28)" -Yes, My name is Okubo.

152
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,820
I usually do onstage plays,

153
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,114
but that's not enough to make a living.

154
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,825
I see, that's why you're acting in the Yaiba Show.

155
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,911
So, Mr. Okubo is the bad guy.

156
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:32,329
And you are...

157
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,833
I am Kanako Harukawa acting as the Princess.

158
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,128
I'm Wataru Otake.

159
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:41,505
I do everything behind the scenes from sets

160
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,632
and special effects.

161
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:44,800
Special effects?

162
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,221
Special effects like exploding dynamite on stage and such.

163
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:51,932
And you?

164
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,018
"Seizou Fujita (40)" -I am Fujita,

165
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,436
the person in charge of the events

166
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:56,729
that are held at Nichiuri Land.

167
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:57,938
Huh?

168
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:00,232
Where is the person who was in the Yaiba costume

169
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,818
riding the roller coaster?

170
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:04,820
That's a doll.

171
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,532
We would actually like to hire and actor to do the part,

172
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,325
but we're short of hands now.

173
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:14,038
Why have we all been called here?

174
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:16,331
Hosono died of an accident, didn't he?

175
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,625
Well, as the investigation progressed,

176
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,128
it's starting to turn out that an accident is not the only possibility.

177
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,838
Yes.

178
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,008
This is apparently homicide!

179
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:28,927
And the killer is someone here!

180
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:32,514
There's got to be someone here

181
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:35,017
that has a grudge against Mr. Hosono.

182
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:37,102
Isn't that right, Mr. Ishijima?

183
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:42,316
Okubo argued with Hosono about the management of the the theater.

184
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,401
You're the one who borrowed money

185
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:45,611
from Hosono and were having problems!

186
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,738
Never mind about me!

187
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:49,406
Kanako was also upset

188
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:52,618
because Hosono kept asking her to go with him.

189
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,912
It just troubled me a bit!

190
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,831
Otake, you were pissed at Hosono, too.

191
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,500
Because he makes you run errands for him, weren't you?

192
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,127
Doesn't that go for all of you?

193
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:06,340
There was no trouble between Hosono and I.

194
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:11,136
Which means all of you

195
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:17,434
except Mr. Fujita have a motive to kill Mr. Hosono.

196
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:22,606
You're the one who killed Masked Yaiba, that is, Mr. Hosono!

197
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,737
You've got to be kidding!

198
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:30,823
Just because I operate the bungee jump,

199
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,699
is it my fault?

200
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:37,830
This rubber was severed because of the explosion.

201
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,000
You're the only one who can set an explosive onto his feet.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,502
We can tell by looking at this.

203
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,503
What?

204
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:47,339
I borrowed this video tape

205
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,716
from someone who shot the scene of Yaiba diving.

206
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,636
I see. It could turn out to be evidence.

207
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:54,805
Let's take a look at it, Mouri.

208
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,723
Yes, I guess so.

209
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,230
I am sorry.

210
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:10,612
Stop!

211
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:15,033
This smoke is when the dynamite exploded.

212
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,039
It is most likely that

213
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,626
when the rubber was strapped to his feet

214
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:28,130
an explosive was rigged to his feet.

215
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,424
And after Yaiba jumped,

216
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:34,636
he pushed the switch of the explosive when the time came.

217
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,808
Why don't you admit it, Mr. Ishijima?

218
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,935
How can I admit something I didn't do?

219
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,812
What's the use resisting at this point?

220
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:46,023
Take a look at this.

221
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,316
See, right here

222
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:50,611
Doesn't it look like Yaiba is touching the rubber?

223
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:52,821
It does look that way.

224
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:56,617
How is it, Mouri? You were close by, aren't you?

225
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:58,202
Come to think of it,

226
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,001
Masked Yaiba did put his finger into the rubber.

227
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,502
Take a look at this, too.

228
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,340
Don't you notice something strange?

229
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,926
You're the one that's strange.

230
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,719
Although the fingers of his left hand are extended out,

231
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,304
the fingers of his right are grabbed into a fist?

232
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,014
Bull's eye!

233
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:22,434
Isn't that the way Yaiba poses?

234
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,937
No, this is the first time I've seen him posing like this.

235
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,814
Could it be that he was holding something in his right hand?

236
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:31,735
Something like a switch to set off explosives.

237
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,111
What?

238
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,239
That's suicide!

239
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,324
That's right, it is a suicide!

240
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:40,202
That's what Hosono did. Right?

241
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,413
That too, is a possible deduction.

242
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:48,418
Well, if you say so, Inspector.

243
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,216
No.

244
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,010
This is homicide.

245
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,931
Then, are you saying that the killer is Mr. Ishijima?

246
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:03,600
I am telling you I didn't do it!

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,602
Before we accuse anyone as being the killer,

248
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:08,939
let's check everybody's alibi.

249
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:10,607
First, Mr. Okubo.

250
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:14,236
I was acting as the Blackian on stage.

251
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:18,031
I was likewise on stage, acting as princess.

252
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,827
I was backstage and in charge of the fireworks.

253
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,914
Mr. Ishijima was on the gondola.

254
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:28,208
-Right. -What about you, Mr. Fujita?

255
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,836
I was here, putting my papers in order.

256
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,630
Can anyone testify that for you?

257
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,009
No, because I was alone.

258
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,136
I didn't mention it a while ago,

259
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:42,306
but you had trouble with Hosono too, didn't you?

260
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,516
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:46,727
In return for letting Hosono's acting team perform here,

262
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,438
you were getting commission, weren't you?

263
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,024
But Hosono didn't pay you the money, right?

264
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,108
Shut up!

265
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:57,612
Well, let's hear all of what Mouri has to say first.

266
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:00,741
As you already saw in the video,

267
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,910
there is a possibility that Masked Yaiba

268
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,120
set the explosive off himself.

269
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,538
Like I said, it's suicide.

270
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:11,418
No, even so, there still is a possibility of homicide.

271
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,712
If the person who was acting as Masked Yaiba

272
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,839
was not Mr. Hosono.

273
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:20,719
The killer probably waited until Mr. Hosono

274
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,513
was alone to attacked him,

275
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:26,016
and knocked him unconscious.

276
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:30,312
And while still wearing his costume,

277
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:33,523
the killer carried him to the river

278
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,525
and drowned him.

279
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:40,822
After that, the killer went over to the waiting room

280
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:43,408
and put on the extra Masked Yaiba outfit.

281
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:47,037
Then, he went on stage and acted as if he were Masked Yaiba himself.

282
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:49,623
The killer pretended to confirm the rubber strap

283
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:50,916
while on the gondola,

284
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,835
and after he stuck the explosive on,

285
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:56,213
he jumped!

286
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,131
He set the explosive off with the remote control switch

287
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:00,717
he was holding in his right hand.

288
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:04,304
The killer dove into the water

289
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:07,432
and swam to the back of the pump room,

290
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:12,104
changed costumes and went back to where everyone was.

291
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,941
But it's about 100 meters

292
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:18,527
from the position of the crane to the pump room.

293
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:21,613
A compact regulator was used.

294
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:25,117
That way, he can stay underwater for about 10 minutes.

295
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:30,413
Well? Can you point out any mistakes?

296
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:35,418
The one who killed Mr. Hosono

297
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,337
is you, Mr. Wataru Otake!

298
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,423
Ridiculous!

299
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,802
I was in charge of the explosives during the show, you know!

300
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:48,723
Did anyone see Mr. Otake around during the show?

301
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,725
-No, I didn't. -Neither did I.

302
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,102
Then, who took care of the explosives

303
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,603
that were used during the show?

304
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:55,814
The person that will answer that question

305
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:58,733
is a boy who is a fan of Masked Yaiba,

306
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,819
Tomohiro Takada.

307
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:05,115
Tell them, Tomohiro.

308
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:06,408
Okay.

309
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,201
I could tell right away

310
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,536
that the person who was wearing the Yaiba outfit

311
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,621
was not the usual person!

312
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,123
His movements were bad,

313
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:15,208
and his kick missed its target, too.

314
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,920
And besides, Yaiba always poses before an explosion.

315
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,007
He goes like this and like this!

316
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,927
That's his usual pose before the explosion.

317
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,513
Yes, but today it was different.

318
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:30,140
How?

319
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,435
The minute he placed his hand on his hip, it exploded.

320
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,313
He usually shouts Yaiba before the explosion.

321
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:39,107
Come to think of it, it was faster than usual.

322
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:41,318
I missed the timing a bit.

323
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:42,736
Besides...

324
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,823
Yaiba's pose was different from always.

325
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:49,201
Yaiba usually poses...

326
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,413
not by extending all the finger of his left hand straight,

327
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:56,708
but he points and the sky with his index finger!

328
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,836
It's different from the one on TV,

329
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:03,006
but he always poses that way at the show here.

330
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,134
When Yaiba came to our town,

331
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:08,303
it rained and the Yaiba Show was canceled.

332
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:12,515
So, he promised us this pose as a token of his apology.

333
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:14,726
In other words,

334
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:17,229
you remote controlled the explosion of the show

335
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,522
using the switch you had on your hips.

336
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,611
That's no proof!

337
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:28,823
The proof is on your body!

338
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:32,035
On your feet!

339
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,204
The burn marks from the explosives!

340
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,917
After all, you exploded something strong enough

341
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:43,505
to sever the super strong rubber used for bungee jumping.

342
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,008
-Excuse me. -No!

343
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:48,718
Wataru.

344
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:54,432
Let's go get some ice cream, Tomohiro.

345
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:59,104
That guy...

346
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:03,817
Hosono insisted that I could never handle the role of Masked Yaiba.

347
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,820
I can handle the movements of Masked Yaiba

348
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,531
just as good or better than you can, Hosono!

349
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:13,201
Don't think you can be Masked Yaiba just by looks.

350
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:17,038
You need certain qualifications to be a hero.

351
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,918
He had the nerve to squawk to me

352
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,712
about qualifications and what not's.

353
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:25,839
All it was is that he was jealous of me

354
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,424
and wanted to get rid of me!

355
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,430
He was probably referring to

356
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,516
is the qualifications of the "heart".

357
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,517
What?

358
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:40,812
It is impossible for a person with a heart like you,

359
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:43,106
who can't take the remarks of another

360
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:45,608
as meaning only evil to act out a hero.

361
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:51,031
Mr. Hosono's finger of his left hand which pointed at the sky

362
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:55,410
was a sign of friendship between Mr. Hosono and the children.

363
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:37,512
So, we didn't get to go after all.

364
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:42,016
I am going to go to Tropical Land next time with my boyfriend.

365
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,811
Boyfriend?

366
00:23:44,811 --> 00:23:47,021
Don't tell me it's that detective brat?

367
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:49,941
Of course, it's not with Shinichi!

368
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,318
Then, who is it?

369
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:57,031
He's my boyfriend!

370
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:05,123
Well... well, I guess so.

Explosives?

374
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:21,306
Just as I thought.

375
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:22,932
Huh? This person is...

376
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:25,810
Doesn't this look like that person?

377
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,438
Remember, the person who was driving the car

378
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,732
that overtook us on our way to Megumi's house.

379
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:36,738
