1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,740
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,640
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,340
Open your mouth wide and say "Ah".

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,740
How will this quite amusing action

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,340
play a role in today's case?

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,840
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,662
"Thistle butterflies"

10
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:21,962
"The Fatal Ah"

11
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:30,362
Please hurry up, Mr. Mouri. Can't you run faster?

12
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:32,062
I'm doing my best.

13
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:34,862
Why don't you try to lose more weight, Ms. Nitta?

14
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,662
Huh, did you say something?

15
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:39,262
Maybe something's wrong with my hearing aid.

16
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,162
Way back. The room at the very end.

17
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,762
It is a remodeled gun.

18
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:08,962
He is a famous detective.

19
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:12,362
He'll solve the case in the wink of an eye.

20
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:14,862
-A cold? -No, I'm okay.

21
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,762
Watch out, because they say "Physician heal thyself."

22
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:20,562
Oh, come on, I am not a doctor.

23
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:23,662
I'm just a dentist's assistant, that's all.

24
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,362
Well, let us continue.

25
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:29,962
Ms. Nitta heard what sounded like a gun just before 3pm.

26
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:32,362
To be exact, it was 2.45pm.

27
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:38,762
When I woke up from my daily nap, and Ms. Suzuki came.

28
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,062
A crust of bread?

29
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:44,262
Yes, I made sandwiches for today's lunch

30
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:48,362
and happened to remember that you like to feed the carps in the pond.

31
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,362
Thank you. I am going there today, too.

32
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,862
I appreciate it.

33
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:54,162
Aren't you going to the dental clinic today?

34
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:56,062
I took a day off.

35
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:58,962
Let's have a tea break after I come back.

36
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:00,762
I will be back after 3pm.

37
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:03,562
What is that sound?

38
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,762
It came from Mr. Yamamoto's room.

39
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,462
Wasn't it the sound of a gun?

40
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:08,662
No way.

41
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:09,862
You are right.

42
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:12,262
It can't be in broad daylight in a place like this.

43
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,062
The carps must be starving and waiting for me.

44
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:18,262
See you later.

45
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:21,662
Afterwards, I returned a little bit before 3pm and...

46
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,162
Has any change come over your neighbor since then?

47
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:25,862
No, nothing.

48
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,162
Hello, Mr. Nakanishi.

49
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:36,662
He used to live in your room.

50
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:37,862
Huh?

51
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,162
The door is left open.

52
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,562
It looks like a will.

53
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:57,162
I've heard that Mr. Nakanishi and Mr. Yamamoto were best friends.

54
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,962
Even if Mr. Yamamoto did commit suicide,

55
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,762
isn't it strange that his best friend went home

56
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:04,562
without calling the police or the ambulance?

57
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:06,862
You mean he left as if fleeing?

58
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:09,562
That's right. I'm sure there's something to this.

59
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:13,162
He's got to be the killer no matter how you look at it.

60
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:16,362
He is surely a suspicious man.

61
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:19,362
I will ask Inspector Megure to come.

62
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,762
Ran asked me to buy some cakes and I'm on my way back,

63
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:26,662
I happened to see Ms. Nitta who was running to police,

64
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:27,662
That's why I am here.

65
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,262
It is addressed to Mr. Nakanishi.

66
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,062
It says he will commit suicide in apology

67
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:33,262
of not being able to return the money borrowed.

68
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:36,862
But the will is typed with a word processor.

69
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:40,362
We can't conclude that Mr. Yamamoto wrote it himself.

70
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,462
What bothers me most...

71
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,562
Is despite having found the dead body of his childhood friend,

72
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:47,062
why did he just split without informing anyone about it?

73
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:49,162
Yes.

74
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:50,862
I didn't think such a thing would happen in broad daylight like this.

75
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,462
Back then I was...

76
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:55,162
The intuition of an ex-police officer tells me that

77
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,862
the murderer was Nakanishi, who was Mr. Yamamoto's childhood friend.

78
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,662
The motive was money trouble between them.

79
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:01,962
Mr. Mouri.

80
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,962
On the basis of the autopsy, we can't say it was murder.

81
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:10,262
The reason is that no trace of resistance was found at all.

82
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,262
No resistance?

83
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:14,962
If a gun had been thrust into his mouth,

84
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,062
scars resulting from resistance

85
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,662
would've been left on his teeth or lips.

86
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,062
Since none were found,

87
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:25,062
we can't help believing that he opened his mouth voluntarily.

88
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,962
Take a look at this, Inspector.

89
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:30,762
True, there are no traces of struggle.

90
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,562
You're probably right, but...

91
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:37,162
The butterflies are called thistle butterflies, it says,

92
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,262
and this plant is...

93
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,162
We don't have time to be wasting with you.

94
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,262
Don't bother us. Get lost!

95
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,162
Inspector, as the result of verification,

96
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,162
we found that Mr. Yamamoto had been arrested in the past

97
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,362
on charges of possessing a remodeled gun.

98
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,762
Ms. Suzuki, his next door neighbor, says that

99
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:56,962
he would burst in rage

100
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:59,862
when there were complaints about the volume of his T.V.

101
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:02,462
and his only purpose in life seemed to be butterflies.

102
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:06,162
Inspector, I can't imagine that such an insensitive man

103
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,762
would kill himself over debts.

104
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,162
Mr. Mouri.

105
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:12,062
We don't understand this.

106
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,962
It was about 2.45pm when Ms. Suzuki and Ms. Nittta

107
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,862
heard the sound of the gun.

108
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:20,662
It was a little after 3pm, when Ms. Nitta saw Nakanishi.

109
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:23,162
Let's suppose that Nakanishi is the murderer.

110
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:27,562
What was he doing during this period of 15 minutes?

111
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,662
If he were the real murderer,

112
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:33,062
he would have left the scene as soon as he could.

113
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:36,762
Inspector, here is Mr. Nakanishi.

114
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,962
"Saburo Nakanishi (30), Yamamoto's childhood friend"

115
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:44,162
See? I came here at the promised time of 3pm.

116
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,662
When I entered his room,

117
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:49,062
Yamamoto was already on the sofa, dead.

118
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:51,262
You found his dead body,

119
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,862
but you're his childhood friend, aren't you?

120
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,862
Why didn't you immediately inform the police?

121
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:59,962
I loaned him money.

122
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,962
I was afraid that you might think I killed him

123
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:03,962
because of money trouble and ran away.

124
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,862
No, don't lie.

125
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:09,262
In order not to leave your fingerprints and the gun power smoke behind,

126
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,062
you wrapped your gun with a towel.

127
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,762
Around 2.45pm,

128
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:15,462
you thrust your gun into Mr. Yamamoto's mouth

129
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,362
and shot him to make it look like suicide.

130
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:24,462
Two people heard the report of the gunfire.

131
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,762
Wait a second.

132
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:29,862
How could I thrust the gun into Yamamoto's mouth?

133
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,862
Are you saying he just waited for the gun to be fired

134
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,462
with his mouth wide open?

135
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:37,662
Well, it's possible to think that you waited

136
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:40,762
for Mr. Yamamoto to yawn or something. Yes!

137
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,462
He was in the midst of being pursued by collectors.

138
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,462
Do you think he had the composure to yawn with his mouth wide open

139
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,862
in a situation like that?

140
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,162
I see your point, but...

141
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,862
What Mr. Nakanishi says is right.

142
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,862
It is unreasonable to say that this man did it.

143
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,562
Let me ask you one more thing.

144
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:01,662
At the estimated time of Mr. Yamamoto's death around 2.45pm,

145
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:04,562
tell me where were you and what you were doing.

146
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,362
In the taxi coming here.

147
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,262
What is the name of the taxi company?

148
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:12,362
I don't remember. It was a blue car.

149
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:15,162
A picture of a dove or a mouse was painted on it.

150
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,462
I will check it.

151
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,162
He is just making useless efforts to buy time.

152
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:28,862
That man is sure unlucky to have to confront Mr. Mouri.

153
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,962
He has no way out.

154
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,462
Mr. Mouri, I am going to have tea with Ms. Nitta.

155
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,362
If it's okay with you, please join us.

156
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,262
Thank you. Let's have the cake I bought.

157
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,262
Darn, I can't get money back.

158
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:44,162
If Mr. Yamamoto had indeed killed himself,

159
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:48,762
I wonder what he had in mind for the butterflies after his death.

160
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:51,262
He treasured the butterflies and raised them.

161
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:55,462
There must be something else I haven't noticed.

162
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,362
What is it?

163
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,767
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

164
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,967
Now, let's have the cake.

165
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,467
Strawberries.

166
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,067
Open your mouth, Conan.

167
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,667
Come on, say ah.

168
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,667
Mr. Mouri, forget about business.

169
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,667
Here, have a strawberry!

170
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,567
No, thanks. I am a grownup.

171
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,867
Well, if you insist.

172
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,267
Conan, don't say anything about this to Ran.

173
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,567
Here, open your mouth.

174
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,067
What a loose fish.

175
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:51,467
Shall I add some brandy to your tea?

176
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,267
Great.

177
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,967
A little while more, a little while more,

178
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,467
and just how long do I have to wait?

179
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,967
My men are looking desperately for it now, too.

180
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:06,067
This is Mr. Yamamoto's consultation ticket.

181
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,567
I wonder what Mr. Mouri is going to use it for.

182
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,267
I guess he wants to find out

183
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,367
if Mr. Yamamoto was consulting a dentist.

184
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:17,067
And, if he was, which dentist.

185
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,767
Thank you.

186
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:22,367
Yes, Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto. Your patient.

187
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,467
It was cancelled?

188
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,467
I will send Conan over, as my messenger,

189
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,567
so please explain it to him.

190
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:35,267
"Beika Taxi Corp."

191
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,767
"Shinjuku Wireless. Taisho Taxi."

192
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,167
Officer Chiba.

193
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,367
Did you find out which taxi Mr. Nakanishi rode?

194
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:57,167
Not yet, or Nakanishi could be lying.

195
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:02,267
Well, Pops says he has something he wants you to look over.

196
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:05,767
Pops, wake up please, Pops.

197
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,467
One more? Okay.

198
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:11,367
I am sorry, he seemed to enjoy drinking a lot,

199
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,167
so I couldn't help offering him more and more.

200
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,467
Pops, wake up!

201
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,967
Can you help me?

202
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:19,867
No more? No more strawberries and no more...

203
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,867
What a pity, Inspector, talk about unlucky.

204
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,067
Just what are you talking about?

205
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,367
It's about time we leave.

206
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,667
Come on, get up.

207
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,067
Hey, just where are you taking me?

208
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:36,767
Till we find the taxi you took, you're a suspect.

209
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:39,367
Nonsense. I've got nothing to do with it!

210
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,767
You are a poor loser.

211
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:45,967
Why don't you resign and admit what you did?

212
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,267
That's what I'd like to say, but...

213
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,467
Inspector, though Mr. Yamamoto's death is due to homicide,

214
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,467
that man has nothing to do with it.

215
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:02,767
Mr. Yamamoto was killed under the pretense of suicide.

216
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,267
Pretense? Who did?

217
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,667
Any evidence?

218
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:10,767
As you see, Mr. Yamamoto loved butterflies.

219
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,967
He would've thought of what would happen to his butterflies if he died,

220
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,867
so he would've released them before he killed himself.

221
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,767
Again, that's where Mr. Yamamoto was sitting.

222
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,567
If he fires the gun from there,

223
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:28,067
the bullet would go through the glass case and shatter it.

224
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,567
At worst, it may harm the butterflies.

225
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:35,267
He would never kill himself in a place like this.

226
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:36,867
True.

227
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:40,067
Mr. Yamamoto called the dental clinic

228
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,267
to cancel the appointment around 2.30pm.

229
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:46,267
In other words, he was killed between 2.30pm and 3pm

230
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:49,367
when Mr. Nakanishi found his body.

231
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,567
It was 2.45pm.

232
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,967
Some people must've surely heard the gunshot.

233
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,967
But, before that,

234
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:01,367
how did the killer manage to put the gun in Mr. Yamamoto's mouth?

235
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:06,367
Mr. Yamamoto opened his mouth as the killer told him to.

236
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,767
Open his mouth like he was told to?

237
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,567
If he was a child, maybe, but he's an adult.

238
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,667
There was a person who could manipulate him that far.

239
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,967
Who could it be?

240
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:22,267
Inspector, if someone told you to open your mouth wide,

241
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,667
who would you open it obediently for?

242
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,067
Obediently?

243
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,267
My wife, grandma...

244
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,367
Hey, open your mouth wide!

245
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,767
Open wide, ah...

246
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,767
A doctor!

247
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,467
That's right, a doctor.

248
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:38,767
Almost all dentists, in particular would say so.

249
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,967
A dentist is the murderer?

250
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,967
The dentist visited this room?

251
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:46,467
No. The person who came here was working at a dental clinic.

252
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,267
And, that person had met Mr. Yamamoto before

253
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:52,767
and knew about his debts.

254
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,667
Who is that person?

255
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,867
Ms. Yumi Suzuki.

256
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:59,867
You are working at Beika Dental Clinic as an assistant.

257
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,267
Mr. Yamamoto was seeing a dentist there.

258
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,567
I see thin lines on the skin behind your ears.

259
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,767
They must be traces of the rubber supporter of the masks

260
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,767
you have been wearing for years.

261
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,767
You told the clinic today that you had urgent business to take care

262
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,467
and took a day off.

263
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,067
You eavesdropped that

264
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:21,467
Mr. Nakanishi was coming to collect his money at 3pm.

265
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:25,567
You decided to carry out your prearranged plan.

266
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,467
A prearranged plan?

267
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:31,267
You moved into this condominium about two months ago.

268
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,967
You moved in right after Mr. Yamamoto

269
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,967
started going to the clinic you were working at.

270
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,067
Your purpose was to pretend that you just happened to meet Mr. Yamamoto.

271
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,567
You wanted to approach him.

272
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,167
And you exchanged words with Mr. Yamamoto as you had planned.

273
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:50,067
You found that Mr. Yamamoto was up to his ears in debt.

274
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,567
Taking advantage of this, you wrote a scenario of

275
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,367
"a suicide caused by debts."

276
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,167
On a weekday afternoon like today,

277
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:01,367
there are only a few residents in this condominium who are at home.

278
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,367
Perhaps, a little after 2.30pm,

279
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:07,467
Ms. Nitta removed her hearing aid and took her daily nap.

280
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,667
Today is your consultation day, isn't it?

281
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,267
Let me have a look at it.

282
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,267
I'll do it free of charge because you're my neighbor.

283
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,867
Hurry, let me in.

284
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,567
Yes. I have some business to attend to,

285
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,267
so please cancel my appointment.

286
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,567
Drinks later, okay? It'll be over soon.

287
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,967
Let's begin, shall we?

288
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,467
Please close your eyes, since the lighting is too bright.

289
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,967
Here we go. Please open your mouth.

290
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,667
Ah.

291
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,667
It'll be over soon.

292
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,967
You set a tape recorder which had recorded

293
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:22,067
the sound of gunfire in advance,

294
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,467
and went out to see Ms. Nitta with some crumbs of bread.

295
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,867
At 2.45pm when Mr. Yamamoto is supposed to have died,

296
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,367
you were with Ms. Nitta.

297
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,567
In short, you made an alibi for yourself.

298
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,067
Ms. Nitta went out to feed the carps.

299
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,067
You saw her off...

300
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,567
And Mr. Yamamoto "died" at 2.45pm.

301
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,067
Furthermore, you deliberately planned to let Mr. Nakanishi

302
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,967
find his dead body at 3pm.

303
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,767
In short, it was a disguised suicide.

304
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,567
No, I didn't do it.

305
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:04,167
I do not have a reason for killing Mr. Yamamoto.

306
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,567
Yes, you do.

307
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,667
I have checked it, Ms. Suzuki.

308
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:13,067
Your husband had a traffic accident 10 years ago in his homeland, Gifu,

309
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:16,467
and is currently still unconscious in the hospital.

310
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,967
Oh, it's a Gifu butterfly.

311
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,367
The driver was Mr. Nobuo Yamamoto.

312
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,667
He was distracted by butterflies and failed to keep his eyes on the road.

313
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,967
Moreover, he was drunk.

314
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,867
Then, he happens to visit your clinic for dental treatment

315
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,167
and meet you again.

316
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,567
You decide to take revenge for what he did to your husband.

317
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,667
-Am I wrong? -You're wrong.

318
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,767
It's true that

319
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,667
Yamamoto took my husband's profession as a dentist away from him

320
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,167
and ruined his whole life.

321
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,267
But, I didn't kill him.

322
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,167
I've never been to this room either.

323
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,067
I seem to have caught a cold.

324
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,167
Please excuse me.

325
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,267
I would like to say, "Please take good care of yourself."

326
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:23,867
But Ms. Yumi, that isn't a cold.

327
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:26,367
Perhaps, it's hay fever.

328
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,867
Hay fever?

329
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,267
Yeah, hay fever caused by mugwort.

330
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,167
Hay fever caused by mugwort?

331
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,767
I found it in a book in this room.

332
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:38,167
It says a thistle butterfly lives on mugwort.

333
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,867
Mugwort is a favorite for the thistle butterfly.

334
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:45,967
But it can cause hay fever in human, it says.

335
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:50,167
One more thing, your hair is a bit shiny.

336
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,967
It is probably the powder from the wings of butterflies.

337
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:56,767
Mr. Mouri, I am living next door.

338
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,667
Mugwort powder might have flown and come to my room.

339
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,067
Some butterflies might have escaped and alighted on my body

340
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,567
although I didn't notice them.

341
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,667
Conan, bring me that thing.

342
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,967
Do you know what is this?

343
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:18,467
Yes. It is a dental mirror to examine the inner side of teeth.

344
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,767
Though I knew it was a rude request,

345
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,367
I borrowed this from Beika Dental Clinic.

346
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,067
It has the initials of Beika Dental Clinic "BDC" on it

347
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,667
and they told me that it is special ordered.

348
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,667
Have you ever met a person who wanted to own it

349
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,567
or a person who went home with it?

350
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,467
No. None.

351
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,467
Inspector, there is a coffee cup under the table.

352
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,667
Please have a look.

353
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,767
It looks like an ordinary coffee to me.

354
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:47,867
What about it?

355
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,667
There is a stir stick inside.

356
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,067
The stick, please pull it out slowly.

357
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,967
Why is it here? Why?

358
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:22,667
You're the only one who could've brought

359
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,667
the dental mirror into this room.

360
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,367
What would you say?

361
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,867
Yamamoto came to our clinic.

362
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:36,367
Of course he had forgotten my face and name.

363
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,867
One thing I couldn't forgive him for

364
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:41,767
was that he drove drunk to our clinic,

365
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,967
despite promising never drink and drive again.

366
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:49,067
He showed no apologetic signs for what he had done.

367
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,267
Thinking of it, made me feel sorry for my husband.

368
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,367
That's why I...

369
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,867
I am sorry.

370
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,467
"Mouri Detective Agency"

371
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:33,967
You see, I must explain to you about the cake.

372
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,567
I didn't mean to lie to you, Ran.

373
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,267
Please open the door.

374
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,167
Hey, she has turned off the switch.

375
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,167
Ran must have turned off her switch towards us too.

376
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:46,267
Is this the karma for "ah"?

377
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:50,367
"Next Episode"

378
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,667
"I've grown tired of living."

379
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,167
A will?

380
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,467
Even if you lie, some sort of evidence will be left behind.

381
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,167
I've found the evidence!

382
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:03,267
The problem is, how can I prove this attempted scheme?

383
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:04,467
What can I do?

384
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:09,467
I can't let anything like this happen!

385
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,767
Next Conan,

386
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:16,867
"Man Hindered by a Steel-Frame"

387
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,652
Next Conan's Hint:

388

"Amnesia"

389
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,652
Officer Chiba, do you remember today's murderer?

390
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,252
-Today's almond jelly? -No, murderer.

391
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,652
-Did I eat it? -What?
