1
00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:06.024
Taken by Nanami Kyodo, Ran's senior in the karate club,

2
00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.324
we the members of the Detective Squad

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.224
came to treasure-hunt at the Kyodo residence.

4
00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:13.024
The mansion of the Kyodo's

5
00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:17.024
was built by the hands of Seitaro Kyodo,

6
00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:18.624
and because he used to always get carried away with what he does,

7
00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:21.924
the mansion was full of tricks and gadgets.

8
00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:24.324
The Dark Tower, a mysterious building, is one of them,

9
00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.824
not having any entrance or windows.

10
00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:32.024
While Nanami guided us around the house,

11
00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:34.324
we suddenly heard a woman screaming.

12
00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.024
It's Mom's voice!

13
00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.024
Mom! Mom!

14
00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:43.924
Children, stay away!

15
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.824
What?

16
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.124
Momoe! Momoe!

17
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:50.224
What's going on?

18
00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:55.124
It looks like she fell off the tower.

19
00:00:55.124 --> 00:00:57.424
But this tower...

20
00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.924
Doesn't have an entrance.

21
00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.724
There's no way she could've made it up there!

22
00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:06.324
Since we deduced that the culprit may still be in the tower,

23
00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:08.024
we started investigations

24
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.824
to look for the entrance of the tower,

25
00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:13.024
but Ai disappears part way through!

26
00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:14.624
Ai's gone!

27
00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:15.924
What?

28
00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:18.324
Hey, Ai!

29
00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:21.424
-Ai! -Ai!

30
00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:25.024
There's wind coming from the space.

31
00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:28.424
Ai!

32
00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.924
Gosh. There's got be an entrance elsewhere!

33
00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.324
Next door is the liquor storeroom.

34
00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:37.624
It smells of liquor!

35
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:40.324
I'm used it because of Dad!

36
00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.124
There's a mirror!

37
00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.824
Why would it be left standing in a place like this?

38
00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:47.024
Standing it there is just sham.

39
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:50.724
I disappeared. There's no other way to put it.

40
00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:53.824
This smell...

41
00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:56.424
If you sniff it too much, you'll really get drunk.

42
00:01:56.424 --> 00:01:59.624
No, I smell the lady's perfume.

43
00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:02.724
Her smell is all over this area.

44
00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:05.724
What's up?

45
00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.224
Disappeared!

46
00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:10.424
The ceiling is reflected in the mirror but we're not?

47
00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:13.024
It switched to a screen!

48
00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:14.224
Rubber tape?

49
00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:15.724
A person can go under it!

50
00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:17.924
It's the entrance to the treasure! Let's go!

51
00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:20.124
We'll be in trouble if the culprit is there!

52
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:24.724
Hey!

53
00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:26.324
What shall we do?

54
00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:28.824
What shall we do, Conan?

55
00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:36.524
Ai?

56
00:02:36.524 --> 00:02:37.924
Ai!

57
00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.024
It's not like her to scream like that.

58
00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:41.424
I'll be right over!

59
00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:43.324
Stay here, Ayumi!

60
00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:46.224
-No. I'm going to rescue her! -Don't!

61
00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.224
Okay, let's go!

62
00:02:53.224 --> 00:02:54.924
Don't ever let go of my hand.

63
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.624
Okay!

64
00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.924
The vivid colored memories of summer

65
00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:14.024
solve mysteries all season round.

66
00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.924
Search for the treasure to a miracle world.

67
00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.324
The truth of light in an eerie tower.

68
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:19.924
He sees through the one and only truth.

69
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:21.824
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

70
00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:24.224
His name is Detective Conan!

71
00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:16.882
"Secret Treasure of the Dark Tower (Part 2)"

72
00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:27.182
Mr. Tsutomu Kyodo, you are the person who discovered the body?

73
00:05:27.182 --> 00:05:29.382
Yes, it seems so.

74
00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:31.582
What were you doing there?

75
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:33.582
-Watercress. -What?

76
00:05:33.582 --> 00:05:36.782
I was gathering watercress to use for cooking.

77
00:05:36.782 --> 00:05:38.182
It is cultivated by hydroponic method

78
00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:40.082
in the stream below the tower.

79
00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:42.482
I see.

80
00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:46.482
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

81
00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:50.682
How strange.

82
00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:52.982
Were the members of the Youth Detective Squad found?

83
00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:54.282
Nanami.

84
00:05:54.282 --> 00:05:56.982
I'm calling Conan right now, but...

85
00:05:56.982 --> 00:05:59.682
Nobody saw them go out the gate.

86
00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:03.682
Don't tell me that they went off on the treasure-hunt on their own?

87
00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:05.082
Dad!

88
00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:11.382
"Nagase Kensaku (75), assistant of the previous head"

89
00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:15.182
What's that sound?

90
00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:17.882
A flood!

91
00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:20.082
Stay calm. It's not for real!

92
00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.382
Close your eyes!

93
00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:28.982
Hot! It's hot!

94
00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:32.082
It's not for real! It's just hot wind blowing!

95
00:06:32.082 --> 00:06:33.582
Cool it, Ayumi!

96
00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.382
Yep. I'll calm down.

97
00:06:36.382 --> 00:06:40.782
When you heard your wife's voice, where were you?

98
00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:42.582
I was somewhere near the rose garden.

99
00:06:42.582 --> 00:06:46.982
I went after my wife wanting to convince her one more time.

100
00:06:46.982 --> 00:06:48.982
Could you tell right away

101
00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:50.782
where your wife's voice was coming from?

102
00:06:50.782 --> 00:06:52.682
Huh?

103
00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:54.682
If it's the rose garden, the connecting corridor is near

104
00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:55.782
and so is the storeroom.

105
00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:59.582
But you ran right for the tower.

106
00:06:59.582 --> 00:07:01.582
That's probably because

107
00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:05.382
I heard the scream coming from somewhere high.

108
00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:10.082
That tower is the only tall building in that area.

109
00:07:10.082 --> 00:07:13.282
That's why I thought Momoe fell.

110
00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:16.782
From a tower with no entrance?

111
00:07:16.782 --> 00:07:20.782
It was so sudden that it didn't dawn on me.

112
00:07:22.582 --> 00:07:23.882
What?

113
00:07:23.882 --> 00:07:25.782
The kid's aren't here?

114
00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:27.982
-Yeah. -I looked all over the house,

115
00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:29.082
but couldn't find them.

116
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.082
Maybe they already went home?

117
00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:34.382
No. I tried calling, but was told they're not home.

118
00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:36.982
I tell you those kids are hopeless.

119
00:07:36.982 --> 00:07:38.682
Let's go look for them once more!

120
00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:39.982
If we ask Mr. Nagase,

121
00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:42.882
he may know of places I don't know, too.

122
00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:46.182
-Dad, come with us too. -Bad news!

123
00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:47.582
Mr. Nagase...

124
00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:49.482
Mr. Nagase's gone!

125
00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:50.882
What?

126
00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:52.882
We walked pretty much, didn't we?

127
00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:55.382
Yes. I wonder where we are now?

128
00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:58.982
At any rate, I'm not giving up until I find the treasure!

129
00:07:58.982 --> 00:08:00.782
I guess so.

130
00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:02.482
But...

131
00:08:04.882 --> 00:08:06.182
Is this me?

132
00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:10.382
Genta, since when did you go on a diet?

133
00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:12.082
Stop making fun of me!

134
00:08:13.882 --> 00:08:15.782
Cut it out!

135
00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:19.582
It's a door?

136
00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.882
Maybe...

137
00:08:20.882 --> 00:08:22.582
The entrance to the treasure!

138
00:08:23.782 --> 00:08:24.882
Over there!

139
00:08:24.882 --> 00:08:27.882
Gosh! Even the door's making fun of me.

140
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.382
I'll catch you!

141
00:08:30.582 --> 00:08:32.182
Gosh!

142
00:08:32.182 --> 00:08:34.382
-You won't get away! -After it!

143
00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.982
Huh? It's gone.

144
00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:40.882
It got away.

145
00:08:40.882 --> 00:08:43.482
Over there!

146
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:45.482
How do we open it?

147
00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:53.782
Be careful.

148
00:08:53.782 --> 00:08:55.282
Yep.

149
00:08:57.882 --> 00:08:59.882
Genta, Mitsuhiko!

150
00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:01.582
Are you two okay?

151
00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:04.282
-Yeah. -Yes, somehow.

152
00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:06.682
What're you doing?

153
00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:09.582
I'm looking for the switch.

154
00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.082
Here it is.

155
00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:16.082
-It's starting to open! -Okay!

156
00:09:16.082 --> 00:09:17.982
Somebody's coming!

157
00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:22.382
It's the culprit!

158
00:09:22.382 --> 00:09:24.282
Hurry! Conan!

159
00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:26.382
Gosh. Is it broken?

160
00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:27.882
It keeps going back!

161
00:09:27.882 --> 00:09:29.882
Mitsuhiko, you can make it in!

162
00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:32.282
But if I let go now...

163
00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:34.182
That's right! Wait!

164
00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:43.182
Use this pipe!

165
00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:47.282
Hurry! The culprit will come!

166
00:09:51.682 --> 00:09:53.382
Okay, run for it!

167
00:09:53.382 --> 00:09:55.082
-Aye! -Yes!

168
00:10:10.082 --> 00:10:11.782
A child's room?

169
00:10:11.782 --> 00:10:13.782
It can't be.

170
00:10:13.782 --> 00:10:16.682
But there's a cute doll.

171
00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.982
It's glued on.

172
00:10:17.982 --> 00:10:19.182
This, too.

173
00:10:19.182 --> 00:10:20.882
And this.

174
00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:23.582
The books in the bookshelf are drawings.

175
00:10:23.582 --> 00:10:25.782
But the sofa is for real.

176
00:10:25.782 --> 00:10:27.982
What was this room made for?

177
00:10:38.782 --> 00:10:41.182
Don't be deceived. It's only an illusion!

178
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.382
The only thing that's spinning is the wall.

179
00:10:56.982 --> 00:10:58.982
Get out of the way.

180
00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:10.082
I saw many split images of myself.

181
00:11:10.082 --> 00:11:12.882
Is this what Tsutomu's memory is all about?

182
00:11:13.782 --> 00:11:15.282
Genta?

183
00:11:19.382 --> 00:11:21.182
What? The culprit?

184
00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:27.082
A mirror?

185
00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:29.982
What is it? Don't scare me.

186
00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:35.182
Gosh! Where are you?

187
00:11:35.182 --> 00:11:37.182
Mitsuhiko!

188
00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.382
This way!

189
00:11:40.982 --> 00:11:43.382
I thought I just saw the figure of a person.

190
00:11:48.982 --> 00:11:51.382
Is anyone there?

191
00:11:51.382 --> 00:11:53.982
There's no one here, is there?

192
00:12:08.482 --> 00:12:11.582
Ouch. Here goes.

193
00:12:18.182 --> 00:12:19.282
Ayumi!

194
00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:21.782
Where are you? Where are you, everybody?

195
00:12:23.882 --> 00:12:25.282
Cool it.

196
00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:27.782
Fussing and making big noise is not going to help me find them.

197
00:12:27.782 --> 00:12:29.682
Think...

198
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:33.382
What meaning there is to this tunnel.

199
00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:35.482
And then think it over again.

200
00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:41.582
Who of the three could've committed the crime?

201
00:12:41.582 --> 00:12:42.982
The fragrance of the perfume

202
00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:46.282
makes you want to deduce that the victim came into the tower.

203
00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:49.382
But be it Tsutomu who was right below the tower...

204
00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:52.082
Or Mr. Nozomi Kyodo who was in the yard...

205
00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:54.682
Or Mr. Nagase, who ran over from the main house.

206
00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:56.282
None of them could've had time

207
00:12:56.282 --> 00:12:59.582
to push the victim off the roof and come back.

208
00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:04.482
These tools...

209
00:13:04.482 --> 00:13:05.682
Wait a sec.

210
00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:08.682
Maybe I had it all wrong?

211
00:13:09.782 --> 00:13:12.882
The tower and the underground passage

212
00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:15.582
that was built 40 years ago.

213
00:13:15.582 --> 00:13:18.582
It's understandable if it breaks or goes rusty.

214
00:13:18.582 --> 00:13:20.182
So...

215
00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:22.182
That's it!

216
00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:27.082
This place is...

217
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:38.541
This place is...

218
00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:44.141
It was dimly lit and the ceiling was high.

219
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:47.441
I see! This is the treasure room.

220
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:50.141
Judging from the height, it the Dark Tower.

221
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:52.741
But it's supposed to be round.

222
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:54.541
It is a triangular pyramid.

223
00:13:57.841 --> 00:13:59.241
A mirror.

224
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:02.741
Which means, this is maybe...

225
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:08.741
Conan nor the children seem to be nowhere in the house.

226
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:11.341
And, of course the same goes for Mr. Nagase.

227
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.641
So, the only place left is

228
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:16.241
the Dark Tower.

229
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:18.541
Nagase knew, didn't he?

230
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:21.741
That Seitaro hid the treasure in the tower.

231
00:14:21.741 --> 00:14:23.641
I still can't believe it.

232
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:26.941
That the treasure that I thought was a dream actually exists.

233
00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:28.941
Who cares about that!

234
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:31.441
As long the children are okay.

235
00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:34.041
We've got no time to lose.

236
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.841
Please cooperate looking for the entrance of the tower!

237
00:14:40.741 --> 00:14:42.541
Conan.

238
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:48.541
According to Tsutomu's story,

239
00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:50.641
there should be a button somewhere.

240
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.341
Here it is.

241
00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:57.541
So these are the buttons of three colors.

242
00:14:57.541 --> 00:14:59.041
What's this?

243
00:15:00.841 --> 00:15:02.241
The roof.

244
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:05.141
Okay, now I have a good view.

245
00:15:05.141 --> 00:15:06.541
This is...

246
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.041
Momoe's fake nail.

247
00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:15.041
She must've pressed it really hard.

248
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.041
To the point of her nail coming off...

249
00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:19.541
Chief!

250
00:15:19.541 --> 00:15:21.341
Yes, this is Megure.

251
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:24.741
It's just as I've explained, we've got no time to lose!

252
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:27.341
Please dispatch all the officers you can gather

253
00:15:27.341 --> 00:15:29.841
because we must thoroughly investigate the Dark Tower.

254
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:31.241
What?

255
00:15:31.241 --> 00:15:33.741
I don't think you need to dispatch the officers.

256
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:36.441
Just what do you mean, Conan?

257
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:38.741
Wait a while!

258
00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.741
The key to the front entrance is...

259
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.841
red.

260
00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:47.241
Hey, kid! Come back here and explain!

261
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.941
What? It's an earthquake!

262
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:51.741
Wrong, Mr. Mouri!

263
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:54.141
The dark tower is extending upwards!

264
00:15:58.441 --> 00:16:01.441
The entrance is over there!

265
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:09.341
Welcome to the Dark Tower!

266
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:12.241
Hey, kid! Hurry and get down here!

267
00:16:12.241 --> 00:16:15.041
Pops! There's something I want to show you.

268
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.941
Will you come up here please?

269
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:19.341
No way!

270
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:21.241
I wonder if he found the treasure.

271
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:23.741
-Could be. -Treasure?

272
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:25.241
I'll go, I'll go! I'll be right there!

273
00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:26.641
Dad.

274
00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:29.841
I thought he didn't like high places.

275
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:32.841
Treasure, treasure!

276
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:35.941
Wait for me, my dear treasure!

277
00:16:35.941 --> 00:16:37.641
Where's the treasure?

278
00:16:38.941 --> 00:16:40.641
Watch out!

279
00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:47.041
I'm falling!

280
00:16:51.641 --> 00:16:54.241
Is he dozing off in a place like that?

281
00:16:54.241 --> 00:16:56.141
How adept.

282
00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:57.941
I'm sorry for troubling you.

283
00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:01.141
I've come up with the truth of this case, therefore...

284
00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:02.341
What?

285
00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:06.541
Mrs. Kyodo falling to her death was no murder

286
00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:08.441
but rather, an accident.

287
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:10.141
An accident?

288
00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:13.441
Are you saying she tripped or something?

289
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:16.641
Of course, it's not as simple as that.

290
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:20.041
Finding the entrance of the tower, she came up here

291
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.941
and discovered the buttons of three colors.

292
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.941
First, I'm sure she opened the door leading to the roof

293
00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:29.041
to let the light in.

294
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:31.341
Conan, you're there, aren't you?

295
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.441
Yes, Pops, I'm here!

296
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:37.141
Okay, got you.

297
00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:46.141
And she pushed the button. The blue button.

298
00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:47.741
I would like to let you know that

299
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:52.241
I, myself haven't tested that button yet either.

300
00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:54.241
However, I do know that something happened

301
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:58.341
and because of that something, the victim fell off the tower.

302
00:17:58.341 --> 00:18:00.941
I assume that's what happened.

303
00:18:00.941 --> 00:18:03.141
Conan, push it, will you?

304
00:18:03.141 --> 00:18:06.341
Yes, sir! The blue button, right?

305
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:14.641
What the? What's happening?

306
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.941
Amazing!

307
00:18:30.941 --> 00:18:34.241
It's understandable that she, thinking that there would be treasure

308
00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:36.641
was shocked out of her wits and fell to her death.

309
00:18:36.641 --> 00:18:38.341
A holograph?

310
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:41.441
I guess it was considered cutting edge technology back then.

311
00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:44.341
40 years ago?

312
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:47.441
Theoretically, it was known from way in the past,

313
00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:48.741
but it was in 1971

314
00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:52.741
when hologram using a laser beam was invented.

315
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:56.441
I saw it on TV the other day!

316
00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:00.441
Although very unfortunate,

317
00:19:00.441 --> 00:19:03.441
Mrs. Kyodo, was taken by surprise by the hologram

318
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:05.341
fell to her death from the roof...

319
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.341
I have no choice but to conclude it as a tragic accident.

320
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.641
So, Momoe went berserk till the very end.

321
00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:16.141
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

322
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:18.041
How strange, though.

323
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.841
According to Tsutomu's memory, if the blue button is pushed,

324
00:19:20.841 --> 00:19:23.141
the treasure was supposed to appear, right?

325
00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:25.641
I heard from Pops

326
00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:28.041
the reason why Mrs. Kyodo pushed the wrong button.

327
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:29.841
What? She made a mistake?

328
00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:33.341
She did push the blue button, right?

329
00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:38.641
You called the nice green vegetables blue, right?

330
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:41.941
Getting vegetables ready

331
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:45.141
is more of an important hobby to me.

332
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:48.141
You also used "blue" to describe watercress, didn't you?

333
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:52.541
That "blue" (green) color of the watercress stimulates the appetite.

334
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:53.741
Wrong!

335
00:19:53.741 --> 00:19:56.941
When I said blue button, I meant the green one!

336
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:58.141
What?

337
00:19:58.141 --> 00:19:59.341
True.

338
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:03.241
There are many people who refer to the color green as blue.

339
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:07.041
But the victim took the word blue literally.

340
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.741
I guess you can call this a tragedy

341
00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:11.541
caused by the ambiguity of the Japanese language.

342
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:15.841
But if Mom pushed the green button, then what?

343
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:20.441
She would've seen what Seitaro wanted to show Tsutomu.

344
00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:23.941
You're all safe after all.

345
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:25.341
Alive and kicking.

346
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:27.841
Mr. Nagase rescued us.

347
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:31.241
He got me out of the elevator that broke down!

348
00:20:31.241 --> 00:20:35.241
Mr. Nagase kept trouble down to a minimum for us.

349
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:36.941
I'm sorry

350
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:39.041
that you had to go through a frightening experience

351
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:41.241
because I delayed making repairs.

352
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.441
What's with you, Nagase?

353
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.541
You mean you knew everything and didn't say a word about it?

354
00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:48.841
Seitaro told me.

355
00:20:48.841 --> 00:20:50.041
If I told Nozomi,

356
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.841
he would say to demolish it right away.

357
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.041
So, he told me that until the time came for Tsutomu

358
00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:56.941
to succeed the family, he would leave it up to me.

359
00:20:56.941 --> 00:21:02.541
But Tsutomu has no intention of succeeding the Kyodo family business,

360
00:21:02.541 --> 00:21:05.041
forgetting the words he said when he was a child.

361
00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.941
If the amusement park inside the tunnel is made public,

362
00:21:07.941 --> 00:21:11.941
everbody would really be happy!

363
00:21:11.941 --> 00:21:13.241
When I grow up,

364
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:15.841
I'm going show them this land of dreams!

365
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.741
Wanting him to recall those words,

366
00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:22.141
I returned to the Dark Tower to make renovations.

367
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:24.641
So, that was the other button?

368
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:26.441
The green one?

369
00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:28.241
That's right.

370
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:32.441
The last treasure that Seitaro had hidden in the tower.

371
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:35.341
May I push that button?

372
00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:24.041
Wow! Fantastic!

373
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.841
It's a super humongous kaleidoscope!

374
00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:29.541
This is a kaleidoscope? Gigantic!

375
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.541
When the oil inside flows,

376
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:35.141
it creates millions and billions of arrays of different patterns.

377
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:38.141
So, this is the dream that Grandpa made.

378
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.641
-Dad! -What?

379
00:23:40.641 --> 00:23:42.841
Are you going to destroy all this?

380
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:44.741
The treasure of the Kyodo family?

381
00:23:44.741 --> 00:23:46.741
-Shut up! -No!

382
00:23:46.741 --> 00:23:50.041
I won't let you do that as the 3rd generation successor!

383
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:52.441
I promised to Grandpa

384
00:23:52.441 --> 00:23:55.441
that I would make Kyodo a factory of dreams.

385
00:23:57.841 --> 00:24:00.841
Do it if you dare.
