00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.982
the stork brings new life and good fortune to homes

3
00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:09.582
on which it stops to rest.

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:15.282
And the small storks we just encountered

5
00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.782

such as the Amanohashidate,

21

known as one of the "three representations of Japanese scenery".

This feels good!

28
00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:00.744
This must be the foot bath!

This feels good!

30
00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:06.244
Awesome, the weather is great too!

31
00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:08.844
Can't wait to get to the open-air bath!

32
00:03:08.844 --> 00:03:11.244
I didn't think much of hot springs,

33
00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:13.044
but I think I'm starting to like it.

34
00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:14.644
Excuse me.

35
00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:17.444
Sorry! Can you move down just a bit?

36
00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:19.344
My, we have nerves. I feel bad about it!

37
00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.144
Pardon us!

38
00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:23.944
It's because you're too fat!

39
00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:26.544
Look who's talking!

40
00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:29.444
As I suspected, it's not all that good.

41
00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:32.044
Let's go to all the spas, okay?

42
00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:35.044
I wonder where Genta and the others started from.

43
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:39.144
This feels good.

45
00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:42.044

I got Mandara Spa!

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.244
Crab ice cream after the bath hits the spot.

49
00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:52.744
Next, we're headed to Ichino Spa.

50
00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:54.144
Genta!

51
00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:56.744
You're dripping ice cream on your badge!

52
00:03:56.744 --> 00:03:59.144

Thanks, Uncle.

60
00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:19.444
Does he think I'm a stork?

61
00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:20.544
Don't you worry!

62
00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.244
It was recommended by a client from a previous case that I solved!

63
00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.944
Actually, I solved that.

64
00:04:28.944 --> 00:04:32.344
Anyway, how did you sprain your ankle?

65
00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:34.244
Well...

69
00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:46.044

I don't want to tell you about it!

73
00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:02.744
I bet you weren't paying attention to where you were going.

74
00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.644
Gotta pay, attention?

75
00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:10.644

Well, have it your way then!

Beer is nice,

118
00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:22.244
but Japanese sake with hot water from the hot spring is exceptional!

119
00:07:22.244 --> 00:07:24.944
Great! Just keep at it!

120
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.044

123
00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:34.244
-That's three. -Hey!

124
00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:36.844
Ta-da! I got crab sticks!

125
00:07:39.144 --> 00:07:40.944
I know you're just being your usual self,

126
00:07:40.944 --> 00:07:43.344
but how much more are you going to eat, Genta?

127
00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:45.844
I still have to get to the horse-beef steak!

128
00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:46.844
Horse-beef?

129
00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:49.244
You know, both horse meat and beef.

130
00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:50.944
It's a local specialty.

131
00:07:50.944 --> 00:07:54.544
"Horse Beef" -You mean...

132
00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.644
-Tajima beef? -Huh?

133
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.744
It doesn't mean you can shorten it just because you can't read it!

134
00:08:00.744 --> 00:08:03.944
What? It's not a combination of horse and beef?

135
00:08:03.944 --> 00:08:06.644
I thought I was getting a good deal.

136
00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:10.444
Genta ate a whole bunch for breakfast.

137
00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:12.344
Huh? Where's Sister Ran?

138
00:08:12.344 --> 00:08:15.844
Well... We've lost her a while ago.

139
00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:17.544
Where could she be?

140
00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:19.744
I just saw Sister Ran!

141
00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:23.644
-Really? -Yes, I recall it was by the Yanagi Spa.

142
00:08:23.644 --> 00:08:26.344
See.

143
00:08:26.344 --> 00:08:29.544
The person in this photo is Ran, right?

144
00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:32.144
Who is that girl in the photo with her?

145
00:08:33.544 --> 00:08:36.344
Mitsuhiko, let me take a look at the left.

146
00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:39.144
-Like this? -Yes.

147
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.944
This guy is...

148
00:08:40.944 --> 00:08:42.444
This man...

149
00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:44.944
-This guy ticked me off! -What?

150
00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:48.044
He's the guy that bumped into Genta and didn't apologize!

151
00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:53.744
Genta!

152
00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:56.044
What the heck is his problem?

153
00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:00.744
My crab ice cream!

154
00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:02.744
That was only my second one!

155
00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:06.244
Is that man following Ran and the girl?

156
00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:08.544
Gotta call Sister Ran regardless.

157
00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:12.144
The phone you are trying to reach

158
00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:16.244
is either out of the service area or turned off and...

159
00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:17.744
What's up, what's up?

160
00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:20.244
Are you guys talking about lunch?

161
00:09:20.244 --> 00:09:23.444
-Sister Ran disappeared. -What?

162
00:09:23.444 --> 00:09:25.444
She's not answering her phone either!

163
00:09:25.444 --> 00:09:27.044
What's going on?

164
00:09:27.044 --> 00:09:28.844
Things are getting interesting!

165
00:09:28.844 --> 00:09:31.344
Hey, the close-up is over!

166
00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:33.144
What?

167
00:09:33.144 --> 00:09:35.744
But I've already informed the editor!

168
00:09:35.744 --> 00:09:37.744
My daughter is missing.

169
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.544
I'm sorry, but this is it.

170
00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:42.644
-Can't you do something about it? -Don't be so pushy!

171
00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:44.944
There goes my chance to make a breakthrough.

172
00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:46.844
Darn it!

173
00:09:46.844 --> 00:09:49.144
So, don't we have any clues

174
00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.144
that'll leads us to Ran's whereabouts?

175
00:09:51.144 --> 00:09:52.544
Well...

176
00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:56.144
If I only knew who that girl is...

177
00:09:56.144 --> 00:09:59.944
What's wrong? Walking on crutches...

178
00:09:59.944 --> 00:10:02.344
Did you fall down and twist your ankle?

179
00:10:02.344 --> 00:10:03.444
Hattori!

180
00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:05.344
I mean, Brother Heiji?

181
00:10:05.344 --> 00:10:07.644
What a coincidence to see you here.

182
00:10:07.644 --> 00:10:09.544
Where's Ran?

183
00:10:09.544 --> 00:10:11.944
Ran disappeared!

184
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.544
-What? -Disappeared?

185
00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:17.744
Yes, she is supposedly with this girl.

186
00:10:17.744 --> 00:10:19.044
Girl?

187
00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:21.244
Wait a minute! This girl...

188
00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:23.344
You know her?

189
00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:25.344
Sure I know her.

190
00:10:25.344 --> 00:10:29.144
We're here to find that kid.

191
00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:31.644
Haruna Tabuse, 8 years old.

192
00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:35.044
The only daughter of the president of a famous restaurant franchise.

193
00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:37.044
She's been missing since yesterday.

194
00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:39.444
-What? -Missing?

195
00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:42.544
Mr. Tabuse!

196
00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:44.744
Sorry to keep you waiting.

197
00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:45.744
Hattori!

198
00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:46.944
"Shuhei Tabuse (42)" -Where's Haruna?

199
00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:49.144
Did you find my daughter Haruna?

200
00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:53.044
Not yet, but we have a solid clue.

201
00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:54.944
Really?

202
00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:57.644
By the way, who's this?

203
00:10:57.644 --> 00:10:59.744
He's a detective from Tokyo.

204
00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:01.644
I'm Kogoro Mouri.

205
00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:03.544
Mouri... The...

206
00:11:03.544 --> 00:11:05.944
The infamous detective?

207
00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:07.844
Huh?

208
00:11:07.844 --> 00:11:09.844
What is that stain?

209
00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:12.244
And this little one is...

210
00:11:12.244 --> 00:11:14.144
I'm Conan Edogawa!

211
00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:15.944
"Little" was so unnecessary.

212
00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:19.344
Man, why are you following us?

213
00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:20.944
Stay out of this, little brat!

214
00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:24.044
Well, I'm worried about Sister Ran!

215
00:11:24.044 --> 00:11:25.644
Sister Ran?

216
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:31.644
Actually, it looks like your daughter is with our daughter Ran.

217
00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:34.444
Your daughter kidnapped Haruna?

218
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.044
Say something!

219
00:11:36.044 --> 00:11:37.744
Now, now...

220
00:11:37.744 --> 00:11:38.944
"Kinosaki Base Spring"

221
00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:41.644
Meat bun made from Tajima beef.

222
00:11:45.444 --> 00:11:46.944
So good!

223
00:11:46.944 --> 00:11:50.644
The Tajima meat bun is tasty!

224
00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:52.544
This crab bun looks delicious, too!

225
00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:56.544
Hey! Stop! I'm not your wallet!

226
00:11:56.544 --> 00:12:00.244
Come on, treat me a bit.

227
00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:01.944
By a "bit", you mean

228
00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:04.244
ten hot spring eggs, five pork buns,

229
00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:05.644
and four beef buns?

230
00:12:05.644 --> 00:12:09.244
That's not fair! Conan took off without us.

231
00:12:09.244 --> 00:12:13.344
I guess something really happened to Ran?

232
00:12:13.344 --> 00:12:17.144
At least Edogawa seems to think so.

233
00:12:17.144 --> 00:12:21.744
Then, let's find Sister Ran before Conan does!

234
00:12:21.744 --> 00:12:25.044
I agree! That's the way the Youth Detectives roll!

235
00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.544
There wouldn't be a problem if we can do that.

236
00:12:27.544 --> 00:12:30.744
Our only clue is that photo.

237
00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:32.844
Right.

238
00:12:32.844 --> 00:12:34.744
This backpack!

239
00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:37.744
It's the same one that I wanted!

240
00:12:37.744 --> 00:12:39.444
The same?

241
00:12:39.444 --> 00:12:42.344
See, on this brochure...

242
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.144
Isn't this the backpack?

243
00:12:45.444 --> 00:12:48.844
I'm so sorry. I lost my temper.

244
00:12:48.844 --> 00:12:51.744
Please, don't worry about it.

245
00:12:51.744 --> 00:12:54.444
Mr. Tabuse. If it's okay with you,

246
00:12:54.444 --> 00:12:56.644
can you tell us what happened from the beginning?

247
00:12:56.644 --> 00:12:58.144
Sure.

248
00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.044
It all started yesterday.

249
00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:03.144
An exhibition piece was stolen yesterday

250
00:13:03.144 --> 00:13:06.544
from the Tabuse Museum in Kobe.

251
00:13:06.544 --> 00:13:10.844
It happened while we were rearranging the exhibition.

252
00:13:10.844 --> 00:13:12.744
And around the same time,

253
00:13:12.744 --> 00:13:19.244
my daughter Haruna who was visiting the museum also disappeared.

254
00:13:19.244 --> 00:13:21.744
I was here in Kinosaki for business,

255
00:13:21.744 --> 00:13:24.144
"Kamachi Takeshi (45)" -received word from Director Kamachi,

256
00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:25.644
then with the help of my colleague,

257
00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:28.544
I requested Hattori to search for my daughter.

258
00:13:28.544 --> 00:13:31.644
So, what was the stolen piece?

259
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.644
It was a piece called "The Rainbow's Child"

260
00:13:33.644 --> 00:13:36.644
by a sculptor named Kaho Handa.

261
00:13:36.644 --> 00:13:38.144
Let's see.

262
00:13:40.044 --> 00:13:43.744
So this is the sculpture of "The Rainbow's Child".

263
00:13:43.744 --> 00:13:45.744
So that means, when this sculpture was stolen,

264
00:13:45.744 --> 00:13:50.944
Haruna just happened to be there and was kidnapped.

265
00:13:50.944 --> 00:13:54.144
Where could Haruna be?

266
00:13:54.144 --> 00:13:57.244
By the way, what about the clue?

267
00:13:57.244 --> 00:14:01.744
In fact, it looks like Haruna is here in Kinosaki.

268
00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:04.544
In Kinosaki?

269
00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:05.744
This is...

270
00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:09.644
It's Haruna! No doubt about it!

271
00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:12.044
Who is that man in the corner?

272
00:14:12.044 --> 00:14:14.144
We don't have proof,

273
00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:16.144
but we suspect he's probably the kidnapper!

274
00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:19.344
So it seems like your daughter ran away from the kidnapper,

275
00:14:19.344 --> 00:14:20.644
bumped into Ran,

276
00:14:20.644 --> 00:14:23.344
and they're on the run together!

277
00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:27.644
Ran. Why aren't you contacting us at all?

278
00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:29.244
Could it be...

279
00:14:30.444 --> 00:14:32.444
The man already...

280
00:14:41.008 --> 00:14:42.308
"Toyooka Caban Street"

281
00:14:42.308 --> 00:14:44.808
Toyooka means bags!

282
00:14:44.808 --> 00:14:47.808
Look, a bag vending machine!

283
00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:49.208
What a rare sight!

284
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:50.908
Gotta buy one! Gotta buy it!

285
00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:53.108
The stork design looks nice!

286
00:14:53.108 --> 00:14:55.508
Hey, why don't you buy one too?

287
00:14:55.508 --> 00:14:57.108
Hey, let me go!

288
00:15:04.908 --> 00:15:06.508
Excuse me.

289
00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:09.408
-Awesome! -It's full of bags!

290
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.808
We're looking for a girl.

291
00:15:11.808 --> 00:15:16.408
Was there a girl who ordered the same bag like that one over there?

292
00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:18.008
Can you hang on for a minute?

293
00:15:18.008 --> 00:15:20.108
Go ahead, please listen to them.

294
00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:22.208
I'll be alright.

295
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:23.708
I apologize.

296
00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:26.708
-By "backpack", you mean this one? -Yes.

297
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:30.808
If it is, the most recent one was for Mr. Tabuse's Haruna.

298
00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:32.708
It was a pink backpack!

299
00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:34.808
Then, I'm pretty sure.

300
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.608
Um...

301
00:15:36.608 --> 00:15:39.308
"Iruka Yui (23), Dolphin Trainer" -Are you guys Haruna's friends?

302
00:15:39.308 --> 00:15:41.408
Something happen to Haruna?

303
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:44.508
-Kinosaki Marine World? -Yes.

304
00:15:44.508 --> 00:15:47.408
The dolphin trainer who knows Haruna

305
00:15:47.408 --> 00:15:50.508
called her colleague on a hunch,

306
00:15:50.508 --> 00:15:52.608
then they told her that they saw the two that fit the description.

307
00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:53.708
Really?

308
00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:57.108
I'll give you a call when I find out more.

309
00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:59.808
Hey! I'll be there too...

310
00:15:59.808 --> 00:16:01.608
Hold on!

311
00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:04.908
There are still things that need to be investigated in this city.

312
00:16:04.908 --> 00:16:07.208
I'll move for you!

313
00:16:07.208 --> 00:16:10.808
You just sit tight and tell us what we need to do!

314
00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:13.108
Hattori...

315
00:16:13.108 --> 00:16:14.308
I appreciate it.

316
00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.308
By the way, what happened to your leg?

317
00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:20.808
You weren't paying too much attention to that girl, were you?

318
00:16:20.808 --> 00:16:23.008
No way!

319
00:16:23.408 --> 00:16:26.108
"Kinosaki Marine World"

320
00:16:34.008 --> 00:16:35.108
Awesome!

321
00:16:35.108 --> 00:16:36.808
Yui, you're cool!

322
00:16:38.608 --> 00:16:40.708
This is Genta, the sea lion!

323
00:16:42.508 --> 00:16:44.008
Check it out! His name is Genta!

324
00:16:44.008 --> 00:16:45.408
It's huge!

325
00:16:45.408 --> 00:16:48.008
Looks just like you. You two brothers?

326
00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.508
How is that possible!

327
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:53.208
We're not here to have fun.

328
00:17:04.808 --> 00:17:07.908
She was also doing the same at that bag store.

329
00:17:08.608 --> 00:17:11.208
Have you seen this child?

330
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:13.908
I'm looking for this child.

331
00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:16.208
I've seen this child.

332
00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:21.208
There. They were visiting the Kishimojin.

333
00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:23.808
Was searching for something?

334
00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:27.408
Yeah, while going around the spas

335
00:17:27.408 --> 00:17:28.708
and the usual tourist spots.

336
00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:32.408
And, have you heard of the Legend of Kishimojin?

337
00:17:32.408 --> 00:17:34.708
"The Legend of Kishimojin"?

338
00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:37.208
I think...

339
00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:41.208
In ancient India, there was a demon with a thousand children,

340
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:44.408
feared for eating human children.

341
00:17:44.408 --> 00:17:49.308
One day, Shakyamuni Buddha hid the demon's youngest child.

342
00:17:49.308 --> 00:17:51.908
Buddha taught the mourning demon a lesson

343
00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:55.908
on how the parents suffered the loss of their children.

344
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.408
From that point on,

345
00:17:58.408 --> 00:18:00.708
the reformed demon became the God of easy delivery

346
00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:03.308
and the protector of children, the Kishimojin.

347
00:18:03.308 --> 00:18:07.608
They were also searching for something around the Kishimojin shrine.

348
00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:11.108
Are they really being chased?

349
00:18:11.108 --> 00:18:13.008
Seems to me like

350
00:18:13.008 --> 00:18:15.608
Ran is being dragged around on a kid's sightseeing tour.

351
00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:18.808
Yeah, I recognize her.

352
00:18:18.808 --> 00:18:21.808
It's probably the family in this photo.

353
00:18:21.808 --> 00:18:24.108
This photo is from three years ago.

354
00:18:24.108 --> 00:18:29.208
Haruna Tabuse. Her father, Shuuhei, her mother, Kaho.

355
00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:32.808
Kaho? If I'm not mistaken, Kaho is...

356
00:18:32.808 --> 00:18:35.508
The sculptor of "The Rainbow's Child",

357
00:18:35.508 --> 00:18:38.808
Handa Kaho is your ex-wife

358
00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:41.508
and also Haruna's mother.

359
00:18:41.508 --> 00:18:43.308
Why didn't you tell us?

360
00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:47.008
That's a first for me too, Mr. Tabuse.

361
00:18:47.008 --> 00:18:49.508
I wasn't trying to hide the fact.

362
00:18:49.508 --> 00:18:52.308
Where is Kaho now?

363
00:18:54.408 --> 00:18:57.008
That woman is...

364
00:18:57.008 --> 00:19:00.308
That woman is a demon who took art over her own daughter!

365
00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:02.908
I don't know where she is! I don't even want to know!

366
00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:05.608
Mr. Tabuse.

367
00:19:05.608 --> 00:19:08.608
But why did you exhibit

368
00:19:08.608 --> 00:19:10.408
the piece of a person whom you won't forgive?

369
00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:13.708
That is...

370
00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.508
-I got it! That woman did it! -What?

371
00:19:17.608 --> 00:19:20.708
That woman stole "The Rainbow's Child"!

372
00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:23.608
Or, she made Haruna take it.

373
00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:26.308
That's what happened!

374
00:19:26.308 --> 00:19:31.008
So, does that mean that suspicious person is Kaho in disguise?

375
00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:35.208
I think that's a bit premature.

376
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:37.708
That thing, Kabachi.

377
00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:39.508
All right.

378
00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:43.108
A letter from Kaho addressed to Ms. Haruna.

379
00:19:43.108 --> 00:19:45.708
It was found by and acquired from the President.

380
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.208
Excuse me.

381
00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:49.308
May I take a look?

382
00:19:49.308 --> 00:19:51.408
Sure.

383
00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:55.208
Let's see. "Kinosaki Springs and the Marine World.

384
00:19:55.208 --> 00:19:57.408
That was fun, wasn't it?

385
00:19:57.408 --> 00:19:59.708
Sure, you were still small,

386
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:01.708
so you might not remember much."

387
00:20:01.708 --> 00:20:02.808
It's the same!

388
00:20:02.808 --> 00:20:06.008
The spas, play ground, and Kiyamachi Square.

389
00:20:06.008 --> 00:20:08.808
Haruna's appeared in all the locations mentioned in this letter!

390
00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:14.308
So, Haruna is revisiting the locations they had visited in the past!

391
00:20:14.308 --> 00:20:17.108
That woman is waiting for Haruna

392
00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:19.208
and "The Rainbow's Child" at one of those locations.

393
00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:22.708
No. Then, they'll just need to specify a location.

394
00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:25.708
This is irritating me.

395
00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:28.108
-That's strange. -What's strange?

396
00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:29.908
Haruna also stopped by

397
00:20:29.908 --> 00:20:33.708
the Kinosaki Straw Crafting Tradition Hall

398
00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:36.208
that's not mentioned in the letter.

399
00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:38.008
On the other hand, they didn't stop by

400
00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:41.308
the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall that's in the letter.

401
00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:44.308
Let me see!

402
00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:48.208
"I unexpectedly saw my friend, Michiko's straw craft

403
00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:50.908
at the Kinosaki Art and Literature Hall and..."

404
00:20:50.908 --> 00:20:52.708
Who's Michiko?

405
00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:54.908
Kaho's high school classmate

406
00:20:54.908 --> 00:20:56.808
and a straw crafting artist.

407
00:20:56.808 --> 00:21:00.708
But, how come Haruna went to where she's never been?

408
00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:03.208
The memory is from three years ago, when she was five years old.

409
00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:05.008
She probably doesn't remember.

410
00:21:05.008 --> 00:21:07.008
Is that so?

411
00:21:07.008 --> 00:21:09.708
Something doesn't feel right.

412
00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:11.508
What's this?

413
00:21:11.508 --> 00:21:15.408
"I'll keep it with the memory of our trip."

414
00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:19.108
Hey, hey. What is the "it" mentioned here in the letter?

415
00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:21.408
I don't know.

416
00:21:21.408 --> 00:21:25.208
More important is where the daughter is headed next.

417
00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:30.808
That is probably Kinosaki Springs Station mentioned in the letter!

418
00:21:38.608 --> 00:21:43.208
"Jibo Kannon Statue"

419
00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:46.708
Yes! Maybe it's here!

420
00:21:46.708 --> 00:21:51.008
Hey, Haruna. What have you been looking for?

421
00:21:51.008 --> 00:21:52.308
Hey!

422
00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:57.708
Where is it? Where is it?

423
00:22:02.108 --> 00:22:04.208
Let me go!

424
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.708
Haruna!

425
00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:09.408
Let go of her!

426
00:22:09.408 --> 00:22:10.908
Don't move!

427
00:22:12.908 --> 00:22:14.408
Haruna!

428
00:22:16.608 --> 00:22:17.908
Where did you put it?

429
00:22:17.908 --> 00:22:19.908
-I don't know! -Stop right there!

430
00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:25.308
Haruna! Contact the police, now!

431
00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:34.208
Miss!

432
00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:08.208
"Next Episode" -Sorry, Ran.

433
00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:10.808
If I could only move the way I wanted to...

434
00:24:10.808 --> 00:24:13.608
Bingo! Haruna's making a move!

435
00:24:13.608 --> 00:24:17.308
Finally, this is more like the Youth Detectives!

436
00:24:17.308 --> 00:24:19.508
The sound of drums coming from the badge?

437
00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:23.508
Seems like you're thoughts are the same as mine, Kudou.

438
00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:27.608
Somebody... Somebody help!

439
00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:30.408
Ran, wait for me!

440
00:24:30.408 --> 00:24:35.890
Next Conan, "Stork Mystery Tour (Pursuing Haruna)"

441
00:24:51.202 --> 00:24:53.402
Next Conan's Hint:

442
00:24:53.402 --> 00:24:56.002
"The Detectives Badge"

443
00:24:56.002 --> 00:24:58.702
Got it, this badge will solve the case for sure!

444
00:24:58.702 --> 00:25:00.602
Genta, it's cold and it means delicious crabs.
