1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.770
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.690
Conan's logic works great on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.850
Today's case is a stalker!
Let's think about what bothers people!

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.930
He sees the single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.510
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.060
His name?

7
00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.719
The Stalker Murder Case.

8
00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.569
The air's so fresh!

9
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.289
It sure is nice in
the early morning!

10
00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.719
Yeah! Today is
perfect walking weather!

11
00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.569
It was still dark when you woke
me up. I didn't get enough sleep!

12
00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.049
Guts-Man!

13
00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.449
Hold on a sec.

14
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.729
Are you going to drink something?

15
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.569
I'm so sleepy I can't keep up...

16
00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.249
Two came out! I'm so lucky!

17
00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.909
Are you sure there
wasn't one already there?

18
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.669
I wouldn't drink it if I were you...

19
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.569
But there are no signs
of it being opened,

20
00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.609
and nothing looks
out of the ordinary.

21
00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.489
Doesn't smell strange, either.

22
00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.489
Someone probably just forgot
it after buying a bunch of 'em.

23
00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.609
Over there!

24
00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.239
Ran! Get an ambulance!

25
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:18.939
Right!

26
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.719
Come on! Hang in there!

27
00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.779
Hey!

28
00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:28.739
Guts-Man!

29
00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.809
Hey! Did you drink that?!

30
00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.229
Could it have been poisoned?!

31
00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.699
The deceased is Nagai
Tatsuya-san, 26.

32
00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.699
He lived on 3rd Street
in Midori-dai.

33
00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.959
Two train stops from here.

34
00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.169
What's the matter?

35
00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.549
I just thought I saw
him somewhere before...

36
00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.529
There's paint on his shoulder...

37
00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.699
Inspector.

38
00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.439
The poison in the Guts-Man might
be an organic phosphate compound.

39
00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.649
Organic phosphate?

40
00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.359
Yes. Small amounts cause
nausea or drooling,

41
00:04:24.609 --> 00:04:28.779
while large amounts result
in respiratory failure.

42
00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:34.699
Inspector Megure. This was
an indiscriminate murder.

43
00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.699
What?!

44
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.879
Follow me!

45
00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.379
Where are you going, Mori-kun?!

46
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:45.569
Now, then.

47
00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.599
The killer placed the poisoned
Guts-Man in the corner like so.

48
00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.349
Then Nagai-san stopped by
and bought a Guts-Man.

49
00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:09.199
But it was the poisoned one
he took, not the one he purchased.

50
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.829
Then, after drinking it, the poison
took effect and he collapsed.

51
00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:24.339
But is there proof the killer put
the poisoned Guts-Man in there?

52
00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:25.859
Yes.

53
00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.319
This.

54
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.739
I bought a Guts-Man here as well.

55
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.309
When I did, I found an
extra bottle down there.

56
00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.559
Say, there's a seal on
that Guts-Man!

57
00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:49.449
It's for a special campaign,
but it ended three days ago!

58
00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.579
As proof, there aren't
any on your bottles.

59
00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:56.079
No, there aren't.

60
00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.039
Nor on this one!

61
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.689
I see. This may
serve as a vital clue.

62
00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.469
I just remembered! I stopped
and questioned that man before!

63
00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:11.549
What?!

64
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.659
It was about three weeks ago.

65
00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.819
A woman in an apartment up
ahead reported being troubled

66
00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.819
by a creepy man who
constantly followed her around.

67
00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.439
That's when I found
this man loitering out in front!

68
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.909
So that means he was a stalker!

69
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.909
Yes. He followed
her because he liked her.

70
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:41.249
But he hadn't actually done anything,
so I gave him a stern warning.

71
00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.539
What was his job?

72
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.209
He said he was studying
for entrance exams.

73
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.179
Is that woman's
apartment near here?

74
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.639
Yeah, just past where he died...

75
00:06:54.989 --> 00:07:00.139
So maybe he was heading
there again? Or following her?!

76
00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:01.939
Well?

77
00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:06.319
But she didn't report
anything since then,

78
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.899
so I figured he had
stopped following her...

79
00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.359
Alright! Let's go
talk to her for now!

80
00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.619
He's dead?!

81
00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:23.579
Yes. He consumed a poisoned
energy drink only forty minutes ago.

82
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.299
Pardon my asking,
but where were you at the time?

83
00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:32.259
Forty minutes ago?

84
00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.139
I had just gotten home...

85
00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.909
I work at a restaurant in Haido.

86
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:45.479
We close up at 4:00,
so I left around 5:00.

87
00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:49.109
Did you take the train
to Beika Station?

88
00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:49.859
Yes.

89
00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.659
And did you walk home from there?

90
00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:53.449
Yes.

91
00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.609
Which means it's just as Conan said...

92
00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:59.739
Let us see your map.

93
00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:00.409
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:11.319
Nishitani-san. Please show us
what route you took coming home.

95
00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.569
Alright...

96
00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:15.889
I went from the station like so.

97
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:17.819
Just as I thought!

98
00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:22.679
She passed by the vending machine
and the spot where he collapsed!

99
00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:25.559
What does that mean?!

100
00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.819
Nagai-san collapsed here.

101
00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.319
In other words,
he was following you.

102
00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:34.069
That can't be!

103
00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:40.789
And I was so relieved once he
disappeared after he was warned!

104
00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:45.609
Did she really not realize
she was being followed?

105
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.539
The windows and door
have extra locks...

106
00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:53.009
And she even has
defense spray ready...

107
00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:59.279
Were these merely from when
she was afraid of her stalker?

108
00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:04.389
It was an organic phosphate
compound in the Guts-Man.

109
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:08.449
Only Nagai-san's fingerprints
were found on the bottle.

110
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:13.189
In other words, it's very likely
the killer prepared it in advance.

111
00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:17.659
Did you determine where that
Guts-Man bottle was purchased?

112
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:22.489
Not yet, but if it
was from that machine,

113
00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:28.989
then it was bought between yesterday
afternoon and seven days ago.

114
00:09:28.989 --> 00:09:37.009
Yesterday, the company replaced
all the bottles with seal-less ones.

115
00:09:37.319 --> 00:09:38.779
I see.

116
00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.389
Thank you.

117
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:48.309
Nagai-san's mother recently
moved here from Shizuoka.

118
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:53.899
I checked her
apartment and found this.

119
00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:59.409
Photos of that woman we spoke to.

120
00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:02.449
And they all seem to be sneak shots.

121
00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:07.659
I visited Nishitani-san
again before coming here.

122
00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:11.239
She had no idea
she was photographed...

123
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:13.379
She seemed extremely shocked.

124
00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:14.629
Huh?

125
00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:17.239
That's not the same apartment...

126
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:19.859
And that's not a restaurant...

127
00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:25.569
She lived in Yokohama,
where she worked at a bakery

128
00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:29.519
and dreamed of
opening her own store.

129
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:33.979
Did she move here
to escape Nagai-san?

130
00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:35.359
Apparently so.

131
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:39.819
But she couldn't sleep due to fear,

132
00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:44.949
so she started working
nights at a restaurant instead.

133
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:47.909
She must've been so scared. Poor girl...

134
00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:52.819
But Nagai-san received money
from his father, an ironsmith,

135
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.709
so he didn't need to work.

136
00:10:55.709 --> 00:11:00.239
Meaning he could follow
her whenever he wanted.

137
00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:03.179
That's one lousy man
she got caught up with.

138
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:06.109
About her...

139
00:11:06.109 --> 00:11:09.639
Did she really not know
she was being followed?

140
00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:14.309
I agree. There's something about her!

141
00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:18.779
Are you saying she poisoned
the Guts-Man and had him drink it?

142
00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:22.319
We can't rule it out.

143
00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:27.489
Perhaps she knew
she was being followed,

144
00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:30.319
bought a Guts-Man from that machine,

145
00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:33.209
and left the poisoned
one when she picked it up.

146
00:11:33.989 --> 00:11:38.819
If Nagai-san also bought
one and grabbed the wrong one--

147
00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:44.159
But there was no guarantee
he'd buy the same drink...

148
00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.219
Say, Inspector.

149
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:49.679
You're forgetting
something important. Look.

150
00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:52.489
See how the bottom ring is cut?

151
00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:57.729
Nobody would drink it if they saw
the cap had already been undone.

152
00:11:57.989 --> 00:11:59.739
That's true!

153
00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:04.699
Which means the killer didn't
leave it in that vending machine?

154
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:07.989
Now nothing makes sense...

155
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:11.319
Oh, one other thing
about Nagai-san...

156
00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:17.359
His neighbors saw him leave his
apartment around 10:00 last night

157
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:19.859
with a small bag in hand.

158
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:24.009
He was empty-handed
when he collapsed this morning...

159
00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:28.969
It might have nothing to do with
the incident, but it bothers me...

160
00:12:28.969 --> 00:12:30.199
A bag?

161
00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:45.449
Isn't there a way she could've
had him drink an opened Guts-Man?

162
00:12:48.119 --> 00:12:49.579
Can't drink any more!

163
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:51.529
Conan-kun! Let's swim!

164
00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:54.359
I'm gonna stay here a little longer.

165
00:12:54.359 --> 00:12:56.039
I'm gonna go swim then!

166
00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.969
What's with you guys?

167
00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:07.889
Nothing!
Nothing!

168
00:13:11.989 --> 00:13:14.729
You're after the rest
of her cola, aren't you?

169
00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:18.159
Yeah, right! That's crazy talk!

170
00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:19.359
Yeah!

171
00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:21.159
Let's take a swim,
Mitsuhiko-kun!

172
00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.199
Good idea, Genta-san!

173
00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:23.449
It sure is hot!

174
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:25.609
That it is!

175
00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.819
Geez. Kids acting like perverts...

176
00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:33.529
That's it! I've figured it out!

177
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:43.501
I know how it was done,
but there's no proof!

178
00:13:45.961 --> 00:13:47.421
Oh! Policeman!

179
00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:51.311
Conan-kun, was it?

180
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:51.941
Yes!

181
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:53.091
Are you questioning people?

182
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:54.111
Yeah.

183
00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:59.891
I was hoping to learn that the
victim bought the Guts-Man here...

184
00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:03.601
Did you check the fingerprints
on the coins in the vending machine?

185
00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:07.611
Yes, but we didn't
find the victim's prints.

186
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:13.071
But we did find two coins totaling
110 yen that had been wiped clean.

187
00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:16.531
So the killer did
buy the Guts-Man here!

188
00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:19.651
If only this had
been a bigger shop...

189
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:22.991
Sometimes you'll catch
'em on surveillance video...

190
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.941
Video? What if-

191
00:14:25.941 --> 00:14:29.771
Say, did you check everything
Nagai-san was carrying?

192
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:33.551
What was he carrying?
Mr. Mori asked me to ask you.

193
00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:35.811
Okay...

194
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:37.561
Let's see...

195
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:42.971
A wallet, a license, cigarettes,
an apartment key, and a lighter.

196
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:45.431
A lighter?! What kind?!

197
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:51.401
It had a flip top and was a
little bigger than normal ones.

198
00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:54.191
Where is it now?

199
00:14:54.191 --> 00:14:56.441
We returned it to
the victim's mother.

200
00:14:56.441 --> 00:14:58.191
Great! Thanks!

201
00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:02.271
Pardon me!

202
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:02.781
Yes?

203
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:04.581
May I ask you something?

204
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:06.541
Sure...

205
00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:11.881
The paint that was on the victim!

206
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:14.961
Mister! Where did
you get that paint?!

207
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:19.181
Mori Detective Agency.

208
00:15:19.181 --> 00:15:22.141
Mori-kun. Megure here...

209
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.561
But didn't you call me here?

210
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.271
What are you talking about?

211
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.731
You called me here.

212
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:32.021
Huh?

213
00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:35.531
What is this about?
I need to leave for work...

214
00:15:35.531 --> 00:15:37.531
Um, well...

215
00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:43.911
Inspector! It appears I called you.

216
00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:47.331
Oh! It's started! Please continue!

217
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:51.521
Nishitani-san.
Please tell work you won't be in.

218
00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:57.801
Because you're the one who
poisoned and killed Nagai-san!

219
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:01.051
What are you--

220
00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:06.971
That morning, you knew
Nagai-san was following you

221
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:10.941
so you bought a Guts-Man
from that vending machine.

222
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.401
Let us call that Bottle A.

223
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:18.691
You then took your
pre-prepared Bottle B

224
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:24.441
and pretended to pick up
Bottle A as he watched on.

225
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:27.741
You removed the cap
and drank it as you walked.

226
00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:32.941
Then you put a closed bottle on a wall.

227
00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:36.521
But it was not the Bottle B
which you had just drunk;

228
00:16:36.521 --> 00:16:41.131
it was yet another bottle you had
prepared in advance: Bottle C.

229
00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:47.351
Incidentally, stalkers are known
to collect their prey's belongings.

230
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.681
So Nagai-san naturally
took Guts-Man Bottle C.

231
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:55.691
He found a large amount
of the drink left inside.

232
00:16:56.611 --> 00:17:01.071
As he was infatuated with you,
he happily drank it down...

233
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:04.371
...unaware it had been poisoned.

234
00:17:06.031 --> 00:17:09.651
The reason you left the
Guts-Man in the machine

235
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:12.111
was to make it look like
an indiscriminate murder.

236
00:17:13.271 --> 00:17:18.941
Your fingerprints were absent
from the coins used to buy Bottle A

237
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:21.771
and from empty Bottle C

238
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:29.861
because you likely put glue on
your fingers in the station restroom.

239
00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:32.561
Glue?!

240
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:40.691
When we first visited, she slyly
rubbed something off her fingers.

241
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:43.541
It was dried glue.

242
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:48.611
It's unnatural to wear
gloves this time of year,

243
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:53.201
and holding the bottle in a tissue
would've roused his suspicion.

244
00:17:53.201 --> 00:17:56.421
So you used glue instead.

245
00:17:57.111 --> 00:18:00.881
Theorize all you want.
You have no proof.

246
00:18:01.191 --> 00:18:03.361
Oh, but I do.

247
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:04.061
Conan!

248
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:07.311
Here.

249
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:13.471
These are--

250
00:18:21.231 --> 00:18:26.361
It seems you didn't know he
was secretly photographing you.

251
00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:31.771
I can't blame you; he was
using a customized camera.

252
00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:34.411
A customized camera?

253
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.871
This.

254
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:42.631
This lighter works like normal,

255
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:45.761
but slide this and it becomes a camera.

256
00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:48.631
This button works the shutter.

257
00:18:55.611 --> 00:19:02.651
He was good with his hands,
like his skilled ironsmith father.

258
00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:06.111
Closer inspection of those
photographs will show

259
00:19:06.611 --> 00:19:10.871
that there is a seal
on the Guts-Man there.

260
00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:15.291
The special campaign seal?

261
00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:21.191
As you said, all the Guts-Man
bottles in that vending machine

262
00:19:21.191 --> 00:19:27.901
were replaced with new, seal-less
bottles yesterday afternoon.

263
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:28.671
In other words...

264
00:19:29.231 --> 00:19:30.091
Yes.

265
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:34.401
I killed him.

266
00:19:35.021 --> 00:19:38.271
I thought he would kill me if I didn't.

267
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:40.731
What do you mean?

268
00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:45.021
One week ago, when I walked
down the station stairs...

269
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:58.331
His look said, "How dare you
tell the police! I'm gonna kill you!"

270
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:03.901
So I felt my only
choice was to kill him first!

271
00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:09.761
Inspector. It's a fact that
Nagai-san planned to kill her.

272
00:20:09.761 --> 00:20:11.111
What?!

273
00:20:11.111 --> 00:20:13.721
Look at the bag behind you.

274
00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:17.851
It belonged to Nagai-san,

275
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:25.271
and was hidden by a nearby lamppost
that had been freshly painted.

276
00:20:25.481 --> 00:20:28.141
Please have a look inside.

277
00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:36.191
Nagai-san probably planned to
get the bag when she came home,

278
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:41.611
wait for his chance to get inside
by cutting a hole in the window,

279
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:44.941
and then kill her with that knife.

280
00:20:45.941 --> 00:20:48.551
So she was almost--

281
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:51.901
It won't hold up as self-defense,

282
00:20:51.901 --> 00:20:56.471
but you'll likely get off
on mitigating circumstances.

283
00:20:57.061 --> 00:20:58.611
Nishitani-san.

284
00:20:58.611 --> 00:21:01.111
Atone for your sin
as quickly as possible

285
00:21:01.111 --> 00:21:07.401
and then continue toward your
dream of running your own bakery.

286
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:11.411
You're still so very young.

287
00:21:13.521 --> 00:21:15.911
Thank you.

288
00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:59.811
This case really made me think,
especially about stalkers.

289
00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:04.981
You do get clients who
talk about being followed

290
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:06.981
or receiving silent phone calls.

291
00:23:07.311 --> 00:23:10.811
Proving this kind of crime is difficult.

292
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:15.361
The police won't do much,
but even if they do do something,

293
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:20.901
the instant the crazed person
finds out you're strongly repulsed,

294
00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:23.911
they can turn into
a full-fledged criminal.

295
00:23:23.911 --> 00:23:27.481
Yeah, I'll need to be careful.

296
00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:32.331
Don't worry! Nobody'd ever
go crazy for a shrew like you!

297
00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:33.961
What'd you say?!

298
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:42.111
I never wanna be on her bad side!

299
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:54.901
Conan-kun!

300
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:03.781
There's no blood around
a part of his wrist!

301
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:06.981
The suspects are triplets?!

302
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:09.771
On the next Conan--

303
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:12.481
The Triplets Villa Murder Case.

304
00:24:14.054 --> 00:24:16.714
Next Conan's Hint:

305
00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:17.944
Home Run.
