"Soccer/J League"

00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,840
"Full Time Result"

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,940
They are taking it in right from the start.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,040
They are.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,240
Eventually the Japanese will understand what gambling is all about.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,540
It is 8 by 2 now.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,540
Should we proceed with buying?

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,140
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,840
It is taken care of.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
When the countdown reaches zero,

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,640
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,740
Though it started with some ominous English,

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,740
today's episode is set in a soccer stadium!

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:27,798
"The J League's Bodyguard"

18
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,698
Japan's performance at the World Cup was disappointing,

19
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,698
but tonight's key match will determine

20
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,298
the latter half of the J League season.

21
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:37,398
"Yasuaki Iwasada (40)" -Indeed.

22
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,298
"J League Employee" -The fans must know this,

23
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,798
as tickets are sold out.

24
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:44,898
The merchandise sales are also up by 30 percent.

25
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,398
Is that what's important to you?

26
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:50,098
Is 30 percent not enough?

27
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,598
It's not about the numbers.

28
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:54,398
Then there's tonight's match.

29
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,198
If the Spirits win,

30
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,598
given the remaining schedule...

31
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:00,998
That doesn't interest you?

32
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,198
What?

33
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,998
Nothing.

34
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:08,098
In any case, don't disappoint our fans.

35
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:09,898
Yes, sir. You can count on me.

36
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,098
"Toto Stadium"

37
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,198
Normally, only the team and their staff

38
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,298
use this entrance.

39
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:18,998
Only players and coaches can enter

40
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,198
the locker rooms down this hallway.

41
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:25,398
"Gamba Osaka" -Those doors are open right now,

42
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,998
but when the teams are inside, they're closed.

43
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,598
After that, they're not opened again

44
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,498
until the game's over.

45
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:35,698
In other words, no matter how close you are to your opponents,

46
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,698
you can't even talk to them.

47
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:41,098
What? Naturally, you can't use phones either.

48
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:42,598
I wasn't going to ask that.

49
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,698
Ai, you've been talking so much.

50
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:46,198
Is something up?

51
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,998
She's just overflowing with excitement

52
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,998
because we're at the stadium.

53
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,098
I'm the star here.

54
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,298
I just let you kids tag along with me.

55
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:55,998
You got that?

56
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,498
I'm surprised.

57
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,998
With a girl who knows so much about the stadium in your group,

58
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,998
you don't need me.

59
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:05,698
If it's something you like, you'll do well at it.

60
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,098
Something we like?

61
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,498
Since Big Osaka will be playing tonight,

62
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:10,498
Mr. Higo...

63
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:12,898
Sorry.

64
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:15,498
Should we check out the locker rooms while we can?

65
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,098
What? Really?

66
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,398
Aren't the rules strict?

67
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:21,198
Yeah, but the teams haven't entered yet.

68
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,598
Now's our only chance.

69
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,998
-Let's go! -You'd better be grateful, kids.

70
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,898
Who do you have to thank for this valuable experience?

71
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:30,198
Me?

72
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,298
The old man's bragging

73
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,998
because the game between Tokyo Spirits and Gamba Osaka

74
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,898
will be played here at Toto Stadium tonight,

75
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:42,298
and he's been given the honor of opening the game.

76
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,498
He's truly a great detective.

77
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,798
-It's so fancy! -It's wonderful!

78
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:50,098
Is this the locker room?

79
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:51,398
This is the lounge.

80
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:54,298
The players relax here before the game.

81
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,898
The locker room is back here.

82
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,098
We can't sit in these, can we?

83
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,698
You totally can.

84
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,998
-We can? -Really?

85
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,198
-Me, too! -Don't get it dirty.

86
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:07,598
I feel like a player after a match.

87
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,098
I bet sitting on this makes you better at soccer.

88
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,698
I know.

89
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,698
There's no way it does.

90
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:16,798
I found it!

91
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:18,998
Hide's autograph!

92
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:20,998
How can you tell?

93
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:24,498
The number 11's written next to it.

94
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,798
So that's how.

95
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,798
The Spirits' number 11 player

96
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,398
-is Hideo Akagi. -Yeah.

97
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:31,798
Miss, are you a fan of Hide?

98
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,798
Yeah. I heard Hide's coming back today.

99
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:37,998
He's been taking time off due to an injury.

100
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:40,698
I brought him a special sports drink.

101
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:43,298
Really? Special?

102
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,498
Don't do it.

103
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:45,498
"Yuichi Tonozuka (45), Tokyo Spirits Roupeiro"

104
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,798
Accepting gifts of food or drink before a match

105
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:49,898
will get you a yellow card, miss.

106
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,898
Mr. Tonozuka, it's okay.

107
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,798
I'll explain it to her.

108
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,598
You'd better be.

109
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:58,498
See you later.

110
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,998
-What a creep. -I agree.

111
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,798
A yellow card?

112
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,898
Did I do something bad?

113
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,098
Sorry, sorry. It's not like that.

114
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,598
I know you brought him a special drink,

115
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,398
but he can't drink it right now.

116
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,698
But he has an important match coming up.

117
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:15,298
It'll make him feel better.

118
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,998
Yeah, you're right.

119
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:20,298
She's going to cry. She's about to cry.

120
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,998
What if he's accused of doping?

121
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,598
He'll be out for longer than he was for his injury.

122
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,898
He won't be able to play again.

123
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,898
-Doping? -But it only contains honey and...

124
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:31,998
It's not like that.

125
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:34,898
Nobody would suspect you.

126
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:36,398
It's just a rule to follow before games,

127
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,498
especially in professional sports.

128
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,898
You wouldn't want anyone to suspect Hide of doping, would you?

129
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:44,198
-Do you think I'm up to something? -What makes you say that?

130
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:47,898
Sorry. These kids don't get it.

131
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,398
You're right.

132
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:51,398
Do you want to see the doping control room

133
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,698
next to the infirmary later?

134
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:57,698
They'll be testing a few players after today's match, too.

135
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,298
"Too"? You mean they do it every time?

136
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:03,198
It's not only done after big matches?

137
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,998
Why does everyone suspect the players of doping?

138
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:08,598
We do it because we don't.

139
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,698
We trust the players.

140
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,598
Isn't it amazing that not a single player's

141
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,898
been disqualified from the J League for doping?

142
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,298
Yeah.

143
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,498
I guess I'll be taking this home, then.

144
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:20,698
No, no.

145
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,098
You can't give it to him now,

146
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,898
but you can later.

147
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:26,598
-Really? -Trust me.

148
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:27,998
That's great.

149
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,698
Now he won't get an upset stomach during the game.

150
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,298
What does that mean?

151
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,798
What else did you put in there besides honey?

152
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,398
-She mentioned green juice. -Doesn't the stadium

153
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,998
keep an official sports drink?

154
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,098
-Ya. -Official?

155
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,598
They're that strict about it?

156
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,498
The packaging is only sold at the stadium.

157
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,298
Since the bottles are sealed,

158
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,298
you don't have to worry about their contents.

159
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:51,598
They're often placed by the goal posts.

160
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,498
You sure do know a lot.

161
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,198
Do you even need me to show you around?

162
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,398
She's special.

163
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,798
Let's go buy some!

164
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,198
I'll buy him some, too!

165
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,398
I thought we'd head to the locker room now.

166
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,598
What do you want to do?

167
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:05,998
What do we want to do?

168
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,498
What does that mean?

169
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:10,298
The team's bus will be arriving soon,

170
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,598
so now's our only chance.

171
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:13,198
No one told us that.

172
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:16,798
Why would we need to discuss it with you kids?

173
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,798
We won't be able to stay

174
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,098
once the players arrive.

175
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,398
We're going to check it out.

176
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,498
You guys do what you want.

177
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:27,598
-We'd like to go! -Wait!

178
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:30,398
I can't take you into a locker room

179
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:32,498
when players are present.

180
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:36,398
They'll be going over their formations before the match.

181
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:39,198
You kids really do know a lot.

182
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:40,298
"Dressing Room for Tokyo Spirits" -I'm disappointed.

183
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,798
I wanted to give the coach my strategy.

184
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:43,998
"Players Room" -The coach?

185
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:45,898
-What are you talking about? -They'd definitely win.

186
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,298
Maedono will be changing his compression shirt at halftime.

187
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,498
Put his on top.

188
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,398
Yes, sir. I know.

189
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,198
"I know"?

190
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,498
Didn't you mean, "I understand, sir?"

191
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:57,298
"Risa Miyamoto (22), Tokyo Spirits Roupeiro" -Sorry.

192
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,798
I'll put Mr. Maedono's compression shirt

193
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,998
on top of his uniform.

194
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,198
If you don't say it out loud,

195
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:07,798
I won't be sure if you've actually done it.

196
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,198
Sorry to bother you, sir.

197
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,698
We won't touch anything.

198
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,798
Just let me show them around.

199
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:17,398
And check the drinks again.

200
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,998
Yes, sir. I'll go check the drinks.

201
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:23,398
Keep an eye out for any unfamiliar squeeze bottles.

202
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:25,298
Squeeze bottles?

203
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,198
He really is a creep.

204
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,498
I couldn't agree more.

205
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:32,498
I see. That happened?

206
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:34,198
Don't be mad, though.

207
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:38,198
He's prouder than anyone of being a roupeiro.

208
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,798
Popero? Is that a tasty food?

209
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:43,498
Roupeiro. It means equipment manager in Portuguese.

210
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:46,298
-Equipment manager. -Are you a Poupeiro, too?

211
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,498
It's with an "h" sound.

212
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,098
The players haven't arrived yet,

213
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:53,198
but all their equipment is here.

214
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:54,998
-You're right. -I see.

215
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:57,198
The players don't have to carry anything themselves.

216
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,698
That's not all roupeiros do.

217
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,098
What do you mean?

218
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:04,198
They maintain every player's spikes, clothes, and drinks.

219
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:06,098
They even know everyone's favorite candies.

220
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:09,398
They allow the players to focus on the game free of stress.

221
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,898
Simply put, that's their job.

222
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,998
Right? Right? Isn't she amazing?

223
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:14,398
You're amazing, big sister!

224
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,898
-You know all of that? -Do you ever get it wrong?

225
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,398
No, no.

226
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,698
Mr. Tonozuka's the one who does that.

227
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:23,198
I'm still learning.

228
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,298
I'd get in trouble if I called myself a roupeiro.

229
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:28,098
No way. Mr. Tonozuka said you know more

230
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:31,498
about the players' preferences than he does now.

231
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,398
You can't be serious.

232
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,198
-He's lying. -That guy complimented someone?

233
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:38,098
He must be up to something.

234
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:40,398
You kids are tough.

235
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,198
I'll scold them later.

236
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,698
"J League's 25th Anniversary"

237
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,898
-Hide! -Hide!

238
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:58,798
-How do you feel about today's match? -Hide, you can do it!

239
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,598
-Mr. Akagi! -Mr. Hide.

240
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:05,198
Excuse me. Do you have a minute?

241
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,398
What's with the formality?

242
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,998
This little girl has a gift for you.

243
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,598
Have you recovered from your injury?

244
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:14,998
I mean, of course you have.

245
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,798
I hope this makes you feel better.

246
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,098
I'll be rooting for you!

247
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,198
Thanks.

248
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:24,398
I couldn't ask for a better gift.

249
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:27,798
Tonight's game is in the bag now.

250
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:29,398
Alright, I'd better get going.

251
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,398
Thanks for your support.

252
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,098
Yes, of course.

253
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,798
-Ayumi! -Don't die!

254
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:36,898
-She's out cold. -We haven't watched the game!

255
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,298
It's not my problem.

256
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,098
I'm starting to get nervous.

257
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,198
It's because I put this on.

258
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,198
Mr. Mouri, you have a great figure.

259
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:49,198
-It looks great on you. -Is... Is that so?

260
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,598
Big sister, I gave my drink to Hide!

261
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:53,098
I made an exception.

262
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,698
Then Mr. Akagi will have leftover drinks tonight.

263
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,198
I'm lucky.

264
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,798
If he doesn't need them, I'll drink them.

265
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:02,198
Why don't you buy one for yourself?

266
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,998
Time to make the shot!

267
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,698
Pops, calm down.

268
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,498
Conan.

269
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:16,398
Mr. Endo!

270
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,165
I can't get any distance on it.

271
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:28,465
Maybe I'm practicing the wrong way.

272
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,365
"Yasuhito Endo (38)" -It's amazing that you're even trying

273
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,765
"Gamba Osaka" -that shot.

274
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,265
-Mr. Mouri. -Yes?

275
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,965
Did you call me?

276
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,565
I'm a huge fan of yours.

277
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:40,865
-Can I shake your hand? -Sure.

278
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:43,765
Since I heard you were opening tonight's match,

279
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:45,665
I thought I might get to meet you.

280
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,265
I feel so lucky.

281
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,865
Don't say that.

282
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,165
Did you kids see that?

283
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:53,165
This is how people who understand true value react.

284
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:54,365
Really?

285
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,465
Is Endo in a slump?

286
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,265
Mr. Endo's so cool.

287
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,765
You're into that?

288
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:02,865
Mr. Mouri, we should get ready for the opening ceremony.

289
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,365
Is... Is it time?

290
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,765
Good luck.

291
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:07,465
Thanks. Good luck.

292
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:11,165
All right! Time for a hat trick!

293
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,965
How are you going to do that?

294
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,265
Thank you for waiting.

295
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:18,365
Today's opening ceremony will be conducted

296
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:23,365
by the great detective, Kogoro Mouri!

297
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:25,765
This isn't good.

298
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:30,165
Tonight's opening ceremony will be a penalty kick.

299
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:33,965
Goalkeeper Masunaga, don't misread the situation.

300
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:36,265
I can't! I can't do it!

301
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:38,865
What is that? It's not funny.

302
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:39,965
Pops.

303
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:47,665
This is really embarrassing.

304
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,665
"Medical Office"

305
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,965
You've definitely got diarrhea.

306
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,865
It's easy to tell.

307
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,665
I can't move...

308
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,565
It's coming again!

309
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:01,065
I'm going to the bathroom!

310
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:02,765
What did he have for lunch?

311
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:04,965
Ran's curry rice.

312
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,365
-Didn't you eat that, too? -Yeah.

313
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,065
Then maybe you'll get it, too.

314
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,165
I'm fine.

315
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,965
Why doesn't this bathroom have any doors?

316
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,165
I should keep my voice down.

317
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,665
That's the bathroom for testing doping.

318
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:20,665
Of course there's no door.

319
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,465
But I can't relax here.

320
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,865
It's not my problem.

321
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:26,465
If you want a regular bathroom, go outside.

322
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,165
No...

323
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:40,065
-Go... -Do it!

324
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,165
This is the drink Pops had.

325
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,665
Should we examine it?

326
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:49,165
Here?

327
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:50,965
Who do you think I am?

328
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,665
"Information"

329
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,165
Why?

330
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:31,265
Goal!

331
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,565
Endo's left foot takes the first point!

332
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,965
Yeah.

333
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,965
I think that's what happened.

334
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,265
Can I count on you?

335
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,565
Thanks.

336
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,765
You don't look happy.

337
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:51,665
This was found in a trash can in the kitchen.

338
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,265
They cut beneath the cap

339
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:56,365
and removed the plastic after softening it

340
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,965
by submerging it in hot water.

341
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,865
I hope they didn't burn themselves.

342
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:04,765
What did you discover?

343
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,365
The water contained

344
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:11,565
rhubarb, aloe, senna, and bisacodyl.

345
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:14,665
In other words, laxatives.

346
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:17,865
-Just laxatives? -Yeah, just laxatives.

347
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,565
It won't kill him.

348
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:21,765
Why?

349
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,765
Maybe they don't like detectives.

350
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:24,865
No way.

351
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:26,165
Wait, where's the plastic bottle?

352
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,265
-I threw it out. -Seriously?

353
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,065
Are you treating this as a case?

354
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:32,065
But there's a victim.

355
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,165
That old man doesn't qualify as a victim.

356
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:36,965
-Isn't that kind of mean? -Not at all.

357
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:38,965
It's almost halftime.

358
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,665
The roupeiros will be busy preparing for the second half.

359
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:48,965
Will the Sleeping Kogoro be making an appearance?

360
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:52,065
He's alone in the VIP room.

361
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:53,165
How is he doing?

362
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:55,065
The medicine they gave him is working.

363
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:57,065
Everything works on him.

364
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:01,565
I'll tell them once the second half starts.

365
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:04,365
In a natural and cute manner.

366
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:05,465
The second half is starting.

367
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,165
The Spirits are behind by one point.

368
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:10,265
Will they be able to tie things up and make a comeback?

369
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,065
Come in.

370
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:18,365
Excuse me.

371
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:21,465
Sorry for asking you to come here.

372
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:22,665
It's fine.

373
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:25,965
It's my first time in this room.

374
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,965
Have the others arrived yet?

375
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,265
You're the only one I called here,

376
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,465
Ms. Risa Miyamoto.

377
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,565
Just me?

378
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,365
That was brutal.

379
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,065
You must've seen that opening ceremony.

380
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:42,565
Three days of my practice has gone down the drain.

381
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:44,165
It was a disaster.

382
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,865
Is your stomach feeling better?

383
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,565
Is my stomach feeling better?

384
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,565
Since it was so lame,

385
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:55,465
I did my best to pass it off as back pain.

386
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:59,465
But I see now. You knew.

387
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:02,165
-Mr. Mouri, I... -Ms. Risa.

388
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,465
I heard you.

389
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:07,965
"Stop him. Please notice."

390
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:12,365
While you were checking the drinks in the locker room,

391
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:17,865
you deliberately brought me Akagi's drinks.

392
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:21,765
Couldn't you have left it

393
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,565
at Akagi's locker?

394
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,965
If I hadn't drank it,

395
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,765
were you going to put it back?

396
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,765
It was a gamble.

397
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,965
I bet my life and my fate on you,

398
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:37,465
the great detective, Kogoro Mouri.

399
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:40,465
I've never gambled before.

400
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,665
And I won.

401
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,065
You won?

402
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,965
Yes, I won.

403
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,165
Are you saying you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you,

404
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:52,765
even if you know it's the wrong thing to do?

405
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,965
You really are amazing.

406
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:58,465
It was two years ago.

407
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:02,365
I was studying abroad to become a roupeiro.

408
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,565
I made a friend there

409
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,265
who was also an aspiring roupeiro.

410
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:11,465
We became co-signers for each other's loans.

411
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,165
But your friend disappeared,

412
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,465
and you took on the debt.

413
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,465
I can only describe you as amazing.

414
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,065
When did you look this up?

415
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,165
We just met today.

416
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,365
This may come as a shock to you,

417
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,065
but your friend

418
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,365
and Rodriguez who pretended to be a good person

419
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:34,365
and discussed your loan with you,

420
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:39,165
are both part of the same evil totocalcio organization.

421
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:40,365
But...

422
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:43,965
Mr. Rodriguez said...

423
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,265
Mr. Mouri!

424
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:46,865
Mr. Tonozuka!

425
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,365
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,365
I heard everything. I...

427
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,865
Please forgive her!

428
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,165
Please don't! This was my...

429
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,565
Don't get the wrong idea!

430
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,365
I'm not doing this for you!

431
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,665
I don't need a roupeiro who causes problems

432
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,965
for the team and players!

433
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,965
It's not fair. Gamble, my foot.

434
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,565
If Mr. Mouri hadn't noticed...

435
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:14,465
Are you saying it's our fault

436
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:16,065
because we didn't notice?

437
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,065
Shouldn't you have come to me

438
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:20,465
or Iwasada first?

439
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,365
Did you think you could scare us

440
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,865
with the trouble you caused?

441
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:26,265
Mr. Mouri!

442
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:28,965
She said Hide was moving strangely

443
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,365
during the first half.

444
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,365
She suggested we swap out

445
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,765
the spikes on just his right side.

446
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:41,065
She... She's learned so much.

447
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:42,565
What am I talking about?

448
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,465
This has nothing to do with you.

449
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:49,365
Basically, what I'm trying to say is...

450
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:54,365
I'm responsible for whatever she's done!

451
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,865
So...

452
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:59,265
Please forgive her!

453
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,365
Please!

454
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:02,465
Sir...

455
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,265
Great!

456
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,965
It's over.

457
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:11,865
If she'd taken things more seriously,

458
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:13,965
she could've done things directly!

459
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:16,065
-She... -Look around

460
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,365
and you'll see people committing foul play everywhere.

461
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,165
But here in Japan,

462
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,965
we have a thorough early warning system.

463
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:27,265
Match fixing and other evil deeds

464
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,265
haven't occurred once

465
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,965
since the J League was formed.

466
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:34,565
That's the noble truth

467
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,465
of the J League you loved.

468
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:42,065
Akagi's overtime goal has brought the game to 1 by 1.

469
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:44,765
It's a draw.

470
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:49,265
Tonight's game ended in a draw.

471
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,365
The players...

472
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,565
are returning.

473
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,165
I told you. I don't know what you're talking about!

474
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,665
I didn't have diarrhea!

475
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,565
I'm hanging up!

476
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:25,465
Who would admit to that? It's embarrassing.

477
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:27,965
Didn't I tell you?

478
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,665
Mr. Mouri said he doesn't know anything about it.

479
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:32,765
There's no victim or physical evidence.

480
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,865
Nothing's going to happen to you.

481
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:39,265
Anyway, about that totocalcio organization you mentioned...

482
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:42,865
I can't believe they arrested all of them in a day.

483
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,965
Did some busybody

484
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,165
put a powerful organization on the job?

485
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:52,965
I have no idea what you're talking about.

486
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,165
"Next Episode" -Even in Tokyo,

487
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,165
there are places like this.

488
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,965
The air's clear and the view's excellent.

489
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,365
What a great place to drink sake.

490
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:05,865
Cheese...

491
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,765
Isn't that because you suggested

492
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:11,565
the three of us go somewhere together?

493
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:13,865
Now, now.

494
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:16,965
What is that?

495
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:20,465
Next Conan,

496
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:23,265
"Friendship Washed Away In The Riverbed"

497
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:27,408
Next Conan's Hint:

498
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,208
"Watermill"

499
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,208
Who supports the J League?

500
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,208
Roupeiro...

501
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,208
Sounds like you've learned something.
