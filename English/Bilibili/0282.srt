1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,124
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:07,924
In a beautiful garden, a mysterious case occurs.

4
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:09,424
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,024
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,311
Thank you for the treat.

8
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:15,411
This is such a great garden that's true to your title

9
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:18,411
as the president of the Kiyama Furniture Company.

10
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:21,211
What a nice house you have!

11
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,611
This is the first time

12
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:24,411
I've seen a garden with a waterfall like this!

13
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,111
This garden somehow makes me feel at peace.

14
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,911
Glad to hear that you like my garden.

15
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:35,811
I'm glad I brought you up here too.

16
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:40,011
I think it's about time to begin.

17
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,311
Eh? To begin what?

18
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,911
You'll see.

19
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,611
Oh, Conan, look over there!

20
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:52,911
Water is flowing over the basin of the waterfall!

21
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,711
Oh, yeah!

22
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,211
The water is filling the garden!

23
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,911
What's that?

24
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,111
Surprised, eh?

25
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:06,511
At 8 a.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. three times a day,

26
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:10,111
the water flows into the garden.

27
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,111
But in doing so, won't the sand pattern disappear?

28
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,711
Water is poured in slowly so that the pattern is not lost,

29
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,511
then the water is drained in 30 minutes.

30
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,211
The former president made this device.

31
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:27,011
It's quite highly reputed.

32
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:32,011
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'd like to get back to work.

33
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,711
But make yourselves at home. See you at dinner.

34
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:37,311
And don't worry about your car.

35
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,711
I'll get my secretary to pick it up tomorrow.

36
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,611
Thank so much for everything.

37
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,611
I'm sure you'd have done the same for me if I were in your shoes.

38
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,411
Okay then. I'll leave them to you, Ayaka.

39
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,511
Very well, President.

40
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,111
Boy oh boy, what a truly superb view!

41
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:54,711
It's really awesome.

42
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,511
What carefree jokers they are!

43
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:00,311
Don't they realize how costly it is to maintain it?

44
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,511
The garden Kiyama made is really nothing but a big nuisance for me!

45
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,811
Look, Conan!

46
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,911
Oh, my, we can see clearly through the circles of white sand!

47
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:15,411
It's beautiful, Ran!

48
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,411
I'll bet it's especially romantic at night

49
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,211
when the moon is reflected on the water.

50
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,311
Yes, indeed.

51
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:26,111
We even have guests who come here every full moon.

52
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,511
How wonderful to drink cold sake

53
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:32,411
while viewing a full moon rising from behind Mt. Fuji.

54
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:37,911
It's out of this world.

55
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,811
Hey, what's that?

56
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,911
Over there. Something's by the pillar.

57
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,411
Oh, that! It's a catching pole.

58
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,611
Catching pole?

59
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:47,911
Yes.

60
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,611
When someone drops something on the white sand of the yard,

61
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,711
we lengthen this pole and pick it up like this.

62
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:02,011
We can't step on the wave pattern of the white sand.

63
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,611
I see. It's well thought out.

64
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:07,111
Well, since Mr. Majima became president,

65
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:10,111
the gardener comes only once a month, so...

66
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,111
Pretty mind racking, isn't it?

67
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,911
Oh, the water's begun to drain.

68
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,211
Yeah, really.

69
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,611
It's amazing how well this works.

70
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:32,411
"Mystery of the Japanese Water Flowing Rock Garden"

71
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,711
"(Part 1)"

72
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:41,511
If you like, shall we go to the saloon

73
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,311
where aperitif will be served.

74
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,511
Oh yeah, here we go!

75
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:56,211
You don't have money? Give me a break!

76
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,111
You still owe me 5 million yen,

77
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,011
no, 7 million yet including interest!

78
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,611
Mr. Majima?

79
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:09,811
Pay back the money in full by the end of this month!

80
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:12,611
Otherwise, you'll be fired! You better dig in!

81
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:15,711
Please wait! President!

82
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,311
This western style house is marvelous too.

83
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,111
Yes. It's truly splendid.

84
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,811
Please come on in.

85
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,911
Oh, well well.

86
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,511
Please come this way.

87
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,411
Oh, thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,811
It's the man we saw just a while ago.

89
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,011
Yeah.

90
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:56,311
Can I get you something to drink, sir?

91
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,211
Sure, I'll take a beer.

92
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:59,811
I'll be right back

93
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:03,011
Hey, Dad! It's too early to be drinking yet!

94
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,811
Why not?

95
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,611
Ayaka.

96
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,611
Who're these people?

97
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,011
They are Mr. Majima's guests.

98
00:07:11,011 --> 00:07:12,811
His guests?

99
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:16,311
I don't know if we can be called guest, because you see,

100
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:21,611
we actually ran out of gas on Sanbonzaka.

101
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:25,011
Then, President Majima, who happened to pass by,

102
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,611
looked in on us.

103
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:33,111
Moreover, he kindly invited us for dinner this evening.

104
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,611
The president is a nice friendly person, isn't he?

105
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,411
Heck. He always puts on a friendly face in public.

106
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:43,211
Can I ask you something?

107
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,711
Is this supposed to be a private gathering

108
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:49,911
to commemorate the opening day of Kiyama Furniture's first store?

109
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:55,011
All is well, Mr. Endo.

110
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,311
Mr. Majima invited them.

111
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,511
And besides, the more the merrier for dinner, right?

112
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,611
I guess so, but...

113
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,511
If you will excuse me.

114
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,811
Well, I'd like to introduce everyone.

115
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:12,611
This is the secretary to the president, Mr. Masayuki Hashimoto.

116
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,311
Nice to meet you.

117
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,611
And this is the president of the Kiyama Interior Company,

118
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,211
one of our affiliated companies, Mr. Endo.

119
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:20,611
Mr. Endo has taken part

120
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:24,111
in the National Sports Festival as an archer.

121
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,311
That's something!

122
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,911
But it was long time ago.

123
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,011
Now, it's a different story.

124
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,911
And I'm Tomonori Kiyama, a freelance writer.

125
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,811
Are you Mr. Kiyama, the author of "Wandering Through Africa"?

126
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:44,911
-Yes, I am. -Wow! I thought so!

127
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,811
Do you know him?

128
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:47,911
Yeah!

129
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:51,211
He is a travelogue writer who travels to many countries.

130
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,811
I've read your "Wandering Through Africa".

131
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,811
Oh, thank you.

132
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,111
How did you like it?

133
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:00,311
Oh. I was deeply moved!

134
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:03,611
Could I have your autograph, please?

135
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,511
Sure, my pleasure.

136
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,611
I tell you what.

137
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:09,511
I'll be holding a photo exhibition.

138
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,811
So if it's okay with you, please come.

139
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:14,811
Wow! Thank you, are you sure it's okay?

140
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,211
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,611
I'll sign my autograph now.

142
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:28,311
What an old-fashioned fountain pen you have.

143
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:30,311
This is the only thing I have to remember my father by.

144
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,111
Although it's no great fountain pen,

145
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,811
I just couldn't bear getting rid of it.

146
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,911
So, I always keep it on me.

147
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,411
Okay, here you are.

148
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,511
Thank you very much!

149
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,811
Please come with your friends.

150
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,411
Yes, I definitely will!

151
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,511
However, I didn't know you were related

152
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,811
to the family of Kiyama Furniture.

153
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:55,111
My father built up the company in the course of his lifetime.

154
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,411
After his death, Mr. Majima succeeded my father as president.

155
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,911
Oh, have you already seen the Rock Garden?

156
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:05,511
Yes, we have! Patterns on the white sand were so beautiful!

157
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,411
Exactly! That waterfall and white sand!

158
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:11,311
The garden you saw was what my father kept working on to complete,

159
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,711
whenever he had time to spare from his busy schedule,

160
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:13,911
putting his heart and soul into it.

161
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,811
Hey, how did your father die?

162
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,011
Conan. How rude.

163
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,711
No. It's okay.

164
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,611
He died in a traffic accident last year.

165
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,711
I see.

166
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,011
You never know what destiny lies ahead.

167
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:35,411
There's a scenic site with fantastic night view.

168
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,411
So, I suggest you go there later.

169
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,011
It's very beautiful.

170
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,311
All of you really must see it.

171
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,311
Shall we go up there, Conan?

172
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,311
I think I'll pass.

173
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:52,211
I'd rather stay here and enjoy a leisurely drink.

174
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:54,311
Come off it, Dad.

175
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:58,411
You must see it, too! It's well worth looking at!

176
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,511
Unlike Tokyo, the stars seem so close

177
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,411
that it looks like they're going to shower down on you!

178
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,711
Stars...

179
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,411
Thank you for waiting.

180
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,011
Here comes the beer!

181
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,911
Thank you very much.

182
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,411
If you like, we have drinks other than beer too.

183
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,311
I'll bring you another cup.

184
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,211
Thanks! Now, I can drink my heart out.

185
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,011
Which one should I drink?

186
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,211
Hey! Stop it, Dad.

187
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,011
Hey, hey! Cut it out! Don't spill it!

188
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,611
What a waste!

189
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:34,611
Oh man, talk about addicted to liquor.

190
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,911
Here, have another one.

191
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:57,911
Oh, thank you.

192
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,211
Well, well, I've had enough.

193
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:12,911
Excuse me.

194
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,911
Mr. Majima.

195
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,711
Sorry, I haven't been around you to see you lately.

196
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,911
I came to tell you that I'm going to holding an exhibition.

197
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:23,111
If you like, please come by and look at my photos.

198
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,711
A photo exhibition.

199
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:30,011
Well, Tomonori, you seem to really be working at it.

200
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,111
Okay, I'll drop by.

201
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,811
President.

202
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:36,411
This is last month's sales report.

203
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,611
I hope that the figures are accurate at least,

204
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,911
since this is your last time.

205
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,311
-Now, then... -Wait!

206
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,411
Dinner is ready, Sir.

207
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,211
Will you all please come this way to the banquet hall?

208
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:12,711
Finally! Dinner party!

209
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,056
Well, I'd like to propose a toast

210
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,056
for Kiyama Furniture's future prosperity!

211
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:48,056
Cheers!

212
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:51,556
This is the best meat I've ever tasted!

213
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,956
Yeah, it's so tender.

214
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:56,056
Care for a drink?

215
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,256
Oh, well, thank you.

216
00:13:57,256 --> 00:14:00,456
You really do like that, don't you? I tell you.

217
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:01,456
I really appreciate having the opportunity

218
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,856
to meet new friends like you.

219
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:06,656
So, if you like it, I'll sell it cheap to you.

220
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,856
Really?

221
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,256
Dad!

222
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,556
You've got to be joking.

223
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:16,156
Hey, listen, Dad!

224
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,156
Come on.

225
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,356
So, please talk this over with your father before you decide

226
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,356
whether you want to buy it or not.

227
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:27,756
If you'll excuse me, I've got to get going

228
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,356
since I still have work left to do.

229
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:38,056
I guess I'll be going too.

230
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:40,356
I have a video that I want to watch,

231
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,456
so I hope you don't mind going to see the night view after I'm done.

232
00:14:42,456 --> 00:14:44,456
Sure, no problem.

233
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:48,156
Well, I'll come and pick you up around 11:15.

234
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:49,356
So, please wait in your room.

235
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,056
Yes. I got it.

236
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:55,256
Wonder what kind of video it is?

237
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,456
It's a documentary film that he wanted to watch about

238
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:59,956
an adventurer named Hiroyuki Sekiguchi.

239
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,456
I happened to find the video

240
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,756
so I brought it with me to show it to him.

241
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:06,356
I see.

242
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:09,556
Documentary film about an adventurer, my foot.

243
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,456
He's so absorbed in watching videos like that,

244
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,756
that's why the company's taken over by Majima.

245
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:17,256
What a thing to say, Mr. Hashimoto!

246
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:19,856
Mr. Majima is not that kind of person.

247
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:23,056
Oh, what's come over you, Mr. Endo?

248
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,256
How strange for you to be taking sides with Majima.

249
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:33,456
Making remarks like that won't help at this point already.

250
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,556
I hear you'll be discharged next month,

251
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,856
due to the firm's poor performance,

252
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:39,856
which you're held responsible for.

253
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,156
But, the debts of Kiyama Interior

254
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:44,156
are essentially the debts of Kiyama Furniture.

255
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,456
The parent company passed the buck to your company.

256
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:51,556
I also hear that you are just taking out your misery on others,

257
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:54,656
shouting furiously "Why should I be fired for that?"

258
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,956
So, everyone's worried saying,

259
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,956
"It comes as no surprise if he killed Majima."

260
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:04,356
Hey, Mr. Hashimoto! You're really starting to get on my nerves!

261
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:12,056
So, please excuse me too

262
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:15,056
because I have some work to do at my office.

263
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:18,056
Oh, by the way, you had better forget about

264
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,156
what you mentioned a little while ago.

265
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,756
What I mentioned a little while ago?

266
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,556
You mentioned the desk.

267
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,456
Listen. At first, he approaches you looking very friendly.

268
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,756
But once he gets you, you can't get rid of him.

269
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:31,456
That's his way, don't get involved with him!

270
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,956
He's bad news.

271
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:35,756
Mr. Hashimoto!

272
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:46,956
Dad, let's go back to our room too.

273
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,856
Come on. It wouldn't hurt to drink a little more.

274
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,656
You know, our life could come to an end tomorrow.

275
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,656
So, drink when you can.

276
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,956
Now you're talking.

277
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,456
Hey, Dad!

278
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:20,056
Oh, it's this late already.

279
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:23,356
Mr. Mouri, I think we have to call it a night.

280
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,256
Dad, wake up.

281
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:26,656
What?

282
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,656
Let's get back to our room.

283
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:33,856
Hey, wait! There's still a bottle of beer to drink!

284
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:37,056
Drink, drink while you can!

285
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,356
Is Mr. Mouri all right?

286
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:41,356
I'm really sorry for all the fuss.

287
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,556
I can still drink!

288
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:46,456
Here you are. This is medicine for hangover.

289
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,956
Thank you.

290
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:49,756
I'll be here if you need any assistance.

291
00:17:49,756 --> 00:17:51,356
Just call me when necessary.

292
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:52,856
Okay.

293
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,456
Good night.

294
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:17,256
This will be fine. I'm sorry for you father.

295
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:19,556
I feel bad that I pushed him to drink more.

296
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,656
Don't worry. This happens all the time.

297
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,656
Sorry for the trouble. Thank you too.

298
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,756
Good night.

299
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,656
Yeah, good night.

300
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:48,756
Yes. I'll open the door now.

301
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,156
Sorry to keep you waiting.

302
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,256
No, not at all.

303
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:55,656
Did you enjoy the video?

304
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,156
Yes, very much.

305
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,856
It was a superb documentary with great power.

306
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:05,556
We're just taking a run up to Mt. Prospect.

307
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,156
Don't be long.

308
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:22,556
It's so beautiful, like a dream.

309
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:26,556
Pop should have come here too.

310
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,456
I recall the days when I was a child,

311
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:31,556
my father and I used to come here.

312
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:35,856
My father also liked this night view.

313
00:19:55,056 --> 00:19:56,756
We're back now!

314
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:02,056
Welcome back!

315
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,156
How was the night scene?

316
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,656
It was so beautiful that I was impressed.

317
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:08,256
Right, Conan?

318
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,956
That's great.

319
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:13,856
So, Ayaka, good night.

320
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,356
Good night!

321
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,956
Good night.

322
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,556
A picture?

323
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,056
Thank you very much.

324
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,756
I'm glad that you enjoyed it.

325
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,456
So, see you tomorrow.

326
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,856
Good night!

327
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,756
This voice?

328
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:19,956
What is it?

329
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:22,356
Ayaka! What's wrong?

330
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:25,356
That!

331
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,556
What happened?

332
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,356
Ma... President Majima!

333
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,756
What? What was that scream about?

334
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:43,556
Mr. Majima!

335
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,756
Ran! Call the police now!

336
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:46,856
Yes!

337
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,056
What's the trouble?

338
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,456
President!

339
00:21:55,056 --> 00:21:57,556
You! Keep out! This is a homicide!

340
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:00,656
Don't enter the garden! We've got to preserve the crime scene!

341
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,656
What's with you?

342
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,856
Pushing your weight around and giving out orders.

343
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,156
I'm Kogoro Mouri, a private detective.

344
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:11,556
You're Kogoro Mouri, that renowned detective.

345
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:13,156
You got it.

346
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:15,256
Don't you think that there's something strange

347
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:17,856
about the President's corpse?

348
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,856
Strange? What's strange?

349
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:22,056
Around the body...

350
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,256
There are no footsteps at all!

351
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,356
True.

352
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:34,756
So, how did the murderer carry Mr. Majima up there?

353
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:11,656
What?

354
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,756
It looks like something was dragged.

355
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:16,456
Strange.

356
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:21,556
If Pops is right, how can the dead body be lying in that way?

357
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,456
But, if he is wrong...

358
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,656
Why is this here?

359
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:32,856
I've got it.

360
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,956
Next Conan,

361
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,256
