1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,440
Ms. Mejiro.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,040
Hello, we came to look at the farm.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,140
Ran, you're early.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,640
This is fantastic.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,540
It's full of autumn vegetables.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,140
Despite it being a week day, you're working hard in the fields.

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,240
"Misa Mejiro (45), clerk" -If it's watering the field and harvesting,

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,340
they can be done after work, you see.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,140
It's convenient since it's nearby, isn't it?

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,740
Yes!

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,240
Oh boy. Who pulled off the insect repellent net?

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,340
"Shinichiro Taguchi (51), office worker" -After all the trouble

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,340
I went through to make it for my vegetables.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,240
You're the one who did it, aren't you?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,740
Beats me.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,140
"Takehiko Nakamura (73), unemployed" -Although now,

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,440
my lot can get a lot of sunshine.

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,540
Only if Gramps Troublemaker weren't here, this place is super...

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,240
Don't throw the weeds that you pulled out onto my lot!

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,740
Beats me.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,240
"Marie Inoue (26)" -How many times do I have to tell you?

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Will you please cut it out?

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,040
Lay off! I told you I know nothing of it!

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,140
There was a time when my lot was soaked in water, you know.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,140
What a troublemaker, the old man!

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,740
You had to see all this unpleasantness after coming here.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,640
Hey, won't you come help pick the vegetables next time?

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,240
I'll share some of my organic vegetables with you, too.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,740
Eating vegetables eaten by insects all over like that

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,640
won't taste good at all.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,040
What's with this farm?

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,540
Brooding over passing seasons

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,340
will not help in pursuing the mystery of cases.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
A murder is committed on the roof far!

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,540
Today, scarecrow Kogoro makes his appearance!

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,140
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

40
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:50,712
"Trap of the Roof Farm"

41
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:55,412
Dad's really all for it.

42
00:03:57,012 --> 00:04:00,012
I'm going to make French fries with the potatoes I pick from the garden

43
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:03,512
and eat them as snacks with beer!

44
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,112
Don't go making holes in the roof.

45
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,812
That's...

46
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,612
The old man we saw the other day?

47
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:30,912
No good.

48
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,412
A wound on his forehead, too?

49
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,412
The victim is Mr. Takehiko Nakamura, 73 years old.

50
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:45,912
He's an elderly man who lives in the neighborhood.

51
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,812
The estimated time of death

52
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,912
seems to be around 10:00 in the morning.

53
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,812
When you came to this roof farm,

54
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:55,512
you found Mr. Nakamura lying on the ground?

55
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:58,612
Yes, we found him about 11:00!

56
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,212
By the way, why are you dressed like that?

57
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,412
I've come with my daughter to help

58
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:07,212
a person called Ms. Mejiro to pick vegetables!

59
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:12,412
Oh, well. Does Mr. Nakamura rent a lot here?

60
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,812
Yes. He seems to have been a habitual troublemaker,

61
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,512
and was called "Gramps Troublemaker"

62
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:21,012
by the others who rent lots here.

63
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:22,712
I see.

64
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:26,912
We'll have to check either way if we've got a case here or not.

65
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:28,912
The cause of death seems to be that

66
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,912
he hit the back of his head really hard.

67
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,412
He must've hit his head on the water container

68
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,512
that was in the field.

69
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:38,212
So he fell on his back.

70
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,512
There are traces that look like he slipped.

71
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,612
Why does he also have a wound on his forehead?

72
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,512
It's still new.

73
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,612
I wonder if he hit it some place?

74
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,312
Maybe he tried to wash his hands

75
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:53,612
and hit his forehead on the faucet.

76
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:56,112
He then was surprised, lurched backwards,

77
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,612
slipped and fell on his back.

78
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,212
What do you think?

79
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:04,712
That's why the towel was on the ground behind the faucet.

80
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,712
What's that dirty part?

81
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:08,712
I had the forensics check it and found that

82
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:12,312
it was the same substance as what's on the railing of the fence.

83
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,812
He probably hung it on the railing.

84
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:17,812
Why does he have two towels?

85
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:20,712
A cell phone was found near the body.

86
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:24,012
Check to see if it really belongs to Mr. Nakamura, will you?

87
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:25,012
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,112
Is there any other way in and out of here

89
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,812
besides that elevator?

90
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,912
The stairs of the emergency exit is under construction now.

91
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:35,612
So, there seems to be no stairs available to make access here.

92
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:39,612
Which means that, the only access here is by using that elevator.

93
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,012
There seems to be no buildings higher

94
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,812
than this one in the surroundings.

95
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:47,812
This building... the windows are all barred.

96
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,912
So, there's no way that anyone could climb out the window

97
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,312
and go up to the roof.

98
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,812
Check the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator

99
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:58,412
and see if anyone went in to or out of the roof!

100
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,812
Yes, sir!

101
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,612
I guess we should go talk to the people involved of this farm

102
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:04,112
to see if we've got a case here.

103
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,312
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:08,112
Takagi! Go gathered the people involved!

105
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,412
Yes, sir!

106
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:15,712
But this dead body sure is in a strange position.

107
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,012
What is it?

108
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:19,412
His position...

109
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:23,412
Don't... Don't tell me that...

110
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,812
What is it, Mouri?

111
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,712
Inspector! This dead body!

112
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:31,212
Doesn't it look like he's pointing his index finger at his own face?

113
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,412
I guess you could say that.

114
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,212
But, if you slip and fall,

115
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,012
there's a chance that you may end up this way, isn't there?

116
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:42,712
Ran!

117
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,512
Who are the other people that we met the other day on this farm

118
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,112
that are renting land besides Ms. Mejiro?

119
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,512
Uh...

120
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,912
Office worker, Mr. Taguchi,

121
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:54,712
office lady, Ms. Inoue... I think it was.

122
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:57,212
Inspector, there are people whose name have the kanji character

123
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:59,312
representing part of a face in their name!

124
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,212
Ms. Mejiro = Eye!

125
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,312
Mr. Taguchi = Mouth!

126
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:04,912
Maybe Mr. Nakamura was trying to tell us

127
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,912
who the one who murdered him is

128
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,112
by pointing to that part of his face!

129
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:11,612
Are you serious?

130
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,512
But it's difficult to determine

131
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,212
which part of his face he is pointing at.

132
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,912
Was it the eyes or the mouth?

133
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:24,812
The police wants to talk.

134
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:26,412
What on earth about?

135
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:30,612
Mr. Nakamura was found dead on the roof farm this morning.

136
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,112
What? Gramps Troublemaker?

137
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,812
So, our farm will find some peace from now.

138
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:40,512
I feel like my heart has suddenly gotten light.

139
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,912
Are you sure it's them, these three people?

140
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:45,312
Yes, sir. When I came to the farm the other day,

141
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:49,612
I heard that those people were being troubled by Mr. Nakamura.

142
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,312
He soaked Ms. Mejiro's lot in water.

143
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:55,412
Mr. Taguchi's insect repellent net was broken by him.

144
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,412
Ms. Inoue said that

145
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,112
he had disposed of the weeds he pulled out on her lot.

146
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:02,912
I'm sure that they had other things done to them, too.

147
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,012
So, all of the things he did accumulated hate after hate in them

148
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,412
and they finally...

149
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,212
Hey, you mean that old man was killed?

150
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,712
Don't tell me you think we did it?

151
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,812
Come, come...

152
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:15,912
We haven't concluded it's a murder yet.

153
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,012
We just want to hear what you have to say,

154
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,412
so would like to ask you to cooperate with us voluntarily.

155
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:23,512
Please tell me what you three were doing and where you were

156
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:28,512
around the estimated time of death of the victim.

157
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:33,612
Okay. Ms. Mejiro, I believe your lot was diagonally across

158
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,712
from Mr. Nakamura's, shall we start with you then?

159
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:41,212
I work at the office here on the first floor of this building.

160
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,912
Since I couldn't finish my accounting work yesterday,

161
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:47,712
I worked on my day off and came in about 08:30.

162
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,312
Where were you at 10:00?

163
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,012
Since Ran and the others were coming here

164
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,012
to help me pick vegetable around 11:00,

165
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,412
I was working in the office till then.

166
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:00,812
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

167
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,312
Since it's Saturday today,

168
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:05,512
there's nobody else in the office but me.

169
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:08,112
Since Ms Mejiro works in this building,

170
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,912
so she can come up here right away.

171
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,712
Maybe the finger of the dead body was pointing at his "eye".

172
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:19,512
Then, the officer worker that has a lot next to Mr. Nakamura's,

173
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,512
Mr. Taguchi, how about you?

174
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:25,112
I went to the home center in the morning

175
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:27,312
to buy some fertilizer and stuff.

176
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,612
The fact is, I was going to come to the farm from afternoon anyway.

177
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,812
Is there anybody who can prove that for you?

178
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:38,212
If the salesclerk at the home center remembers me...

179
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:42,212
Right! I've got the receipt!

180
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,012
Here it is!

181
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:52,712
A receipt that indicates 11:00 doesn't serve a proof.

182
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,712
Oh, no...

183
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:57,912
Maybe his dying message was him pointing at his "mouth".

184
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:03,112
Then, how about you, office worker Ms. Inoue,

185
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:06,512
whose lot is next to Mr. Nakamura's?

186
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:10,512
Since I'm off work today, I got up late.

187
00:11:10,512 --> 00:11:12,012
And, how about around 10:00?

188
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,712
I wonder...

189
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,512
I think I was groggily watching TV after I got up.

190
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:21,812
I have nobody who can prove that since I live alone.

191
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:25,512
Ms. Inoue lives right below the roof,

192
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:29,912
but there's nothing in her name that represents the part of a face.

193
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:33,412
There's no one here that has a definite alibi.

194
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:36,312
You'll have to come with me to the site,

195
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,712
so I can ask you further questions.

196
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:43,512
Gramps Troublemaker troubles people even after he dies!

197
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,312
Be it an accident or murder,

198
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:48,212
there's no mistake that he brought it upon himself.

199
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,312
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

200
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:53,112
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

201
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,912
What a bummer.

202
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,993
Yes.

203
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,493
I see. I understand.

204
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,693
Inspector.

205
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:27,293
That cell phone was Mr. Nakamura's cell phone after all.

206
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,493
At around 10:00 in the morning,

207
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:31,493
he received a call from a non-displayed number.

208
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:34,393
It seems to have been dialed from a pre-paid cell phone.

209
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,293
We haven't figured out who the caller was.

210
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,893
-Check on it just to be sure! -Yes, sir.

211
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,793
What shall we do with the three people?

212
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:45,293
There seems to be no change in their attitude or testimony

213
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:47,393
even after seeing the site.

214
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,893
Inspector!

215
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:53,793
I've confirmed the images in the surveillance camera of the elevator.

216
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:56,893
Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof with the elevator at 09:00.

217
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:58,593
Then, until Mr. Mouri and his party

218
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:00,093
went up the elevator to the roof at 11:00,

219
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:03,293
no one else did.

220
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:07,793
So, no one other than Mr. Nakamura went up to the roof.

221
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,393
There seems to be nothing suspicious.

222
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:11,793
In other words,

223
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:15,493
this is an accident that frequently occurs to the aged.

224
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,293
After finishing his farming work,

225
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,693
he caner to the faucet to wash his hands.

226
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,293
Then, his cell phone rang,

227
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:23,293
so he got distracted and slipped

228
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:26,993
and hit the back of his head on the corner of the water container.

229
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:28,893
This seems to be what happened.

230
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,193
You mentioned earlier that

231
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,393
the strange position that the dead body was found,

232
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,793
it may have some meaning though?

233
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:37,793
Oh, no, well, I just meant that it could be a possibility.

234
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:41,293
When he slipped and fell,

235
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:44,093
he twisted his body in surprise.

236
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:45,593
How about the wound on his forehead?

237
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,093
It could be that the cell phone

238
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,693
that he was holding hit his forehead when he fell!

239
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,993
Okay. Let's conclude the case as an accident.

240
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,893
Something bothers me.

241
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:00,793
There are two suspicious points.

242
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:03,593
The wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead,

243
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,493
and why is it that he had a towel around his neck

244
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,393
and yet, another towel was found on the ground.

245
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:13,193
Ran! If you touch anything at the scene,

246
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,293
the officer will get angry at you!

247
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:19,293
The prop was down, so I inadvertently...

248
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,393
This is...

249
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,893
I see. So, that's the story!

250
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:37,393
So, now we get to go.

251
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:38,393
If it's an accident,

252
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:40,393
they should just tell us it is from the beginning.

253
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,793
My day off's been totally wasted.

254
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,293
I'm counting on you, Pops.

255
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,693
Wait...

256
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:57,893
Oh, no!

257
00:14:58,993 --> 00:15:00,093
Inspector!

258
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:05,793
There's a person among the three who killed Mr. Nakamura,

259
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:08,593
and is deceiving the police by making it look like an accidental death!

260
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:09,993
-What? -What?

261
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,693
What're you talking about?

262
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,393
You yourself said a while ago,

263
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:15,893
that this was a case of accidental death, didn't you?

264
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:20,093
That was a lie to catch the killer off guard.

265
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,893
Will you please gather the suspects here?

266
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:26,793
Are you planning to make your deduction like that?

267
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,293
Who cares about how I'm dressed.

268
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:32,593
What's important is the truth of the matter!

269
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:35,093
Goodness. What on earth's going on?

270
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:36,993
Geez.

271
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:39,393
The one who killed Mr. Nakamura

272
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:43,493
used a certain trick to make it look like an accident.

273
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:45,493
-What? -Trick?

274
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:47,493
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

275
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,793
You're still going on?

276
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,793
I figured out that it was a trick

277
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:54,293
at seeing the wound on Mr. Nakamura's forehead.

278
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,193
He wouldn't have that wound if he actually did slip at the place

279
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,593
where the faucet was and fell on his back.

280
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,493
Something came flying and hit him on the forehead!

281
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,993
But, hasn't it already been confirmed

282
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,793
that there are no other buildings nearby

283
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:08,193
where something can be thrown from?

284
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,193
Yes, that's why we were all deceived.

285
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:13,193
Our boy found something interesting

286
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:14,993
among the Chinese cabbage field.

287
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:17,393
Hey, Conan!

288
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,593
Here it is.

289
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,293
I gathered it and put it together

290
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,593
and it became one block of brick.

291
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,593
This is...

292
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,993
There's a hole in the middle.

293
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,993
The pieces of the brick were scattered

294
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:34,693
near the borders of Mr. Nakamura and Ms. Inoue's field.

295
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,993
That came flying

296
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,693
and wounded Mr. Nakamura on the forehead.

297
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:43,293
It probably shattered because it hit the paving stone.

298
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,893
Came flying... from where?

299
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:49,193
The brick came flying

300
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:51,193
not from the side but from below.

301
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:53,093
From below?

302
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,693
The towel was on the ground

303
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,593
between the faucet and the fence, wasn't it?

304
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,693
I thought it was strange.

305
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:01,493
Despite Mr. Nakamura having a towel wrapped around his neck,

306
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:04,393
the fact that there was another towel at the site bothered me.

307
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:05,593
Come to think of it,

308
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:08,993
the old man had his initials embroidered on his towel.

309
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,093
There's none on that one.

310
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,593
Inspector, you remember that the paint from the railing

311
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:17,293
was stuck on the back of the towel, don't you?

312
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:20,393
Yeah, I heard the report.

313
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,193
But, what about it?

314
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,793
The remains of the paint

315
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,693
looked as if it had been scraped on strongly.

316
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:29,093
The towel was hung on the railing of the fence

317
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:31,293
and scraped along strongly against something

318
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,393
then eventually fell where it was found.

319
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:35,193
Just what do you mean?

320
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:39,593
The killer pulled a rope through the brick

321
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,493
which had a hole made in it

322
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:44,693
and the towel that was hung on the railing of the fence of the roof,

323
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,693
was probably sandwiched between the railing and the rope.

324
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:50,193
And, when Mr. Nakamura came in front of the railing,

325
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:52,793
the rope was pulled strongly from the floor below!

326
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:59,893
Mr. Nakamura then slipped,

327
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,693
and bumped his head on the water container

328
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:04,593
that was left there beforehand.

329
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:07,393
The brick that came flying hit the paving stone shattered

330
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:09,393
and fell into the field.

331
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:12,993
The killer pulled the rope and retrieved it,

332
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:16,593
but the towel was still left back at the scene of the crime.

333
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,193
She sandwiched the towel

334
00:18:18,193 --> 00:18:20,693
in order to block Mr. Nakamura's vision

335
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:24,193
so that he wouldn't see the brick that was hanging.

336
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:27,593
In other words, the person who killed Mr. Nakamura...

337
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:35,493
is you, Ms. Inoue!

338
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:37,793
-What the? -What's this?

339
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,893
What?

340
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:42,393
Me? Why would I?

341
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:44,093
I see.

342
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:45,493
The only one who could've carried out this trick

343
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:48,193
is Ms. Inoue who lived right below!

344
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,793
The faucet is right below the window.

345
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:54,693
Besides, Mr. Nakamura left a dying message behind.

346
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:55,993
What?

347
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:58,393
After hitting her head on the faucet,

348
00:18:58,393 --> 00:19:01,493
Mr. Nakamura realized that you had done this,

349
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:04,493
so he left a message behind pointing you out as the killer.

350
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,293
There's no part representing a part of the face

351
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:08,893
in the Kanji character of Ms. Inoue's name though?

352
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,593
No.

353
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:14,093
Mr. Nakamura's finger wasn't pointing at anything on his face,

354
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,193
but rather at the floor below.

355
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:20,193
In other words, it was a dying message saying that

356
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,293
Ms. Inoue who lived right below killed him.

357
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,093
I understand that by doing what you just explained,

358
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:29,493
it's possible to wound Mr. Nakamura's forehead and make him fall,

359
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:34,193
but how did she lure Mr. Nakamura over to the railing?

360
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:35,593
Right.

361
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:38,093
Are you saying that I shouted out loud or something?

362
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,393
If I do that, the neighbors would suspect me!

363
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:43,093
It's simple.

364
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:46,693
You used a prepaid cell phone.

365
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:51,193
After confirming that only Mr. Nakamura was on the roof,

366
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:54,393
you lured Mr. Nakamura over to the place where the towel was

367
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,593
by giving him whatever reason

368
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:58,693
and pulled the rope from below!

369
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:02,393
That only deduces that I was the only one

370
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:04,493
who could've used that trick, doesn't it?

371
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:05,693
The dying message sounds like

372
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:07,293
something you just put together for the heck of it.

373
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,193
Or, do you have any proof?

374
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:10,793
Concrete proof.

375
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,993
Before coming up to the roof, you said...

376
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:18,093
He goes and bumps his head on his own and dies.

377
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,893
Then he gets us all messed up in this.

378
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,793
What a bummer.

379
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:25,693
Back then, the police had not explained anything

380
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:27,893
as to Mr. Nakamura's cause of death yet?

381
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:32,293
The only person who could've made that remark

382
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:35,493
is the killer, Ms. Inoue!

383
00:20:38,793 --> 00:20:40,393
Officer Chiba.

384
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,793
Was Ms. Inoue shown on the surveillance camera

385
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,093
of the elevator after 10:00?

386
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,993
No, not even once.

387
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:51,093
Which means that Ms. Inoue had not left her room since.

388
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:54,793
If so, it should still be in her room,

389
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:57,993
the rope that she used to kill Mr. Nakamura!

390
00:20:57,993 --> 00:21:00,393
-Officer Takagi. -Yes, sir.

391
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:03,293
You don't mind us checking your room, do you?

392
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:09,793
You don't have to go out of your way to check.

393
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,293
Just as the detective said,

394
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,793
it's in my room

395
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:16,793
because I didn't have time to get rid of it.

396
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,593
Yes, I did it.

397
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,393
I killed that hateful troublemaker old man!

398
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,593
Oh, no. What a thing to do,

399
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:26,693
even if he did cause a lot of trouble to the people around him.

400
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,293
Trouble?

401
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:30,293
He did way more than cause trouble!

402
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:32,293
The vegetables that I gave all my love and care to

403
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:34,393
in raising over so many months

404
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,693
was all killed because of his insecticide!

405
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:39,493
That old fart...

406
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:42,493
Oh, so these were vegetables.

407
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,893
I thought they were weeds since they looked so flimsy,

408
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,393
so I poured insecticide on them.

409
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:51,393
They were vegetables that I raised from the seeds

410
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:55,293
that my father who died of an illness left behind for me!

411
00:21:55,293 --> 00:22:00,293
I couldn't forgive him for insulting my vegetables that way!

412
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:34,393
Ms. Inoue seems to have been living with her father

413
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:38,593
who was a farmer from the time she was a child, just the two of them.

414
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:41,293
So, when her father died of an illness,

415
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:43,293
the only thing that kept her going on living

416
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:46,093
were probably raising vegetables.

417
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,593
Huh?

418
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:51,793
I can't shake the feeling of having forgotten something.

419
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:04,893
Pops, play your role as Scarecrow Kogoro for a while longer.

420
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:09,093
"Next Episode" -A 50,000 yen necklace?

421
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:11,893
It could be a birthday present for somebody.

422
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:14,893
I won a ticket for an overnight stay at a hotel?

423
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:19,293
Huh? Mom, you aren't wearing anything around your neck.

424
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,493
Then, she can go wear a dog collar or something!

425
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:23,593
This old guy...

426
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:25,793
Is he even planning to give her a present?

427
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:36,434
Next Conan, "The Worst Birthday (Part 1)"

428
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,896
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:56,096
"Coke"

430
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:57,996
Shake well before drink!

431
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,896
Hey, wait! Don't open the can pointed toward me!
