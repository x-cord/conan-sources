1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,300
I tagged along with Ran and her friends

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,200
and attended the birthday party
of Remi Sekizawa the model.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,500
At the party, Sera noticed that

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,300
I was carrying the antidote for APTX 4869

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,700
and reported it to her mother, Mary.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
However, a murder occurred
at the birthday party.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
Meanwhile, Mary reminisced

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,500
about the time she was given APTX 4869.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,150
It was in London.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,000
And the person involved...

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,000
Tsutomu.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,600
It's been a while, Mary.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,100
The love for deduction
and the exhilaration of

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,200
unravelling mysteries
that comes before sleep!

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
The words "divine punishment"
was on the victim's forehead.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
What is the truth hidden in the darkness?

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,300
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,200
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
His name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,900
"A Birthday Party with Divine Punishment (Part 2)"

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,100
When I parted ways with Tsutomu,

22
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,000
I was still pregnant with my daughter.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Who are you?

24
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,800
That's right.

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,100
I'm not Tsutomu Akai.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm the woman
who is about to poison you to death

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,750
with this capsule.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
MI6 intelligence operative, Ms. Mary Akai.

29
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,700
I finally have you now.

30
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,000
I've been hanging around town
for quite a while now.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,100
While wearing your husband's face, of course.

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,000
I see. You lured me out to this country

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
so that you could
make our colleagues see him

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,300
and confirm it was really him.

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,400
You spent the last three years
disguising this meeting as a reunion

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
so that no one realises
that this was a trap.

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,100
Yes. After all, for Tsutomu Akai,
who was supposed to be dead,

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
to return to work at MI6,
you served as an obstruction

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,100
as you had made yourself disappear
all of a sudden.

40
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,400
Of course, I could tell
if my husband was real,

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
just as I have done.

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Or if it was a disguise
by the witch with a thousand faces.

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
But that's too bad.

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,900
I've already told my daughter that
if I didn't return in time,

45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,600
she is to tell MI6
that Tsutomu Akai is a fake

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,300
and leave London right away.

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,800
In that case,
how about I disguise myself as you

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
and go to see your daughter?

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,700
You talk as if you know
where my daughter is.

50
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,300
There is no way that you would know
if I even have one.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,750
You're right.

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,400
Perhaps I should leave my plan
of infiltrating MI6 for later.

53
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Then, until I complete...

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
this next objective...

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,400
which is to eliminate Mary Akai.

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,100
I would be in a lot of trouble
if you were to stay alive.

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,750
How does it feel

58
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,200
to die from the poison created
by your little sister?

59
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,300
What was that sound?

60
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,390
It looked like someone fell into the water.

61
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,200
Mum is running late.

62
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
What is she doing?

63
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,900
Mum! Were you able to see dad?

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Huh? Mum?

65
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
- Masumi.
- What?

66
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,950
Who are you?

67
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,590
It's me.

68
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,600
They made me take a strange capsule,

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,900
so I ended up looking like this.

70
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,300
It's Mary, your mother.

71
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,900
Really? Are you really my mum?

72
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,150
Yes.

73
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
I can't believe it.

74
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
It's just unbelievable.

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
What?

76
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,900
I can't believe Yumi is a murder suspect.

77
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
It couldn't be avoided.

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,500
The only people who could
slip some poison into Mr. Hanasaki's cake

79
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,100
were the ones
who sat at the same table as him.

80
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,600
There were four suspects:
the model Remi Sekizawa,

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Remi's sister Yumi, who is also our classmate,

82
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
( Yumi Sekizawa(17) )
Remi's sister Yumi, who is also our classmate,

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,490
( Mitomu Kushiyama(28) )
Remi's manager, Mr. Mitomu Kushiyama,

84
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,200
and Mr. Tsuguo Hatsune,

85
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
( Tsuguo Hatsune(21) )
the pastry chef who baked the cake

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,750
( Tsuguo Hatsune(21) )
and distributed it to the guests.

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,800
( Mizutoshi Hanasaki(32) )
Not only was the victim poisoned,

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
( Mizutoshi Hanasaki(32) )
but the words "divine punishment"

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,300
(Divine punishment)
but the words "divine punishment"

90
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,100
(Divine punishment)
were also written on his forehead.

91
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,300
So, the people who had markers on hand
are being suspected.

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,200
It was confirmed that
Remi did not have a marker.

93
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,600
Mr. Kushiyama, the manager,
had a marker in Remi's bag,

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
but it could no longer be used to write.

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Yumi was the only person
who had a working marker.

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
It's no wonder
she would be suspected the most.

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,200
But whoever poisoned
the victim left his or her seat.

98
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,600
You're right. Remi and Mr. Kushiyama

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,900
were sitting on either side of the victim.

100
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Mr. Hatsune could have slipped the poison

101
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,400
because he was the one
giving out individual cake slices.

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Miss Remi was sitting
between Sekizawa and the victim.

103
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,400
Yes. So, it would have been
particularly difficult

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,250
for Yumi to poison him, right?

105
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You know...

106
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
You called Yumi by her last name
without any honorifics.

107
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
It's like you're her classmate or something.

108
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
I should have called her Miss Yumi.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Is there any poison
in the rest of the cake?

110
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,350
No. Forensics contacted me just now.

111
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
There were high amounts
of powdered cyanide

112
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,450
in the cake eaten by Mr. Hanasaki.

113
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
However,
they couldn't detect any poison

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
in the Remi Sekizawa's half-eaten cake

115
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,000
or Mr. Kushiyama's untouched cake.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,600
There was nothing in the crumbs left

117
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,800
on Yumi Sekizawa's plate, either.

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Of course, there was no poison

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,600
in the cake Mr. Hatsune gave
to the other guests

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,500
or the rest of the cake
that wasn't given out.

121
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,700
There's also the problem with Yumi's bag,

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,300
which had a working marker.

123
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,600
Inside the bag holder under Yumi's seat...

124
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,500
There's something resembling
a strange black stain.

125
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
What could it be?

126
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't know.

127
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,500
That stain wasn't there
before Mr. Hanasaki was murdered.

128
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,600
- Pardon?
- Isn't that right, Conan?

129
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes.

130
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,600
Here, I recorded a video of Yumi and Remi

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
blowing out the candles on the cake.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
Look at the floor.

133
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,050
There's no stain, right?

134
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,600
You're right.

135
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Then, where did the stain come from?

136
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Wait!

137
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't enter the crime scene
without permission!

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,600
Let's get you two out of here.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,500
So, Yumi put her bag

140
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,400
inside this bag holder
under the seat, correct?

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes. That's why she would have noticed

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,950
if anyone were to touch it.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, what are their belongings?

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Remi has one handkerchief
and eye drops for dry eyes,

145
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,300
while Mr. Hatsune
has a smartphone, cigarettes,

146
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
and an oil-based lighter.

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,100
If that is the case,
we'll have to look at possible motives.

148
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
Does anyone have an idea

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
who would have a grudge
against the victim?

150
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I understand

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,900
not wanting to speak ill
of someone who just died.

152
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,700
- No.
- There are too many.

153
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
I wouldn't know where to start.

154
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,700
In any case, he has a terrible reputation
among my model friends.

155
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,600
He's a capable hair and make-up artist,

156
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
but he's always
making moves on the ladies.

157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,100
He would demand so much

158
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,850
in return for undertaking priority hair
and make-up sessions.

159
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,300
He would also ask for
a model's measurements

160
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,150
so that he could send them clothes.

161
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,900
How about you, then?

162
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,100
My sister can be careless,

163
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,500
so she would leave things
in the make-up studio,

164
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,900
and I'd come to get them back.

165
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,600
But sometimes,
her things would go missing.

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Were they things
like wallets and accessories?

167
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,900
No. They were things
like a can of juice she had drunk

168
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,700
or a half-eaten snack.

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,700
I asked the other
make-up artists and stylists,

171
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
but they didn't remember
throwing the things away.

172
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Then, how about you?

173
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
He often complained.

174
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,700
He would nitpick about things
at different stores.

175
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Not long ago,
he was enraged over the knife and fork

176
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,200
not being parallel to each other
on the table.

177
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,000
The fork he threw at the employee
managed to hit a guest,

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,300
and he was widely criticised for it
on the Internet.

179
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,800
As expected, he put out
a statement of apology for it.

180
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,300
All of them seem like shallow motives for murder.

181
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,400
You're right.

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,100
Inspector!

183
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,250
What?

184
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,900
There was a marker
in a waste bin in the kitchen?

185
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Does that marker work?

186
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,300
The cooks in the kitchen
didn't recall throwing it away.

188
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,700
But no one entered or left the kitchen

189
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
when the incident occurred.

190
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,850
That only applied to the cooks
who were in the kitchen.

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,700
They called out to each other
during the blackout, or so they said.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,400
But because it was dark,

193
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,550
they might not have noticed
if anyone snuck into the kitchen.

194
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Hold on. The only one who could do that...

195
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,900
It was someone who knew
where the waste bin was.

196
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,600
Mr. Hatsune, the pastry chef!

197
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,700
Only you could have done it.

198
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it wasn't me!

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Now that I think of it,

200
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
the wall socket where the projector
was plugged into

201
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,800
before it turned off due to
the plug disconnecting from the socket

202
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,900
was next to the door
that led to the kitchen.

203
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,100
If you were next to that door
distributing slices of cake,

204
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,400
you could have easily pulled the cord.

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,500
It's true that I might have been
next to that door.

206
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
When that guy fell,
everyone's attention was on him

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,750
and someone could have pulled the plug.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
And just when I thought
I was cleared from suspicion

209
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,900
because I didn't have the marker,

210
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,200
I can't stand being suspected once again
because of that!

211
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
Again?

212
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,400
You are all nitpicking!

213
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,700
You're not all that different

214
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
from that guy who's always complaining!

215
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Complaining?

216
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,500
I see. Mr. Hanasaki
wasn't poisoned with the cake.

217
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
The culprit went ahead

218
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,660
and fed the poison to him directly.

219
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,600
And they did it without knowing the words
that are distorting the truth

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,200
would be inscribed on his forehead.

221
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Inspector Megure.

222
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,100
Think about it carefully.

223
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,800
The cooks in the kitchen

224
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,500
would be holding knives
as they were standing.

225
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,000
No matter how well
they knew each other,

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
I wouldn't want to enter
such a dangerous place

227
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,900
in total darkness.

228
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,400
That's right.

229
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,100
But if it wasn't Mr. Hatsune...

230
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,700
The suspect would have to
add the poison to the cake

231
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,900
right in front of Mr. Hanasaki.

232
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
- That's the thing.
- What?

233
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,900
The culprit didn't poison Mr. Hanasaki's cake,

234
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
but they poisoned their own cake instead.

235
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,090
What?

236
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,100
Sera, I've bought two slices
of strawberry shortcake.

237
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Put them side by side
and place them on the table.

238
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,560
Okay.

239
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,200
Listen. Let's pretend Sonoko is the victim,

240
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,900
and I am the culprit.

241
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
When the culprit stood up,

242
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,950
they diverted Mr. Hanasaki's attention
and did this.

243
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,800
The strawberry on the cake
at the neighbouring seat

244
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,500
is on its side.

245
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,400
That's why
Mr. Hanasaki exchanged his cake

246
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,900
with the culprit's own.

247
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
But if he were dissatisfied with that,

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,800
he could have asked the staff
for a new slice of cake.

249
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,600
That would have been the case,

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,000
but Mr. Hanasaki couldn't do it this time.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
Just the other day,

252
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,900
the fork he threw at an employee
hit another guest,

253
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,400
and he had just come out
with a public apology.

254
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,500
People are going to talk about him again
if he were to complain

255
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
about a strawberry
that was on its side on his cake.

256
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,600
Isn't that right?

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,900
The one who left his seat

258
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,300
to pick up the phone
before touching his cake...

259
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,600
Remi Sekizawa's manager,

260
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
Mr. Mitomu Kushiyama.

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,600
The strawberry on its side on the cake

262
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
you said you haven't touched is proof.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,600
No. It was true that
my phone rang at that moment.

264
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,500
Right? There was an incoming call
to my phone, right?

265
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,700
You must have called the number
to make an incoming test call.

266
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,000
In a few seconds,
you would receive a call back

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
because that's what the service does.

268
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,100
No one could tell
if you muted the audio

269
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,630
and didn't listen to the message.

270
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,200
If you had the timing right
and called the number,

271
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,100
the call would come
and you would stand up

272
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
right before he ate his cake.

273
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,200
Of course, it had to be
after you poisoned your own cake.

274
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,250
But what about the marker?

275
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
As you already know,

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,800
the permanent marker
I had didn't work

277
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,900
because the cap had been removed.

278
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,200
So, how could
I have written those words

279
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,900
on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead?

280
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,050
Ran, did you buy
the thing I asked you?

281
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes. A permanent marker
and nail polish remover.

282
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,800
I uncapped the marker and made it
so that it doesn't work,

283
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,500
just like you told me to.

284
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,650
Thanks.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,400
A permanent marker usually stops working

286
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,200
because the ink has dried up
on the surface of the tip.

287
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,700
Just like this.

288
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,950
But if you poured nail polish
remover into the marker cap

289
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,500
and put it back on for a little while,

290
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,800
the acetone in the nail polish remover

291
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,700
would dissolve the dried-up ink
on the marker tip.

292
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,900
And that's how you
get the marker to work once again.

293
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,900
So, could it be that
the black stain on the floor...

294
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,900
He must have discarded
the nail polish remover

295
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
from the marker cap onto the floor.

296
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,800
He'd also leave the marker
uncapped afterwards

297
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,400
so that it wouldn't work anymore.

298
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
In other words, you predicted that

299
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,800
someone would ask Remi
to sign her autograph

300
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,000
and had her use
a non-working permanent marker

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,500
to leave such an impression.

302
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
Then, when Mr. Hanasaki fell over,

303
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
you pulled the projector's electrical cord

304
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,900
and made the entire room dark.

305
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,700
Using the light
from his glow-in-the-dark glasses,

306
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,000
you used the marker you fixed

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and wrote those words
on Mr. Hanasaki's forehead.

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,430
And that is the truth.

309
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
You made him wear those glasses

310
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,200
by telling him
Remi would find it funny, right?

311
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Besides, as her manager,

312
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,100
it's possible for you
to sit right next to him.

313
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,800
By the way, you planted the marker

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
in the waste bin in the kitchen

315
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,700
while getting water for Conan
before the party started.

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,200
You asked if we had any food allergies
out of the blue

317
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
so that you'd have an excuse
for entering the kitchen.

318
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,600
This is just my guess,

319
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,900
but you must have predicted that

320
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,800
when Remi tried to
sign with the non-working marker,

321
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,400
she would get a spare from her sister,

322
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,800
which you have accounted for in your plan.

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,800
Since Remi had the marker,

324
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,400
you were able to divert suspicion onto her

325
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,000
and then cover for her desperately.

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,400
And with the discovery
of a different marker in the kitchen,

327
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,350
she would be cleared of suspicion entirely.

328
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,800
Unfortunately, your plan
didn't take into account

329
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,700
the fact that Remi returned
the spare marker to Yumi.

330
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,100
But why would Mr. Kushiyama
do such a thing?

331
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,700
It's so that
Remi would develop feelings for him.

332
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,400
He must have taken the can
of juice and snack

333
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,500
from the make-up room
for the same reason.

334
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,750
What?

335
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
When Mr. Hanasaki saw that,

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
he must have threatened you.

337
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,050
Could it be that he demanded money
from you as well?

338
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,300
Yes. And the amount
kept getting higher and higher.

339
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,800
So, I had no choice but to kill him.

340
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I had to do it!

341
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
Move!

342
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,600
Conan, look out!

343
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,300
Are you all right, Conan?

344
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Yes.

345
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,900
I'm glad you're okay.

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Case closed!

347
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,500
You're right.

348
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,000
I have other things to attend to, so...

349
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,100
Could it be that Sera...

350
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,050
Yes, I've got it, just as you had hoped.

351
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
It's the antidote that might just
bring your body back to normal.

352
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,500
Well done.

353
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,400
With this, the time they've stopped...

354
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,000
It will finally...

355
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,300
move forward again.

356
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,000
Anyway, you should come in.

357
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,200
You have to get those clothes changed.

358
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
You're right.

359
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,500
What's with the cough?

360
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,100
Did you catch a cold?

361
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,400
No. They made me take a strange capsule.

362
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
It might be a side effect.

363
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Wimbledon.

364
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Is it that time of year already?

365
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes. I recorded this afternoon's match.

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
More importantly,
what are you going to do now?

367
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Are you going to the hospital?

368
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
No. If they had foreseen something
like this would happen,

369
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,850
it's prudent to think that
they would be waiting at the hospital.

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,500
But unless you have someone figure out

371
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,000
what happened to your body
and get it back to normal,

372
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
you won't stand a chance
against those guys.

373
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,300
Even with this body, I can still fight.

374
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
I won't lose to them.

375
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
But you were just given a strange capsule.

376
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,400
Minerva!

377
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
In any case, we have to
find out what that capsule is...

378
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,100
I'll help you!

379
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm Holmes' apprentice!

380
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Isn't this kid...

381
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,700
He looks exactly like the kid
we saw at the beach that time.

382
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
The magician who made Shu laugh.

383
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,600
If I recall, at the time,
he said his name was Shinichi Kudo.

384
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes.

385
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,400
And that he was Holmes' apprentice...

386
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,700
I'm Shinichi Kudo,

387
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,900
and I'm Sherlock Holmes' apprentice.

388
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,900
I've had my colleagues at MI6
research him just now.

389
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,150
There is a Shinichi Kudo
on the flight passenger list,

390
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
but he's supposed to be a second-year
in high school, just like you.

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,900
Then, did he take his little brother to London?

392
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,800
No, he doesn't have one.

393
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
And the two others travelling with him

394
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
didn't seem to be part of his family.

395
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
Not only that, the strange thing is that

396
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,800
Shinichi Kudo is a high schooler detective,

397
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,400
and he has been solving numerous cases
while we're not in Japan.

398
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,400
But he stopped doing so
all of a sudden in the last six months.

399
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Instead, a young boy
has been appearing at crime scenes.

400
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
That boy looks exactly
like the one on the TV, or so they said.

401
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,600
They don't just look alike.

402
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
He's actually Shinichi Kudo, isn't he?

403
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes. He must have taken the same capsule,

404
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,800
and his body changed into that of a child.

405
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
And it's very likely that

406
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,300
he must have reverted his body
to normal somehow

407
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,900
when he boarded the aeroplane.

408
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,300
If there is such an antidote,

409
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,400
you are to approach the boy

410
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
and retrieve it from him by all means.

411
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,100
That's right. And it's finally in my hands!

412
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What? The capsule's not in here anymore!

413
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But why?

414
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I was right to
put the antidote for APTX 4869

415
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,500
somewhere else just in case.

416
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,700
Come on, Conan, let's go home.

417
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,800
We'll leave you behind
if you don't hurry.

418
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait for me!

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,700
Oh, it looks like
your mouth ulcer has healed.

420
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,900
You're right.

421
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,400
Solving mysteries
is the best kind of medicine

422
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,960
for a detective, after all!

423
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,900
That jerk...

424
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,000
(Next Episode)
Here's the guy who has come to save me!

425
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,600
I'm sorry, Ryota.

426
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,650
This is the head chef's knife, isn't it?

427
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Yes.

428
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,900
Next Conan,
"The Red Sheep's Ominous Game (Part 1)"

429
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,000
"Memories of the Festival"

431
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,600
I'm glad your mouth ulcer has healed!

432
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,500
Of course, it would heal
after seeing your kick!

433
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes, that's it.
