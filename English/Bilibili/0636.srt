00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,340
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,040
Yes.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,240
Of course I do.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,540
Yeah. Yes.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,440
Yes, I see.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,240
Understood!

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,340
I will gladly accept the offer to perform!

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,840
Yeah, that's right.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,940
Ran, what show is that?

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,040
Well, they're asking dad

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,140
to appear on "The Most Useful School in the World" show

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,940
as an instructor.

14
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,640
That's amazing.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
For real?

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,240
Isn't "The Most Useful School in the World"

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,040
one of the most iconic shows on Nichiuri TV?

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,340
May I inquire how much my appearance fee would be?

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,240
Well, that sort of amount is a little bit...

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Is he planning to refuse?

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,140
What?

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,840
Yoko Okino will appear as one of the guest panelists?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm in! I'll do it!

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
Please allow me to participate!

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,640
Appearance fee? I don't need that sort of thing!

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,640
Dad.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,940
Looks like they're one step ahead.

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,240
Like the fog clears.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Let's see through love and crime as well.

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,140
Uncle Kogoro will appear as a lecturer on that popular show?

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,640

33

36
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:10,481
Is this too gaudy after all?

37
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,181
Perhaps Yoko would like the necktie I usually wear better.

38
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,581
Nothing will change no matter which one you wear.

39
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:20,281
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:24,081
Stop dilly-dallying. Hurry up and come!

41
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,881
Yes! My apologies, master.

42
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:32,381
Isn't that the leading figure in the enka realm, Noburo Kimijima?

43
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,981
"Noburo Kimijima (67), Leading Figure in Enka" -You're right.

44
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,981
But he looks kind of frightening and strict.

45
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:39,281
Noburo Kimijima is not only strict to others,

46
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,281
but is also famous for his self-discipline.

47
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:46,681
That's why he's still dominating the top seat in the realm of enka.

48
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:52,081
You're pretty supportive of him. Aren't you, Pops?

Mr. Kamisuwa!

It's been a while since we met in Hiroshima.

53
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,181

54
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,681
Yeah, it's all healed up.

Yes!

I assume our staff member has already informed you about it,

but we would like you to deliver a lecture on ways to protect yourself

Yeah. Just leave it all to yours truly, Kogoro Mouri!

Are puffed grain candies still available out there?

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,581
Yeah.

My apologies.

88
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,081
By the way...

89
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:48,881
I'm not seeing Ms. Yoko Okino anywhere.

90
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,181
The waiting room for our guest panelists

91
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,481
is on the floor below us.

92
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:54,981
Is that so?

93
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,581
There's no way she'll be placed in the same room as you, is there?

94
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:01,881
Well, then. I shall call you guys again

95
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,581
when it's time for our rehearsal.

96
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:06,581
Please enjoy your boxed lunches until then.

97
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:14,181
I see. So Yoko's waiting room is on the floor below.

98
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:21,381
I shall go and greet her now.

99
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,681
You're bringing your lunch with you?

100
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:31,681
Yoko's waiting room is...

101
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,081
Hold it, dad.

102
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,381
Why are you taking your lunch with you if you're going to greet her?

103
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,781
What do you think?

104
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:40,881
Of course I plan to have lunch with Yoko!

105
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:44,781
It wouldn't taste as good if I had to eat with those fellows.

106
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,281
I knew you were up to something like that.

107
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,181
Then again, we seem to have followed suit

108
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,581
and brought our boxed lunch as well.

109
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:53,781
Yes. Yes.

110
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,181
Understood.

111
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,581
Excuse me.

112
00:06:57,581 --> 00:06:59,781
I'd like to ask you something.

113
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,581
Where is Ms. Yoko Okino's waiting room?

114

Oh? Aren't you Conan?

00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,081
Who is he? Is he someone you know?

117
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:15,481
Yeah. He's a friend of Dr. Agasa and also a college professor.

122
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,281

124
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:34,281
Well, Ms. Yoko Okino hasn't arrived yet.

125
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,581

Well, then. Please do your best.

127
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:44,181
So Yoko hasn't come yet?

128
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:50,481
Anyway, shouldn't you go and greet Principal Sakai before that?

00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,081
You're right.

130
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:55,181

It's splendid, don't you think?

136
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,281
Speaking of this vase,

137
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:15,081
it was made in China back in the Qing Dynasty.

138
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,581
The Qing Dynasty?

139
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,981
That's right.

140
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,181
This vase was made in the time when Qianlong,

141
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:26,081
the sixth emperor of the Qing Dynasty and an art enthusiast, reigned.

142

My apologies, but can that wait?

146
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:41,581
We're having an important discussion right now.

147
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:46,281
So Noburo Kimijima is also a guest panelist for today's filming?

148
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:48,181
Pardon our intrusion.

149
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:51,581
But actually, we saw you earlier as well, Mr. Kimijima.

150
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,181
And we were just talking about you.

151
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,681
I bet they weren't pleasant things, right?

152
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,281
On the contrary!

153
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:02,281
Actually, the first record I bought when I was in elementary school

154
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,481
was that famous song of yours, Mr. Kimijima.

155
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:07,481
"A man must have guts, so bring it on!"

156
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,581
Oh, that song?

157
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,781
I see you have quite a pair of trained eyes.

158
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:18,681
I see. So Pops is a fan of Noburo Kimijima.

159
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,181
Mr. Kimijima.

160
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:23,681

-Okay. -See you all later.

172

Despite the warning, these two sure click well with each other.

173

Please let me help.

00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,981
By the way, regarding that vase,

180
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:31,381
how much do you think it is worth?

181
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:36,081
I'll have Mr. Honma do an appraisal on that in today's lecture.

182
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:40,181
Who was Mr. Honma again?

183
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,681
The appraiser who seems unapproachable.

184
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:47,581
It's true that Mr. Honma is a difficult person.

185
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,081
However, on the subject of appraising relic antiques,

186
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,381
his keen eyes are tried and true.

187
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:56,281
Wasn't there a hack appraiser with the name Hanamura or something

188
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:00,481
who was behind that case involving Thief Kid?

189
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:03,781
Their difference is like heaven and hell.

190
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,381
In fact, the ceramics and porcelain in this era

191
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:09,881
are especially popular among connoisseurs.

192
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,681
I think the estimated value for this ranges from 100 million

193
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,581
to 160 million yen.

194
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,781
100 million?

195
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:19,381
That high?

196
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,881
A vase like that... I mean, that vase is worth 100 million yen?

197
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:28,381
Come to think of it, at a recent auction in the United Kingdom,

198
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,981
another vase from the Qing Dynasty like this one was auctioned off

199
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,681
for an equivalent of 5.7 billion yen, according to the news.

200
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:39,881
It's a super treasure that even Thief Kid would go pale thinking about.

201
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:44,481
But then again, he should have no interest in something like a vase.

202
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:01,386
So this is where they film "The Most Useful School in the World".

203
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:04,286
"THE MOST USEFUL SCHOOL IN THE WORLD"

204
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:06,886
It's just like on TV.

205
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,886
Of course.

206
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:12,386
However, this place is surprisingly small.

207
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:15,986
They say things appear to be more spacious on TV.

208
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,786
That's right, dad.

209
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,986
They've given us the script for today.

210
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,786
What? I don't need something like that.

211
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,186
You don't need it?

212
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:28,686
So that's a puffed grain candy machine?

213
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,786
Let's see. The second period lecture is

214
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,386
"Experience the Fine Traditional Puffed Grain Candy Machine".

215
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:40,386
Rice, wheat, and corn kernels will turn into snacks instantly.

216
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,486
So it says.

217
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:47,486
How exactly do you make snacks using this machine?

218
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,686
You have to stay tuned for that.

219
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,386
I bet you'll be surprised.

220
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,986
So this is a puffed grain candy machine.

221
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,586
If I recall correctly,

222
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,586
its formal nomenclature is "grain expander".

223
00:12:57,586 --> 00:13:01,686
When grains like raw rice is poured into the rotating pressure chamber,

224
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:05,386
the machine will rapidly decompress them and turn them into snacks.

225
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,986
This is the first time I've seen the actual machine.

226
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:11,586
Well, isn't this Mr. Honma?

227
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:14,386
Please do your best today.

228
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,586
The class in the third period is

229
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,586
"Ascertain Real or Fake,

230
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:22,186
History of Counterfeiting and Modern Technology of Replica".

231
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:25,686
We've gone the extra mile and prepared real and fake antiques.

232
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:29,486
Mr. Honma will give a lecture on their differences.

233
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,286
The items lined up over there

234
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:35,786
are all counterfeits prepared by Mr. Honma.

235
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:39,386
And the artifact is the one Mr. Kimijima brought.

236
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:43,786
It's this one.

237
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:47,586
What do you think? It's quite a work of art, right?

238
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:50,886
This is... Excuse me for a second.

239
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,886
Remarkable...

240
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,486
Where did you get this?

241
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:01,586
Well, well, Mr. Honma.

242
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:04,586
I can see that it caught your eye.

243
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,086
Apologies, Mr. Honma.

244
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,086
Please appraise it when we're rolling.

245
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:19,086
Well, then. We'd like to use these three as examples of counterfeits.

246
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:20,986
Understood.

247
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:24,286
So that's how it was.

248
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,586
That's why Mr. Kimijima bothered to go as far as

249
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:29,386
to bring his beloved vase to the TV station.

250
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,586
Principal Sakai, Vice Principal Ueda,

251
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,486
and Class President Arita have arrived!

252
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:39,786
How do you do? My name is Sakai.

253
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:42,986
I look forward to working with you for today.

254
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:45,186
"Shinya Ueda" -I'm Vice Principal Ueda.

255
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,986
Nice working with you.

256
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,886
"Teppei Arita" -I'm Class President Arita.

257
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:50,986
It's a pleasure to meet you!

258
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,786
No, it's our pleasure to meet you.

259
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:56,086
Nice to meet you guys.

260
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,686
"Daisuke Tsuchiya (45), Director" -Now, if everyone is ready to begin,

261
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:01,886
I would like to start the rehearsal right now.

262
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:03,986
Let's start with the first period,

263
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,586
the lecture from Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

264
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,886
Good morning!

265
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:14,986
Yo... Yoko!

266
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:17,086
It really is Yoko Okino!

267
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:19,986
What? Ms. Yoko, you didn't have to come until the rehearsal

268
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,686
-for the second period. -Yes.

269
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,786
But when I read the script in the waiting room,

270
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:26,686
I learned that Mr. Mouri is the instructor for the first period.

271
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,386
Wait. Does that mean

272
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,186
you took the trouble just to see me?

273
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:35,086
No. I'm just here to say hello.

274
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:37,086
Let's get to the rehearsal!

275
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:40,186
For starters, what should I begin with?

276
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:44,086
Well, to kick things off...

277
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:47,386
Shall we start with your performance corner on the art of self-defense?

278
00:15:47,386 --> 00:15:48,986
Understood!

279
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:51,186
Dad's really giving it his all.

280
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:53,986
I hope he doesn't give out too soon during rehearsal.

281
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,886
Conan, you guys also came?

282
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,986
-Yeah. -We're here as audience.

283
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:01,086
I'm all sweaty since I rushed here in a hurry.

284
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:06,186
Excuse us!

285
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:09,386
Don't you think it's rude to take pictures without permission?

286
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,486
No, I'm just...

287
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:14,686
Hey, bastard! You took sneak shots of Ms. Yoko?

288
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,786
-Dad. -I'm sorry.

289
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:19,186
I'm a fan of Yoko, so I couldn't help...

290
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,886
If you're a fan of her, you should respect her even more!

291
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,486
He broke it.

292
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,886
As a grown man,

293
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:33,686
it's insolent of you to take peeping photos of an idol.

294
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:34,986
You should be ashamed.

295
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,786
But still, you didn't have to break it!

296
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:42,486
Screw it! I'm going home!

297
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:45,186
Wait! Please hold on.

298
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:46,786
Now, now.

299
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,286
Mr. Yamazaki, calm down.

300
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:52,486
Ms. Yoko, we'll handle this, so please wait outside.

301
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,786
All right.

302
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:59,086
Mr. Mouri, please continue with your rehearsal.

303
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,286
Got it.

304
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:09,886
Mr. Kimijima, please do us a favor, too.

305
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,186
I'll buy you a replacement phone.

306
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:24,486
Learn from this lesson

307
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:28,486
and stop taking pictures of other people without permission.

308
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:31,886
I'm truly sorry for this.

309
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,986
Idiot! There's no need to apologize!

310
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,886
Darn it.

311
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:44,586
Here are Mr. Kimijima's vase and three counterfeit items.

312
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,386
And we still need...

313
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:50,786
Hey, they say there's an awesome relic vase on display.

314
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:52,386
Let me have a look.

315
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:53,886
You can't!

316
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:57,886
This... This is epic! Let me touch it.

317
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,086
-Hey, you can't just go ahead... -It'll be fine.

318
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:00,486
-and take it! -It'll be fine!

319
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:02,686
I'll be in trouble if you touch it with bare hands!

320
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:03,986
Just for a while, just a while!

321
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:07,886
We shall proceed to the rehearsal for the second period.

322
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,386
Now, Mr. Yamazaki, would you please begin?

323
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:11,586
Yes.

324
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:31,486
Geez, Mr. Kimijima is hard to deal with.

325
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,686
Although we managed to restore Mr. Yamazaki's mood...

326
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,986
It was a close shave since we almost couldn't film.

327
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:43,386
Well, I guess the guy who took photos in secret was in the wrong, too.

328
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,386
Then, I'll go ahead.

329
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,586
Mr. Honma, where are you going?

330
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,886
I'm not interested in that.

331
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:55,286
He's saying things like that.

332
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:57,786
But the truth is he's scared, isn't it?

333
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,586
He's scared?

334
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:02,386
Well, Ms. Okino, please take the hammer.

335
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:03,786
Okay!

336
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:06,886
Please strike on this with full force.

337
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,186
What is this?

338
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,186
Well, just keep watching.

339
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,486
Ran, I think it'd be best if you covered your ears.

340
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:19,886
I'm asking what this is about!

341
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,586
All right, here we go!

342
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:34,186
That was scary.

343
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,086
Well, that's how it goes.

344
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,086
Wait. You knew about it, Conan?

345
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:44,786
Yeah. I've watched it on TV before.

346
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,586
That was some shocking noise.

347
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,086
It definitely surprised me.

348
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,786
Me, too.

349
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:54,186
Well, I want to apologize

350
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,186
for saying unnecessary things in the waiting room.

351
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:59,786
Because of me, you were scolded by Mr. Kimijima.

352
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,386
It's all right. Please don't mind it.

353
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:05,686
Don't make me repeat myself!

354
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:07,186
Yeah!

355
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,386
I said there's nothing to worry about, didn't I?

356
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,286
Although Master Kimijima is a strict teacher,

357
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:18,486
I still have complete respect for him.

358
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,586
Something is troubling her, don't you think?

359
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:27,786
You see, since my name, Okino is similar to her name, Oki,

360
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,786
I somehow feel a sort of close bond between us.

361
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:34,486
Sometimes, we even talk to each other when we're on the same set.

362
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:38,586
Is Ms. Shinobu Oki a disciple of Mr. Kimijima?

363
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:39,986
Yeah, that's right.

364
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:42,986
She said that the name Shinobu Oki was given to her by him.

365
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:47,086
I see. No wonder her name sounded like an enka singer.

366
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,986
However, although she's working harder

367
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:51,986
than everyone else to make her debut,

368
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:54,186
her effort is not paying off.

369
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,786
She also mumbled last time about how she should give up

370
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:59,486
and go back to her hometown if she really has no talent.

371
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,386
Is that so?

372
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,086
Mr. Kamisuwa! Something's gone wrong.

373
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,886
What is it this time?

374
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:12,086
What? Mr. Kimijima's vase has gone missing?

375
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,486
What?

376
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:16,086
The vase from the Qing Dynasty has gone missing?

377
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:22,286
We're in deep trouble. It seems nobody saw anything.

378
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:23,986
What's wrong?

379
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,086
Did something happen?

380
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,386
During the rehearsal of the first period,

381
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,986
it was definitely still here.

382
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:34,586
Isn't that right, Mr. Arita?

383
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,986
Yeah...

384
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,686
Why would you know something like that?

385
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:39,786
Oh, no. I'm just...

386
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,686
How did this happen?

387
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:45,586
Somebody must have stolen my vase.

388
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,086
No, we can't determine that just yet...

389
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:51,486
Who did it? Who stole my vase?

390
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,586
Principal Sakai! Don't tell me that you did it?

391
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,386
Why... Why would I?

392
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,086
When I showed my vase to you,

393
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,486
didn't you express a great deal of interest?

394
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,586
Master, please calm yourself down!

395
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,886
Even if we assume someone did steal it,

396
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,186
there shouldn't be anyone

397
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,386
who could carry a container with a vase hidden in it

398
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:13,586
and leave the studio during rehearsal.

399
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:18,686
That means the culprit is still in this studio.

400
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:21,186
And the missing Qing Dynasty vase

401
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,586
should also still be somewhere in this studio.

402
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:51,886
I have a request, Mr. Mouri.

403
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:54,786
I'm sure Mr. Mouri can find the vase without fail!

404
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:57,486
Of... Of course, I will!

405
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:01,386
That man is definitely hiding something from us.

406
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,886
Please do excuse me.

407
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,786
Does he know something else?

408
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:08,386
As for today's filming, we'll call it a day here.

409
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:10,386
Hold on for a moment!

410
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:14,286
Before we call it a day, let's wrap up the case.

411
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:19,874
Next Conan, "The Most Useful School in the World Case (Part 2)"

412
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:22,913
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:25,013
"Loud Sound"

414
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:27,113
We'll try our hands at an experiment on how to make things disappear

415
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,413
on "The Most Useful School in the World" show later tonight!

416
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,717
Watch it or lose out!
