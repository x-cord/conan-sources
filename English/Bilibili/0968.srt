1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.450
The murder that took place at
the new Nichiuri TV building

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.620
turned into a serial bombing case.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.300
Yonekura Isato Murdered

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.830
Hattori Heiji and I assisted
the police investigation,
Yonekura Isato Murdered

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.810
Hattori Heiji and I assisted
the police investigation,

6
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.640
and uncovered the terrifying truth
the true culprit had plotted.

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.150
However...

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.500
Hey! What are you filming for, you idiot?!

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.330
Who cares, Yone?

10
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.970
Ryohei must be Suemura.
Who cares, Yone?

11
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.390
Yeah.
Ryohei must be Suemura.

12
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.570
Yeah.

13
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.120
If we copy this video and distribute
it to everyone, no one can betray us.

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.240
All right. This is it.
If we copy this video and distribute
it to everyone, no one can betray us.

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.380
We should contact the
Hyogo police immediately.
If we copy this video and distribute
it to everyone, no one can betray us.

16
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.690
We should contact the
Hyogo police immediately.

17
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.140
Exactly.
We should contact the
Hyogo police immediately.

18
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.090
Wait!

19
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.520
Look at the screen.

20
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.400
There are four men in the shot, right?

21
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.900
Then who's shooting the video?

22
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.090
So there were five robbers.

23
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.910
Yeah.

24
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.290
Which means in the presence
of the final man...

25
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.040
It's already been set.

26
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.260
A bomb that could go off at any time.

27
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.640
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

28
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.530
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

29
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.240
Find the final remaining bomb!

30
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.200
The climax will have you
on the edge of your seat!

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.760
Always determining the one truth

32
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.540
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

33
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020
his name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:02.561
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba
(Finale)

35
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.591
"Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Finale!"
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba
(Finale)

36
00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:07.981
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba
(Finale)

37
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:16.021
They went to question Ishizawa after that,

38
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:18.241
but it seems like he didn't talk.

39
00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:22.061
It was already nighttime,
and they were at a hospital.

40
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.871
They couldn't push him too hard.

41
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.001
Which means it's our turn at bat.

42
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:30.381
Yeah. It's time to do whatever it takes.

43
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.131
That's right.

44
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:38.261
What? Ran-chan, you're not going to audition?

45
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:41.261
No. It's not really my thing.

46
00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:43.101
Why not?

47
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:47.121
Well, you know, I have
to look after the kids.

48
00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:49.281
I guess it can't be helped.

49
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:51.271
You've got to consider
Kudo-kun's feelings, too.

50
00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:52.981
It's not like that.

51
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:56.231
But I'm doing it, even if I'm doing it alone.

52
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.741
I'm going to get the part
and shake Gomera's hand!

53
00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:03.401
I-I'm not sure you can shake Gomera's hand.

54
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.461
Then Kamen Yaiba's!

55
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:08.771
We should probably leave soon.

56
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.631
You're right.

57
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:13.401
I'll get the others. Let's go
to Abeno Harukas together.

58
00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:14.131
Okay.

59
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:20.511
No New Messages

60
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:23.021

Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation HQ

62
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:31.151
Well, everyone?

63
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:32.731
Found anything?

64
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.531
Nothing yet.

65
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:39.861
The Hyogo police already conducted a
thorough investigation, so it's not that easy.

66
00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:41.881
I know that.

67
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.541
I'm telling you to figure something out.

68
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:45.911
Listen up, everyone.

69
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:51.421
We've learned that what we thought was a team
of four robbers was actually a team of five.

70
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:56.971
Not only that, but it's possible a bomb has
been planted in the vicinity of the fifth man!

71
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:59.591
They must've left something behind.

72
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.221
Find him!

73
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:02.131
Yes, sir!

Bombing Suspect

77
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.211
Well, well.

78
00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:13.861
You seem to be doing well.

79
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.741
Who are you?

80
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.611
Curious about that article?

81
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.351
Of course you are.

82
00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:26.461
After all, the bombs you made are killing
your old accomplices one after another.

83
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.871
So you're with the police.

84
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:32.631
Didn't Yonekura attack you and lock you up?

85
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:38.071
I think it'd be best if you gave
yourself up and talked to the police.

86
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.441
You've got your last
accomplice to worry about.

87
00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:44.761
Isn't there still another bomb you made?

88
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:49.891
So wouldn't it be planted near
your surviving accomplice?

89
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.401
It'd be better to talk to the
police and have him taken intoâ€”

90
00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:54.901
I don't know! I don't know anything!

91
00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:01.021
Hello? What's up?

92
00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:04.241
What? Got it! I'll head back immediately!

93
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.591
Abeno Harukas

94
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:29.071
Wow!

95
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:30.781
Look at all these Gomeras!

96
00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.691
What a view!

97
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:34.311
Let's go over there!

98
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:34.871
Yes!

99
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:38.911
There are so many kaiju balloons.

100
00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:40.521
Yeah, you're right.

101
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:43.571
You still haven't heard from Hattori-kun?

102
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:46.651
It's fine. He's always like this.

103
00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:50.121
I know. Ran-chan, take some pictures for me.

104
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:58.861
Nice.

105
00:06:58.861 --> 00:06:59.871
Kazuha-san.

106
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.801
Thank you for coming today.

107
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:07.051
This is Suzuki. He'll be
running today's event.

108
00:07:07.441 --> 00:07:08.551
I'm Suzuki of Nichiuri TV.

110
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:11.431
Thank you for auditioning today.
Suzuki Naoki (29)
Nichiuri TV Presenter

111
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:14.691
Thank you for having us.

112
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:19.111
Didn't you MC the production
announcement event, too?

113
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:23.771
Yes. I'm terribly sorry about
everything that happened then.

114
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:27.641
Anyway, I'll show you to the audition space.

115
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:29.121
Your green room is there.

116
00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:30.341
Okay.

Naniwa Police Hospital

118
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:39.171
Changing Room
Authorized Personnel Only!

119
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:56.811
Chief, we've confirmed
there were five robbers.

120
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:58.191
I knew it.

121
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.711
They were caught on the security cameras.

122
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:01.361
Hey.

123
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:02.531
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:08.031
Here you are.

125
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:12.901
This is the entryway of the victims' home.

126
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:18.691
Look closely at this gap.

127
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.301
He's got a watch on his right hand.

128
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:24.731
So he's left-handed.

129
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:25.421
Yeah.

130
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.641
None of the other four are left-handed.

131
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:33.061
Which means this is the fifth man.

132
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:39.531
The Hyogo police knew there was
a left-handed man in the group,

133
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.511
but that wasn't enough for them to go on.

134
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:46.611
All right. Search their
associates for left-handed men.

135
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:47.451
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:03.421
It's me, Katsuji.
You're in there, aren't you?

137
00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:07.881
There better not be anyone with you.

138
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:08.851
Nah.

139
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.231
Ishizawa Koichi (40)
Katsuji's Brother

140
00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:14.891
What? Ishizawa has a brother?
Ishizawa Koichi (40)
Katsuji's Brother

141
00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:14.971
What? Ishizawa has a brother?

142
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:16.601
Is that true?

143
00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:17.381
Yes.

144
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:21.221
Ishizawa lost his parents when he was young.

145
00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:25.731
He and his brother Koichi, who's two years his
senior, were raised at an orphanage in Kyoto.

146
00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:29.991
Koichi went missing after he
left the orphanage at sixteen.

147
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:33.051
Ishizawa himself left soon afterwards.

148
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:38.001
Koichi seriously injured his right
leg in a fight when he was fifteen,

149
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:40.811
and he has a slight limp.

150
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:45.001
And his brother Koichi is left-handed.

151
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:46.501
What?!

152
00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:50.201
Bro, what are you going to do?

153
00:09:50.201 --> 00:09:51.681
Run, obviously.

154
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:52.601
Where?

155
00:09:52.601 --> 00:09:56.841
I don't know! If I stay here, the
police will come for me eventually.

156
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:59.371
Then why didn't you flee sooner?

157
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:02.351
Yonekura's on the news.

158
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.901
I've got my hands full
evading debt collectors!

159
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:07.191
I don't have time to watch the news.

160
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:09.381
They shut off the power to my house.

161
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:10.681
I see.

162
00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:13.101
So that's how it is.

163
00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:15.531
What are you guys doing here?

164
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:18.791
We just followed you from the hospital.

165
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:23.581
Your brother's the fifth robber, isn't he?

166
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:26.341
Bro...

167
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:27.041
Damn it!

168
00:10:28.111 --> 00:10:28.971
Move!

169
00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:30.451
Hey, wait!

170
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:31.411
Run, bro!
Hey, wait!

171
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:31.881
Run, bro!

172
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:32.311
Hey, let go!

173
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:33.551
Bro!
Hey, let go!

174
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.951
Don't let him escape, Kudo!

175
00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:56.208
Damn!

176
00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:36.598
Don't make this difficult.

177
00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:39.028
You can't escape now.

178
00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:41.298

and please refrain from

185
00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:08.338
Yeah, we're on the West Amagi overpass.

186
00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:10.088
Are you okay, bro?
Yeah, we're on the West Amagi overpass.

187
00:12:10.088 --> 00:12:11.268
Yeah, we're on the West Amagi overpass.

00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:22.878
Jeez. She's so carefree.
At Harukas â™¥

195
00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:24.378
Did something happen?

196
00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:25.708
No, it's nothing.

197
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.258
I'm sorry, bro.

198
00:12:27.258 --> 00:12:28.128
Jeez.

199
00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:31.928
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've gone into work instead.

200
00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:32.958
Sorry.

201
00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.458
You're supposed to be working right now?

202
00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:36.138
Yeah.

203
00:12:36.518 --> 00:12:39.768
Yonekura asked me to work
security at an event for him.

204
00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:42.188
Where?

205
00:12:42.508 --> 00:12:44.018
Abeno Harukas.

206
00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:47.068
I think it was a movie production
announcement or something.

207
00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:47.958
What?

208
00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.428
Ran and the others should be at that event.

209
00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:51.538
Yeah.

210
00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:53.868
Did Yonekura give you any other instructions?

211
00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.218
I can't remember all of that.

212
00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:57.788
Answer the question!

213
00:12:57.788 --> 00:12:59.498
There are lives on the line!

214
00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:02.118
It's no use. They're not answering.

215
00:13:02.118 --> 00:13:02.708
Damn!

216
00:13:03.318 --> 00:13:06.268
He really didn't give me any details.

217
00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:08.768
He said there'd be kaiju
balloons or something,

218
00:13:08.768 --> 00:13:10.968
and that I should stand next to them.

219
00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:13.338
Balloons? You mean these?

220
00:13:14.018 --> 00:13:15.948
Yeah, probably.

221
00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.848
There are numbers written on
the weights of the balloons.

222
00:13:19.338 --> 00:13:23.798
He told me to stand between
numbers 26 and 27.

223
00:13:23.798 --> 00:13:24.988
That's it, then.

224
00:13:24.988 --> 00:13:25.728
Yeah.

225
00:13:26.028 --> 00:13:30.108
There are two bombs: one
in 26, and one in 27.

226
00:13:30.618 --> 00:13:34.638
The bombs are probably in the
weights of those two balloons.

227
00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:40.448
Shouldn't we cancel the event?

228
00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:46.168
I wish we could, but if people find out
about the bombs, it could cause a panic.

229
00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:49.718
These bombs are incredibly unstable.

230
00:13:49.718 --> 00:13:52.678
The slightest shock could set them off.

231
00:13:53.178 --> 00:13:58.178
In other words, we have to do something
until the bomb squad arrives.

232
00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:04.058
Thanks to your cheers, Yaiba was able
to defeat Jocker's monster!

233
00:14:04.438 --> 00:14:08.988
Finally, let's thank Yaiba with a loud cheer!

234
00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:10.478
Ready, everyone?

235
00:14:10.478 --> 00:14:11.688
Yeah!

236
00:14:11.688 --> 00:14:13.758
"Kamen Yaiba, thank you!"

237
00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:15.948
Kamen Yaiba, thank you!

238
00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:19.158
They said they'd provide a costume, but...

239
00:14:20.948 --> 00:14:23.158
Do I really have to wear this?

240
00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:25.538
What is this?

241
00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:29.548
Th-There are all these balloons?

242
00:14:29.818 --> 00:14:31.798
Let's split up and search.

243
00:14:31.798 --> 00:14:32.488
Got it.
Yeah.

244
00:14:32.488 --> 00:14:33.048
Got it.

245
00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.658
Damn it. Where are they?

246
00:14:44.658 --> 00:14:45.598
Officer!

247
00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.458
I'll help.

248
00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:52.488
In that case, could you check to see if
balloons have been placed anywhere else?

249
00:14:52.488 --> 00:14:53.788
Got it.

250
00:14:53.788 --> 00:14:56.358
Otaki-han! Have you found them?

251
00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:57.918
Not yet.

252
00:14:57.918 --> 00:14:59.818
There's so many of them.

253
00:14:59.818 --> 00:15:01.158
I found it!

254
00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:03.798
I found 26!

255
00:15:06.498 --> 00:15:08.228
I'm opening it.

256
00:15:25.168 --> 00:15:26.628
Ten minutes left.

257
00:15:26.628 --> 00:15:29.158
We don't have time to
wait for the bomb squad.

258
00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:30.278
It's an emergency!

259
00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:36.318
One Gomera and one Yaiba balloon have
been moved to the stage on floor 58!

260
00:15:36.638 --> 00:15:37.858
What?

261
00:15:39.308 --> 00:15:41.078
I became a huge fan after my brother took me

262
00:15:41.078 --> 00:15:46.398
to see a Gomera movie when I was three.

263
00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:49.918
If I'm given the opportunity to appear
in "Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba"...

264
00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:51.748
What should we do, Hei-chan?

265
00:15:51.748 --> 00:15:54.808
You guys head upstairs.

266
00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:58.178
Kazuha and Mori-san's daughter are there.

267
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.068
We'll handle things here.

268
00:16:00.068 --> 00:16:01.428
But...

269
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.498
There are tons of guests upstairs.

270
00:16:03.498 --> 00:16:05.808
You'll need people to help evacuate them.

271
00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:07.788
Got it.

272
00:16:07.788 --> 00:16:11.058
But if things get dangerous
here, you'd better run.

273
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.688
Yeah, I know.

274
00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:14.728
Let's hurry.

275
00:16:14.728 --> 00:16:15.628
Got it.
Yeah.

276
00:16:17.368 --> 00:16:20.858
Kosugi-san, you stay here. I have a request.

277
00:16:21.218 --> 00:16:22.368
A request?

278
00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.238
It's time for our final participant.

279
00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:28.528
Entry number 5, from right here in Osaka.

280
00:16:28.528 --> 00:16:30.248
Kazuha-chan, you can do it.
Entry number 5, from right here in Osaka.

281
00:16:30.248 --> 00:16:31.978
Toyama Kazuha-san.

282
00:16:40.438 --> 00:16:41.958
Huh? The music...

283
00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:42.968
Did it break?

284
00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:45.128
I wonder what happened.

285
00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:47.038
Kazuha-chan...

286
00:16:47.828 --> 00:16:50.238
I'm terribly sorry, everyone.

287
00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:54.228
Due to technical difficulties,
we'll be taking a break now.

288
00:16:54.548 --> 00:16:59.608
We'll be holding a handshake event with
Gomera and Yaiba in the elevator hall.

289
00:16:59.608 --> 00:17:01.908
Please feel free to participate.

290
00:17:02.718 --> 00:17:05.058
What's going on?

291
00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:07.618
I'm sorry. There's actually an emergency.

292
00:17:07.618 --> 00:17:08.518
What?

293
00:17:09.058 --> 00:17:10.658
I was asked to give you this.

294
00:17:10.658 --> 00:17:11.528
In Call
End   Hold
I was asked to give you this.

295
00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:12.328
In Call
End   Hold

296
00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:14.618
Hello?

297
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:15.338
Kazuha, is that you?

298
00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:16.208
Heiji?

299
00:17:16.608 --> 00:17:19.558
Listen, Kazuha. Stay calm and listen.

300
00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:22.088
A bomb has been planted
on that stage you're on.

301
00:17:22.088 --> 00:17:23.338
What?!

302
00:17:26.148 --> 00:17:27.138
Ran-oneesan?

303
00:17:27.888 --> 00:17:29.038
Let's hurry.

304
00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:31.698
If we don't get in line
soon, we'll be too late.

305
00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:32.588
Okay.

306
00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:33.718
Let's go.

307
00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:43.808
Is this a joke? A bomb?

308
00:17:43.808 --> 00:17:46.148
See the two balloons onstage?

309
00:17:46.968 --> 00:17:51.458
Yeah. There's one of Yaiba and one of Gomera.

310
00:17:52.168 --> 00:17:57.978
There's a bomb inside the weight that
has the number 27 written on it.

311
00:17:58.548 --> 00:17:59.298
I found it.

312
00:17:59.848 --> 00:18:02.728
27 is written on Gomera's weight.

313
00:18:02.728 --> 00:18:06.018
All right. Unzip it and open the lid.

314
00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:08.248
Got it. Give me one second.

315
00:18:08.248 --> 00:18:09.208
Well?

316
00:18:09.208 --> 00:18:09.848
Okay.

317
00:18:10.268 --> 00:18:15.238
The surrounding wires are bypasses,
so she just needs to cut them in order.

318
00:18:15.708 --> 00:18:19.608
Then she can remove the detonator.

319
00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:20.698
Got it.

320
00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:22.858
What is it, Kazuha?

321
00:18:22.858 --> 00:18:25.238
No, no, no! I can't do this!

322
00:18:25.448 --> 00:18:26.868
Calm down, Kazuha!

323
00:18:27.058 --> 00:18:29.428
Let's leave this thing and get out of here.

324
00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:30.408
You idiot!

325
00:18:30.408 --> 00:18:33.948
What do you think will happen to the other
guests if a bomb goes off right now?

326
00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:38.748
There's no time to evacuate everyone.

327
00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:41.298
Listen, Kazuha.

328
00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:43.758
Otaki-han and the others
are headed there now,

329
00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:46.008
but we don't know if they'll make it in time.

330
00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:50.508
I need to deal with the bomb
here, so I can't go to you.

331
00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:53.568
What? There's a bomb over there, too?

332
00:18:53.568 --> 00:18:57.398
Yeah, so you'll have to disarm that one.

333
00:18:57.698 --> 00:19:00.138
You just have to do as I say.

334
00:19:01.388 --> 00:19:03.768
It's okay. I know you can do it.

335
00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:06.908
What should I do?

336
00:19:07.198 --> 00:19:07.958
Okay.

337
00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.788
Switch to video and show me your bomb.

338
00:19:11.788 --> 00:19:12.958
Got it.

339
00:19:13.538 --> 00:19:14.658
Switch to video...

340
00:19:14.658 --> 00:19:17.208
Let me. I'll do it.

341
00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:18.288
Ran-chan.

342
00:19:23.268 --> 00:19:26.298
Just like I thought, it's
the same as this one.

343
00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:32.828
Kazuha, there should be small scissors
in the sewing kit you carry with you.

344
00:19:32.828 --> 00:19:34.978
Use those to cut the wires.

345
00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:37.978
Okay. I'm ready anytime.

346
00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:38.998
All right.

347
00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.218
1 Black
2 Yellow
3 Green
3 Black
4 White
5 Brown
Leave red and blue!

348
00:19:40.218 --> 00:19:41.978
First is black.
1 Black
2 Yellow
3 Green
3 Black
4 White
5 Brown
Leave red and blue!

349
00:19:42.528 --> 00:19:44.858
Kazuha, the black wire is first.

350
00:19:45.538 --> 00:19:48.938
I'll try cutting mine first. If
nothing happens, you cut yours, too.

351
00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:49.618
Okay.

352
00:19:50.738 --> 00:19:52.118
Here we go.

353
00:19:56.568 --> 00:19:57.998
Okay. Cut the black wire.

354
00:19:58.258 --> 00:19:59.258
Got it.

355
00:20:00.398 --> 00:20:01.178
I did it.

356
00:20:01.178 --> 00:20:01.998
All right.

357
00:20:02.348 --> 00:20:03.578
Let's keep going.

358
00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:04.948
Next is yellow.

359
00:20:06.878 --> 00:20:10.008
Okay. That just leaves the big one.

360
00:20:10.598 --> 00:20:15.228
Inside the tube connected to the red wire,

361
00:20:15.228 --> 00:20:19.228
see the tube connected to the blue wire
being held up by some plastic rods?

362
00:20:19.228 --> 00:20:20.148
Yeah.

363
00:20:20.598 --> 00:20:24.948
Remove the dangling tube without
touching the surrounding tube,

364
00:20:24.948 --> 00:20:27.318
cut the blue wire, and you're done.

365
00:20:28.258 --> 00:20:33.108
First we'll unscrew the plastic
rods supporting it, and...

366
00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.078
I can't!

367
00:20:34.078 --> 00:20:35.878
What's wrong, Kazuha?

368
00:20:36.858 --> 00:20:39.248
I don't have a screwdriver.

369
00:20:40.398 --> 00:20:41.468
What should I do?

370
00:20:41.468 --> 00:20:44.758
You don't have one in your sewing kit?

371
00:20:44.758 --> 00:20:46.458
Of course not!

372
00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:49.218
Damn! We're so close...

373
00:20:49.688 --> 00:20:50.828
This isn't good, Hattori.

374
00:20:50.828 --> 00:20:52.138
We've got less than three minutes left.

375
00:20:52.638 --> 00:20:56.388
Is there anything in the area
that you could use instead?

376
00:20:56.938 --> 00:21:00.728
There's nothing that convenient
just lying around...

377
00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.738
I found it. I found something, Heiji.

378
00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:05.648
Hurry, Kazuha! There's no time!

379
00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.838
Forgive me, Yaiba.

380
00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:10.898
Give me the scissors.

381
00:21:10.898 --> 00:21:11.848
Okay.

382
00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.048
Ran-chan, cut it!

383
00:21:33.198 --> 00:21:34.698
Is it over?

384
00:21:34.698 --> 00:21:37.158
Looks like it. It didn't explode.

385
00:21:37.718 --> 00:21:40.378
There's no bell or buzzer or anything?

386
00:21:40.378 --> 00:21:42.808
No. It's over.

387
00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:46.308
You did a good job, Kazuha.

388
00:21:48.158 --> 00:21:50.018
Yes!

389
00:21:55.698 --> 00:21:56.978
By the way, Kazuha...

390
00:21:56.978 --> 00:21:58.328
What?

391
00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:02.688
That outfit looks great on you.

392
00:22:03.968 --> 00:22:06.018
Don't look!

393
00:23:44.928 --> 00:23:49.158
Filming Underway!!

394
00:23:49.158 --> 00:23:51.948
So they blew up the new building in the end.
Filming Underway!!

395
00:23:51.948 --> 00:23:53.608
Filming Underway!!
