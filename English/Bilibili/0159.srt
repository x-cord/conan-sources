00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.566
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.366
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.366
Today, we visited a five-story pagoda deep in the mountains.

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.466
Its legendary power leads to an impossible crime!

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.166
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.066
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.466
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:08.404
"Genkai Temple"

11
00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:14.904
Beautiful! What a great change of pace!

12
00:02:14.904 --> 00:02:17.604
And we owe it all to you

13
00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.304
for winning this prize in the contest.

14
00:02:20.304 --> 00:02:24.404
But Conan, you're the one who solved the puzzle for me.

15
00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:27.204
I couldn't believe how easy it was.

16
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:33.104
Dad!

17
00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:34.204
Let's go!

18
00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:35.404
I hate it here!

19
00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:37.504
This place is so depressing!

20
00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:41.504
These free trips really are lousy!

21
00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:42.704
What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.404
When you first heard about it,

23
00:02:44.404 --> 00:02:46.804
you were so excited about taking a trip for free.

24
00:02:46.804 --> 00:02:48.804
You two go on without me!

25
00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:52.304
I'll just go back to the hotel and soak in the bath!

26
00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:53.304
Excuse me.

27
00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:56.104
"Juukichi Okabe (55)" -Smoking is not allowed on temple grounds.

28
00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:58.604
I didn't know.

29
00:02:58.604 --> 00:03:00.904
We're terribly sorry

30
00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:03.004
It's nothing. But it's true.

31
00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.204
This place may be boring to the tourists.

32
00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.104
That's not true!

33
00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:13.104
You don't see sights like this while living in the city.

34
00:03:13.104 --> 00:03:15.504
It cleanses the soul.

35
00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:16.804
How nice of you.

36
00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:18.904
For one so young you're very admirable,

37
00:03:18.904 --> 00:03:22.404
If you like, I'll give you a tour of the temple.

38
00:03:22.404 --> 00:03:24.004
Really? Could you?

39
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.804
Count me out!

40
00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.804
You're being very rude, dad.

41
00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:30.404
-Come on, let's go. -Darn it...

42
00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:34.204
This temple was built 400 years ago

43
00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:35.604
400 years ago...

44
00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:37.204
It's very old.

45
00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:38.404
Because of its age,

46
00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:41.404
there are many historical sites here.

47
00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:44.804
For example, there is an old well near the pagoda

48
00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:49.804
which had been used until the middle of the Edo period.

49
00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:52.004
Why did they stop using it?

50
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.904
It suddenly went dry.

51
00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:58.304
Legend says that a young woman, who was heartbroken,

52
00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.204
cried for three days and nights straight in front of the well.

53
00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:02.304
As her tears ran dry, the water from the well

54
00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:06.204
filled her eyes and it was used up.

55
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.104
Ridiculous.

56
00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:24.904
There's a frightening legend behind this pagoda.

57
00:04:24.904 --> 00:04:27.304
What kind of legend?

58
00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:29.404
In the beginning of the Edo period,

59
00:04:29.404 --> 00:04:31.904
there was a young monk who the head monk picked

60
00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:36.504
to become the successor of this temple

61
00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:39.204
but he fell in love with a girl from the village,

62
00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:41.604
broke his vows, left the temple

63
00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:43.404
and ran away to get married.

64
00:04:43.404 --> 00:04:45.504
But...

65
00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.304
Perhaps it was a curse,

66
00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:49.204
the monk was taken away by the goshawk.

67
00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.204
The monk was later found dead.

68
00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:53.504
Hanging from the pagoda.

69
00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:54.704
How awful.

70
00:04:54.704 --> 00:04:58.504
There's more. In the middle of the Edo period,

71
00:04:58.504 --> 00:05:00.404
a misguided monk here

72
00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:02.604
sold the temples furnishings

73
00:05:02.604 --> 00:05:04.504
used the money for liquor.

74
00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:07.704
But one day he disappeared.

75
00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.104
A few days later,

76
00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:13.404
he was found dead hanging from the pagoda.

77
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:24.704
Since then, it has been said that

78
00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:28.304
whoever breaks the vows of the temple will be cursed.

79
00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:31.404
Hey, stop making those spooky faces.

80
00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:35.704
Ghost!

81
00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:37.604
Mr. Tan Kai!

82
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.804
Don't be afraid.

83
00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:41.704
He's the head monk of this temple.

84
00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:43.104
Head monk?

85
00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:45.304
"Tan Kai (60)" -So, you're pretending to be a family this time.

86
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:47.404
What are you looking around for now?

87
00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:48.604
No, wait.

88
00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:52.304
They're only tourists.

89
00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:53.504
They look suspicious.

90
00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:55.204
I don't trust them!

91
00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:58.204
I don't want you to bring strangers around without my permission!

92
00:05:58.204 --> 00:06:01.304
But tourism is the temples...

93
00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:02.504
Nonsense!

94
00:06:02.504 --> 00:06:04.004
Don't forget there are those

95
00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.504
who will desecrate this temple for that very reason!

96
00:06:05.504 --> 00:06:08.304
That's...

97
00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:13.904
But soon, punishment will befall the unbeliever...

98
00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:18.304
Punishment by the curse.

99
00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:27.704
Excuse me. Is something wrong?

100
00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:29.804
The truth is a tour company

101
00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:32.804
took control of this property

102
00:06:32.804 --> 00:06:38.104
and they decided to build an amusement park here.

103
00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:41.004
Then, this area is going to change?

104
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:45.704
Yes, the head monk is opposing it saying he was tricked

105
00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:48.604
and he's become bitter even toward tourists as you saw.

106
00:06:48.604 --> 00:06:49.904
He has some nerve!

107
00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:52.004
Scaring people Iike that.

108
00:06:52.004 --> 00:06:53.504
Come on. Let's get out of here!

109
00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:55.304
Dad, wait!

110
00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:59.904
I am sorry. My fathers quite short tempered.

111
00:06:59.904 --> 00:07:03.704
Don't apologize, the fault was all mine.

112
00:07:03.704 --> 00:07:09.304
By the way, is your father by chance Kogoro Mouri?

113
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.604
Yes. Well... he's a private detective.

114
00:07:12.604 --> 00:07:16.604
I knew it! He's that famous detective!

115
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:21.104
What an exciting story! I have to tell my grandchild.

116
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.604
What an honour.

117
00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:31.704
Thank you for inviting us to dinner!

118
00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:34.104
The honour is ours.

119
00:07:34.104 --> 00:07:36.404
"Yousuke Kajimura (43)" -Our hotel just opened.

120
00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:38.904
For a famous person as yourself to stay here

121
00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:41.304
is an excellent advertisement.

122
00:07:41.304 --> 00:07:45.904
I'm most willing to be of service if someone such as I am needed!

123
00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:49.704
You certainly have the most beautiful hotel here!

124
00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:52.104
"Hideaki Oda (56)" -Do you like it?

125
00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:56.904
The amusement park I proposed will be completed next year,

126
00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:59.904
then this place will be even more enjoyable!

127
00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:03.804
Really, it must be costing you a lot of money.

128
00:08:03.804 --> 00:08:06.904
Just about 80 billion!

129
00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:07.904
But once it is completed,

130
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.904
I am expecting it will bring in several hundred billion annually.

131
00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:13.804
That's incredible.

132
00:08:13.804 --> 00:08:16.304
Forgive me.

133
00:08:16.304 --> 00:08:18.804
I am the General Manager of this hotel.

134
00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:22.304
Kajimura. You're being impertinent!

135
00:08:22.304 --> 00:08:25.404
I can't believe you didn't realize that

136
00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.304
the infamous Kogoro Mouri was staying here

137
00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:29.604
until Okabe told you!

138
00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:31.504
It shows that you were very careless.

139
00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:33.304
I hope you learn from this!

140
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.304
Yes, I am terribly sorry.

141
00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:38.304
By the way, aren't you going to Tokyo tonight on a business trip?

142
00:08:38.304 --> 00:08:41.104
Do you think you should be wasting your time here?

143
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.704
Well, Mr. Mouri.

144
00:08:42.704 --> 00:08:45.204
I hope you enjoy your stay.

145
00:08:46.904 --> 00:08:48.904
Useless fool!

146
00:08:50.604 --> 00:08:53.804
Forgive me, I sometimes forget myself.

147
00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:56.604
You are very strict.

148
00:08:56.604 --> 00:09:01.504
I get like that when it comes to business.

149
00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:05.304
Hold on. Isn't that a diamond on your tie pin?

150
00:09:05.304 --> 00:09:08.604
This... It's nothing much.

151
00:09:08.604 --> 00:09:11.004
It's only about five carats.

152
00:09:11.004 --> 00:09:13.504
Five carats, you say?

153
00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:15.104
That's huge!

154
00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:18.004
Stop that, dad! You're embarrassing me.

155
00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:19.404
There, young lady...

156
00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:23.704
Your father is just reacting naturally.

157
00:09:23.704 --> 00:09:26.404
You call that natural?

158
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:28.804
Sir, your cigar!

159
00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:30.604
Okay.

160
00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:33.304
Hey! Where's the receipt?

161
00:09:33.304 --> 00:09:34.904
Sorry.

162
00:09:34.904 --> 00:09:38.204
The nerve! I can write this off as company expense!

163
00:09:39.904 --> 00:09:43.204
Do you always carry around so much?

164
00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:45.904
That's just petty change.

165
00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:48.604
I hate to use credit cards.

166
00:09:53.804 --> 00:09:56.104
"Shun Kai (26)" -Look at yourself. Enjoying a leisurely meal!

167
00:09:56.104 --> 00:09:57.904
You are a disgrace!

168
00:09:57.904 --> 00:10:01.304
Why if it isn't the heir to Genkai Temple?

169
00:10:01.304 --> 00:10:04.804
Have you completed your training at the head temple?

170
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.204
How dare you use political means to deceive my father.

171
00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:09.204
You won't get away with this!

172
00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:12.104
I've come back to the temple to make sure of that!

173
00:10:12.104 --> 00:10:15.204
Calm down, watch what you were saying!

174
00:10:15.204 --> 00:10:17.704
Your father and I discussed the matter carefully!

175
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:22.004
Enough! You told my father that he should sign over the deed

176
00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:25.404
to the people to Oda Tours temporarily in order to raise funds

177
00:10:25.404 --> 00:10:26.804
for the preservation of the temple's environment.

178
00:10:26.804 --> 00:10:28.604
He trusted your advice!

179
00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:33.004
But he's prepared to take you to court now!

180
00:10:34.204 --> 00:10:36.304
Is that all you have to say?

181
00:10:36.304 --> 00:10:37.804
What?

182
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.804
I am entertaining my guests now.

183
00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:42.304
If there is anything else,

184
00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:44.204
come to my office tomorrow.

185
00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:47.404
You're sadly mistaken

186
00:10:47.404 --> 00:10:49.804
if you think you heard the last from me!

187
00:10:49.804 --> 00:10:50.904
Let me go!

188
00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:57.304
Forgive all the intrusions.

189
00:10:57.304 --> 00:10:58.904
Too many problems happened

190
00:10:58.904 --> 00:11:01.804
Are you having trouble with the people at the temple?

191
00:11:01.804 --> 00:11:03.604
It's nothing.

192
00:11:03.604 --> 00:11:06.804
They are suspicious of the development plans

193
00:11:06.804 --> 00:11:09.604
and some of them are protesting telling us that

194
00:11:09.604 --> 00:11:12.904
we'll destroy the atmosphere of that rundown temple

195
00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:15.404
They are going to gain from the tourism business too.

196
00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:18.504
What a stupid bunch of fools.

197
00:11:18.504 --> 00:11:21.604
Ran, didn't we hear that a curse will fall on anyone

198
00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:24.004
who harms that temple?

199
00:11:24.004 --> 00:11:26.804
Conan, no! Don't talk about that now!

200
00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:31.104
I know about that legend!

201
00:11:31.104 --> 00:11:35.104
A lot of people have warned me about it!

202
00:11:35.104 --> 00:11:39.004
But that too can be used to draw the tourists.

203
00:11:39.004 --> 00:11:42.604
It's a matter of how one looks at things!

204
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.904
This guy is a shark.

205
00:12:02.604 --> 00:12:06.404
Hello. This is Mouri Detective Agency.

206
00:12:06.404 --> 00:12:09.104
Okabe here. I showed you around the temple yesterday!

207
00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.404
This is bad! The curse come true!

208
00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:13.204
What?

209
00:12:13.204 --> 00:12:15.604
The curse?

210
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:18.004
Please come to the temple right now!

211
00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:20.804
Hey, wait a minute!

212
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:28.904
Mr. Mouri! Hurry up!

213
00:12:28.904 --> 00:12:32.004
Hold it! I want an explanation!

214
00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:35.104
The frightening curse has come true!

215
00:12:42.304 --> 00:12:44.504
What? That curse.

216
00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:46.504
"Morning Prayer" -He is just reciting the morning prayers!

217
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:48.004
Not there!

218
00:12:48.004 --> 00:12:50.104
It's over there!

219
00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:00.704
Mr. Oda!

220
00:13:00.704 --> 00:13:03.104
It's the curse...

221
00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.193
The crime lab is done with their investigation.

222
00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:21.893
So the body will be lowered.

223
00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:24.193
"Officer Yokomizo" -How does it look?

224
00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:29.193
The victim was found with the rope tied to the railing.

225
00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:31.193
The other end was swung over the edge of the roof

226
00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:33.193
and around the neck.

227
00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:35.593
He has been tentatively identified as Hideaki Oda,

228
00:13:35.593 --> 00:13:37.793
president of a tour company.

229
00:13:37.793 --> 00:13:39.893
A private detective who knows him

230
00:13:39.893 --> 00:13:42.393
is going up to make a positive ID

231
00:13:42.393 --> 00:13:44.293
Private detective? What's his name?

232
00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:47.393
It's me, Officer Yokomizo.

233
00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:49.493
Why if it isn't Mr. Mouri?

234
00:13:49.493 --> 00:13:51.293
It's been a long time!

235
00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:52.893
Why are you here?

236
00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:55.293
It just turned out this way.

237
00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.393
To come straight to the point.

238
00:13:56.393 --> 00:13:58.793
What do you think about this case?

239
00:13:58.793 --> 00:14:02.193
From the evidence, it looks like suicide.

240
00:14:02.193 --> 00:14:05.093
Well... The circumstances are strange

241
00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:07.493
but it's definitely not murder!

242
00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:09.593
What makes you say that?

243
00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:12.893
First, Mr. Oda weighs about 100kg!

244
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.193
A normal person wouldn't be able to carry him

245
00:14:15.193 --> 00:14:17.893
all the way up there!

246
00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:20.993
And even if the killer managed to carry him up,

247
00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.193
the width of the stairwell is very narrow,

248
00:14:23.193 --> 00:14:25.993
just enough for one adult to pass!

249
00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:27.993
It's possible to drag him up

250
00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:31.793
but his clothes would get torn and the body would get bruised!

251
00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:35.393
And I did not notice any of those things just now!

252
00:14:35.393 --> 00:14:38.393
I see! You've deducted so much already!

253
00:14:38.393 --> 00:14:41.193
But why did he pick such a place?

254
00:14:42.293 --> 00:14:44.793
A little more...

255
00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:46.193
That's it! Stop!

256
00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:57.193
This is a new mark. I wonder how it got here?

257
00:14:59.693 --> 00:15:02.393
The rope is new but it's frayed in some places.

258
00:15:02.393 --> 00:15:04.693
What is it?

259
00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:06.493
How are we going to get him down?

260
00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:08.393
His feet don't reach the railing!

261
00:15:08.393 --> 00:15:10.293
That's not possible, isn't it?

262
00:15:10.293 --> 00:15:12.793
If his feet don't reach the railing...

263
00:15:12.793 --> 00:15:14.393
Hey, you kid!

264
00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:15.993
What are you doing here?

265
00:15:15.993 --> 00:15:17.593
Go down!

266
00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:20.393
I was looking for the toilet and got lost.

267
00:15:20.393 --> 00:15:22.993
It's not here, is it?

268
00:15:22.993 --> 00:15:26.393
That's strange. I wonder where it is?

269
00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.293
Who was that kid?

270
00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:30.393
Beats me.

271
00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:32.093
According to the crime lab,

272
00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:35.293
there wasn't much dust inside the pagoda

273
00:15:35.293 --> 00:15:38.593
so they couldn't find the victim's footprints!

274
00:15:38.593 --> 00:15:42.193
And we had the torn doctor do an autopsy,

275
00:15:42.193 --> 00:15:43.893
he didn't find any external injuries

276
00:15:43.893 --> 00:15:45.293
and the cause of death was determined to be

277
00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:47.193
suffocation due to pressure on the neck region!

278
00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:51.593
Meaning the direct cause of death was by hanging.

279
00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:53.193
The estimated time of death is

280
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:56.693
somewhere between 3 and 4 am.

281
00:15:56.693 --> 00:15:59.293
Mr. Oda was using a suite in his hotel

282
00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:01.893
as his office and home

283
00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:04.893
but the front clerk said he saw Mr. Oda leave the hotel

284
00:16:04.893 --> 00:16:06.293
at about 2:30 am.

285
00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:07.893
Judging by the time,

286
00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:11.993
I think it's safe to assume he came straight here?

287
00:16:11.993 --> 00:16:14.593
-Is there any will? -We haven't found one yet!

288
00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:15.993
Mr. Oda!

289
00:16:19.593 --> 00:16:22.793
Mr. Oda! Why did you kill yourself?

290
00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:25.893
You should have waited, just a little longer...

291
00:16:25.893 --> 00:16:28.193
Excuse me, who are you?

292
00:16:29.393 --> 00:16:32.493
I am employed as the general manager of Hotel Oda.

293
00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:34.593
My name is Kajimura.

294
00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:37.993
It seems that you weren't here last night.

295
00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:40.593
Yes. I have a sudden business trip.

296
00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:45.193
Do you know of any reason why he would commit suicide?

297
00:16:45.193 --> 00:16:47.893
The truth is, the purpose of my business trip

298
00:16:47.893 --> 00:16:49.993
was to raise funds...

299
00:16:49.993 --> 00:16:52.093
If I failed,

300
00:16:52.093 --> 00:16:53.593
the checks the firm wrote this month

301
00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:56.993
would bounce at the end of the month.

302
00:16:56.993 --> 00:16:58.393
I wasn't the only one.

303
00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:02.493
Mr. Oda was also very worried about that.

304
00:17:02.493 --> 00:17:06.193
But he was carrying so much money on him last night.

305
00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:08.093
Mr. Oda had a lot of pride,

306
00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:11.193
he never showed his weaknesses to anyone.

307
00:17:11.193 --> 00:17:14.893
And of course, he always put on a bold front

308
00:17:14.893 --> 00:17:17.893
but last night, when he was threatened

309
00:17:17.893 --> 00:17:20.793
to be taken to court by the temple,

310
00:17:20.793 --> 00:17:22.693
he seemed very concerned.

311
00:17:22.693 --> 00:17:24.993
Look at this!

312
00:17:24.993 --> 00:17:28.093
It seems like he doesn't have his wallet!

313
00:17:28.093 --> 00:17:29.293
Wallet?

314
00:17:29.293 --> 00:17:32.693
There is no wallet in his possession.

315
00:17:32.693 --> 00:17:34.393
Isn't that strange?

316
00:17:34.393 --> 00:17:36.893
He didn't change his clothes

317
00:17:36.893 --> 00:17:39.893
but the wallet he had with him last night is gone!

318
00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.393
Dummy! Who carries a lot of money on them

319
00:17:42.393 --> 00:17:44.893
when they're committing suicide!

320
00:17:46.093 --> 00:17:49.393
I always told you to not wander around the crime scene.

321
00:17:49.393 --> 00:17:53.193
But his tie pin is gone too!

322
00:17:53.193 --> 00:17:54.293
Shut up!

323
00:17:56.593 --> 00:17:57.993
Are you all right?

324
00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:00.293
You mustn't interfere with the police work.

325
00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.493
Mr Mouri, what did he mean by tie pin?

326
00:18:03.493 --> 00:18:06.393
Mr. Oda had it on last night.

327
00:18:06.393 --> 00:18:09.693
The huge five carat diamond tie pin

328
00:18:09.693 --> 00:18:13.393
is indeed missing!

329
00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:14.793
Which means...

330
00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.993
he could have been robbed!

331
00:18:17.993 --> 00:18:20.193
Even if he was robbed,

332
00:18:20.193 --> 00:18:22.093
he was on his way to commit suicide,

333
00:18:22.093 --> 00:18:25.693
he probably gave up his valuables very easily!

334
00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:30.593
So it doesn't refute the suicide theory at all!

335
00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:33.793
If he was strangled,

336
00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:34.893
he would struggle trying to get free

337
00:18:34.893 --> 00:18:38.793
and scratch his own throat with his fingernails!

338
00:18:38.793 --> 00:18:41.493
But there are no traces of that!

339
00:18:41.493 --> 00:18:44.393
And even if this was a murder,

340
00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:47.093
how would the killer hang the victim

341
00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:50.193
from the top of the pagoda?

342
00:18:50.193 --> 00:18:54.293
Aside from suicide, it is physically impossible!

343
00:18:54.293 --> 00:18:56.593
If there was a killer,

344
00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.793
it would be that curse.

345
00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:02.793
It was a just reward.

346
00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:06.593
Heaven punished the unbeliever!

347
00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:10.193
I am Officer Yokomizo of the Shizuoka Prefectural Police.

348
00:19:10.193 --> 00:19:13.193
I'm sorry but may I ask who you are?

349
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.893
Can't you tell by looking?

350
00:19:14.893 --> 00:19:17.893
I'm Tan Kai, the head monk of this temple!

351
00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:19.893
I'm his son, Shun kai.

352
00:19:19.893 --> 00:19:22.893
I'm Okabe, the labourer here.

353
00:19:22.893 --> 00:19:29.593
Can all of you tell me where you were between 3 to 4 am?

354
00:19:29.593 --> 00:19:31.293
What is the meaning of this?

355
00:19:31.293 --> 00:19:33.293
Wasn't this a suicide?

356
00:19:33.293 --> 00:19:35.593
No, we haven't reached a decision.

357
00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:40.393
And also because some of Mr. Oda's valuables are missing.

358
00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:41.893
What did you say?

359
00:19:41.893 --> 00:19:45.993
Are you accusing us, men serving Buddha, of thievery?

360
00:19:45.993 --> 00:19:47.493
Oh, no.

361
00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:51.193
We just need your alibis for our records.

362
00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:54.793
You'd probably be happy

363
00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.693
if I said I was meeting with that no good liar

364
00:19:56.693 --> 00:20:00.393
but I was in the main hall chanting at that time!

365
00:20:00.393 --> 00:20:01.393
Chanting?

366
00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:04.893
You were chanting at that time of night?

367
00:20:04.893 --> 00:20:06.293
I had a premonition that

368
00:20:06.293 --> 00:20:09.393
the curse would come true!

369
00:20:09.393 --> 00:20:12.793
A curse... you say?

370
00:20:12.793 --> 00:20:15.193
And what about you, Shun kai?

371
00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:18.893
I was asleep! Although I got up at 5 am!

372
00:20:18.893 --> 00:20:21.393
Then Mr. Okabe came with the news that

373
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:23.293
Mr. Oda was dead!

374
00:20:23.293 --> 00:20:25.593
I was so shocked

375
00:20:25.593 --> 00:20:28.493
so I called Mr. Mouri right away!

376
00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:29.893
I see...

377
00:20:29.893 --> 00:20:33.093
Why did you call Mr. Mouri first and not the police?

378
00:20:33.093 --> 00:20:36.193
This man is Oda's spy!

379
00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:39.093
He was the one who introduced me to Oda!

380
00:20:39.093 --> 00:20:41.193
Mr. Tan Kai! Mr. Oda told me that

381
00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:42.793
he wanted to help the temple

382
00:20:42.793 --> 00:20:45.293
by increasing the number of tourists!

383
00:20:45.293 --> 00:20:48.393
He... He lied to me too!

384
00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:49.493
You too?

385
00:20:49.493 --> 00:20:52.293
It seems the head monk here was deceived

386
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.293
and got the deed to the temple taken.

387
00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:58.993
So there are three people who hated Mr. Oda!

388
00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:01.893
So what if we did hate him?

389
00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:04.493
That private detective said

390
00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:07.293
there's no way that suicide theory can be disproved.

391
00:21:07.293 --> 00:21:11.593
And in a suicide, there is no killer, is there?

392
00:21:11.593 --> 00:21:15.393
Well... We haven't concluded it as a suicide yet.

393
00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:18.793
Then make a decision and get off of this property!

394
00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:21.293
I can no longer tolerate having these sacred grounds trampled on

395
00:21:21.293 --> 00:21:23.693
by those who are impure!

396
00:21:23.693 --> 00:21:28.393
But Mr. Oda's wallet and tie pin are indeed missing

397
00:21:28.393 --> 00:21:30.193
but from how things look,

398
00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:33.093
suicide seems to be the only answer!

399
00:21:33.093 --> 00:21:36.893
But something isn't right!

400
00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:42.693
His elbow is dirty.

401
00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:47.093
It's grass.

402
00:21:47.093 --> 00:21:49.493
Did he fall and hit his elbow?

403
00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:57.393
There's dirt on both heels!

404
00:21:57.393 --> 00:22:00.193
Why is there dirt on his heels?

405
00:22:00.193 --> 00:22:01.493
Wait a minute!

406
00:22:03.193 --> 00:22:06.293
If you look closely, you can see this rope is charred.

407
00:22:06.293 --> 00:22:07.893
Maybe...

408
00:22:13.893 --> 00:22:14.893
There it is!

409
00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:16.893
The tie pin!

410
00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:18.193
There's no mistake!

411
00:22:18.193 --> 00:22:20.893
This is where it really happened!

412
00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:25.593
If my theory is correct...

413
00:22:25.593 --> 00:22:28.293
Mr. Oda didn't commit suicide!

414
00:22:28.293 --> 00:22:30.493
He was murdered!

415
00:22:30.493 --> 00:22:32.493
And the killer most probably is

416
00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:35.493
the person who said what he did...

417
00:22:35.493 --> 00:22:36.693
It's him!

418
00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:05.693
"Next Episode" -How could that be?

419
00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:08.393
If he stood on the railing and his neck didn't reach the rope,

420
00:24:08.393 --> 00:24:10.693
he couldn't have committed suicide!

421
00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:13.893
Let's just say, for the time being that it was murder.

422
00:24:13.893 --> 00:24:16.993
How would someone hang him

423
00:24:16.993 --> 00:24:19.493
from a rope 50cm too short?

424
00:24:19.493 --> 00:24:21.593
Oh, you're right!

425
00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.493
This end was tied to the railing,

426
00:24:24.493 --> 00:24:27.993
why use a slipknot?

427
00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:29.493
Next Conan,

428
00:24:29.493 --> 00:24:33.514
"The Terrifying Legend of the Five-story Pagoda (Part 2)"

429
00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:36.695
Next Conan Hint:

430
00:24:36.695 --> 00:24:38.495
"Wallet"

431
00:24:38.495 --> 00:24:39.495
The next episode the part two of the story.

432
00:24:39.495 --> 00:24:42.295
The truth behind the legend might be even scarier!

433
00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:43.595
Please, don't.
