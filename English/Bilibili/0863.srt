1
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.570
Rum.

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.270
Just as I deduced.

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.870
The perp who killed Koji Haneda 17 years ago

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.270
is the bodyguard who disappeared from the scene of the crime called Asaka.

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.170
His identity is

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.270
thought to be the number 2 man of the Black Organization, Rum.

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.870
Even if he were to have left a dying message

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.170
just before he died, saying so

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.770
I can't get a hold of any further information.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
In the first place, is Asaka a last name or first name?

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.170
If it's a last name, I can't even make out the gender.

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.570
What drug was Koji Haneda forced to drink, anyway?

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.770
It seems to have been a drug that Ai's parents made,

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.470
but Ai who revived the drug said

15
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.170
she had no intention of making a poison drug.

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.870
Besides, when Gin forced me to drink that drug, he mumbled.

17
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.770
We'll use this.

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.270
This drug was recently developed by the Organization.

19
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.270
They won't be able to find any traces of poison in the body.

20
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.570
It allows you to commit the perfect crime.

21
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.970
It seems to be a prototype

22
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670
that has never been used on humans yet though.

23
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.570
Which means that the drug that I was made to drink back then

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870
was the drug Ai had revived,

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.570
and I was the first one they tried it on.

26
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.670
-I'm home. -Huh? A talk show?

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.570
With another detective?

28
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
Spirit Detective Gaito Hotta?

29
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.970
There was somebody like that before.

30
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270
A suspicious guy with that kind of name.

31
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.970
Anyway, more information needs to be gathered.

32
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.570
The site of that case hasn't been uploaded for a while

33
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.570
after it's been deleted either.

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.970
Huh? Solve the mystery

35
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.270
and disclose the truth of the Koji Haneda murder case?

36
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.670
The Koji Haneda murder case is the one

37
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.270
that happened 17 years ago in the States or wherever,

38
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.570
the cold case, right?

39
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.970
Huh? Summon the spirit of Koji Haneda?

40
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.770
I can't be wasting time on a stupid program like that!

41
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.970
What? It's just a corner of a late night program this time,

42
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170
but if the ratings are good, it'll be moved to golden time

43
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170
and my name will appear as the title of the program?

44
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.870
Furthermore, for the MC,

45
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.770
you have plans to call Yoko Okino?

46
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.770
Huh? Tomorrow morning at the restaurant of the hotel

47
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.470
you'll be explaining the arrangement?

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.570
Okay! Okay!

49
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.870
And what about the pay?

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

51
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.470
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

52
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.570
The information on Rum becomes eerily effective.

53
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.570
What is the spirit detective going to say?

54
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.370
He sees through the one and only truth.

55
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

56
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.070
His name is Detective Conan!

57
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:55.911
"The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 1)"

58
00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:02.511
Gosh. How come you're tagging along?

59
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:07.211
Because Ran's out overnight because of Karate training camp and not home.

60
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.711
It's not fair that only you get to eat at a restaurant, Pops!

61
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:14.011
Well, it seems the TV station's going to be paying for the meal

62
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:16.911
but don't order something too expensive, understand?

63
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:22.311
Moreover, I want to meet the spirit detective too, you see!

64
00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:27.111
That spirit detective Gaito Hotta summons the spirit of the dead

65
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:29.511
and blurts out things accurately

66
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:31.811
that only people intimate to the spirit knows, right?

67
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.811
Yeah.

68
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.711
There were a time when the bones of a missing person

69
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.811
was found in the mountains, too.

70
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:39.911
That was just a coincidence.

71
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.011
I hear that the bones were of a totally different person.

72
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:45.111
Besides, he was correct in many things

73
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:48.011
only because he made investigations beforehand.

74
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.311
The fact that he paid for witnesses

75
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:53.711
to give falsified testimony of missing persons was brought to light

76
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:57.611
and he was razzed by the media, then disappeared.

77
00:05:57.611 --> 00:06:01.511
But it's amazing how he made it back to television.

78
00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:05.211
Even though he appears with a new trick to deceive people,

79
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.611
I, the Sleeping Kogoro will see right through it.

80
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.711
That's right.

81
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.911
If a guy like that is deliberately going to summon

82
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:19.711
the spirits of famous people who crossed over in the past,

83
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:21.311
it could be that he has information

84
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:25.911
that no one else has gotten hold of yet.

85
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.111
I'll disclose what he's doing at all costs.

86
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.511
I'll get to the true identity of Rum.

87
00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:41.211
Mr. Mouri!

88
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.311
Well, sorry to have kept you waiting.

89
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:46.611
I'm sorry you had to come so early in the morning.

90
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.611
No, no problem.

91
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.211
So, you're Conan, right?

92
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:52.711
How do you do?

93
00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:55.811
I've heard about you. You're the Kid Killer, right?

94
00:06:55.811 --> 00:07:00.111
If it's okay with you, I'd like to hear some comments from you too, okay?

95
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:01.311
Yep!

96
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:04.611
Okay, shall we make the arrangements over breakfast?

97
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.211
Before that, let me take you to the room where Mr. Hotta is staying.

98
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.411
What?

99
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.811
It seems that he wants you to watch him summon the spirits first.

100
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:14.811
All right.

101
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.111
Okay, let's go then.

102
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:24.211
Well, I'm sure glad you brought Conan along with you.

103
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:25.611
What?

104
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.611
Although the part where he summons the spirits may be a bit dubious,

105
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:31.311
we can take pictures of him being surprised, you see.

106
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.711
I see.

107
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:35.511
It's hard to believe that this kid'll be surprised, though.

108
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.611
Huh? This is strange.

109
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:45.311
He's supposed to be in his room.

110
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:49.111
Maybe this morning when I confirmed the time by email,

111
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:53.711
he wrote that he would be meeting someone before the arrangement,

112
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:57.111
so maybe that someone is still with him in the room.

113
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:01.311
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

114
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:02.811
What?

115
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:04.911
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

116
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.111
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

117
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:11.511
Anyway, I'll go get the bellboy and have him unlock the door.

118
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.511
Mr. Mouri, please keep on the lookout

119
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:16.211
so that no one suspicious comes out of the room.

120
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.811
Yeah.

121
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:22.011
Don't tell me that this is part of the performance, too?

122
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:27.911
Jeez. What's taking him so long?

123
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:31.011
What is that director doing?

124
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.311
There they are!

125
00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:35.711
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

126
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.211
Mr. Hotta?

127
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:42.311
Mr. Hotta, are you in?

128
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:45.211
Never mind, just hurry and use the key!

129
00:08:45.211 --> 00:08:48.311
All right. I will...

130
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:50.211
Wait!

131
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:52.111
An incoming call.

132
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:54.011
Hello, Mr. Hotta?

133
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:56.011
Are you Mr. Hotta?

134
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.011
I'm sorry. It was a wrong number.

135
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.711
I'll open the door then.

136
00:09:00.711 --> 00:09:02.011
Okay.

137
00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:05.311
Mr. Hotta?

138
00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.011
What was that sound?

139
00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:11.011
It sounded like something cracking.

140
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:21.111
A wine glass and plate.

141
00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:25.211
It seems that someone had been drinking wine here till just a while ago.

142
00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.511
And that someone, surprised that we came in,

143
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:31.111
dropped the plate and glass cup,

144
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.311
stepped on the spilt wine and went into the room beyond.

145
00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.511
Somebody fled from the veranda just now!

146
00:09:52.511 --> 00:09:54.411
But this is the 4th floor, you know?

147
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:57.711
No, I'm certain I saw a silhouette of a person.

148
00:09:57.711 --> 00:10:02.311
I'll bet he fled to the next room from the veranda!

149
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.611
The slippers with the wine stains on them are left here, too.

150
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.911
No mistake about it!

151
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:10.411
Hey, Bellboy!

152
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.311
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.911
Is there someone staying in the room next door?

154
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:18.111
Yes, room 403?

155
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:20.011
A boy who looks to be in high school

156
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.211
has been staying there since a week ago.

157
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:27.111
Huh? A kid is staying alone for a week in a hotel by himself?

158
00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:28.911
More important,

159
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.711
what's this sound that I've been hearing from a while ago?

160
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.411
It's the sound of the renovation construction that's going on downstairs!

161
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:36.511
Since it's noisy and shakes a bit,

162
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.711
the rooms in this area are a bit cheaper, you see.

163
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:41.311
I see.

164
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:45.411
And? Where is Gaito Hotta, the man in question?

165
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.311
In bed, maybe?

166
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.111
Because there's a small mound there.

167
00:10:52.811 --> 00:10:56.711
But it hasn't budged an inch since a while ago.

168
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:58.211
So he's probably already...

169
00:11:22.278 --> 00:11:25.678
Gosh. What a cruel thing to do.

170
00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:27.578
Mr. Hotta.

171
00:11:27.578 --> 00:11:29.478
-Mr. Hotta! -No, you don't!

172
00:11:29.478 --> 00:11:31.178
Don't dare touch the corpse!

173
00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:32.278
Okay.

174
00:11:32.278 --> 00:11:36.078
I'll return to the front desk and contact the police.

175
00:11:36.078 --> 00:11:39.578
No. You stay here with Mr. Kokuri.

176
00:11:39.578 --> 00:11:41.478
So, call the police from here!

177
00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:44.078
Because if the perp should come back here from that window,

178
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:47.578
you may not be able to nab him alone.

179
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.778
Nab him?

180
00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:51.778
Where are you going, Mr. Mouri?

181
00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:53.978
I'm going to the room next door.

182
00:11:53.978 --> 00:11:58.578
That boy that's staying there may already be dead, though.

183
00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:06.978
Gosh! There's no answer.

184
00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:09.178
So, the perp's already...

185
00:12:09.178 --> 00:12:11.678
Gosh, who is it?

186
00:12:11.678 --> 00:12:14.578
What's with all the noise?

187
00:12:14.578 --> 00:12:16.478
You're...

188
00:12:18.178 --> 00:12:21.678
Huh? You're the guy from the detective agency.

189
00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:25.378
Masumi Sera.

190
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.478
You're here too, Conan.

191
00:12:27.478 --> 00:12:32.078
Hey, never mind that. Didn't anyone come to this room?

192
00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:33.878
Nobody came.

193
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.278
Are you sure?

194
00:12:35.278 --> 00:12:36.978
I'm sure.

195
00:12:36.978 --> 00:12:39.678
I'm the only one in this room.

196
00:12:43.378 --> 00:12:45.478
I see.

197
00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:47.378
So, this is how it is?

198
00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.178
You came to room 402 that's next to this room

199
00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:52.378
to meet with the spirit detective

200
00:12:52.378 --> 00:12:56.678
along with the TV director Kokuri, but...

201
00:12:56.678 --> 00:12:58.778
The minute you opened the door of the room,

202
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.078
you heard the sound of wine glasses

203
00:13:02.078 --> 00:13:07.678
and plates fall and crack.

204
00:13:07.678 --> 00:13:09.078
So you ran inside,

205
00:13:09.078 --> 00:13:11.578
you found that someone had stepped on the split wine.

206
00:13:11.578 --> 00:13:13.278
The traces of that wine lead into the bedroom beyond,

207
00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:14.878
so you opened that door and went inside.

208
00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.378
The window was opened

209
00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:19.578
and you saw someone run out to the veranda!

210
00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:26.278
And that veranda is next to the veranda of room 403 here.

211
00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:30.378
You figured that somebody ran along the veranda

212
00:13:30.378 --> 00:13:33.678
and jumped over the railing then fled into my room.

213
00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:35.278
Amidst all this,

214
00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:39.378
you realized that a small mound was created on the bed.

215
00:13:39.378 --> 00:13:41.778
So, you flipped the covers open...

216
00:13:43.978 --> 00:13:45.478
And found what you did.

217
00:13:45.478 --> 00:13:47.578
Yep! That's why we were wondering

218
00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:51.578
if somebody suspicious came into your room.

219
00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:53.678
I said I'm the only one here.

220
00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:57.878
But on the veranda of the room next door,

221
00:13:57.878 --> 00:14:01.578
wine stained slippers were found left behind.

222
00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:03.078
This is the 4th floor,

223
00:14:03.078 --> 00:14:05.778
so your room is the only place the perp can flee into.

224
00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.478
Anyway, let me check inside your room!

225
00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:11.578
The perp may have snuck in and is hiding right now, you know.

226
00:14:11.578 --> 00:14:14.378
I'm telling you that there's no one here, aren't I?

227
00:14:14.378 --> 00:14:18.178
More importantly, don't you have any idea about the perp?

228
00:14:18.178 --> 00:14:21.578
It seems that the victim was meeting with someone before meeting me.

229
00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:24.078
I'm sure that person is the perp.

230
00:14:24.078 --> 00:14:28.478
I think it involves somebody from the case 17 years ago.

231
00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:29.678
It seems that Gaito Hotta was saying

232
00:14:29.678 --> 00:14:31.578
he was going to summon the spirit of Koji Haneda

233
00:14:31.578 --> 00:14:35.578
who was killed in that case, you see.

234
00:14:35.578 --> 00:14:37.578
Haneda...

235
00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:38.678
Koji!

236
00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:42.378
And? Did you hear something about the case from that detective?

237
00:14:42.378 --> 00:14:44.978
No. It was before I met him, so...

238
00:14:44.978 --> 00:14:48.078
What? Do you know that guy called Haneda?

239
00:14:49.178 --> 00:14:52.778
Yeah. He was a Shogi player.

240
00:14:52.778 --> 00:14:55.278
Well, if you want to help out with the case,

241
00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:57.278
let me check your room!

242
00:14:57.278 --> 00:14:58.578
Because they're going to check this place out

243
00:14:58.578 --> 00:15:00.778
when the police get here anyway.

244
00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:02.678
Okay.

245
00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:05.378
I've got my undies and stuff lying all around

246
00:15:05.378 --> 00:15:07.378
so give me a minute, okay?

247
00:15:10.378 --> 00:15:11.778
Gosh.

248
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:15.178
How long is she going to take just to put her undies away?

249
00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:17.278
Excuse me.

250
00:15:17.278 --> 00:15:20.078
I just got a call from the front desk that we got a complaint

251
00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:23.978
saying that a car is parked in a place that's not the parking lot.

252
00:15:23.978 --> 00:15:26.878
Could the car be either one of yours?

253
00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:29.278
That's my car!

254
00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:32.878
I'm sorry. The parking lot was full, you see.

255
00:15:32.878 --> 00:15:36.378
I was thinking of parking it somewhere else later but forgot to!

256
00:15:36.378 --> 00:15:39.178
I'll move it right away.

257
00:15:41.878 --> 00:15:44.078
Thanks for waiting!

258
00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:46.078
Hey, wait...

259
00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.778
The best place to hide on the spur of the moment would be...

260
00:15:49.378 --> 00:15:51.078
would be the veranda!

261
00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:55.878
But there's nobody here, after all.

262
00:15:57.378 --> 00:16:00.478
The wine stained slippers were found

263
00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:02.478
on the veranda next door, which means...

264
00:16:02.478 --> 00:16:05.778
the perp had no choice but to jump over here.

265
00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:07.778
But since this is the 4th floor,

266
00:16:07.778 --> 00:16:10.078
the perp couldn't have jumped down.

267
00:16:11.678 --> 00:16:14.578
There's a car parked right below the veranda.

268
00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:17.878
Why is it parked in a place like that?

269
00:16:17.878 --> 00:16:20.778
Mr. Kokuri?

270
00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.678
So, it's Mr. Kokuri's car that was mentioned a while ago.

271
00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:26.278
It's a convertible.

272
00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:28.178
Nice car.

273
00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:32.178
But it's strange.

274
00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:34.678
The parking lot's pretty much open and yet.

275
00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:37.678
I wonder why he parked his car in a place like that?

276
00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:45.878
I guess I'll take a picture of it with my smartphone just in case.

277
00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:05.478
And also just in case,

278
00:17:05.478 --> 00:17:07.478
I'll take a picture of the back side of the veranda, too.

279
00:17:08.678 --> 00:17:11.578
Conan.

280
00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:13.478
Pops Kogoro is calling you.

281
00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:15.978
He says he's finished searching the room.

282
00:17:15.978 --> 00:17:17.278
Okay.

283
00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:18.978
Sorry to have intruded on you.

284
00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:24.978
So! It's just like I told you.

285
00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:27.478
That boy's keen and sharp, isn't he?

286
00:17:28.978 --> 00:17:32.978
More importantly, solve the case as fast as you can!

287
00:17:32.978 --> 00:17:35.378
If the police search this room,

288
00:17:35.378 --> 00:17:38.778
they'll find out about me, too.

289
00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:43.578
That guy'll hear about the Koji Haneda murder case

290
00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:46.178
and show up before that happens.

291
00:17:48.378 --> 00:17:49.778
Okay.

292
00:17:57.578 --> 00:17:58.978
A bowtie?

293
00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:14.278
Understand the process of the body being found,

294
00:18:14.278 --> 00:18:16.578
but the minute you opened the front door,

295
00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:19.278
the wine glass and plate fell and cracked.

296
00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:23.678
So somebody rushed and fled, you say but that's really hard to believe.

297
00:18:23.678 --> 00:18:24.978
Just about that time

298
00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:28.578
a renovation construction of the room below was underway

299
00:18:28.578 --> 00:18:31.078
and it shook a bit, correct?

300
00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:32.278
Yes, sir.

301
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:36.478
The construction starts every day from 9:00 a.m.

302
00:18:36.478 --> 00:18:39.078
You and the others entered this room

303
00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:41.578
just around 9:00 a.m. too, didn't you?

304
00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:43.378
Yes.

305
00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:48.778
If so, and the glass cup and plate were placed at the edge of the table,

306
00:18:48.778 --> 00:18:50.878
it would've fallen to the floor at the slightest shake of the construction.

307
00:18:50.878 --> 00:18:52.378
Then, why don't you place your cell phones

308
00:18:52.378 --> 00:18:56.378
at the edge of the table and try it out?

309
00:18:56.378 --> 00:18:57.978
True.

310
00:19:01.378 --> 00:19:03.278
Are you ready?

311
00:19:03.278 --> 00:19:04.978
Here goes!

312
00:19:06.878 --> 00:19:08.178
Huh?

313
00:19:08.178 --> 00:19:10.578
Half of the cell phones fell, but what about the other half?

314
00:19:10.578 --> 00:19:12.778
They're still on the table?

315
00:19:12.778 --> 00:19:14.878
I see! Although it may sway,

316
00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:16.978
you don't know which way it'll sway

317
00:19:16.978 --> 00:19:19.078
so all of the cell phones won't fall!

318
00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:20.478
I see.

319
00:19:20.478 --> 00:19:23.278
Even if the dishes were to be placed on the edge of the table,

320
00:19:23.278 --> 00:19:25.878
the chances of them falling to the floor are fifty-fifty.

321
00:19:25.878 --> 00:19:28.178
It'd be difficult to use as a trick.

322
00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:29.678
You're right.

323
00:19:29.678 --> 00:19:31.978
Besides, there's no guarantee

324
00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:34.478
that the construction would start at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

325
00:19:34.478 --> 00:19:38.978
As to that, the construction was always set to start at 9:00.

326
00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:40.578
The construction was delayed

327
00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:43.478
and the hotel was pressuring them to rush things on.

328
00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:46.078
Even so, you couldn't really tell whether they would start at 9:00 sharp.

329
00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:49.078
Well, as to that, we once had a complaint from a guest

330
00:19:49.078 --> 00:19:53.878
that the construction started a minute early!

331
00:19:53.878 --> 00:19:56.678
So the constructors seem to have been adjusting their watches

332
00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:58.578
to that of the hotel to be accurate to the second, you see.

333
00:19:58.578 --> 00:19:59.578
I see.

334
00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:04.978
Even so, it's just a coincidence that we opened the door at 9:00 sharp.

335
00:20:04.978 --> 00:20:07.678
We opened the door at that time to begin with

336
00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:11.178
only because it took Mr. Korkuri some time to get the bellboy to come.

337
00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:14.578
Jeez. What's taking him so long?

338
00:20:14.578 --> 00:20:17.378
What is that director doing?

339
00:20:17.378 --> 00:20:18.778
There they are.

340
00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:22.578
I'm sorry. It took me a while to explain.

341
00:20:22.578 --> 00:20:24.778
Mr. Kokuri only went to call the bellboy

342
00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:28.678
because he noticed an incoming e-mail from Mr. Hotta.

343
00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:32.978
Huh? Mr. Hotta mailed me an hour ago.

344
00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:34.278
What?

345
00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:36.478
"I'm going to be killed. Help me!"

346
00:20:36.478 --> 00:20:38.678
Hey, hey. Are you serious?

347
00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:42.978
Anyway, I'll go get the bellboy and have him unlock the door.

348
00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:45.978
Mr. Mouri, please keep on the lookout

349
00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.778
so that no one suspicious comes out of the room.

350
00:20:47.778 --> 00:20:49.278
Okay.

351
00:20:49.278 --> 00:20:51.078
Moreover, that e-mail came in an hour

352
00:20:51.078 --> 00:20:54.678
before Mr. Kokuri even realized that he got it.

353
00:20:54.678 --> 00:20:56.778
If he had noticed right away,

354
00:20:56.778 --> 00:21:00.478
we would've come into this room way earlier.

355
00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:04.378
There's no room for tricks.

356
00:21:04.378 --> 00:21:05.378
No!

357
00:21:05.378 --> 00:21:08.978
So the perp realized that we came in, fled in a hurry,

358
00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:10.678
dropped and cracked the dishes then...

359
00:21:10.678 --> 00:21:13.178
What's wrong, Officer Takagi?

360
00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.678
No. It seems that something got on my hand

361
00:21:15.678 --> 00:21:18.078
when I pounded the table a while ago.

362
00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:20.678
I wonder if this is salt?

363
00:21:20.678 --> 00:21:22.378
Salt?

364
00:21:22.378 --> 00:21:23.678
I see!

365
00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:26.678
If salt were used, what the Inspector was saying would also...

366
00:21:26.678 --> 00:21:30.778
On top of that, the coincidence that Pops was talking about would all...

367
00:21:30.778 --> 00:21:32.378
Really?

368
00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:33.878
When you pounded the desk right above

369
00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:36.578
where the dishes were on the floor,

370
00:21:36.578 --> 00:21:40.278
salt got on the base of your pinky.

371
00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:41.478
Really?

372
00:21:41.478 --> 00:21:43.378
Hey, hey.

373
00:21:43.378 --> 00:21:48.578
It sounds like you're trying to explain things in detail to somebody.

374
00:21:48.578 --> 00:21:50.178
Wrong.

375
00:21:50.178 --> 00:21:52.578
I have a habit of repeating things to myself.

376
00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:55.078
I organize my thoughts by repeating things to myself!

377
00:21:55.078 --> 00:21:56.678
Didn't you know?

378
00:21:56.678 --> 00:21:58.978
Really?

379
00:21:58.978 --> 00:22:01.278
I didn't know at all.

380
00:23:54.478 --> 00:23:56.678
"Next Episode" -And Mr. Mouri,

381
00:23:56.678 --> 00:24:00.678
did you really see somebody flee from the window?

382
00:24:00.678 --> 00:24:03.378
Yes, sir! I saw it clearly with these eyes of mine!

383
00:24:03.378 --> 00:24:05.478
How about it, Conan?

384
00:24:05.478 --> 00:24:08.678
Yep. It's a bit sticky, though.

385
00:24:08.678 --> 00:24:11.978
You found a trace of something pasted above the window.

386
00:24:13.778 --> 00:24:15.178
What's this?

387
00:24:15.178 --> 00:24:16.678
What's the matter?

388
00:24:16.678 --> 00:24:19.278
Did you find something?

389
00:24:19.278 --> 00:24:24.378
Next Conan, "The Spirit Detective's Murder (Part 2)"

390
00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:27.521
Next Conan's Hint:

391
00:24:27.521 --> 00:24:29.321
"Salt"

392
00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:30.621
What are you doing, Pops?

393
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:32.621
I'm licking salt and backsaulting.

394
00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:34.421
What a salty pun.
