1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to a deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,240
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,140
The star of the show today is Genta.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,940
Like you know he's not all that reliable, so let's all help him out.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:01,953
"Teitan Elementary School" -Dig in...

9
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,153
Listen, everybody!

10
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:05,953
Don't be picky and chew well when you eat!

11
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,753
Yes, madam...

12
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,053
Gosh.

13
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:12,753
I tell you, eating from a lunch plate in high school.

14
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:14,653
I feel like crying.

15
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,953
Oh, I sort of like this.

16
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:23,153
When I was in the States, I used to eat alone in the cafeteria.

17
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,053
That's why eating together with everybody like this

18
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:27,653
is interesting and very enjoyable.

19
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:31,453
Well, I felt nostalgic the first few time, too.

20
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,453
Oh, Mitsuhiko, you're not eating your carrots again.

21
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:39,953
Oh, I'm going to eat them all together at once later.

22
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,653
There are guys like him who push the food they don't like aside.

23
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:47,453
And, they are those who brag about how fast they can eat, too.

24
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,753
Well, in this class, the guy who just can't help but do so is...

25
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,853
I did it, I'm number one!

26
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,753
I was sure it was going to be Genta.

27
00:02:58,253 --> 00:02:59,653
Ms. Kobayashi,

28
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:03,253
I don't feel well, so may I go to the infirmary and rest a while?

29
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:17,553
"Genta's Misfortune"

30
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,653
We've got a case here.

31
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:23,953
Genta has virtually not touched his food at all.

32
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,753
I wonder if he's on a diet?

33
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:28,753
No way, he's too fond of eating.

34
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,153
Come to think of it,

35
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:33,053
Genta hasn't been playing with us the past 2 to 3 days, has he?

36
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,653
Even after school, he'd go home ahead of us, all by himself.

37
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:40,553
Maybe he's being bullied by the seniors.

38
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,653
Don't be ridiculous, Genta's not the type to be bullied,

39
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:46,853
and even if he were, it would be safer for him

40
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,553
to go home with us, wouldn't it?

41
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:51,153
Maybe he's got problems at home.

42
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,353
Huh?

43
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,553
Maybe somebody in his family is seriously ill

44
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,853
or maybe they are having all-out quarrels every day.

45
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:59,053
If that's the case though,

46
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:02,753
it's not something that we can do anything about.

47
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,553
Oh, no.

48
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,553
No such thing is happening.

49
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,053
Ms. Kobayashi.

50
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:12,953
His parents are healthy and well, managing a liquor store.

51
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:17,053
I went to visit Genta's house yesterday because I was worried, too.

52
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:21,053
But it is true he is afraid of something.

53
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,453
They told me that he would pull the covers over himself

54
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:27,253
as soon as he got home and tremble.

55
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:30,453
But, what is he afraid of anyway?

56
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:33,553
Well, no matter how many times I ask him, he won't tell me.

57
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,653
He keeps saying it's nothing.

58
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,453
Maybe he'll tell you people.

59
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,353
When you find out what it is, will you please tell me about it, too?

60
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,253
Okay.

61
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,553
Wait, Genta!

62
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,753
What are you sneaking around for?

63
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,853
Are you training to become a ninja or something?

64
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,953
I see!

65
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,453
You're on a diet, that's why you didn't eat lunch,

66
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,653
so that you could get into shape.

67
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:17,353
Right.

68
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:20,553
I saw a real cool Ninja movie the other day so...

69
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,753
Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:24,653
Why would a person like that be trembling under covers?

71
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:28,253
I'll bet you dreamt that you were being slashed

72
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,353
by some blood smeared samurai warrior,

73
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:33,453
and running around from an illusionary enemy of some sort.

74
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,553
Dream, no way! I really...

75
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,853
You really?

76
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:44,053
You really what?

77
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,753
To tell the truth, I...

78
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:51,553
My life is being sought after by a killer!

79
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,753
Killer?

80
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,853
Stop joking, Genta.

81
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:01,653
There's no way that a killer would come after a grade school student!

82
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,653
She's right.

83
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,853
After all, he's not me nor you.

84
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,053
Hey.

85
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:10,353
I was stupid to have told you guys about it.

86
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,953
Hey, wait.

87
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:17,353
Genta, please tell us more in detail about it!

88
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,953
I won't laugh at you anymore.

89
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,053
I heard strange footsteps

90
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:27,053
when I was walking along the road under the railroad track.

91
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,653
It was pitch dark that I couldn't see the guy,

92
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:36,153
but when I stopped he stopped and when l ran he ran.

93
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:42,553
It was most likely your own footsteps echoing off the wall of the road.

94
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,253
That's not all!

95
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,753
I was pushed off the stairs of the pedestrian crossing,

96
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,853
and even last night, a motorbike ran a traffic light

97
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,153
and came right for me.

98
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,353
It was probably only a coincidence, mere coincidence.

99
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,853
It was no coincidence!

100
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,553
Because that guy...

101
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,553
The guy...

102
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,053
What a large screw.

103
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:06,853
It's dangerous.

104
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,953
I wonder where it came falling from?

105
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,553
The neon sign of the department store.

106
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:28,353
I'm sure the bolt was old and it fell off coincidentally.

107
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,353
This is just a bad day, a merely bad day!

108
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:33,753
Genta, maybe you'd better go get exorcised.

109
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,753
No. It's neither a bad day nor a coincidence.

110
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,253
Look,

111
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,453
there are traces of the wiring having been cut by a knife.

112
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,853
It was cut beforehand,

113
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,353
so that when the bolt is loosened

114
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,653
and the neon sign falls it doesn't get stuck.

115
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:51,453
If so, it would fall indiscriminately on anyone

116
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,053
who walks below the sign.

117
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:56,453
It seems that the target was set.

118
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,153
Take a look at this.

119
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,853
Isn't this the Kamen Yaiba toy that Genta is always looking at?

120
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,853
Which means that...

121
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,053
Yeah. It seems that just as Genta says,

122
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,653
somebody is after his life.

123
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,653
There seems to be no doubt about it.

124
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:21,653
Genta, tell me more in detail about this.

125
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,653
About why you're being targeted.

126
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,853
Okay.

127
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,553
What?

128
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:37,453
You saw a serial purse snatcher?

129
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:41,553
You mean you saw that purse snatcher who's been attacking

130
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:44,453
only aged people and women In this area recently?

131
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:45,553
Yeah.

132
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:47,553
He looked just like the wanted poster composite drawing

133
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,253
at the police station.

134
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,053
Did you tell the police?

135
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,953
Yeah, about a week later.

136
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:54,953
Because when I first saw him

137
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,453
there was no composite drawing posted.

138
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,753
I remembered that I saw the purse snatcher

139
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,153
after I saw the wanted poster,

140
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:04,153
but I forgot where I saw him.

141
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,453
But, I found the young man

142
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,653
who saw the purse snatcher together with me.

143
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:11,753
Saw him together with you?

144
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:14,653
Yeah. About 5 days ago,

145
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,153
there was a purse-snatching incident near my house,

146
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:17,953
so I went to look.

147
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:20,753
Then, I found the blonde guy who was standing beside me

148
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:24,753
when the purse snatching incident happened among the onlookers.

149
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:28,253
And, what happened after that?

150
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:32,853
Of course, I took that young man to the police that was over there!

151
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:37,653
But that young man said, I don't know the boy nor the purse snatcher.

152
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:41,053
Are you sure you saw the purse snatcher together with that man?

153
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:43,053
Yeah. When I saw the purse snatcher,

154
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:46,153
it seemed that man was sitting next to me.

155
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,753
So I was sure that he saw him, too.

156
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,253
What do you mean by it seemed?

157
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,853
I was sort of sleepy then,

158
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:56,653
so I just happened to notice that the man was beside me.

159
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:58,653
What about the purse snatcher, then?

160
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:01,453
He may have been around and he may have not.

161
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,353
People usually get sleepy,

162
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,053
when they are in a movie theater.

163
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,253
Or in a train.

164
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:10,153
Judging from what Genta is saying,

165
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:14,053
it seems that the purse snatcher is after him.

166
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:15,153
Gosh.

167
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:19,153
And why didn't you tell the police that somebody was after your life?

168
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:22,453
I got a phone call.

169
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,853
I'll kill you if you tell anybody about me!

170
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:28,853
I'll kill your friends family and everybody around you", he said.

171
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,353
That's why you didn't say anything till now.

172
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:34,653
Yeah.

173
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:36,353
But, we do have a problem.

174
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:40,453
If he has your phone number, he probably knows your address, too.

175
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:41,553
Yeah.

176
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:43,653
If we rush over to the police,

177
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:46,453
the culprit may mistakenly think that Genta recalled something,

178
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:49,453
and God knows what the culprit will do.

179
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:52,953
He could be watching us here in this shop right this minute.

180
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:59,053
And, don't you remember anything else

181
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:01,653
that could serve as a clue to finding the culprit?

182
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:03,453
I told the police officer too,

183
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:06,053
but he was smoking a cigarette with his left hand.

184
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:08,853
Which means that the culprit is left-handed!

185
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:12,153
He was wearing a strange looking T-shirt.

186
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:14,753
A black T-shirt with a white skeleton on it.

187
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:17,453
Like that. Like that.

188
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,953
He was wearing the same T-shirt as that one!

189
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,053
Excuse me, sir.

190
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:26,953
Are you the man who is after Genta's life?

191
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,953
His face is totally different.

192
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,353
What do you guys want with me?

193
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:39,153
Besides the T-shirt of the man I saw had 202 on it, not 1999!

194
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:42,253
Do you remember where you bought that T-shirt?

195
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:46,353
A clothes store in front of the station called Bones.

196
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:47,553
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:48,953
Okay.

198
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:52,353
Okay, let's go check out that shop then.

199
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,553
Yes, that skeleton T-shirt is...

200
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,053
an original item of ours!

201
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,353
But, I wonder if we had anything that said 202.

202
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:06,653
What other kinds of T-shirts did you have?

203
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:12,153
1999, HELP, ESCAPE, all with some kind of pleading message.

204
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,753
Remember in the year 1999,

205
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,453
people made a fuss because of that prophecy, right?

206
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,953
We pushed our luck and started making those T-shirts.

207
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,153
Did you notice anyone suspicious

208
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,453
among the people who bought that T-shirt?

209
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,653
I wonder.

210
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,153
It was quite some time ago,

211
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,953
so l don't remember the faces of the customers.

212
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:33,953
Found nothing.

213
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:38,453
If you could only remember where you saw the culprit, Genta.

214
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:43,353
Wasn't it in a movie theater or on the train?

215
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:46,753
No, because smoking is not allowed in those places.

216
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,053
What about a family restaurant, then?

217
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,353
I'm sure that's it.

218
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,453
You probably were full and got sleepy.

219
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,653
But that guy wasn't eating anything.

220
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,753
I was staring at him for a while,

221
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:02,253
but all he did was glare at the newspaper and smoke cigarettes.

222
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,653
How come you can remember all that

223
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,353
and still cannot remember where you saw him?

224
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,053
I don't know why.

225
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,453
But, how strange.

226
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:14,453
If you stare at someone like that, it's most likely to get scolded.

227
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,553
Did you get scolded?

228
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,953
3 Nope. Besides, my eyes never met his.

229
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:24,653
I see. So, that's what it was.

230
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:27,453
The 202 skeleton shirt.

231
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,753
Left handed.

232
00:13:29,753 --> 00:13:31,953
And a place where you don't get scolded

233
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,553
for staring at somebody for a long time.

234
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,753
Genta, I've figured it out.

235
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:39,953
The place where you witnessed the culprit.

236
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,461
Hey, Genta.

237
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,961
It was at a glasses shop, right?

238
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,961
The place where you saw the purse snatcher.

239
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,861
You said that you didn't get scolded

240
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,961
even when you kept on staring at him, right?

241
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,461
Yeah...

242
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:05,061
If the culprit had taken off his glasses to have his glasses cleaned,

243
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:08,761
he wouldn't be able to tell If somebody were looking at him

244
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,661
because everything would be blurred, right?

245
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:16,561
B.But, Conan, I never went to an eyeglasses shop.

246
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,061
You've gotta be kidding! Because look over there.

247
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,461
You're totally wrong!

248
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,961
Really? I thought I had it all figured out.

249
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,961
I guess that's it for the Holmes of this century then.

250
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,861
Well, well, it's only human to make mistakes.

251
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:45,961
Don't get depressed!

252
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,661
I'll see you all, then.

253
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:50,961
Let me know if you recall anything, okay?

254
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,061
Okay!

255
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:59,461
I wonder where it was that you saw the culprit, though, Genta.

256
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,461
A place where you don't get scolded for staring

257
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,661
and a place that makes you sleepy.

258
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:08,961
Maybe it's at school? Because Genta's always sleeping.

259
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:12,961
If such a person came to school, we would surely have seen him, too.

260
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,461
That's true.

261
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:16,761
Hey! Will you wait a sec? Right here.

262
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,961
My goodness.

263
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,161
You sure love to eat, don't you?

264
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,361
You're going to get fat.

265
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:28,861
Who cares? I can't help eating what I like.

266
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,861
You've got ice cream on your cheek, Genta.

267
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:37,261
What's the matter?

268
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:39,161
Did you remember something?

269
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,461
No, not really.

270
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,961
Please be careful on your way home, okay?

271
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,361
Bye!

272
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,861
Three skewers with green onions and chicken and 4 liver, please.

273
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,861
Okay!

274
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:53,561
I think I'm a little hungry.

275
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:56,661
But, you just ate ice cream a while ago!

276
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,061
It's French food!

277
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,861
Hey, hold your horses!

278
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,261
It's only a little way more to home.

279
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:16,361
Red, white and blue...

280
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:18,861
What about the French flag?

281
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,561
Hey, Ayumi, doesn't red, white and blue look familiar?

282
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,761
I wonder.

283
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:27,461
But, Conan is always wearing a red bow-tie,

284
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:30,961
a white shirt and a blue jacket.

285
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:33,861
Don't tell me that the purse snatcher you saw was...

286
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:37,861
Don't be silly. Conan would never do something like snatch purses.

287
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,861
I don't know why,

288
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,761
but the colors red, white and blue are spinning inside my head.

289
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:50,061
I'll see you around, Genta! Go straight home, okay?

290
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,061
Yeah.

291
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,561
If you get any fatter than you are now,

292
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:54,461
you'll be the laughingstock of the pigs.

293
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,761
Shut up!

294
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:01,561
Seriously, that girl, Ayumi.

295
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,161
All she can ever say is fatso, fatso.

296
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,161
I'm not all that fat.

297
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,761
I got it! It was over there!

298
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:17,161
The 7th floor of the station building,

299
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,161
in front of the elevator.

300
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:23,561
Hold the elevator!

301
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,061
Wait a sec!

302
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,561
What floor, sonny?

303
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,761
Seventh floor, please.

304
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,161
Hey, sonny!

305
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:37,561
The blonde man.

306
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:39,361
I'm sorry about last time.

307
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,961
It seemed to have slipped my mind.

308
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,161
I remember now.

309
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,261
The place where I saw the purse snatcher with you.

310
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,261
Don't talk so loud.

311
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,161
He may be looking from somewhere, right?

312
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:54,661
Don't tell me that he came after you, too?

313
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,261
Yeah, I just remembered a while ago, too.

314
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:01,461
I thought it'd be better to see if both our stories match

315
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,561
before we head off to the police.

316
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,961
Right, let's go to the men's room

317
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,461
where nobody will come around.

318
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:10,761
No doubt about it!

319
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,761
This guy.

320
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,361
What?

321
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,961
I'm sure he wrote the name "Shibata" on the customer's list.

322
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,561
Who are you?

323
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:24,261
If you get funny, you're really going to get it.

324
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:30,161
Left handed, with a 202 skeleton T-shirt.

325
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:32,061
With the testimony that Genta gave,

326
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:36,161
it's no surprise that the police couldn't make out who the culprit was.

327
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:39,961
Because Genta was watching your reflection in the mirror.

328
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,161
You guys are the kids 4 that were around a while ago.

329
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,461
Right.

330
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,661
Genta didn't get scolded for staring at you

331
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,161
because he was looking at your reflection through the mirror.

332
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,461
In other words, the 202 that was reflected in the mirror

333
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:54,761
was actually SOS.

334
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,561
You're not left-handed, but actually right-handed.

335
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,561
A place that Genta would go,

336
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,961
where there is a mirror,

337
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:04,761
and moreover, get you sleepy.

338
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:06,961
Where else would it be but a barber, right?

339
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:14,761
And, Genta mistakenly thought that he saw the culprit with you...

340
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,361
is because you dyed your hair blonde while he was asleep.

341
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,761
The man with glasses and black hair turns blonde.

342
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,161
Since your clothes were covered under the cloth

343
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:27,361
and you were seated next to Genta.

344
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,861
That's why he thought you were another person.

345
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:34,861
What is this kid talking about? And he doesn't even have proof.

346
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:38,661
A witness is standing right behind you.

347
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:42,561
The barber who dyed your hair.

348
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:51,861
You were lucky because he hates to watch TV.

349
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:54,361
And, there were no posters with composite drawings of you

350
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,661
along the road where he used to walk.

351
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,161
You may have thought that you could easily commit the next crime

352
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,461
by simply dyeing your hair back to black,

353
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:04,361
and that you'd never get caught.

354
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:07,261
But your fingerprints were left on the bag

355
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:10,161
that you previously attempted to snatch and failed.

356
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:12,561
If the fingerprints match your fingerprints,

357
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,061
now you have no way out, do you?

358
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:17,161
Then what?

359
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:20,361
You mean this kid was going all over town because...

360
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:23,661
I wanted to lure you over here.

361
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,561
The ice cream that was on his mouth was shaving foam

362
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:27,861
that you use when shaving your face.

363
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:30,461
The French flag that is red, white and blue

364
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,461
is the spinning pole of the barber.

365
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:35,961
And the reflection on the glass window was the mirror.

366
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:39,861
Everything ended up reminding him of a barber.

367
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,961
We had Genta pretend that he recalled the barber,

368
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:46,561
so that the blonde-haired man, you would follow him

369
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:49,161
and walk into our trap.

370
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,061
You've gotta be kidding!

371
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:59,761
What do you think you're doing you broad?

372
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,661
You're so dumb.

373
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,161
Do you really think I'd walk all over town

374
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,661
just to lure you out here?

375
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,161
What?

376
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,961
Right. While Genta

377
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:13,461
was making you run around town and buying time,

378
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:16,061
we called the cops, so you're surrounded.

379
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,961
Therefore, the purse snatcher was arrested.

380
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:24,961
The case was solved just like that.

381
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:30,061
Conan, you really gave it to that guy, didn't you?

382
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:32,061
Are you really a grade-schooler?

383
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:36,961
I just copied the police officer that I saw on a TV drama!

384
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,461
I see.

385
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:14,261
The Youth Detective Squad does it again!

386
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,461
Genta, I think you're sleeping a bit too much.

387
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:21,261
You were asleep all the time the man was getting his hair dyed blonde.

388
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:24,661
The barber told me that he didn't wake me

389
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:26,861
because I seem to be sleeping so soundly.

390
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:30,461
Well, but they do say, children who sleep well grow fast.

391
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,061
Aren't you glad that the culprit was not left-handed

392
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,361
and right-handed just like you assumed?

393
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:38,561
Well, I guess if it were them,

394
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:41,061
I guess they would've come after me, instead of Genta.

395
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,361
So, I guess it wasn't them.

396
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,261
Hey, don't tell me you're talking about...

397
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:50,161
If you didn't know, you'd better remember this well.

398
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:52,761
Gin is left-handed, too.

399
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,161
"Next Episode"

400
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,161
What?

401
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:13,361
This is...

402
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:21,361
He probably wanted to look inside the briefcase.

403
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,561
Because you see, the key is still inside the keyhole.

404
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:28,661
A curse.

405
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,261
Next Conan,

406
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Kogoro Impersonator (Part 1)"

407
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,579
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,879
"Cell Phone"

409
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,179
In the next episode.

410
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,179
I, the renowned detective will...

411
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,279
You'll what?
