1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.940
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.840
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.840
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.640
Today's crime is quite a surprise.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.640
Using my head and chest, I will solve the case step by step.

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:06.499
And, what is this difficult case that you need

10
00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.299
the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri to help you with?

11
00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.099
If it's a silly case,

12
00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.199
treating me only to lunch won't do!

13
00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.399
Hey... Mr. Mouri,

14
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.999
lower your voice.

15
00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.699
An officer wouldn't come pick you up

16
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.299
if it were a silly case.

17
00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.399
Moreover, all the way from Shizuoka, paying his own way...

18
00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.799
As a matter of fact, Mr. Mouri...

19
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.399
About the...

20
00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.499
Do you know that man?

21
00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.299
Oh, no, but I have a very confidential favor to ask of you so...

22
00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.399
Mr. Mouri!

23
00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:45.999
About that Taiji Komiyama case...

24
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.399
Komiyama?

25
00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.999
Oh, you mean that famous actor.

26
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.099
What about him?

27
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.299
Huh? Don't you know? He was killed 3 days ago.

28
00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.499
Killed?

29
00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:02.699
Didn't you know?

30
00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.699
This case was a very incomprehensible one indeed.

31
00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.799
You can't find a suspect no matter how much you investigate?

32
00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.799
Just the opposite...

33
00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.399
The opposite...

34
00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.799
Three people saying that they killed him

35
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.999
have turned themselves in!

36
00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:28.799
One victim and three people who turned themselves in.

37
00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.399
Very interesting...

38
00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:39.999
"The Man Who Was Killed Four Times"

39
00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.999
What do you mean by three people turned themselves in?

40
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.999
Not accomplices?

41
00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.099
Well, it's not that simple.

42
00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.899
Tell me about it.

43
00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:51.999
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.099
The murder was committed 3 days ago.

45
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.399
The last day of the stage that the victim to perform,

46
00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.799
2 hours before the performance began.

47
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.799
Komiyama.

48
00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.199
Are you asleep, Komiyama?

49
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.299
"Hideo Tsuda (55), Actor"

50
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.699
"Taiji Komiyama"

51
00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.699
Hey, I'm coming in.

52
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.199
Komiyama!

53
00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:22.699
The victim is Taiji Komiyama, 58 years old.

54
00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:23.999
The estimated time of death

55
00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.999
is 2 hours before the victim was found.

56
00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.399
It seems that he had been hit on the back of his head

57
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.199
with a blunt object.

58
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
The corpse was sent out immediately for autopsy

59
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.099
because homicide was suspected.

60
00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.799
We also went on to question three people for testimony.

61
00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:45.699
The three are also performers on the show, eh?

62
00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.899
Yes.

63
00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.699
The room Mr. Komiyama was found in,

64
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.599
is in a corner where outsiders cannot get to very easily.

65
00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.799
We got testimony from the security guard,

66
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.399
the only ones who were in that area

67
00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.199
during the victim's estimated time of death

68
00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.399
were the three.

69
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.199
I see.

70
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.699
Mr. Kengo Katsumata

71
00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.199
wanted the role that Mr. Komiyama had played

72
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.599
for the past 20 years.

73
00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.399
Yumiko Niikura

74
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.399
was seriously troubled about Komiyama pestering her.

75
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.699
Mr. Haruyuki Hoshino liked Ms. Niikura,

76
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.699
and disliked Mr. Komiyama.

77
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.399
Anyway, I summoned these three to the station

78
00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.299
and heard them out.

79
00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:30.699
Then...

80
00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.299
"Kengo Katsumata, Actor" -I'm very sorry,

81
00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.399
I killed Mr. Komiyama.

82
00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.399
Huh?

83
00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:42.699
Mr. Komiyama suddenly came shouting in to the room.

84
00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.799
I don't know if he was drinking, but he was a bit unsteady.

85
00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:49.399
What's the matter, Mr. Komiyama?

86
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.299
What the heck were you reading just now?

87
00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:53.399
What?

88
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.599
Never mind, just hand it over!

89
00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.099
So, you were reading this again!

90
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.499
Listen!

91
00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.799
This script was written for me to read!

92
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.199
I'm not ever giving my role to a half-done performer

93
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.299
like you!

94
00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.799
I'm taking this to the grave with me!

95
00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:20.499
You scum.

96
00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.699
Thinking that I had to do something about the corpse,

97
00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.399
I decided to drag him over to his room.

98
00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.399
I thought that if I left his body there,

99
00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:46.699
they would think his wife killed him.

100
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.699
His wife?

101
00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.999
Yes, because everyone knew that Mr. Komiyama and his wife

102
00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.699
weren't getting along.

103
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.099
She came to see him at his room back stage yesterday,

104
00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.199
and they like always were fighting.

105
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.799
I see.

106
00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:03.699
Darn. I wonder why

107
00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.399
Komiyama suddenly came into the room shouting.

108
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.499
But then...

109
00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.499
What?

110
00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.399
Like I just said, I killed Komiyama with my very hands!

111
00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.199
Just what do you think you're doing, barging in like that?

112
00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.999
Don't you dare forget!

113
00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:22.199
Yumiko Niikura is mine!

114
00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.499
I'm not going to give her over to you!

115
00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:25.999
You shrimp!

116
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:42.699
I didn't want to leave his corpse in my room.

117
00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:47.299
So, I moved Komiyama over to his own room.

118
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.999
But, officer, thinking back on it now,

119
00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:53.099
I feel I did something unnecessary.

120
00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:56.899
Because I don't regret being arrested at all.

121
00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:58.799
I did, after all,

122
00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:01.999
rescue Yumiko from that lewd poison pest

123
00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:03.599
with my very hands.

124
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.499
What's more!

125
00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:07.599
What did you just say?

126
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:11.999
Mr. Komiyama suddenly came into my room and...

127
00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:14.699
Please, no, Mr. Komiyama!

128
00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.399
Why do you run from me?

129
00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.799
We're going to be acting on the same stage,

130
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:22.299
I'm just trying to be friendly, Yumiko!

131
00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:26.599
No!

132
00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.299
I don't know

133
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.599
how Mr. Komiyama's corpse got back in his room.

134
00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.699
But, I'm the one who killed Mr. Komiyama.

135
00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:46.499
I'm very sorry.

136
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:50.999
And investigations following their questioning,

137
00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:53.899
revealed that the vases found in all three of their rooms

138
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:57.099
had traces of the vases having hit the victim.

139
00:08:57.899 --> 00:08:59.399
I have already reserved a room for you!

140
00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:02.999
Please think it over till tomorrow morning,

141
00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:05.299
and find us a conclusion with your sharp deduction.

142
00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:06.499
Mr. Mouri!

143
00:09:06.499 --> 00:09:08.399
What is this?

144
00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:11.299
The investigation documents.

145
00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.799
This much?

146
00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:15.299
Yes!

147
00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:16.699
Oh, is that right?

148
00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:18.699
Huh?

149
00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:21.699
Isn't there something strange about this picture?

150
00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:23.799
What's so strange about it?

151
00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:24.999
Ouch!

152
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:26.999
This is not something for a kid to look at!

153
00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:29.399
But, if someone hits you on the head,

154
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.099
don't you hold your head like this?

155
00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:35.399
This person is holding his chest, isn't he?

156
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.199
I wonder why.

157
00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:39.499
Come to think of it, it's strange.

158
00:09:39.499 --> 00:09:42.699
The direct cause of his death is his heart.

159
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:44.399
His heart?

160
00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.599
As a result of the autopsy,

161
00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:48.899
the wound of the back of his head was not that serious,

162
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:52.399
but he seems to have had a heart ailment.

163
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.399
According to the actor who discovered Mr. Komiyama,

164
00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.599
he says that Mr. Komiyama

165
00:09:56.599 --> 00:09:57.999
had an attack the morning he died,

166
00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:01.599
but somehow held it down with the medication he carries around.

167
00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:03.599
In other words, at this time,

168
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:05.499
when he was hit on the head,

169
00:10:05.499 --> 00:10:09.499
it sent a shock to his heart and he passed away.

170
00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:12.099
I guess so.

171
00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:15.599
But, I wonder why he didn't drink his medicine then?

172
00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.399
You idiot! He didn't have time to drink his medicine!

173
00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:20.899
Well, maybe he did want to drink it,

174
00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:22.699
but his pill case was empty.

175
00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.299
Empty?

176
00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:25.499
If he had drunk his medicine,

177
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:27.699
he could've held down the attack.

178
00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:30.899
Which means that his pill box was empty from the start.

179
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.999
It can't be.

180
00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:37.599
Please excuse me, Mr. Mouri.

181
00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:41.099
It's from the station. I'd like to excuse myself.

182
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:49.399
I wonder if he'd not notice that

183
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:53.999
he had run out of medication that is vital to his life?

184
00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:56.599
But, it was in fact empty.

185
00:10:56.599 --> 00:10:58.299
The only possible conclusion is...

186
00:10:58.599 --> 00:11:00.899
That's reckless!

187
00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:04.899
But, department head, I understand how you feel, but...

188
00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:06.299
Yes.

189
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:10.599
Why did the victim not call for help?

190
00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:14.499
One out of three chances, eh?

191
00:11:14.499 --> 00:11:16.999
Well, if I rack my brains over night,

192
00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:18.299
it should be duck soup.

193
00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:23.799
I'm sorry, sir!

194
00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:26.599
Hey, what is this, all of a sudden?

195
00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:29.799
You don't have one night.

196
00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:30.799
Huh?

197
00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.299
We need you to give us your deduction

198
00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:35.699
as soon as we arrive at the scene of the crime!

199
00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:37.899
As soon as we arrive?

200
00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.899
Hey, hey, what are you going to do, Pops?

201
00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:44.499
"Shizuoka, Citizenship Hall"

202
00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.899
We've arrived.

203
00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:49.699
Hey, Officer Yokomizo.

204
00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:50.999
Mrs. Komiyama.

205
00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:53.599
When on earth are going to give it back?

206
00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:56.599
Oh, well, it is evidence, after all,

207
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.299
so we can't return it till the case is solved.

208
00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:01.999
Then, hurry up and solve the case!

209
00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:04.199
Who are they?

210
00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.499
She is the victim's wife, Atsuko,

211
00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:09.299
and the actor, Mr. Tsuda.

212
00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:12.199
They look very angry.

213
00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:14.799
Yes, they want the things that

214
00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:16.499
the investigation headquarters have in custody,

215
00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:18.699
are rushing me.

216
00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:23.499
Isn't he the man that found Mr. Komiyama's corpse?

217
00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:24.799
Yeah.

218
00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:26.599
Just as I thought!

219
00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:28.799
Oh, where are you going, Conan?

220
00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:30.899
To the restroom!

221
00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:32.799
Again...

222
00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.899
Excuse me, I've got to go to the restroom too.

223
00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:36.399
Mr. Mouri,

224
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.299
the restroom is that way.

225
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.999
Oh, I thought so.

226
00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:43.299
On the day that he was killed?

227
00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:47.999
Mr. Mouri of the detective office asked me to ask you.

228
00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:52.899
The man called Komiyama had an attack that morning too, right?

229
00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:55.299
Yeah, when he was talking to me

230
00:12:55.299 --> 00:12:57.699
at the coffee shop in the hotel.

231
00:12:58.099 --> 00:13:00.899
You're telling me to quit acting?

232
00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:02.999
I'm telling you as a friend.

233
00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.399
In your health condition,

234
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.899
continuing acting is like committing suicide.

235
00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:08.299
What will there be left of me

236
00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:09.999
if you take acting away from me?

237
00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:12.099
Komiyama?

238
00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:13.699
What's wrong, Komiyama?

239
00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:15.299
Do you want me to call your wife?

240
00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:16.999
She's in the room, isn't she?

241
00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.899
It'll be fine if I take my medicine.

242
00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.799
I'll drink one.

243
00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:34.099
His attack seemed to subside as soon as he took the medicine.

244
00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:35.399
I see.

245
00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:39.399
I've figured out how the murder was committed.

246
00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:42.999
As well as who the real killer is!

247
00:13:50.488 --> 00:13:51.588
Hello,

248
00:13:51.588 --> 00:13:55.488
I'm Kogoro Mouri from the Mouri Detective Agency in Tokyo,

249
00:13:55.488 --> 00:13:57.788
who was invited over by Officer Yokomizo.

250
00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:01.688
There is something we would like you to check on right away.

251
00:14:03.888 --> 00:14:06.388
You've gotta be joking.

252
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.688
I was personally asked to give you help!

253
00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:11.488
And, you're the one who asked, right?

254
00:14:11.488 --> 00:14:14.288
Well, absolutely.

255
00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:17.588
I don't know how it got to the department head's ears.

256
00:14:17.588 --> 00:14:19.888
I'm so sorry!

257
00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:22.588
So, will you please begin?

258
00:14:22.588 --> 00:14:24.188
No way!

259
00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:25.888
Please, Mr. Mouri, I beg you.

260
00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:27.988
Our department head is really looking forward to you

261
00:14:27.988 --> 00:14:29.288
solving the case too,

262
00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:32.188
saying that he gets to hear your deduction in person.

263
00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:34.588
That's only your side of the story!

264
00:14:34.588 --> 00:14:38.388
Besides, you said that tomorrow would be fine, didn't you?

265
00:14:38.388 --> 00:14:40.688
What's up, Pops?

266
00:14:40.688 --> 00:14:43.688
I don't think it's nice to keep people waiting.

267
00:14:43.688 --> 00:14:47.588
If you can't solve it, you may as well apologize right away.

268
00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:50.288
You idiot!

269
00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:52.088
There is no case that the renown Detective Kogoro

270
00:14:52.088 --> 00:14:53.588
is not able to solve!

271
00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:56.288
Okay! I'll solve it!

272
00:14:56.288 --> 00:14:58.688
No rehearsal, it's show time!

273
00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:05.488
I am the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri!

274
00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:10.288
I was asked to talk about

275
00:15:10.288 --> 00:15:15.488
the murder of Mr. Taiji Komiyama today.

276
00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:18.288
But, I would like to first talk about

277
00:15:18.288 --> 00:15:21.488
why I decided to pick being a detective as my profession.

278
00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:23.288
Never mind the formalities!

279
00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:26.688
Who of the three is the killer?

280
00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:30.588
Huh, you mean the real killer?

281
00:15:30.588 --> 00:15:34.088
The real killer is...

282
00:15:34.088 --> 00:15:37.288
Well...

283
00:15:37.288 --> 00:15:40.288
How should I say it?

284
00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:44.688
-Oh, no, Dad. -The real killer probably...

285
00:15:44.988 --> 00:15:48.488
Even your impertinent deduction is not making its appearance.

286
00:15:48.488 --> 00:15:51.388
I was hoping that it would buy some time.

287
00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:53.688
I've got no choice.

288
00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:01.588
He's got into position,

289
00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:04.388
he's going to start deducing, department head!

290
00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:08.588
I've finally figured out the killer now, Officer Yokomizo.

291
00:16:08.588 --> 00:16:13.588
If it is exactly as the three people say it is,

292
00:16:13.588 --> 00:16:15.388
the victim Taiji Komiyama

293
00:16:15.388 --> 00:16:18.988
would've been killed three times.

294
00:16:18.988 --> 00:16:22.388
He entered each of your rooms back stage

295
00:16:22.388 --> 00:16:24.688
but, the problem is the order in which he entered the rooms.

296
00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:28.388
Mr. Kengo Katsumata's confession goes like this.

297
00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:34.688
Mr. Komiyama came shouting into the room.

298
00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:38.988
I don't know if he was drinking, but he was a bit unsteady.

299
00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:40.088
That's right.

300
00:16:40.088 --> 00:16:43.988
However, if Mr. Komiyama had a heart ailment,

301
00:16:43.988 --> 00:16:46.788
I don't think he would've drunk until he was unsteady.

302
00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:49.188
And, more so, if it was just before he was ready to go on stage.

303
00:16:49.188 --> 00:16:50.488
True.

304
00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:53.288
Then, why was he unsteady?

305
00:16:53.288 --> 00:16:57.288
Probably because it was after he had been punched by someone.

306
00:16:57.288 --> 00:16:59.688
Next, according to Mr. Haruyuki Hoshino,

307
00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:02.088
back then, Mr. Komiyama was...

308
00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.588
Just what do you think you're doing, barging in like that?

309
00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:06.588
Don't you dare forget!

310
00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:08.988
Yumiko Niikura is mine!

311
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:11.388
-Yes. -However, Mr. Komiyama

312
00:17:11.388 --> 00:17:13.288
acts weird here too.

313
00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:18.488
He suddenly burst into the room and pounced on Yumiko.

314
00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:23.488
Something must've triggered him to do so.

315
00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:25.988
Yes, he made passes to you,

316
00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:29.088
and Ms. Yumiko Niikura, you rejected him.

317
00:17:29.088 --> 00:17:30.688
You already understand, don't you?

318
00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:35.788
Mr. Komiyama approached Ms. Yumiko Niikura's room first,

319
00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:38.888
and he was hit on the back of his head.

320
00:17:39.588 --> 00:17:42.188
Yumiko, who thought she had killed him

321
00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:44.488
fled from the spot.

322
00:17:44.488 --> 00:17:46.988
However, a little while after that,

323
00:17:46.988 --> 00:17:51.388
Mr. Komiyama regains consciousness.

324
00:17:51.388 --> 00:17:52.588
Then...

325
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:55.188
He had only fainted.

326
00:17:55.188 --> 00:18:00.788
Then, Mr. Komiyama headed for Mr. Hoshino's room,

327
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.688
thinking that Yumiko keeps rejecting him

328
00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:05.788
because of Mr. Hoshino.

329
00:18:05.788 --> 00:18:10.888
However, Mr. Komiyama is hit on the head there again.

330
00:18:10.888 --> 00:18:15.288
He must've had a very hard head or something.

331
00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:18.888
He snaps back to himself once again.

332
00:18:18.888 --> 00:18:21.088
What a hard head.

333
00:18:21.088 --> 00:18:22.488
Absolutely.

334
00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:24.088
However, not learning his lesson,

335
00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:27.288
Mr. Komiyama goes on his way again,

336
00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:29.288
in order to take his anger out on someone

337
00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:31.088
for being hit on the head twice in a row.

338
00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:34.088
I see, that's why he came over to my place

339
00:18:34.088 --> 00:18:35.988
and spitted out those rude words.

340
00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:39.388
Then, you did it, Mr. Katsumata.

341
00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:42.888
So, like I've been telling you from the start, I hit him.

342
00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.788
No, Mr. Komiyama is more than that.

343
00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:49.888
What do you mean?

344
00:18:49.888 --> 00:18:51.588
When his corpse was found,

345
00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:55.688
Mr. Komiyama looked to be holding his chest in pain.

346
00:18:55.688 --> 00:18:57.288
Despite the fact that

347
00:18:57.288 --> 00:19:00.888
the corpse was dragged along by Mr. Katsumata.

348
00:19:00.888 --> 00:19:03.488
I'm sure that Mr. Komiyama's hands

349
00:19:03.488 --> 00:19:05.888
were loosened to both sides of his body.

350
00:19:05.888 --> 00:19:09.788
Then, why were both his hands by his chest when he was found?

351
00:19:09.788 --> 00:19:11.788
There is only one answer.

352
00:19:13.088 --> 00:19:14.288
Mr. Komiyama had already

353
00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:17.188
regained his consciousness three times.

354
00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:21.488
It was after all this

355
00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:25.988
that Mr. Komiyama had the heart attack that took his life.

356
00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:35.388
I see!

357
00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:38.388
When he realized it, his medicine container was empty.

358
00:19:38.388 --> 00:19:41.088
I wonder if there is a person who would not realize

359
00:19:41.088 --> 00:19:43.188
that such an important thing is gone?

360
00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:46.488
Moreover, he already took his medicine that morning too.

361
00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:48.188
There is no reason he would not realize!

362
00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.988
But, he in fact...

363
00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:53.488
Somebody took the important medicine out

364
00:19:53.488 --> 00:19:55.288
from his pill container!

365
00:19:55.288 --> 00:19:56.388
But the victim

366
00:19:56.388 --> 00:19:59.688
always wore the pill container around his neck.

367
00:19:59.688 --> 00:20:02.888
The person who has access to his pill container is...

368
00:20:02.888 --> 00:20:05.288
There is just one person.

369
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:07.188
After he had his attack,

370
00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:09.788
in order to wash off his perspiration,

371
00:20:09.788 --> 00:20:11.588
I think Mr. Komiyama took a shower,

372
00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:14.888
isn't that right, Mrs. Komiyama?

373
00:20:14.888 --> 00:20:17.388
He took off his precious pill container from around his neck,

374
00:20:17.388 --> 00:20:19.788
so as not to get it wet.

375
00:20:20.188 --> 00:20:21.888
It's true that from circumstantial evidence,

376
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:24.288
everything is against me.

377
00:20:26.388 --> 00:20:28.088
However, Mr. Detective,

378
00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.288
you've got no proof, right?

379
00:20:30.288 --> 00:20:34.588
That I secretly emptied out his pill container, do you?

380
00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:38.088
Maybe he really did forget.

381
00:20:38.088 --> 00:20:40.788
I didn't say that you emptied it.

382
00:20:41.988 --> 00:20:44.488
If his pill container was really empty,

383
00:20:44.488 --> 00:20:50.288
I'm sure he would've called someone for help.

384
00:20:50.288 --> 00:20:52.488
But, he didn't do so.

385
00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:53.788
I think

386
00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:57.588
a different type of pill was in his pill container.

387
00:20:57.588 --> 00:20:59.488
Just one different capsule.

388
00:20:59.488 --> 00:21:01.788
Mr. Komiyama naturally drank the pill

389
00:21:01.788 --> 00:21:04.388
with no suspicion what so ever.

390
00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.988
However, his attack wouldn't subside.

391
00:21:07.988 --> 00:21:11.988
After struggling for some time, he passed away.

392
00:21:16.888 --> 00:21:19.088
Yes, this is Yokomizo.

393
00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:22.788
Stomach medicine? What do you mean by stomach medicine?

394
00:21:22.788 --> 00:21:25.688
If I tell Mr. Mouri, he'll understand?

395
00:21:25.688 --> 00:21:28.688
Oh. Stomach medicine?

396
00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:33.288
The one that I'm always drinking.

397
00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:36.188
What on earth are you talking about?

398
00:21:36.188 --> 00:21:39.988
I had the content of the Mr. Komiyama's pill container checked.

399
00:21:39.988 --> 00:21:45.188
To see if there was something strange inside it.

400
00:21:45.188 --> 00:21:49.488
Oh, so the last medicine that Mr. Yokomizo drank was...

401
00:21:49.488 --> 00:21:50.888
stomach medicine?

402
00:21:52.588 --> 00:21:54.388
What a fix I'm in.

403
00:21:54.388 --> 00:21:56.788
If you guys didn't hit him in the head repeatedly,

404
00:21:56.788 --> 00:21:59.988
the police wouldn't have stuck their nose in,

405
00:21:59.988 --> 00:22:01.788
and he would've just died from the heart ailment

406
00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:04.388
that he had always had.

407
00:22:04.388 --> 00:22:05.888
That, of course

408
00:22:05.888 --> 00:22:09.388
goes for Mr. Detective over there too.

409
00:23:36.688 --> 00:23:38.988
Well, well, just a rumor has it,

410
00:23:38.988 --> 00:23:40.188
you're really something, fantastic.

411
00:23:40.188 --> 00:23:42.388
Well, not big deal.

412
00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:43.988
When on earth did you

413
00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:46.388
check the contents of the pill container?

414
00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:49.288
That's... you see...

415
00:23:50.288 --> 00:23:53.888
That, of course is business secret.

416
00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:57.088
It's just that you don't know the answer, right?

417
00:24:02.688 --> 00:24:04.588
Gin?

418
00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:08.388
Oh, no! He's found it!

419
00:24:10.388 --> 00:24:12.688
Probably APTX4869.

420
00:24:12.688 --> 00:24:14.388
It's the medicine in question.

421
00:24:22.888 --> 00:24:24.288
Next Conan,
