1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.640
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.340
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.540
In television, movies, and books detectives are everywhere.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.990
Come on!

9
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.290
Gosh, I bite my tongue.

10
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.590
Drive safely, will you, dad?

11
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.890
They advertised the place as being a very secluded

12
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.290
and little known hot spot.

13
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.790
Of course it's going to be hard to get to!

14
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.290
Yes, I can see it now.

15
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.490
Hey, dad. This road is paved.

16
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.990
Weren't we supposed to take this road to get here?

17
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.590
Look! They've got an archery area!

18
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.190
You're just trying to change the subject.

19
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.290
I figured.

20
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.690
Look out!

21
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.890
I'm so sorry!

22
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.490
It went off course. Are you all right?

23
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.690
Hey, you!

24
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.790
Oh! I know you!

25
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.390
You're Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective. It is you, isn't it?

26
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.690
Well, yes, you're very perceptive.

27
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.490
Are you staying at the villa too?

28
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.490
You mean you are too?

29
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.790
Yes.

30
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.290
I guess this means the two famous detectives will finally meet.

31
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.290
Huh?

32
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.190
"Murder of the Famous Detective (Part 1)"

33
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.790
What is this? Isn't anybody on duty?

34
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.490
Excuse me!

35
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.590
What was that sound?

36
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.290
-Those were gunshots. -Huh?

37
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.290
The forest around us is hunting grounds.

38
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.390
-What? -You're Mr. Mouri, I presume.

39
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.090
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

40
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.590
I'm here alone today.

41
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.790
Dad! We drove right through that forest,

42
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.990
we could've been hurt.

43
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.490
Actually the hunting areas are marked with signs and fenced off

44
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.090
but there's always the danger of being hit by a stray bullet.

45
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.390
We've already been baptized, only it was by an arrow.

46
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.490
Welcome back.

47
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.390
Here's your key.

48
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.290
Who does he think he is anyway?

49
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.190
We're very proud of our garden restaurant here,

50
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.090
please have dinner there.

51
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.490
Garden restaurant?

52
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.190
Just have a look.

53
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.490
Wow, it s beautiful!

54
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.590
Ran, look at this.

55
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.890
There's a mountain stream down there.

56
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.190
-Conan, be careful. -Okay.

57
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.290
It's raining.

58
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.790
Gosh. If it keeps raining,

59
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.890
we won't be able to eat in this great garden restaurant.

60
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.890
You're...

61
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.890
That's right. Jack the Ripper the 5th!

62
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.390
Who's there?

63
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.390
You're...

64
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.690
That's right. Urban hunter Bannai Kujirao at your service!

65
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.690
How can you watch such junk?

66
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.590
How rude! It was getting to the best part!

67
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.590
He's no detective.

68
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.890
Real cases don't get solved so easily

69
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.890
week after week like that.

70
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.390
I'm very sorry you think they're so easy.

71
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.890
Urban hunter Bannai Kujirao at your service!

72
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.190
It's really you!

73
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.190
This is Kazuyoshi Sunaoka, the actor who plays Bannai Kujirao.

74
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.190
I'm his manager, Noe Tanigawa.

75
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.790
It's nice to see you again.

76
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.990
You're Kogoro Mouri, the genuine detective.

77
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.990
It's a pleasure to meet you.

78
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.390
You know, I'm actually a big fan of yours.

79
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.090
Can I have your autograph later?

80
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.990
Gosh, he's all talk.

81
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.490
Thank you!

82
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.090
And here's my calling card, just in case.

83
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.590
It's such an honor to be at the same table

84
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.590
with the famous detective Mouri.

85
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.690
The same goes for me.

86
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.390
I never dreamed I'd get to meet a famous actor.

87
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.390
Are you filming here?

88
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.790
Actually, I've been given secret orders

89
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.390
to come here and protect you.

90
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.790
We're here to discuss the show and just to relax.

91
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.190
Naturally, no one besides us knows

92
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.290
that the popular star Mr. Sunaoka is with us.

93
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.090
You're a great team.

94
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.390
Sunaoka and I went out this afternoon

95
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.790
to enjoy some hunting.

96
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.890
We took cover under the rain

97
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.590
and stayed out all day but got zilch.

98
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.790
I can't believe how anyone could shoot live animals.

99
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.290
That's why I opted for archery.

100
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.890
Oh! I did, however nearly spear some humans!

101
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.690
Yes, it was a close call.

102
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.390
We nearly ended up as trophies on the wall.

103
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.590
What do you mean by that?

104
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.890
By the way, what were you doing?

105
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.890
You don't look like you've gotten rid of your stress.

106
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.390
That's because I stayed in my room

107
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.990
thinking up a plot for the next show.

108
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.090
That man's kind of scary.

109
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.890
And did you come up with something good, sir?

110
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.890
Kazu!

111
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.590
Lately, it seems the viewers solve the crime before I do.

112
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.590
That just won't do.

113
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.590
Mr. Sunaoka, put yourself in my shoes.

114
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.190
I have to write scenarios to fit your personality.

115
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.190
Now now, we're here to work something out

116
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.090
to make the show more enjoyable.

117
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.690
Let's have some constructive suggestions.

118
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.790
That's easy for you to say.

119
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.090
All you're concerned about is the money.

120
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.890
I know all about it.

121
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.590
I hear you're pocketing some of the production fees.

122
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.590
How dare you! That's a lie!

123
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.790
All right, that's enough.

124
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.990
There's a lot of bad blood behind the scenes.

125
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.190
Kazu, I think you've had a little bit too much to drink.

126
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.690
-Let's get you back to your room. -Leave me alone!

127
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.090
I want to talk to Mr. Mouri a little longer.

128
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.390
You're always so bossy!

129
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.290
But that won't be for long.

130
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.590
A major production company

131
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.490
is offering me a bundle to sign up with them.

132
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.790
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.690
We've discussed that over and over again.

134
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.390
Now come on, go to your room and get some sleep.

135
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.990
I'm the biggest star your agency's got.

136
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.790
If you lose me, you probably won't be able to stay in the business.

137
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.190
Well, Mr. Detective, I'll catch you again later.

138
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.690
Mr. Tahara, if you've got any gripes against me,

139
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.190
just let me know. I'll quit anytime.

140
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.690
Kazu, if you quit,

141
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.190
the whole show will go down the drain!

142
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.690
Tanigawa, do something!

143
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.290
What you see on TV and reality is really two different things.

144
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.290
It certainly is.

145
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.990
I'm sorry about that scene.

146
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.690
You may not think so, but that guy's very conscientious.

147
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.890
He's very serious about making the show a success.

148
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.890
It's just that he can't hold his liquor,

149
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.590
please forgive him.

150
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.590
Yes. Well, good luck to you.

151
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.190
Thank you. Now, shall we continue drinking?

152
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.790
It's empty.

153
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.490
I'll go get you another one.

154
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.890
Thanks.

155
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.690
Here, your key.

156
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.590
I didn't mean what I said. Sorry.

157
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.190
Goodnight.

158
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.090
Boss.

159
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.590
Sorry to keep you waiting.

160
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.990
-Thanks! -It was worth the wait!

161
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.990
These are for you two.

162
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.690
-Thank you. -Thanks.

163
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.290
No problem. Here you go, Mr. Mouri.

164
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.790
Thanks.

165
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.590
Now that Mr. Sunaoka and Ms. Tanigawa's gone,

166
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.690
he's suddenly in such a good mood.

167
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.590
Tahara, why don't you join us?

168
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.190
Sure.

169
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.990
Excuse me for a second.

170
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.190
What's up?

171
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.990
I just thought of an interesting trick.

172
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.890
I better write it down before I forget.

173
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.990
It's not easy being a writer.

174
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.690
Let's toast, Mr. Mouri.

175
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.590
-Cheers! -Cheers!

176
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.890
Mr. Nagatsuka, you have a call from Tokyo,

177
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.690
you can take it at the front desk.

178
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.090
It's 8 o'clock, who could it be at this hour?

179
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.090
Excuse me for a minute.

180
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.590
Gosh, I'm all alone.

181
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.090
Keep me company, you've got your juice.

182
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.890
Dad, I think you've had enough.

183
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.190
Hello? This is Kogoro Mouri.

184
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.190
How about it? Why don't you come up to my room

185
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.590
and we'll talk detective?

186
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.690
-Mr. Sunaoka, it's you. -Huh?

187
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.190
Hold on for a second. What is that?

188
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.790
Hello? Mr. Sunaoka?

189
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.090
Gosh.

190
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.490
What's the matter, dad?

191
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.190
That was Mr. Sunaoka.

192
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.290
First, he asks me to come up to his room,

193
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.090
then he hangs up on me.

194
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.290
A gunshot?

195
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.490
It sounded like it came from across the valley.

196
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.090
What could anyone be shooting at this hour?

197
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.890
Everyone stay inside. It might be dangerous.

198
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.890
Ms. Tanigawa.

199
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.390
What is it?

200
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.590
Did you just hear that gunshot?

201
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.890
So it was a gunshot after all.

202
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.390
I'm sure Kazu's asleep by now.

203
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.990
The window in Kazu's room...

204
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.990
There's a hole in it! It looks like a bullet hole!

205
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.590
What did you say?

206
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.790
-Sir, the key! -Yeah, you're right!

207
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.890
Mr. Akashi! Get the master key

208
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.290
and meet us in front of Mr. Sunaoka's room!

209
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.590
-Okay. -What's going on?

210
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.990
Mr. Sunaoka! Wake up!

211
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.090
Is there no response?

212
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.490
He never gets up when he falls asleep while drunk.

213
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.190
Mr. Mouri, I've brought the key.

214
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.690
Mr. Sunaoka, we're coming in!

215
00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.579
Someone tell me what happened!

216
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:20.779
Why would anyone kill Kazu?

217
00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.279
Mr. Mouri, it's been a long time.

218
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.279
Hello, Detective Yokomizo.

219
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.879
Take a look at this.

220
00:13:28.179 --> 00:13:29.579
As for you, ladies and gentlemen.

221
00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:31.279
Please sit downstairs in the lobby.

222
00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:33.179
I'll be down to question you later.

223
00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:39.279
Sure, he says some harsh things when he's drunk

224
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:42.079
but it's nothing anyone would kill him over!

225
00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:48.079
What am I going to do? I'm going to answer for this!

226
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:51.079
And they just decided to extend the show.

227
00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:54.179
Okay, everyone. I know how you must all feel

228
00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:56.279
but the crime lab technicians are coming in now.

229
00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:01.979
By the looks of it, the only wound is

230
00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:04.179
the bullet wound on his forehead.

231
00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:06.679
That's right. That's what killed him.

232
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.679
But seeing as the flesh isn't burned

233
00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:11.479
and also there are no powder burns,

234
00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:14.679
I'd say he was shot from a distance.

235
00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:19.079
The height of this hole and Mr. Sunaoka's position

236
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.279
were he was standing is almost the same height.

237
00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.179
I'm pretty sure he was shot

238
00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:27.279
while he was standing by the window.

239
00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.479
Which means the shooter was...

240
00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:36.379
When we heard the shot being fired,

241
00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:38.179
it came from across the valley.

242
00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:39.579
Let's go have a look.

243
00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:45.179
What's that?

244
00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:46.979
It looks like there's some kind of plant fiber

245
00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:49.179
mixed in with the glass.

246
00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:53.579
Conan!

247
00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:56.679
Always getting in our way! What is it with you?

248
00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:59.179
Come here!

249
00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:01.679
You're getting fast.

250
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:09.379
The only way to get to the other side of the valley from the villa

251
00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:11.479
is by crossing this suspended bridge.

252
00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:14.979
Be careful and only five people can cross at a time.

253
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:17.479
It's quite far from the villa.

254
00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:18.679
Yes, it is.

255
00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:21.179
Now we walk along the cliff for about 10 minutes

256
00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:22.979
and we'll be across from the villa.

257
00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:32.079
-We're here. -Finally.

258
00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.079
It takes 30 minutes one way.

259
00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:38.979
But then, the shooter's escape route becomes another puzzle.

260
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:41.279
Who's there?

261
00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:44.979
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:46.779
Ran?

263
00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.179
What are you doing here?

264
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:52.979
Well, Conan went charging out of the villa.

265
00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:55.079
I got worried so I followed him.

266
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.379
So why are you hiding in there?

267
00:15:58.379 --> 00:16:01.779
Well, Conan...

268
00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:03.279
Where'd he go?

269
00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:06.679
Conan!

270
00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:08.279
The rifle's over here!

271
00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:10.179
Conan!

272
00:16:11.479 --> 00:16:13.079
Dad.

273
00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:15.579
Gosh.

274
00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:19.379
Tie him up some place!

275
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:22.879
Conan, you were very naughty.

276
00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:24.279
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.679
We've got cartridge casings here.

278
00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:28.379
I think it's safe to say this is the murder weapon.

279
00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:31.179
The killer must have stood here aiming for Mr. Sunaoka

280
00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:33.079
on the other side of that window.

281
00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.779
Take these casings

282
00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.479
and that rifle to the lab right away.

283
00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:37.679
Yes, sir!

284
00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:44.279
What's this? The underside of this rifle is dry.

285
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.879
Take a shot of this.

286
00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:52.979
Mr. Mouri. What time did it stop raining around here?

287
00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:54.079
Let's see...

288
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.379
In the evening, it had stopped by the time it got dark.

289
00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:00.979
Then I wonder why it wasn't wet under the rifle.

290
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.579
Never mind that, Detective Yokomizo.

291
00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:06.179
After shooting Mr. Sunaoka,

292
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:09.179
the killer escaped through this road.

293
00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:12.179
You'd better get a roadblock set up right away.

294
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:15.179
-Yeah, you're right. -But something's not right

295
00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.479
Remember? When we climbed up here,

296
00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:19.979
we didn't see anyone else's footprints, did we?

297
00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:23.979
That's right. It was so slippery after the rain.

298
00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:25.379
I was so scared of that mountain path,

299
00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:28.179
I kept my head down following Conan's footprints,

300
00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:29.679
so I know I didn't see anyone else's.

301
00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.179
So maybe the killer took this road.

302
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.379
There aren't any footprints on this side.

303
00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:39.579
What?

304
00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:41.679
What is really going on?

305
00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:44.479
Mr. Mouri!

306
00:17:44.479 --> 00:17:46.079
Take a look at this.

307
00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:48.379
There's a rope tied to this tree.

308
00:17:49.879 --> 00:17:52.979
I'm pretty sure the killer used this rope

309
00:17:52.979 --> 00:17:55.079
and escaped by that stream.

310
00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:57.979
The current is strong

311
00:17:57.979 --> 00:17:59.079
so the killer probably used a rubber raft

312
00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.079
to get here from upstream.

313
00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:06.679
The killer ties the raft on the shore then climbs up the rocks

314
00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:10.279
then waited for Mr. Sunaoka to appear at the villa.

315
00:18:11.179 --> 00:18:12.779
Then...

316
00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:19.879
Mr. Sunaoka was shot.

317
00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:23.879
Then the killer used this rope to get back down

318
00:18:24.879 --> 00:18:27.779
then probably used the raft to get downstream.

319
00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:31.979
Oh, no! Set up roadblocks in the areas downstream!

320
00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.579
He's wrong.

321
00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:38.979
There was danger of being seen by the people in the restaurant,

322
00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:41.179
climb up and down from here

323
00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:43.379
and the killer certainly wouldn't shoot from this place

324
00:18:43.379 --> 00:18:45.579
which leaves him in the open.

325
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:48.679
Besides, when we heard the gunshot and came running,

326
00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:50.179
there's no way the killer

327
00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:51.979
could have gotten away without being seen.

328
00:18:51.979 --> 00:18:53.579
Which means...

329
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:54.979
Hey, Conan!

330
00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.979
I knew it.

331
00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:01.579
The rope's wet.

332
00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:06.679
Conan!

333
00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:08.479
You're not supposed to run around.

334
00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.779
-All right. -We're going back.

335
00:19:10.779 --> 00:19:14.079
You're going to get lost if you keep wandering around.

336
00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:16.379
Wait up!

337
00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:25.379
Where were you when you heard the gunshot?

338
00:19:25.379 --> 00:19:27.879
I had a call from the station.

339
00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:29.779
I was on the telephone at the front desk

340
00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:32.479
so I didn't hear it.

341
00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:35.879
We've already confirmed it with the other party.

342
00:19:35.879 --> 00:19:39.579
So you were using the telephone at the front desk, is that correct?

343
00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:42.179
Yes, but not the public telephone,

344
00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:44.079
I was using the front desk's phone.

345
00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:45.279
It has a cord.

346
00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:48.579
That's right. Outside calls all come in on that.

347
00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:51.579
The battery in my portable phone was dead.

348
00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:54.579
I see. And what about you, Mr. Tahara?

349
00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:56.379
I was at the garden restaurant

350
00:19:56.379 --> 00:19:59.079
putting ideas for the scenarios together.

351
00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:00.679
I was concentrating so much,

352
00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:02.879
I didn't hear the gunshot at first.

353
00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:04.679
By the time I looked to where the shot came from

354
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:07.479
with Mr. Mouri and the others, there was nobody around.

355
00:20:07.479 --> 00:20:10.579
That's right. When the shot went off,

356
00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:15.479
it was just after Mr. Nagatsuka got his telephone call at 8 o'clock.

357
00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:16.479
When Mr. Mouri and the others

358
00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:18.979
came to the front desk to get the master key,

359
00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:21.479
I was just getting off the phone.

360
00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:23.479
I'm sure you can track the time of the call

361
00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.479
if you check the phone records, right?

362
00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:29.479
You make my job of questioning you so easy

363
00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.179
being you're all in the mystery profession.

364
00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:34.879
And what about you, Ms. Tanigawa?

365
00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:38.679
After I took Mr. Sunaoka back to his room,

366
00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:41.579
I went to take a shower.

367
00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.479
Just as I was getting out of the shower,

368
00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:45.079
when I heard the sound,

369
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.679
but it never dawned on me that we were in danger.

370
00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.379
There was a commotion outside

371
00:20:49.379 --> 00:20:52.179
so I went out to the veranda to have a look.

372
00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:55.679
And I never dreamed Kazu had been shot!

373
00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:59.979
I'm very sorry.

374
00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:01.479
Mr. Akashi, where were you?

375
00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.779
I was in the kitchen washing dishes.

376
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:06.379
The fan was on

377
00:21:06.379 --> 00:21:08.579
and I'm so used to hearing the shots from the hunting grounds

378
00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:11.279
so I didn't hear a thing.

379
00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:14.079
That's right. It was physically impossible

380
00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:18.479
for anyone in the villa to fire the rifle from that spot.

381
00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.679
The only ones staying in the villa

382
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:24.279
besides us is that group.

383
00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:27.779
Although it was kept secret that Mr. Sunaoka was here,

384
00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:30.879
it wouldn't have been too hard to find that out.

385
00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:37.279
But if the killer was someone from the outside,

386
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:40.179
it would have made better sense to shoot him on the hunting grounds

387
00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:42.479
and make it look like he was shot accidentally by a stray bullet.

388
00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:46.279
And to find a safe hiding place, there were other options.

389
00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.079
So why deliberately use a boat and rope to escape

390
00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:53.079
and risk being seen from the restaurant?

391
00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:57.479
I'm absolutely sure that was a camouflage.

392
00:21:57.479 --> 00:22:00.479
And there's only one reason for going through all that trouble.

393
00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:05.079
The killer needed an alibi.

394
00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:08.479
Which means the killer is someone from the villa.

395
00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:10.879
Yes, that's right.

396
00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:14.579
One of those three

397
00:22:14.579 --> 00:22:16.479
is the killer.

398
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:21.379
There's an exit to every maze.

399
00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:23.479
This seemingly impossible murder...

400
00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:26.579
I vow to solve this case

401
00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:28.579
on behalf of the murdered detective!

402
00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:00.579
"Next Episode" -I didn't embezzle any money

403
00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:01.579
from the production!

404
00:24:01.579 --> 00:24:04.279
Well, an investigation will clear that up.

405
00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:07.079
You mean one of us is the killer?

406
00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:10.779
The most suspicious person is you, Ms. Tanigawa!

407
00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:12.579
How dare you!

408
00:24:12.579 --> 00:24:16.279
What I found mixed in with the pieces of glass...

409
00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.079
Where'd they come from?

410
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:22.179
I knew it! Just as I thought!

411
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:28.279
