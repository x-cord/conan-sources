1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,966
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:04,766
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,366
The streetcar stops.

4
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,566
Is it an accident or a murder case? A strange incident occurs.

5
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:10,266
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,266
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,666
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,779
"The Streetcar Case"

9
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,179
"Harii Station"

10
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,179
What has taken Conan so long?

11
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,679
It's already 5:40 p.m.

12
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,279
There he is!

13
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,379
Over here, Conan!

14
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,279
-You're late, Conan. -I'm sorry.

15
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,879
What were you doing? You're 10 minutes late!

16
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,479
I overslept.

17
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,979
We don't have time to waste, you know.

18
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,179
They say that it takes hours

19
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,479
before we can get on the new thrill-packed ride of Beika Land.

20
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,379
If we go from now,

21
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,879
we'll most likely be the first ones in line.

22
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,979
Of course. It's still before 6 a.m. in the morning.

23
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,979
The train for Beika Land will be arriving.

24
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,379
Please stand behind the white line.

25
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,979
There it is!

26
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,179
Hey, let's get on!

27
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:06,379
Wow! It's like we chartered this streetcar!

28
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,179
Not too many people would think of

29
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,479
riding the streetcar from so early Sunday morning.

30
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,779
Gosh. They're not here yet.

31
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,579
Gosh, those guys... What's with them?

32
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,379
Although Horii is always late, it's unusual.

33
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,379
It's unusual for Shimizu to be late.

34
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,279
Are you alone today?

35
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,579
No, two more people should be coming.

36
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,679
May I ask is anything the matter?

37
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,079
I don't mind you people taking pictures in the streetcar,

38
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,079
but please don't disturb other passengers.

39
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,679
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,979
I made it!

41
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,879
You're late, Shimizu!

42
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,779
I'm sorry, Kawasaki. I overslept.

43
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,779
Huh? Where's Horii?

44
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:48,879
He's not here yet, like always.

45
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,779
He should be here any minute then.

46
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,979
Because it's almost time to leave.

47
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,079
-True. -Good morning.

48
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,979
Sorry.

49
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,879
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

50
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,479
What do you mean "you're sorry"?

51
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,979
You're never on time.

52
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,079
Wow! This is fantastic!

53
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,879
This way better than the driving game after all.

54
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,979
Yes. Nothing can beat the real thing.

55
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,279
Are you going to Beika Land too?

56
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,779
Nope.

57
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,579
We're members of the Beikayama-dai research committee

58
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,279
and we came to take pictures of streetcars.

59
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,979
The number of streetcars have decreased lately, haven't they?

60
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,879
We're going to be going as exchange students to Germany too,

61
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,079
so we want to take pictures of streetcars

62
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,979
before they disappear all together.

63
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,079
Leave it to me.

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,079
Yeah, we're counting on you.

65
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,279
Although he may not look it,

66
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,779
Mr. Kawasaki's only talent of taking pictures is virtually professional.

67
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,679
Hey, Shimizu! Cut out the "only", will you?

68
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,379
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,479
The next stop is Harii Shrine.

70
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,879
This is our stop.

71
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,579
Huh? Are you getting off already?

72
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,979
Yeah. There's a great place just beyond here

73
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,179
where we can get great shots of streetcars.

74
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,579
Great spot?

75
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,179
If I wrap it around twice, that should do it.

76
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,179
Hey, Horii and Shimizu.

77
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,179
The camera case is brand new

78
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,979
and the camera is inside it too.

79
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,979
So, don't let anybody touch it.

80
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,879
Okay. Remember, we're counting on you, Kawasaki.

81
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,179
Take good pictures, okay?

82
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,879
Leave it to me!

83
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,679
The bus is leaving soon.

84
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,079
Off we go!

85
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,579
Okay, I made it in time.

86
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,079
Hello?

87
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,979
Senior Kawasaki.

88
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,479
The streetcar just started off.

89
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,979
Okay, I'm all ready too.

90
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,679
Give it your best shot.

91
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,179
Senior Horii.

92
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:36,079
Shall we take pictures from the rear window then?

93
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,479
Okay.

94
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,179
Hey! Are you all right?

95
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,879
Mr. Kawasaki, are you hurt?

96
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,679
No, I'm fine. I was just a bit surprised.

97
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,179
Gosh. Enough is enough.

98
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,479
You would've been dead, you know!

99
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,179
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:36,879
Why did you fall on the rails?

101
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,979
The ladder suddenly swayed

102
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,479
when I was up there taking pictures.

103
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,079
All four legs of the ladder is supposed to be steady.

104
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,579
What are these scratches?

105
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,679
There are scratches over there too.

106
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,979
What is that?

107
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:07,479
An "S" shaped hook.

108
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,979
Moreover, a piano line is tied onto it.

109
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,079
Maybe this is...

110
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,679
I'm really sorry.

111
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,279
Well, it's a good thing that you're okay.

112
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,379
Please get back inside, everyone.

113
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,679
We're starting off.

114
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,979
What are you doing, Conan?

115
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,479
The streetcar will start off.

116
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,379
Okay.

117
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,379
Okay. Is everybody on?

118
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,679
Everybody's on!

119
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,779
If Genta is on board, everyone else is!

120
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,879
Correct! Huh? What does that mean?

121
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,479
Huh?

122
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,379
What's the matter, Mr. Horii?

123
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,679
Hey, Horii. What're you doing?

124
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,179
Don't touch him!

125
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,579
Hey, sonny.

126
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,279
What do you mean, "don't touch him"?

127
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,079
Driver, please call the police.

128
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,279
Just what do you mean by call the police?

129
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,479
Don't tell me...

130
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:19,479
Right. He's already dead.

131
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,979
What?

132
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,679
This is...

133
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,079
a lump on his forehead

134
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,879
and a lacerated wound on the back of his head.

135
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,679
Blood on the bottom of the camera case?

136
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,479
Blood on the floor.

137
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,379
What on earth is this?

138
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,379
The victim who died after falling is

139
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,079
Mr. Masao Horii, age 22.

140
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,279
He has bruises on his forehead

141
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,779
and a large laceration on the back of his head.

142
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,079
The cause of his death

143
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,679
is probably the laceration on the back of his head.

144
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,079
Hello, everyone.

145
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,979
I am Officer Wakai of the Harii Police Station.

146
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:07,479
Could I have you explain the circumstances when Mr. Horii fell?

147
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:10,079
I was watching Mr. Kawasaki

148
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,679
when he fell off the ladder to the rails.

149
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,979
When the streetcar suddenly stopped, so I saw nothing.

150
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:20,879
I was so scared, that I closed my eyes, so...

151
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,879
I was so absorbed in what was going on in front,

152
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,179
so I didn't see anything either.

153
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:28,779
I was taking pictures together with Mr. Horii

154
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,779
at the rear of the streetcar.

155
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,479
Then, the streetcar suddenly screeched to a stop,

156
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,379
and I was thrown forward.

157
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,579
So, I don't know how Mr. Horii was then.

158
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,679
I see. And you?

159
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,479
I braked the streetcar to a stop,

160
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,979
went outside immediately and ran over to him,

161
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,879
that I don't know anything about the person who died.

162
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,179
I see.

163
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,679
All of you rushed outside the streetcar.

164
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,379
Did anyone from outside

165
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,279
get on board the streetcar during that time?

166
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
It was only a few minutes later

167
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,479
that we came back on board the streetcar,

168
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,079
so I don't think anyone came on board.

169
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,379
I see.

170
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,279
Judging from Mr. Horii's laceration on the back of his head

171
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,779
and the blood stain on the camera case,

172
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,679
Mr. Horii lost his balance

173
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,079
when the streetcar suddenly stopped.

174
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,179
Then, he fell on his back and hit the back of his head

175
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,279
on the camera case that was placed by the exit.

176
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,679
This is an accident.

177
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,479
A genuine accident.

178
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,479
What? But it's strange.

179
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,079
What's strange?

180
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,379
There is no mistake in my judgment who is headed for

181
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,379
the post of Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police.

182
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,679
What would a kid like you know?

183
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,879
It's up to you where you're headed for.

184
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,279
But we're members of the Youth Detective Squad too.

185
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,379
Right. We're disciples of the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri.

186
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,879
Gosh.

187
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,379
What? You mean the famous Sleeping Kogoro?

188
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,479
So, what's so strange, sonny?

189
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:01,779
Look at this camera case.

190
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,279
There is a lot of blood on the bottom of the case,

191
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,979
but if he fell on top of it,

192
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:08,679
shouldn't there be a lot of blood on the top?

193
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,379
I see.

194
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,279
The camera case probably rolled over

195
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,979
when the streetcar suddenly stopped.

196
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,479
But the shoulder belt of the camera case

197
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:23,279
was fixed onto the railing, so I don't think it moved.

198
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,779
This shoulder belt...

199
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,979
I'm sure that back then...

200
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,779
If I wrap it around twice, that should do it.

201
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,279
Hey, Horii and Shimizu.

202
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,579
The camera case is brand new.

203
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,479
That's strange.

204
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,179
l wrapped the shoulder belt around twice

205
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,979
and fixed it onto the railing when I got off the streetcar.

206
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,679
I told everyone not to touch it

207
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,279
because it's brand new and doesn't have even one scratch yet.

208
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,279
Gosh. There's a scratch on the side too.

209
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,579
What?

210
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,679
Then, are you saying that

211
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,879
someone removed your camera case from the railing?

212
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,679
Officer.

213
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,479
Don't you think it's strange that

214
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:05,579
he has a lump on his forehead despite falling backwards?

215
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,579
I see.

216
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,679
And besides, look here.

217
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,979
There's a lot of blood.

218
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:14,979
As if hit by...

219
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,879
No, it couldn't be.

220
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,879
That's impossible to do if the streetcar screeched to a stop.

221
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:23,179
This is undoubtedly an accident.

222
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,179
There is definitely no other possibility.

223
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,679
What a fix.

224
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,779
What's that?

225
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,279
Wait a sec.

226
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,879
This "S" shaped hook that was near the ladder.

227
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,379
And the scratch on the camera case.

228
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,079
I see. I get it.

229
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,879
Since the streetcar braked suddenly,

230
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,779
it looks impossible at first glance,

231
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,079
but this is not accident.

232
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,279
Mr. Horii was killed.

233
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:52,279
And the killer is here.

234
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:06,068
Driver, you can't keep your streetcar stalled here,

235
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:07,968
so please head back to the depot.

236
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:10,268
I'd like to take a recorded statement of the accident.

237
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:11,568
Yes, sir.

238
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,068
Hey, you. We're going to be taking recorded statements

239
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:18,268
from the people involved, so keep that in mind, will you?

240
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,368
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:23,068
Oh, no. I've got to do something about Officer Wakai.

242
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:26,568
But I can't use the anesthetic gun in front of everyone.

243
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:29,868
Moreover, there's no place to hide in this streetcar anyway.

244
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,968
Therefore, Mr. Kawasaki and Ms. Shimizu,

245
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:34,868
I'm going to have to make

246
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:37,168
a record of your statements of the accident,

247
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,868
so please give me some of your time.

248
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:42,668
-Yes, sir. -All right.

249
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,368
Will you please come along too, boys?

250
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:45,768
Yes, sir...

251
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,268
Wait, officer!

252
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,268
What is it, sonny?

253
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,968
Don't worry, I'll let you be the first one to testify.

254
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,468
No, that's not it.

255
00:14:55,468 --> 00:15:00,268
I picked this up near the ladder that fell a while ago.

256
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:03,468
I wonder if it has anything to do with the accident.

257
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:05,368
What connection does that "S" shaped hook have

258
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,668
with Mr. Horii's accident?

259
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:11,068
Well, if this ladder didn't fall,

260
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:14,668
the streetcar wouldn't have braked to a stop, right?

261
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:16,668
So...

262
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:23,068
Let me see that hook.

263
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,168
Here you go, Officer.

264
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,968
Maybe...

265
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,568
It fits perfectly!

266
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:32,968
The scratch matches perfectly, after all.

267
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:36,268
So, this hook was hooked onto the ladder.

268
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,368
And this piano cord...

269
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,768
Officer Wakai.

270
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:44,968
A piano cord was tangled onto the bumper of the streetcar.

271
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:46,968
What? Show it to me!

272
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,268
Yes, it's this.

273
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,568
From the thickness, material and the cut edge,

274
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:54,068
it seems to be the same cord.

275
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:58,068
Sonny, where did you find this "S" shaped hook?

276
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:01,568
It was stuck to the metal part of this telephone pole.

277
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:06,568
I see. The scratch on the metal part of this pole is still new.

278
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,968
And I'm sure it's there too.

279
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,068
See! There's a scratch here too!

280
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:17,268
Right on the opposite side is the sign.

281
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,168
Just as I thought.

282
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,368
I see!

283
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:27,268
There is a cut off piano cord left on the pole of this sign.

284
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:28,968
Which means...

285
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,768
the piano cord which stretched out from the "S" shaped hook

286
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,168
stuck to the ladder,

287
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,768
was wrapped around a nearby telephone pole

288
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:38,868
and hooked on to a telephone pole about to meters behind,

289
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:40,668
then stretched over to the pole of the sign

290
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,468
on the opposite side of the rails.

291
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:47,368
The streetcar that came along, pulled the piano cord.

292
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,868
The leg of the ladder is dragged,

293
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,868
loses balance and falls.

294
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:55,168
The frame was thus forced to fall.

295
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:56,768
But who would do something like this?

296
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,168
This trick is too complicated to be a simple prank.

297
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:01,268
I wonder if the ladder falling

298
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:06,268
and Mr. Horii's death is connected?

299
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:08,568
I see! That's it!

300
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:12,468
I, Officer Wakai, will solve the mystery of this case.

301
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:14,868
Let's all go back to the streetcar.

302
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,968
Hey, hey. Can you work it out or what?

303
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,968
Okay, everyone, are you ready?

304
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,268
Mr. Horii didn't die of an accident.

305
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:29,068
He was murdered!

306
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:31,168
What?

307
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,168
But you just said it was an accident a while ago.

308
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:38,368
Yes, but I've also found out that Mr. Kawasaki's ladder

309
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,168
was rigged by someone and made to fall.

310
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:45,268
What? You mean somebody was trying to kill me?

311
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:48,168
Yes, maybe.

312
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,968
What do you mean?

313
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,968
You say that Mr. Horii didn't die of an accident,

314
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,268
and on top of that, you're saying that

315
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,968
somebody deliberately made Mr. Kawasaki's ladder fall.

316
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,268
I'll explain that now.

317
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,668
First, for the way that Mr. Horii was murdered.

318
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:08,668
If the murderer knew that the streetcar was going to stop suddenly.

319
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,968
Yes, if the ladder that Mr. Kawasaki was on

320
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,768
could be rigged to fall.

321
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:17,568
It would be possible to kill Mr. Horii in no time at all.

322
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,268
Mr. Kawasaki came falling

323
00:18:20,268 --> 00:18:23,168
and your attention were all fixed on what was happening ahead.

324
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:25,568
Taking advantage of the situation,

325
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:29,268
the killer hit the back of Mr. Horii's head with the camera case.

326
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,668
And Mr. Horii who fell forward,

327
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,868
hit his forehead on the railing

328
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,268
and fell to the floor,

329
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:38,868
leaving a pool of blood.

330
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:40,868
The killer immediately

331
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,768
strapped the camera case back to where it was,

332
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:47,268
but being in a rush could only wrap the belt around the railing once.

333
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:51,468
Right after that, the streetcar suddenly stopped

334
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:53,168
that Mr. Horii's body slid

335
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,968
and he hit his head on the camera case.

336
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:02,268
At that time, the person who was nearest to Mr. Horii

337
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,868
was you, isn't that right? Ms. Shimizu!

338
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,468
You've gotta be kidding!

339
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,768
I was thrown forward when the streetcar stopped

340
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,868
and almost died too!

341
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,868
Driver.

342
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:18,068
There was another streetcar that went by before you, right?

343
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:22,168
It went by about 5:40 a.m.

344
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:28,368
If so, the killer rigged the piano cord after 5:40 a.m.

345
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,068
And it had to be somebody who knew that

346
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,368
Mr. Kawasaki was going to be taking pictures here.

347
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:38,368
Horii, Shimizu and I decided to take pictures here yesterday.

348
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:42,368
I took it there this morning before going to the station.

349
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:47,068
I was at Harii Station by 5:54 a.m.

350
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,968
It's about 4 kilometers from here to Harii Station, right?

351
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:53,268
You can come in 10 minutes by bicycle.

352
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:56,768
When the streetcar reached Harii Shrine station,

353
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:00,268
you called Mr. Kawasaki on your cellular, didn't you?

354
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:04,168
You wanted to confirm if Mr. Kawasaki was on the ladder, right?

355
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:06,668
Don't tell me that you really...

356
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:09,668
I didn't even touch the camera case,

357
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,368
nor did I kill Mr. Horii!

358
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:15,368
Besides, what proof do you have?

359
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:18,268
Proof? Well...

360
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:21,468
The nerve of accusing someone, without any proof.

361
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:23,868
Ms. Shimizu.

362
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,668
What's the scratch you have

363
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:28,768
on the palm on your hand and your wristwatch?

364
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,068
What about this scratch?

365
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:35,068
And that? The blood on the camera case.

366
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,368
Isn't that the blood that came from your wound?

367
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:45,168
You got this wound when you hit Mr. Horii

368
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,268
with the camera case, didn't you?

369
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:48,568
No!

370
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:52,168
How did the result of the investigation officers turn out?

371
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,568
According to the investigation officers,

372
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,468
the blood stain on the top right corner of the camera case

373
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:01,268
is not Mr. Horii's.

374
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:04,968
And fingerprints other than that of Mr. Horii

375
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:06,568
and Mr. Kawasaki were found.

376
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,168
How about it, Ms. Shimizu?

377
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:15,168
Ms. Shimizu, why'd you kill Horii?

378
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,768
I...

379
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,768
I was going steady with Mr. Horii,

380
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:25,268
and we also promised to get married to each other.

381
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:28,268
And when it turned out that

382
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:31,268
he would be going to Germany as an exchange student,

383
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,568
I told him I wanted to go with him, but...

384
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,568
Sorry. I can't take you with me.

385
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:40,768
I've got a fiancee there that my parents picked for me.

386
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,768
I'm getting married in Germany.

387
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,868
I couldn't forgive Mr. Horii.

388
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,368
I couldn't forgive him.

389
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:57,468
I couldn't forgive him, no matter what.

390
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:35,868
Good work, Youth Detective Squad!

391
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:38,168
I'll give you my autograph in memory of this.

392
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,468
Huh?

393
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:42,068
I, Kenji Wakai, has determined the streetcar accident

394
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:46,068
that the Youth Detective Squad were pursuing as being a murder case,

395
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,568
and have solved it as such.

396
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:49,768
Hey, hey.

397
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:53,968
Youth Detective Squad! I'll see you again someday!

398
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,168
Oh, my!

399
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:01,368
You'd better be careful not to trip over a promotion.

400
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:06,068
"Next Episode"

401
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,568
What is this water?

402
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:26,268
It's wet all the way from there.

403
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:33,368
Next Conan, "The Amusement Park Bungee Jump"

404
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,570
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,470
"The Masked Yaiba Show"

406
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,270
The next case takes place in an amusement park.

407
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,170
Officer Takagi's biggest calamity!

408
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,470
Is that so?
