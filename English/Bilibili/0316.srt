1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,840
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,540
A graceful mask on the professional wrestling ring.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,740
Solve the case of the masked man.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,567
"Tohto Kokugikan"

9
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:47,167
Now, let's have renown Detective Kogoro Mouri

10
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,067
pick the real Wolf Face!

11
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,367
Who of the five men here is the masked man, Wolf Face,

12
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,667
in the Teito professional wrestling match occurring right now?

13
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:09,667
Well?

14
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,567
Is it number three?

15
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,367
Yes! Correct! Exactly!

16
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,967
Just as would be expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

17
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,967
What spectacular deduction!

18
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,267
It's so obvious that he'd figure it out

19
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,367
with the panel of the real one

20
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,867
being pushed at his face like that.

21
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:38,867
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 1)"

22
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,867
Darn it.

23
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:46,067
I just took this job because they're giving me good pay,

24
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,667
but what a place to have come to.

25
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,667
What do you mean?

26
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:54,767
Combat sports are pretty popular among the young people nowadays.

27
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,667
Even the boys in our karate club

28
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,867
use professional wrestling techniques on each other for fun too!

29
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,467
Hey...

30
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:05,567
Especially that technique that was just used...

31
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:10,067
Wait, what was it called?

32
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,967
No matter how cool they try to make it look,

33
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,067
it's no more than just kid's stuff.

34
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,367
All right!

35
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,167
You're totally into it.

36
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,567
Hey, Ran.

37
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,267
When is that Wolf Face that was introduced a while ago going to fight?

38
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,267
He's incredibly strong, isn't he?

39
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:50,767
Wolf Face is fighting in the junior heavyweight title match,

40
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,267
so it'll be at the very end, which is the main event!

41
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,567
Are you saying that he's a champion or something like that?

42
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,867
Right!

43
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,367
After he debuted making an official announcement

44
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,067
that he would take off his mask if he loses,

45
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:04,467
but he never lost in all the single 65 matches he fought!

46
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:09,767
But, I'd like to see him lose for once.

47
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,767
Why?

48
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:14,167
Because if he loses,

49
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,067
we get to see what he looks like!

50
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,167
Hiding his face with a mask.

51
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:23,367
I'll bet he's probably just some super ugly dude or going bald!

52
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,167
Sorry for being an ugly man.

53
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,267
But, he isn't bald.

54
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,367
What?

55
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,867
Then, don't tell me that...

56
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,567
You're him?

57
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:45,967
"Takaharu Ogami (27)" -This is the true identity of Wolf Face.

58
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,367
Are you sure it's okay, though?

59
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,767
Coming out without your mask to a place like this.

60
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:50,867
No worry,

61
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:54,567
Wolf Face is said to be Mexican.

62
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:59,167
Besides, I sometimes fight in the opening performance with this face.

63
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,667
But, everybody thinks that I'm just a young wrestler.

64
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,967
Well, I don't use the techniques of Wolf Face at that time,

65
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,167
so I'm just another young wrestler.

66
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,767
So, no one knows your true identity then.

67
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:11,867
Yes.

68
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:15,367
Nobody except for the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling knows about me.

69
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,867
Neither do my parents nor my girlfriend.

70
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,767
I debuted as a mysterious masked wrestler

71
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:23,767
in Mexico to begin with so...

72
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:27,467
You don't have the kind of face that you'd have to hide, though.

73
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:30,367
I like to wear masks!

74
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,967
It's been my dream since I was a child.

75
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,267
Excuse me.

76
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,167
Doesn't it bother you at all?

77
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,467
To hide your identity and deceive everybody.

78
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:48,167
I'm sure that your girlfriend wants you to tell her the truth.

79
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,867
I really wish that you were Shinichi, Conan.

80
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:57,867
Ran.

81
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:03,467
I just said a while ago, remember?

82
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,967
That my true identity is

83
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:08,467
a secret that only the personnel of Teito Pro Wrestling know of.

84
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,867
If an outsider revealed my true identity,

85
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,967
I won't have to suspect her for having given away my identity

86
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,567
if she doesn't know, right?

87
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,667
But...

88
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,067
Besides, I don't want to worry her.

89
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:25,467
Wolf Face's match is aired on TV during Golden Time.

90
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,967
The match may turn out to be violent and bloody too so...

91
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,367
Well,

92
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,567
I'm more or less prepared for what is to come.

93
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,167
The time when I take my mask off

94
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,667
is when I lose and sink into the mat.

95
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,967
It's when Wolf Face dies and leaves the ring.

96
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:48,367
But why did you reveal your identity to us, then?

97
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,967
Well,

98
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:54,267
the thing is, my girlfriend is a great fan of the Sleeping Kogoro.

99
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,467
I figured you wouldn't give me your autograph

100
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,967
if I was just another young wrestler.

101
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,767
Why didn't you ask me when you were wearing your mask,

102
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,167
just a while ago, then?

103
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,267
But Wolf Face can't communicate in Japanese

104
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,567
unless he uses an interpreter!

105
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,267
Therefore, I wouldn't be able to ask you to give me an autograph

106
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,967
addressed to a girl with a Japanese name!

107
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,867
Besides, I figured that you're not the kind of people

108
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:19,567
who would give away my secret and shatter the dreams of children.

109
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,967
Well, of course not.

110
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,967
Mr. Ogami, it's about time.

111
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,167
Okay!

112
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,567
Well, then... Her name's inside,

113
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,567
so please give me your autograph!

114
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,967
His identity will be revealed

115
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,267
when he dies?

116
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,667
Mr. Nagase.

117
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,667
Mr. Nagase! Turn this way please.

118
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:56,267
Mr. Nagase! You're finally going to be fighting against

119
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,867
the invincible champion Wolf Face for his belt,

120
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,867
can you tell us how you're feeling now?

121
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:03,167
How am I feeling?

122
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:07,267
All I want is for the people here to watch me.

123
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,167
To watch me fight with all my might

124
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,167
"Hyota Nagase (25)" -against that idiot Japanese leopard

125
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:16,867
whose mask will be torn off when I defeat him.

126
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,667
Japanese leopard?

127
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:22,367
You mean Wolf Face is Japanese?

128
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,767
-Oh, no. -It's a joke, just a joke!

129
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:28,067
We're in a rush, so interview us later.

130
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,167
"Japanese Team Locker Room" -Hey, Nagase!

131
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,867
Just what do you think you're doing?

132
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,967
"Iwao Ushigome (36)" -Didn't I tell you

133
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,867
that Wolf Face's identity is top secret?

134
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,267
And that you're not supposed to say a word about it to anyone!

135
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:41,267
Are you aware of the fact that

136
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:46,267
Ogami shoulders half the popularity that Teito Pro Wrestling enjoys!

137
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:49,567
Then, what is it you're saying, Mr. Ushigome?

138
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,867
Are you telling me, the star of the main event,

139
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:57,067
who has worked and polished strength as well as gain popularity

140
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,267
to go out of my way to lose deliberately on this gala occasion?

141
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,067
It's true that you're just a good looking

142
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,767
or even better than him,

143
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,467
but with the strength that you possess now,

144
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,367
you couldn't possibly beat him.

145
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,967
Just what are you talking about?

146
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,667
What's important for a wrestler is looks.

147
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,767
If not, a wrestler with your ability

148
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,867
would've become popular a long time ago, right?

149
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,267
What?

150
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,567
Hey, Nagase!

151
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,567
That's no way to talk to your superior.

152
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,967
"Hiroyuki Sakuma (25)" -Hold it.

153
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:30,567
You don't want to hurt a precious body just before a match, do you?

154
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,867
Okay then.

155
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:35,067
I'll be flexing my body like always in the room.

156
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,167
So when it's time to fight the match, please call me.

157
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,267
Well, if I win,

158
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:43,567
I'll give all of you a mask as a gift.

159
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,367
So that you guys can all hide your ugly faces

160
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,067
and gain more popularity.

161
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,967
Yeah. No problem.

162
00:09:56,967 --> 00:10:00,067
Chances are 200 percent my win.

163
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,467
Although, it's a hidden fact,

164
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,467
his left knee is not completely healed yet.

165
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,467
If I target his weak point, I can stop him in his moves

166
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,867
and if it looks like I'm about to lose, that's fine too.

167
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:16,767
All I have to do is peel his mask off on the mat, that'll be it.

168
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,967
Everything will work out just fine.

169
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,967
I made the young ones at your place wear masks

170
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,167
and I practiced time and again with them

171
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:28,367
on how to tear off the mask during the match.

172
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,967
The match will be cancelled once his identity is revealed,

173
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,367
and I'll be fired,

174
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,567
but Teito Pro Wrestling's popularity will go down too.

175
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,567
I'll end up the unfortunate wrestler

176
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,267
who is fired from Teito Pro Wrestling

177
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:43,667
for revealing the true identity of Wolf Face,

178
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:47,867
and go up on the ring at your place.

179
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:50,867
I'm counting on you when that time comes.

180
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,267
Okay, Bankoku Pro Wrestling?

181
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,867
He sure is the leader of Teito Pro Wrestling.

182
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,967
It's finally time for Wolf Face to fight!

183
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,467
I gotta go to the restroom!

184
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:09,067
You better come back quick or the match will start!

185
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,567
Yep!

186
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:13,167
So where's the restroom...

187
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,967
Mr. Ogami?

188
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,267
Amazing.

189
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,567
He's so different from who we just saw.

190
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,467
Hey, Wolf!

191
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:33,167
"Leonardo Rossi (30)" -Good luck.

192
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,667
Shoots. I better go to the restroom quickly.

193
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,267
Hey, kid!

194
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:47,367
This place is off limits to everyone except authorized personnel!

195
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,767
Come on, I'm just going to the restroom!

196
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:51,967
No...

197
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,067
The restroom for the general public is on the second floor...

198
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,767
Hey, Nagase!

199
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,967
Just what do you think you're doing!

200
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,067
The match is going to start!

201
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,467
Hey, Nagase! Hey!

202
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,267
What's up, Sakuma?

203
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,867
Mr. Kiba.

204
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,667
Is something wrong with Nagase?

205
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,867
Well...

206
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:12,467
Nagase won't come out of the waiting room.

207
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,767
Well, we had a slight argument a while ago,

208
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,067
and nobody wanted to be his corner man,

209
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:21,967
so I decided to be his corner man and came to call him but...

210
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,867
Then, why don't you just drag him out of there

211
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,467
and make him get up on the ring!

212
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,767
But, he gets outraged saying that

213
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,867
his concentration is interrupted

214
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:33,367
if we go in without his permission.

215
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:37,167
Who does that green-horn think he is?

216
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,467
Hey, Nagase!

217
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,267
Hurry up and come out!

218
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,767
Nagase?

219
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,167
Hey, get a hold of yourself! Nagase!

220
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,467
No good.

221
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,067
There's no pulse.

222
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,467
What?

223
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:59,367
Hurry and get an ambulance and the police!

224
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,267
Yes, sir!

225
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:03,267
Darn it, who...

226
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,267
who could've done a thing like this?

227
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,267
Don't you hear a strange noise?

228
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,267
What?

229
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,367
A strange noise?

230
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,267
It's coming from that bag.

231
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,867
A hidden camera?

232
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,667
Nichiuri TV?

233
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,067
"Nichiuri TV"

234
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,667
Don't tell me that the killer is in the video...

235
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:48,067
This is...

236
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,967
Wolf Face?

237
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:09,389
We're sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.

238
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,189
The challenger for the junior heavyweight title match,

239
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:15,589
Hyota Nagase, is unable to fight

240
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,789
because of a sudden accident.

241
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:21,789
Therefore, the title match with Wolf Face that had been scheduled

242
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,589
has been cancelled.

243
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,789
What?

244
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,189
No way.

245
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:40,589
The victim is Mr. Hyota Nagase, age 25.

246
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,589
He belongs to the Teito Pro Wrestling team.

247
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,389
A professional wrestler?

248
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,989
Yes, he'd been getting stronger day by day

249
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:49,889
and was steadily gaining popularity.

250
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,389
He seems to have been stabbed to death.

251
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,489
Yes.

252
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,589
He's been stabbed in a total of three places

253
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,789
which are his back, his chest and his stomach.

254
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,889
The blow that took his life was the final stab in his chest.

255
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,789
How do you know that the final stab was in his chest?

256
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,289
Well...

257
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,189
that's what we saw on the video before you got here, Inspector.

258
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,489
The video?

259
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,089
You mean a surveillance camera?

260
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,789
No. It is a hidden camera that Nichiuri TV,

261
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,489
who holds broadcasting rights

262
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,289
to our Teito Pro Wrestling Team set up in this room!

263
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,589
They wanted to film in secret Nagase

264
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,389
just before the title match.

265
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,189
Whenever he fought at the Tohto Kokugikan,

266
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:34,989
he used to do warm-up exercises alone in this room.

267
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,589
I see.

268
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,089
Will you show me that video too?

269
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,289
Oh. Here it is!

270
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,589
If so, the case is just as well solved!

271
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,289
The killer is shown on this tape, right?

272
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,489
Well, the thing is...

273
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,089
Wolfman?

274
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,589
Rather, a wolf's mask?

275
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,189
Wolf Face.

276
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,789
The masked wrestler that is popular now.

277
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,989
He's a junior heavyweight champion

278
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:10,389
and was scheduled to fight Nagase tonight for the title.

279
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,489
Since Wolf Face publicly announced that

280
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,089
he would reveal his true identity if he lost.

281
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,189
So it was a match in which his mask was at stake.

282
00:16:18,189 --> 00:16:21,489
Which means in order to protect his title and identity,

283
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:24,789
the masked wrestler killed Nagase before the match

284
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:28,489
without realizing that there was a hidden camera here.

285
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:29,689
Oh, not really.

286
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,389
Not really!

287
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,889
Almost all the people of the Teito Wrestling Team

288
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:40,789
besides Nagase knew that there was a hidden camera here,

289
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,889
and once this wolf's mask is worn,

290
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:45,389
Wolf Face could be anybody, right?

291
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:47,389
Conan?

292
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:51,089
Which means that the killer is Wolf Face himself

293
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,889
or a professional wrestler with the same kind of physique as Wolf Face

294
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,389
who wants to set him up as the killer, right?

295
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,889
A professional wrestler with the same physique?

296
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,289
Because the killer that is in the video is

297
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,289
about the same height as Mr. Nagase.

298
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:11,489
Wolf Face is about the same height as Mr. Nagase, right?

299
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,089
Yeah.

300
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,589
Besides, this room is closed to everyone

301
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,089
except authorized personnel!

302
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,089
Only another professional wrestler

303
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,089
could stab a professional wrestler in a place like this!

304
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,189
I already gave the forensic officers

305
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,089
the murder weapon, which was a knife,

306
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,489
the gloves and outfit of the killer,

307
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:33,089
that was found in the restroom nearby, so don't worry!

308
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,889
I see.

309
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,689
So, Mr. Kiba,

310
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,489
please bring that masked wrestler and the professional wrestler

311
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:44,089
that has the same physique as he does here!

312
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,589
Yes, sir.

313
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:52,489
But, Conan. Why are you here?

314
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,489
I wanted to go to the restroom

315
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,489
and I heard the other wrestler making a fuss

316
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,589
over Mr. Nagase not coming out of his room,

317
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:59,289
so I came to check out what was happening!

318
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,089
No, rather,

319
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:04,989
who brought you to this professional wrestling grounds?

320
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:10,089
The famous Detective Kogoro Mouri, Inspector!

321
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,789
It's you after all, God of Death.

322
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:18,089
Well... Please let me see it too.

323
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:23,089
The video tape which shows the murder being committed!

324
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,189
Oh, it's you.

325
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:33,789
This is when the killer comes into the room.

326
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,089
Hey...

327
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,989
I have nothing to talk to you about before the match.

328
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,389
Or do you want to ask me to lose on purpose?

329
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:43,589
The video just shook just now.

330
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,489
I think the killer's foot touched the bag

331
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,289
in which the video camera was hidden.

332
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,789
I already told you that I'm going to go for it seriously tonight.

333
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:56,789
He's already holding the knife.

334
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:01,189
-What do you think you're doing? -He stabs Mr. Nagase in the back first.

335
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:02,789
Then as he turns around,

336
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,589
Mr. Nagase is stabbed again in the stomach.

337
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,989
Hey. Isn't the victim trying to say something?

338
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:11,389
But, the killer covers his mouth so nothing can be heard.

339
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:14,489
He's going for the mask!

340
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,689
Come to think of it,

341
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,189
the blood smeared mask that I found in the restroom

342
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:21,289
was ripped about 10cm under the part of the right eye!

343
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,389
Then, maybe the killer's face can be seen.

344
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:28,489
Then, the final blow in the chest.

345
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:32,789
Darn it! Only if the killer would look this way.

346
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,089
But, why is he looking around like that?

347
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,689
Maybe he's looking for something?

348
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,889
He fell?

349
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,889
Okay, get up, just the way you are!

350
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,989
Then, we get to see a close up of his face

351
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,789
from the ripped part of the mask.

352
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,289
Darn it. It's the left profile of his face of the part

353
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,889
that's not ripped that we first saw.

354
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,689
And, he leaves the room.

355
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,389
But, if a blood smeared man like him walks around,

356
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,289
I'm sure that somebody would've noticed him.

357
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,589
Oh, yes,

358
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:07,089
the young wrestler who was in front of the restroom

359
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,489
seems to have seen a man with blood on his outfit.

360
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,689
It seems that the man went into the restroom

361
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,589
hiding his head with a bath towel,

362
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,289
that the young wrestler took no special note of him,

363
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,989
thinking that it was just another veteran wrestler,

364
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,289
who was smeared in blood after fighting in the opening performance.

365
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,989
I see.

366
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:26,389
If he hid another outfit in the restroom beforehand,

367
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,689
he can change clothes then come out

368
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:31,489
looking as if nothing had happened.

369
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,689
What time is the estimated time of death?

370
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:37,289
A definite time has not been concluded yet but...

371
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,389
It was probably some time during the match Mr. Kiba was fighting.

372
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,489
Because three minutes after the killer left the room,

373
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,589
Mr. Kiba's roar of victory.

374
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:49,189
See! You'll hear it soon!

375
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,989
-Right? -You're right.

376
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:56,289
Which means that the time the murder was committed is...

377
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,489
Around 7:20 pm.

378
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:03,089
Inspector, I brought the four

379
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:06,089
who have a physique similar to Nagase.

380
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:11,289
So, please let me know when you find the murderer.

381
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,289
It's a promise, Inspector.

382
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,389
Okay.

383
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,789
Oh, there he is!

384
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,189
Mr. Kiba! Is it true that Mr. Nagase was killed?

385
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,889
Are the four that just went in suspects?

386
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,389
Please answer us, Mr. Kiba!

387
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,389
-Mr. Kiba? -Mr. Kiba!

388
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,689
Gosh, his lips are sealed.

389
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:38,189
But, this means the end of the Teito Pro Wrestling Team.

390
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:39,989
Yeah.

391
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:44,489
All right then, from the person on the right,

392
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:46,389
please give me your name

393
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:50,389
and where you were around 7:20 pm.

394
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:52,989
Yeah.

395
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:54,789
Judging from the circumstances,

396
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:58,189
the killer should be among the four.

397
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:00,289
Who was it?

398
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:03,189
Who was it among these four people?

399
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,989
The person who killed Mr. Nagase.

400
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,589
"Next Episode" -It's the wrestler that did the bloody match.

401
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,789
Hey, Officer Takagi.

402
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:01,189
I have two things I want to ask you.

403
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,289
Next Conan,

404
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,489
"The Sullied Masked Hero (Part 2)"

405
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:16,457
Next Conan's Hint:

406
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,457
"Mask"

407
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,757
Sleeping Kogoro will make his appearance in the next episode.

408
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:23,503
I see, Pops is my mask.
