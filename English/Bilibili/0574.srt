1
00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:04.215
Heiji and Kazuha came to Tokyo

2
00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:06.315
to get back Kazuha's lucky charm

3
00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.615
that Heiji hand mistakenly given away.

4
00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.815
The person that the charm was given to was Mr. Teruaki Kunimatsu

5
00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:15.615
who had broken his left arm during tennis practice

6
00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.615
and was staying over at his friend's place.

7
00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.915
Mr. Kunimatsu was found

8
00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.015
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -assaulted and battered by someone

9
00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.615
"Teitan University second-year student" -in the restroom of a sports cafe.

10
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:31.115
Heiji and I who started investigation along with Officer Takagi,

11
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.215
narrowed the suspects down to three people.

12
00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:35.315
Moreover,

13
00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.315
we found that the sports match that Mr. Kunimatsu watched in the afternoon

14
00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.415
seemed to have something to do with the incident.

15
00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.715
However, we didn't know which match he watched.

16
00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.815
All three of the suspects

17
00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.315
watched a sports match in the afternoon.

18
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:52.115
I'm sure that a clue that leads to the culprit

19
00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:54.815
can be found in the testimony of the three suspects!

20
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:01.215
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

21
00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.215
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

22
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:04.315
The mystery of the case is finally solved.

23
00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:07.515
What on earth was inside Kazuha's lucky charm?

24
00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:09.215
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.215
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.215
His name is Detective Conan!

27
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.420
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 2)".

28
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.520
I guess all three did go to watch an exciting game,

29
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.620
but unless we figure out what game Mr. Kunimatsu went to watch today...

30
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.520
Yeah.

31
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.320
Didn't you find anything in his wallet?

32
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.020
Like the cut off half of a ticket for a game or something.

33
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.220
No. Besides a some money and credit cards,

34
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.620
just a lucky charm.

35
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.720
Coming up is pro baseball news!

36
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.520
Here are the highlights from the day game.

37
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.620
Maybe he went to a baseball match?

38
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.520
You see, maybe he actually went to watch a baseball game

39
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.420
but lied about it?

40
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.720
I see!

41
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.920
If something happened between

42
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.420
the culprit and Mr. Kunimatsu that caused the problem,

43
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420
he would never say that he went to watch a baseball game!

44
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.520
But the day game for baseball was just this game,

45
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.920
a plain game with a lot of errors.

46
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.120
The only thing good about it was that

47
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.320
at the bottom half of the 9th inning...

48
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.120
Hold it!

49
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.720
Well, since the customers left,

50
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.920
I decided to clean the table.

51
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
I wish you wouldn't clean up without asking first!

52
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.720
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -It's still got popcorn inside.

53
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.720
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -Then, will you bring my half eaten hot dog

54
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.720
back to me after heating it up again!

55
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.220
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -Then, the same with my beer.

56
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.220
All right.

57
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.520
So, what was I talking about?

58
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.720
The day game! The day game!

59
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.220
Why would it be a day game if it were baseball?

60
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.420
If around here,

61
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.720
they had a night game at Yokohama too, didn't they?

62
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.220
Idiot!

63
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.920
When Mr. Kunimatsu made a phone call saying, "This is just great!

64
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.920
Luck has come my way at last! I'll show you proof from now".

65
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.920
It was sundown, you know!

66
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.520
So, it had to be a game that was held in the day time, right?

67
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.820
I guess so.

68
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.720
Besides, when I checked using my cell phone a while ago,

69
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.920
the score for this game was 1 to 5.

70
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.920
A player for the team that was making errors and losing

71
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.820
finally struck just one homerun at the bottom half of the 9th inning.

72
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.320
He would never say something like "This is just great!"

73
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.220
watching a shabby game like this, would he?

74
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.520
At any rate,

75
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.620
the games that were played in the day time

76
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.920
were sumo wrestling, beach volleyball, soccer,

77
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.420
the baseball game and golf.

78
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.820
Then, maybe it was golf?

79
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.120
If I remember correctly,

80
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.320
it seems to have been a very exciting game

81
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.120
where the game took a complete turn at the final hole.

82
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.920
But that course is a bit far from here, you see.

83
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
If after watching that match,

84
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.720
if you were to try to make it to this sports cafe by 20:00,

85
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.920
it would be pretty difficult.

86
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.720
According to the employee,

87
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.620
Mr. Kunimatsu seems to have come to the shop

88
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.020
about an hour before the incident occurred, so...

89
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.720
There's no clue.

90
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.020
There's no way of knowing who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up.

91
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.320
-Wrong. -Wrong.

92
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.520
-We already know who the culprit is! -We already know who the culprit is!

93
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.920
-No way. -Are you serious?

94
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.220
If you know who it is,

95
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.320
why don't you hurry and tell everybody about it,

96
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.720
and solve the case?

97
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.120
If you find that the lucky charm has nothing to do with the case,

98
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.620
you'll give it right back, won't you?

99
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.420
Yeah...

100
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.020
What's with you, all hung up on a lucky charm all the while?

101
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.220
Mr. Kunimatsu was beaten up

102
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.020
despite having the lucky charm on him, you know?

103
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.020
It's not all that effective!

104
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.920
That's a lucky charm that's effective only for me!

105
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.020
So, who's the culprit?

106
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.520
You know who it is, don't you?

107
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.220
But we don't have proof yet.

108
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.920
You don't have any?

109
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.720
-Right? -Yeah.

110
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.620
Talking about proof,

111
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.520
I wonder what it was that Kunimatsu was saying he was going to show me.

112
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.520
Yes, I wonder.

113
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.720
The first thing that comes to mind

114
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.020
as evidence of a great match is

115
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.120
a picture taken by cell phone when a put on a good play.

116
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.720
But no such pictures were found in his cell phone.

117
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.020
Maybe he got the autograph of a player

118
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.120
that performed really well in the match.

119
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.620
Although Kunimatsu liked sports,

120
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.920
the only time he'd get carried away asking for an autograph

121
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.820
is from a tennis player, because he himself plays tennis too.

122
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.620
Golfer Sho Mikawa shoots a Chip in Eagle at the final 18th hole

123
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.520
turning the game over, and winning the match!

124
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.420
I see, so that's the story.

125
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.220
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend over to this sports cafe.

126
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.120
In order to show him the conclusive evidence.

127
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.420
He didn't imagine that the person...

128
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.720
Would be taking a picture of it on the cell phone.

129
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.320
Is there still something else?

130
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.420
I would like to start heading on home.

131
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.120
It's already past 22:00.

132
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.120
We already told you everything that we know too.

133
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.220
You did a body check a while ago too,

134
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.120
but nothing came out, right?

135
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.120
But the only customers with no alibi are you three, you see...

136
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.720
Hey, hey! You don't have proof

137
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.820
and yet you still intend to keep us here?

138
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.920
If you want to go home that badly,

139
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.020
just go.

140
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.120
Of course,

141
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.420
I'm talking about the two who aren't the culprit, though.

142
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.420
Then, does it mean you found the evidence?

143
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.220
Yeah. We've got the culprit as well as the proof.

144
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.520
Really? Conan!

145
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.920
Yes, it seems so,

146
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.620
rather, why are you asking me?

147
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.420
If anybody, you should be asking Heiji, right?

148
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.020
Well, you mentioned a while ago that you knew who the culprit is too,

149
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.420
so I had a feeling that you might also

150
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.820
know what the evidence is.

151
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.320
But I wonder, why I thought so?

152
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.220
Of course, I'd know!

153
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.720
Because the culprit

154
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.520
said something strange that even a kid like me saw through.

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.420
Something a child would even know...

156
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.220
Something strange?

157
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.820
The comments on the games the three said they watched today.

158
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.920
There was one person that said something strange, wasn't there?

159
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.020
Well, if I remember correctly...

160
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.520
Mr. Kazuo Satsumo watched Sumo wrestling and...

161
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.920
Well, it was a good match

162
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.920
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

163
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.520
so I was vexed.

164
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.420
Mr. Kengo Haruto watched beach volleyball.

165
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.120
It was a succession of close games

166
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.820
and sure was a lot of fun!

167
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.420
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

168
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.020
Mr. Takuya Kyuma watched soccer.

169
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.620
I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

170
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.920
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

171
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.220
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

172
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.920
I can't really think of something that's strange.

173
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.120
Isn't it the wardrobe malfunction of the guy who watched beach volleyball?

174
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.420
It's strange when a person goes to watch sports

175
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.220
and anticipates swimsuits falling out of place!

176
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.320
To put it frankly, that's sexual harassment!

177
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.220
It's just a joke!

178
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.820
Yeah, it's just that this man's lewd.

179
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.420
He hasn't said anything strange.

180
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.720
Well, unlike the underpants of sumo wrestling,

181
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.220
swimsuits falling out of place

182
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.120
does not seem to be considered a violation, so...

183
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.220
So, you mean that the person

184
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.020
who went to watch sumo wrestling is the culprit?

185
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.720
No, I didn't say anything about sumo underpants.

186
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.920
Goal!

187
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.120
Higo of Big Osaka,

188
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.920
despite the pressure of being the away team,

189
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.120
made a perfect goal shot!

190
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.720
Away?

191
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.320
Hold it.

192
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.420
In soccer, when a team plays on the grounds of its opponent team,

193
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.320
they aren't called visitor but rather, the away team.

194
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.420
Right, right.

195
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.020
The fans are called supporters

196
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.120
and the grounds are called pitch, right?

197
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.920
Which means...

198
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.920
Right.

199
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.020
He didn't use any of the words

200
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.320
that people who love soccer would use

201
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.320
and yet he said that he liked soccer and went to watch the match.

202
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.820
He had to lie and say so to the police.

203
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.420
Mr. Kyuna...

204
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.120
Is the only one who could be the culprit!

205
00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:29.367
Wrong!

206
00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:32.567
I just recently became a soccer fan!

207
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:34.967
So I'm still not used to...

208
00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.267
If you saw the game,

209
00:11:37.267 --> 00:11:39.567
give me the number that was on the back of the uniform that Higo,

210
00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:41.267
the one who made goal was wearing.

211
00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:43.567
Well...

212
00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:45.667
You wouldn't know

213
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:48.067
because checking the result of the game on the cell phone

214
00:11:48.067 --> 00:11:51.767
will tell you who scored at what time, but...

215
00:11:51.767 --> 00:11:55.167
the number on the back of the top of uniform is not announced.

216
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:59.467
Well, player Higo is a representative player of Big Osaka,

217
00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:03.767
so almost all the supporters are wearing his uniform.

218
00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:05.667
If you went to watch the match,

219
00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:08.967
you'd remember the number even if you didn't want to.

220
00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:10.167
Like I said,

221
00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:12.967
I went for the first time today to watch a soccer match.

222
00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:16.067
You're a baseball fan, aren't you?

223
00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.467
The terms visitor, fan and ground

224
00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.067
are all used when referring to baseball.

225
00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:24.467
Weren't you actually watching a baseball game?

226
00:12:26.067 --> 00:12:27.767
Why baseball?

227
00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:30.067
Didn't you just say that

228
00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:34.167
if Mr. Kunimatsu excitedly called his friend,

229
00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:37.567
he would've had to have watched a super entertaining game.

230
00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:40.367
If the crime was not planned,

231
00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:42.867
and the culprit held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu

232
00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:45.667
when they came into contact with each other...

233
00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.567
It would most likely be the place

234
00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:50.467
where the game that Mr. Kunimatsu got all excited about was held.

235
00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:52.467
If so,

236
00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:56.267
the culprit would have had to be at the same match too.

237
00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:00.667
The score that Mr. Kunimatsu could see was 1 to 6.

238
00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.467
And the team that kept on making errors

239
00:13:02.467 --> 00:13:04.367
finally struck a homerun at the end,

240
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.067
scoring one more point, right?

241
00:13:06.067 --> 00:13:09.367
That's far from being a great game!

242
00:13:09.367 --> 00:13:11.167
True.

243
00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:12.167
In any sports,

244
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:15.367
any game that is full of errors doesn't make any one feel good,

245
00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:17.167
whether you're on the winning side or not.

246
00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:20.067
Moreover, if the score of the game is 1-10...

247
00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:21.267
No matter how you look at it,

248
00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:24.867
it couldn't have been called a great game.

249
00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.867
But, what if you're the only one

250
00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:29.767
who got a souvenir from that game?

251
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.367
Souvenir?

252
00:13:32.267 --> 00:13:33.467
Moreover,

253
00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:36.367
if it was something that was used in the game,

254
00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:40.067
and also evidence of the great performance of the player,

255
00:13:40.067 --> 00:13:42.567
wouldn't you be super happy?

256
00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:46.167
No matter if you're not a fan of that player...

257
00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:48.367
Don't tell me that it was...

258
00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.267
the homerun ball?

259
00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.767
If so, the people in the stands have a chance to get it too!

260
00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:56.667
Then, Mr. Kunimatsu caught that homerun ball!

261
00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:58.967
Right! He caught it

262
00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:02.167
and wanted to boast about to his friend over here.

263
00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:04.567
But, it was taken away from him by Mr. Kyuma

264
00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:07.467
who followed him here from the baseball ground.

265
00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:10.367
But, how did he know

266
00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:13.667
that Mr. Kunimatsu caught the homerun ball?

267
00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:14.767
That's because of...

268
00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:17.567
Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket!

269
00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:20.067
The back pocket of Mr. Kunimatsu's pants

270
00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:22.367
were filled with his wallet, cell phone and cigarettes.

271
00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:24.867
It was bulging to the max

272
00:14:24.867 --> 00:14:29.567
because the culprit shoved all of Mr. Kunimatsu's things inside.

273
00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:32.867
He did this to camouflage Mr. Kunimatsu's pocket

274
00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:34.967
that was stretched out of shape.

275
00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:36.267
I see!

276
00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:39.367
Mr. Kunimatsu had shoved the ball

277
00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:43.067
into the pocket of his slacks.

278
00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.367
If even after the ball is removed,

279
00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.767
if the pocket is stretched out of shape,

280
00:14:46.767 --> 00:14:49.667
it'll be obvious that something was inside, right?

281
00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:51.667
I'm sure that he was afraid

282
00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:54.467
that people would realize that a baseball was inside

283
00:14:54.467 --> 00:14:56.767
from the shape of how it was stretched out.

284
00:14:56.767 --> 00:15:00.967
But, I wonder why Mr. Kunimatsu called his friend out here?

285
00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:02.467
Right.

286
00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:05.167
If he caught the homerun ball,

287
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:08.167
all he had to do was take it home and show it to him.

288
00:15:08.167 --> 00:15:12.967
It seems that Mr. Kunimatsu was staying over at his friend's besides.

289
00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:14.167
So,

290
00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.667
if I told you that the baseball that I'm holding

291
00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:21.167
is the winning ball that was used in the WBC game that Japan won,

292
00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:23.167
would you believe me?

293
00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.367
Of course, not!

294
00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:27.867
Most naturally.

295
00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:32.667
But, if there's an image that will prove that then, what?

296
00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:33.867
An image?

297
00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:34.967
Come to think of it,

298
00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:38.967
you can watch homerun balls make it into the stands on TV, right?

299
00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:39.967
Right.

300
00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:41.567
In all other sports,

301
00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:43.367
customers who are taken by TV cameras

302
00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:45.067
are probably shot coincidentally,

303
00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:46.267
but if somebody catches a homerun ball,

304
00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:48.867
it is definitely aired on TV.

305
00:15:48.867 --> 00:15:49.967
If a man wearing a cast on his arm,

306
00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.567
obviously jumps up for joy,

307
00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:53.567
they could've zoomed his face up.

308
00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:57.767
That's why Mr. Kunimatsu told his friend to come here.

309
00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:00.467
Now for today's homerun.

310
00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:01.767
So that he could show his friend

311
00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:03.967
as well as the other customers in the shop

312
00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:06.467
the sports news that is aired

313
00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:11.067
and then show them the homerun ball that he caught.

314
00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:18.067
Really! Mr. Kunimatsu caught the ball!

315
00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:20.767
Isn't the man sitting diagonally behind Mr. Kunimatsu...

316
00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:22.567
Mr. Kyuma?

317
00:16:22.567 --> 00:16:23.767
Yeah!

318
00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:28.467
I see.

319
00:16:28.467 --> 00:16:30.667
That's why just a while ago when the news

320
00:16:30.667 --> 00:16:33.167
for this professional baseball game came on,

321
00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:35.067
you shouted, right?

322
00:16:35.067 --> 00:16:38.867
Because you wanted to divert our attention from the scene.

323
00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:41.567
That's not all, is it?

324
00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:42.967
It's also because the employee

325
00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:46.067
was about to take this away, right?

326
00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:50.667
The homerun ball that you stole from Mr. Kunimatsu

327
00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:55.967
and buried into this barrel of popcorn.

328
00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:59.067
But, why did you steal it?

329
00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:02.167
Were you a fan of the player who hit that ball?

330
00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:06.567
Yeah, I really into him.

331
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.067
I'm referring to my girlfriend

332
00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:11.067
who died of an illness last night.

333
00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:14.767
She used to always talk about

334
00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:18.267
catching the homerun ball that was thrown by him.

335
00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:21.467
She kept mumbling, so until right before she passed away...

336
00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:25.567
That's why I planned to catch the ball

337
00:17:25.567 --> 00:17:29.567
and put it in her coffin before she is cremated.

338
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:33.167
So, I sat at outfield with a glove.

339
00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:36.967
Then, it really came flying and I caught the ball!

340
00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:39.467
You caught the ball?

341
00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:41.667
But Mr. Kunimatsu was the one who caught it!

342
00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.667
I really caught it!

343
00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.967
But right afterwards,

344
00:17:45.967 --> 00:17:47.867
I was squashed by the people around me

345
00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.767
and when I snapped back to myself,

346
00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:52.267
the ball was at the feet of the man with a cast on his arm,

347
00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.267
and he got hold of it.

348
00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:57.767
But there's nothing you can do about it.

349
00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:00.367
Is that why you held a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu,

350
00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:02.867
hit him and stole the ball?

351
00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:05.067
No, I told him my situation

352
00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:10.167
and asked him to give it to me repeatedly.

353
00:18:10.167 --> 00:18:12.367
But he...

354
00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:15.367
What? You again?

355
00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:17.067
Lay off!

356
00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:19.467
Please!

357
00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:22.867
Please give me that homerun ball!

358
00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:26.067
I don't know if you want to give to your girlfriend or what.

359
00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:29.267
Why should I give you this ball, stupid?

360
00:18:29.267 --> 00:18:32.667
I blew my top at hearing his remark

361
00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:36.667
and thought that I had no choice but to take it from him.

362
00:18:39.767 --> 00:18:41.567
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:42.867 --> 00:18:47.267
Please tell the one you beat up those words.

364
00:18:47.267 --> 00:18:50.867
We just got word from the hospital

365
00:18:50.867 --> 00:18:53.867
that Mr. Kunimatsu regained consciousness.

366
00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:56.167
-Really? -I'm glad!

367
00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:02.967
"Haido Central Hospital"

368
00:19:02.967 --> 00:19:05.667
For his girlfriend who died of an illness?

369
00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:08.767
So, that's why he was pleading with all his might

370
00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:12.467
for me to give him the ball?

371
00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.267
You didn't know?

372
00:19:14.267 --> 00:19:17.567
He said he explained his situation to you though.

373
00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.667
I got annoyed at his words when he said he was going to

374
00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:21.467
give it to his girlfriend as a gift.

375
00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:22.467
I seemed to have skipped the part

376
00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:25.267
where he mentioned that she died of an illness.

377
00:19:25.267 --> 00:19:26.967
How come?

378
00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:32.867
Because I just happened to be brushed off

379
00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:35.067
by a girl that I really liked!

380
00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:42.467
And about the lucky charm that was mistakenly given to you...

381
00:19:42.467 --> 00:19:45.467
I got it back from the forensic officer

382
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:47.767
and handed it over to Heiji.

383
00:19:47.767 --> 00:19:50.867
What? When and where?

384
00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:54.167
A while ago in the corridor of this hospital.

385
00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:57.267
-Idiot! -Idiot?

386
00:19:57.267 --> 00:19:59.967
Hey, could it be that

387
00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:03.067
the girl who brushed you off is...

388
00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:05.067
Kazuha, Mr. Kunimatsu?

389
00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:09.667
No, it can't be.

390
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.867
Because he went all the way back to Osaka

391
00:20:12.867 --> 00:20:14.367
just so that he could have Kazuha make him a lucky charm

392
00:20:14.367 --> 00:20:17.567
in order for him to win the tennis tournament

393
00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:19.467
and yet after coming back to Tokyo,

394
00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:21.467
he got hurt during practice.

395
00:20:21.467 --> 00:20:24.467
That goes to show that you lost the will to play.

396
00:20:24.467 --> 00:20:27.667
You looked inside lucky charm, didn't you?

397
00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:30.367
Yeah,

398
00:20:30.367 --> 00:20:33.967
the picture of that tanned boy.

399
00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:37.067
Did you know about the picture, Conan?

400
00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:38.167
Yeah.

401
00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:41.767
I heard you and Kazuha talking.

402
00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:43.467
I opened it thinking

403
00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:46.867
that the cloth of the lucky charm was pretty worn out

404
00:20:46.867 --> 00:20:49.367
for it to be brand new,

405
00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:54.567
but that boy said that it was on the handle of Kazuha's bag, so...

406
00:20:54.567 --> 00:21:00.067
Just thinking that this was Kazuha's lucky charm made me cry.

407
00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:01.867
I was thinking of telling her how I feel about her

408
00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:04.667
if I won the tennis tournament, but...

409
00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:08.567
After catching that homerun ball,

410
00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:13.467
I thought that luck was starting to turn my way,

411
00:21:13.467 --> 00:21:15.967
but I guess it was just my imagination.

412
00:21:17.167 --> 00:21:20.167
Where is that ball right now?

413
00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:22.967
The forensic officers have it for now.

414
00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:27.667
Then, can you give it to the guy who struck me later?

415
00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:29.967
And tell him that I'm sorry I was mean to him.

416
00:21:29.967 --> 00:21:31.467
Yeah.

417
00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:32.767
That's right!

418
00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:34.567
Please tell Kazuha too.

419
00:21:34.567 --> 00:21:37.767
What... what do you want me tell her?

420
00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:42.267
That I'm sorry I was mean to her.

421
00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.367
Mean?

422
00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:11.067
Please. No matter what you do, don't look inside, okay?

423
00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:14.267
Heiji!

424
00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:17.567
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

425
00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:21.867
Shoots! He's opening the lucky charm after all!

426
00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:23.967
Kazuha.

427
00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:28.167
Now I know why you've been going around desperately

428
00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:29.867
looking for the lucky charm.

429
00:23:35.067 --> 00:23:42.367
You were so much into...

430
00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:46.167
despising me to no return like this!

431
00:23:47.867 --> 00:23:49.967
What?

432
00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:52.567
What is this?

433
00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:55.667
Well, I'm mature and adult enough

434
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:59.367
that I won't get angry at something like this.

435
00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:02.267
I see.

436
00:24:02.267 --> 00:24:04.967
He was so vexed that he scribbled all over the picture.

437
00:24:07.267 --> 00:24:11.867
"Next Episode"

438
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:16.367
What's with her weird witch-like outfit?

439
00:24:16.367 --> 00:24:18.467
It's a fashion called Gos Lolita, Gos Lolita!

440
00:24:18.467 --> 00:24:20.167
It's nice after all!

441
00:24:22.467 --> 00:24:23.767
What's up?

442
00:24:23.767 --> 00:24:26.467
In... In the toilet...

443
00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:33.067
Next Conan,

444
00:24:33.067 --> 00:24:36.307
"Alibi of the Black Dress (Part 1)".

445
00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:53.969
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:53.969 --> 00:24:56.069
"Cup".

447
00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:57.869
In the next episode, I'll be challenging myself to wearing costumes!

448
00:24:57.869 --> 00:24:59.269
Just what kind of costume are planning to wear?

449
00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:00.869
A pitch black look.
