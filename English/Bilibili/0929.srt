1
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.570
It hurts...

2
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.970
Don't...

3
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.770
Don't touch it.

4
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.970
But it's just a little scrape.

5
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.770
We should put some medicine on it.

6
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.470
My apartment is nearby.

7
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.470
But...

8
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.370
Children shouldn't be so reserved.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.570
"Saki Midorikawa"

10
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.170
Give me a minute.

11
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.370
Let's see...

12
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.870
Oh, there it is.

13
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.470
Let me see it.

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.070
First we'll disinfect it.

15
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.670
This will sting a little.

16
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.470
Be strong.

17
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.070
Good girl.

18
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.770
Okay, good.

19
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770
Thanks, miss.

20
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.270
Want something to drink?

21
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.670
All I have is tea and orange juice.

22
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.170
Oh, but...

23
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.970
Orange juice then.

24
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.870
Orange juice it is.

25
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.970
Here you go.

26
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.670
Thanks for the drink!

27
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.770
She's so pretty and nice.

28
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.470
Miss.

29
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.370
You have a boyfriend.

30
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.570
Huh?

31
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.770
So they have a friend over.

32
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.770
A friend?

33
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.770
Nothing.

34
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.570
She saw me!

35
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.170
In my eyes are maximum creation.

36
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.870
My detective skills are tomorrow's reaction.

37
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.470
A dark shadow lurks in a beautiful woman's eyes!

38
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.570
It's a strange case connected to her window!

39
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.070
He sees through the one and only truth.

40
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

41
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.470
His name is Detective Conan!

42
00:04:45.112 --> 00:04:50.912
"The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 1)"

43
00:04:55.312 --> 00:04:56.912
We're really going?

44
00:04:56.912 --> 00:04:59.912
Yes! Don't you want to see her too?

45
00:04:59.912 --> 00:05:01.912
She's pretty and nice.

46
00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:04.712
Why not? Just imagine it's good for your eyes.

47
00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.712
You too?

48
00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:11.612
That's Saki Midorikawa.

49
00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.312
She really is pretty.

50
00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:17.112
Yeah.

51
00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:20.012
I heard she was good-natured and cheerful, but...

52
00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:23.112
She seems kind of lonely.

53
00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:25.312
And what's she looking at?

54
00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:31.412
Come to think of it, she was looking yesterday too.

55
00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:34.612
"Saki Midorikawa (28)"

56
00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:42.712
You go to the gym?

57
00:05:42.712 --> 00:05:44.912
For your beauty and health?

58
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:48.112
No. My body's important for work.

59
00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:50.512
What's your job?

60
00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:52.512
What do you think?

61
00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:55.812
What were you looking at from your window?

62
00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:58.212
What? Who knows?

63
00:05:58.212 --> 00:06:00.612
This is my stop. See you later.

64
00:06:04.012 --> 00:06:05.812
She's mysterious.

65
00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:07.312
Kind of, yeah.

66
00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:09.812
What's wrong with being mysterious?

67
00:06:09.812 --> 00:06:11.112
Yeah!

68
00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:13.712
Let's start looking for cases!

69
00:06:13.712 --> 00:06:14.912
Since our long weekend starts today,

70
00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:17.912
I'd like to solve a big case.

71
00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:21.412
You really think you'll find a big case just lying around?

72
00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:30.912
What's wrong with that car?

73
00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:32.312
It's out of control!

74
00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:44.812
Excuse me.

75
00:06:47.412 --> 00:06:48.912
What's going on?

76
00:06:51.112 --> 00:06:53.012
It's her.

77
00:07:03.412 --> 00:07:06.412
"Tatsuko Dojima (43), Social Critic"

78
00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:09.412
"Junnosuke Tachibana (33), Women's University Professor"

79
00:07:09.412 --> 00:07:12.312
"Michiyo Konno (24), Office Worker"

80
00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:16.212
-Is something wrong? -Is something wrong?

81
00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:23.212
Let's see...

82
00:07:23.212 --> 00:07:25.312
What a terrible accident.

83
00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:27.212
Ms. Dojima.

84
00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.412
I was so surprised by the loud noise.

85
00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:33.612
Well, we'd only get in the way here.

86
00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:36.012
You're right.

87
00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:37.912
Let's go.

88
00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:41.412
They were glaring at the nice lady.

89
00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:43.712
I wonder what that was about.

90
00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:46.012
You're here too?

91
00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:49.812
Ms. Saki, have you done anything

92
00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:51.612
to make people resent you?

93
00:07:54.912 --> 00:07:59.712
Well, when you live twenty and some years...

94
00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:02.312
Do you have some idea?

95
00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:03.812
I'm kidding.

96
00:08:03.812 --> 00:08:07.312
I haven't done anything like that.

97
00:08:07.312 --> 00:08:11.012
Oh, no. I need to get to work.

98
00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:15.712
Later.

99
00:08:15.712 --> 00:08:17.212
Work?

100
00:08:17.212 --> 00:08:19.012
I wonder what she does.

101
00:08:23.612 --> 00:08:25.512
Hey.

102
00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:28.212
Did something happen between you and that lady?

103
00:08:28.212 --> 00:08:29.412
What?

104
00:08:29.412 --> 00:08:30.612
No.

105
00:08:30.612 --> 00:08:33.012
I have no idea what you mean.

106
00:08:36.612 --> 00:08:39.212
All three of them were startled.

107
00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:41.612
And they tried to play it off by smiling.

108
00:08:41.612 --> 00:08:44.312
Something must be up.

109
00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:47.912
But I don't see how anyone could hate the nice lady.

110
00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:52.912
It's possible she incurred their hatred without realizing it.

111
00:08:52.912 --> 00:08:56.012
You're right! Like a misunder-handstand.

112
00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:57.812
You mean a misunderstanding?

113
00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:00.212
Let's check it out.

114
00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.512
I wonder who they are.

115
00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:12.512
Seems like all three of them live here.

116
00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:30.412
Hey. Excuse me.

117
00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:31.912
"Kyoichi Ogi (58), Apartment Manager" -Huh?

118
00:09:31.912 --> 00:09:35.912
What do those three people do?

119
00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:39.712
Professor Junnosuke Tachibana of unit 102

120
00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:43.112
is an English literature professor at Beika Women's University.

121
00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:48.312
Good morning!

122
00:09:48.312 --> 00:09:54.412
I told you not to come to my apartment. Right?

123
00:09:54.412 --> 00:09:58.412
I'm jealous, Professor Tachibana.

124
00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:00.012
He's so popular with his students

125
00:10:00.012 --> 00:10:03.012
because he's handsome.

126
00:10:08.012 --> 00:10:09.212
Good morning.

127
00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.012
See you later.

128
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:17.912
Ms. Michiyo Konno of unit 302 works at a trading firm.

129
00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.212
She's nothing if not earnest and polite.

130
00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:22.812
She's a good girl.

131
00:10:22.812 --> 00:10:28.612
Ms. Tatsuko Dojima of unit 1107 is a social critic.

132
00:10:28.612 --> 00:10:31.212
An information program on TV?

133
00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:32.812
That's right.

134
00:10:32.812 --> 00:10:36.412
They're going to have me on as a regular commentator.

135
00:10:36.412 --> 00:10:39.512
Someone finally realized my talent.

136
00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:41.912
Took them long enough!

137
00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:47.412
Now the entire country will know your name and face.

138
00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:51.212
Well, yeah.

139
00:10:56.412 --> 00:11:00.712
Well, I'm sure she's capable.

140
00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:04.612
Mr. Junnosuke Tachibana of unit 102.

141
00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.812
Ms. Michiyo Konno of unit 302.

142
00:11:07.812 --> 00:11:11.512
Ms. Tatsuko Dojima of unit 1107.

143
00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:15.212
A college professor, a serious office worker,

144
00:11:15.212 --> 00:11:18.312
and a social critic asked to appear on TV.

145
00:11:18.312 --> 00:11:21.012
They all sound like decent people.

146
00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:25.512
No one strange lives here.

147
00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:29.212
I guess we were worried for nothing.

148
00:11:29.212 --> 00:11:30.512
That's good.

149
00:11:30.512 --> 00:11:31.912
I hope you're right.

150
00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:35.512
The water has stopped.

151
00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:38.612
Let's keep looking for a case!

152
00:11:38.612 --> 00:11:42.212
There must be something about those three.

153
00:11:50.912 --> 00:11:52.312
Huh?

154
00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:53.912
What's wrong?

155
00:12:06.912 --> 00:12:08.312
Of course.

156
00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:10.012
Then naturally, from here...

157
00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:11.412
You can see them.

158
00:12:11.412 --> 00:12:12.812
Yeah.

159
00:12:12.812 --> 00:12:14.912
You can't see unit 1107

160
00:12:14.912 --> 00:12:17.212
but you can see unit 102 and unit 302.

161
00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:20.512
That's Professor Tachibana and Konno the office worker.

162
00:12:20.512 --> 00:12:22.112
If we can see them from here,

163
00:12:22.112 --> 00:12:24.412
then they must be visible from her apartment too.

164
00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:30.812
Maybe she was looking out her window

165
00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:33.812
and saw them doing something.

166
00:12:33.812 --> 00:12:38.212
Something they didn't want her to see.

167
00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:42.312
Ms. Saki herself probably hasn't realized what she saw.

168
00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:43.712
It's possible she does know

169
00:12:43.712 --> 00:12:46.212
and she's just playing dumb.

170
00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:50.212
What? Why would she do that?

171
00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:53.312
I'm just speaking hypothetically.

172
00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:55.512
"Mr. Tachibana"

173
00:12:56.712 --> 00:12:58.512
So she was watching.

174
00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:01.612
She was watching after all.

175
00:13:01.612 --> 00:13:03.112
"I saw it all. I'll tell. If you don't want me to tell,"

176
00:13:03.112 --> 00:13:04.912
"you'll have to pay me. Don't bother contacting the police."

177
00:13:04.912 --> 00:13:06.712
"I saw it all."

178
00:13:06.712 --> 00:13:08.512
"If you don't want me to tell..."

179
00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:11.612
"The woman who knows your secret."

180
00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:14.312
I wonder what she saw.

181
00:13:14.312 --> 00:13:17.912
We're going to ask her that right now.

182
00:13:17.912 --> 00:13:21.512
It's not clear if Ms. Saki herself is aware of what she saw.

183
00:13:21.512 --> 00:13:25.212
I sure hope none of them resent her over a misunderstanding.

184
00:13:25.212 --> 00:13:28.212
She saw something they didn't want her to see...

185
00:13:44.312 --> 00:13:45.512
That voice!

186
00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:47.012
Wasn't that her?

187
00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:03.779
Miss!

188
00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:05.179
What happened?

189
00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:06.579
A car...

190
00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.379
A car crashed into you?

191
00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:10.979
No, I was thinking

192
00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.679
and accidentally tried to cross when it was red.

193
00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.579
And a car nearly hit you.

194
00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:18.579
You should be careful.

195
00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.379
You're right.

196
00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:24.079
We thought you were attacked over a misunderstanding.

197
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.279
What?

198
00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:28.779
Ms. Saki, there's something we want to ask you.

199
00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:31.879
Sorry but my heart's still pounding.

200
00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:33.879
Ask me another time.

201
00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:45.079
She seems pretty shocked over nearly being in an accident.

202
00:14:45.079 --> 00:14:49.479
Then let's go ask them what she saw.

203
00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:51.979
There's no way they'd tell us.

204
00:14:51.979 --> 00:14:54.179
Let's take our chances.

205
00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:55.779
You heard them.

206
00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:02.679
I understand Professor Tachibana and Ms. Michiyo Konno,

207
00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:05.879
but what about Ms. Tatsuko Dojima?

208
00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:10.579
Unit 1107 isn't visible from Ms. Saki's apartment.

209
00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:13.379
There's no guarantee she saw it from her apartment.

210
00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:17.879
I see. It's possible she witnessed whatever it was from somewhere else.

211
00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:21.179
I wonder what she saw, though.

212
00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:23.079
For example...

213
00:15:23.079 --> 00:15:25.279
maybe she shoplifted something

214
00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.779
or cursed someone

215
00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.879
or killed someone!

216
00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:33.079
I'm sure she'd call the police immediately

217
00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:35.079
if she saw that.

218
00:15:35.079 --> 00:15:36.579
Normally, yeah.

219
00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:39.979
In any case, we'll know once we ask them.

220
00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:46.679
All three of them are out right now?

221
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.979
We can't take any chances if they're out.

222
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:51.279
Let's wait for them to return.

223
00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.079
Wait?

224
00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.279
Hello.

225
00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:01.179
Oh, from this afternoon...

226
00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:04.679
We're actually the Youth Detective Squad.

227
00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:06.079
That woman from this afternoon

228
00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:08.979
saw you doing something you shouldn't have, didn't she?

229
00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.679
Like what?

230
00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:19.279
We were hoping you'd tell us.

231
00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:25.079
Why would she have seen something like that?

232
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:28.279
You were glaring at her, right?

233
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:32.779
That's because she seemed like a pretty, cheerful person.

234
00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:34.279
What?

235
00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.879
I was jealous.

236
00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:39.179
I'm not pretty

237
00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:40.979
and I'm gloomy.

238
00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:43.479
So that's why?

239
00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:49.579
I definitely glared at her.

240
00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:53.479
Is it because she saw you doing something bad?

241
00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.279
Because she looked like the cousin

242
00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:59.579
I've hated since I was a child.

243
00:16:59.579 --> 00:17:01.479
So that's why?

244
00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.179
Huh?

245
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.579
Yeah, she looked like her.

246
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.179
The girl who rejected me amidst a flurry of falling leaves

247
00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:19.879
behind the school building one autumn day

248
00:17:19.879 --> 00:17:22.379
during my second year of middle school!

249
00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:25.579
Oh, it aches. The old wound aches.

250
00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.379
Like the falling maple leaves,

251
00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:30.479
so does my heart bleed!

252
00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:32.579
Farewell, children.

253
00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:34.279
I am...

254
00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:47.879
Once we got to know them,

255
00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:50.779
not a single one of them was decent.

256
00:17:54.979 --> 00:17:59.579
In other words, you imagined all of it, Conan.

257
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.379
Yeah.

258
00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:05.279
Hey, wait! You guys were worried too, right?

259
00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:07.879
You're ignoring me?

260
00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.679
I'm glad though.

261
00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:13.879
It had nothing to do with Ms. Saki.

262
00:18:13.879 --> 00:18:15.979
Let's go home.

263
00:18:21.879 --> 00:18:23.679
"Dance Pub Blue Mob"

264
00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:25.479
Good night.

265
00:18:37.379 --> 00:18:39.479
Good night.

266
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:12.479
Welcome.

267
00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:18.479
Thank you.

268
00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:31.079
It's their fault for allowing themselves to be blackmailed.

269
00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:43.679
Right?

270
00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:52.679
No one's going to kill me.

271
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.879
-See you later. -See you later.

272
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:19.279
Good morning.

273
00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:21.979
Good morning.

274
00:21:25.379 --> 00:21:29.179
Ms. Dojima, did you find what you were looking for?

275
00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:33.779
No. I thought I dropped it around here.

276
00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:02.779
She suddenly fell from up there!

277
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.079
Miss, pull yourself together.

278
00:22:05.079 --> 00:22:07.479
I called the police.

279
00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:15.879
Was there an accident?

280
00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:22.379
Miss!

281
00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:24.979
She's dead?

282
00:22:24.979 --> 00:22:27.179
No way... What's going on?

283
00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:30.979
What happened?

284
00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:56.179
"Next Episode" -There were scratch marks

285
00:23:56.179 --> 00:23:57.779
on the railing on the roof.

286
00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:00.979
We also found a woman's earring on the ground.

287
00:24:00.979 --> 00:24:03.979
But who and why?

288
00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:07.579
A car almost struck Ms. Saki at an intersection yesterday.

289
00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:11.379
I thought I saw him from my window.

290
00:24:11.379 --> 00:24:13.579
There's only signs of water on this side.

291
00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:18.379
She didn't come to the roof.

292
00:24:18.879 --> 00:24:20.379
Next Conan,

293
00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:24.379
"The Woman Standing by the Window (Part 2)"

294
00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:27.322
Next Conan's Hint:

295
00:24:27.322 --> 00:24:29.522
"Gloves"

296
00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:30.722
So we weren't imagining things.

297
00:24:30.722 --> 00:24:32.122
Doesn't look like it.

298
00:24:32.122 --> 00:24:33.722
Miss...
