1
00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.058
I'm sorry for being late.

2
00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.458
You're late.

3
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:18.558
For you.

4
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.258
What's this?

5
00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.758
Hey.

6
00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:31.158
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

7
00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.458
I'm asking you, what is it?

8
00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:35.958
When I get a hold of all of them, I'll contact you.

9
00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.058
I promise.

10
00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:39.058
Yumi.

11
00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:41.058
Yumi.

12
00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.158
Yumi.

13
00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:46.358
Assistant Inspector, Yumi Miyamoto!

14
00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:52.458
I wish you wouldn't snooze on duty!

15
00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:09.458
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

16
00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:11.158
are slashed by the light of deduction.

17
00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:13.158
Assistant Inspector Yumi Miyamoto's secret?

18
00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.358
A new character, who makes sharp deductions appear!

19
00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:16.958
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.758
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:21.358
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:58.946
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 1)"

23
00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:05.246
Yumi. Did something happen last night?

24
00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:06.346
Sorry.

25
00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:08.246
Last night I played overnight mahjong

26
00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.646
with the officers at Marubo.

27
00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:12.346
Overnight mahjong isn't good,

28
00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:13.946
for work or for your skin!

29
00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:15.446
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:19.246
By the way, what did you mean by getting hold of all seven?

31
00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:21.146
Did I say something like that?

32
00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:22.946
Yes, you were talking in your sleep,

33
00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:25.646
"Just when are you going to get a hold of all that?" like so.

34
00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:29.846
It's something that my ex used to say.

35
00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:31.246
When I told him that I wanted to break up

36
00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:32.946
because I'm going to become a police officer,

37
00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.746
he pushed a strange envelope at me

38
00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.246
and said, "Wait, until I get a hold of all seven."

39
00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:40.246
But, no matter how long I waited,

40
00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.646
he never got in contact with me again,

41
00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:42.946
so I brushed him off!

42
00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:44.146
I told him off saying that I'm not waiting anymore,

43
00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:45.546
I don't want to see his face,

44
00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:47.446
or hear his voice ever again!

45
00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:49.846
Where did you get to know him?

46
00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:52.746
On the train when I was a university student.

47
00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:53.946
He was living in a good district

48
00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:55.646
so I guess he was some rich dude or something?

49
00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:59.146
But, I wonder what he meant by the "seven" whatever's?

50
00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.146
Beats me.

51
00:04:00.146 --> 00:04:01.546
I'll bet it's just some nonsensical.

52
00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.946
Wasn't he a sailor or something?

53
00:04:04.946 --> 00:04:07.946
North Atlantic, South Atlantic,

54
00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:10.846
North Pacific, South Pacific,

55
00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:13.846
the Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Ocean.

56
00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:15.746
Maybe he wanted you to wait for him

57
00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:17.146
until he completed crossing all 7 seas!

58
00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:19.246
Conan?

59
00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.346
Was he tanned?

60
00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:25.646
No, he was pale and looked like an introverted freeloader to me.

61
00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:28.146
He seemed to go out a lot, but it was on an irregular basis

62
00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:31.146
and it didn't look as if he was working.

63
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:34.146
Maybe he was going around praying to the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune"?

64
00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:37.446
Is that when you go around to shrines and temples

65
00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:40.346
on New Year's day collecting the dolls of the 7 gods?

66
00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.146
My mother does that every year!

67
00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.446
Those are easy to get a hold of, no?

68
00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.246
One other thing thinkable is

69
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.346
"The seven deadly sins".

70
00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:55.846
Pride, envy, wrath, sloth,

71
00:04:55.846 --> 00:04:59.746
greed, gluttony, and lust.

72
00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:02.646
What good is there in collecting stuff like that?

73
00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:06.146
Maybe the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune" is highly likely.

74
00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:08.646
It was Christmas when he said that too.

75
00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:13.146
I mean, why do I have to tell you guys something like this?

76
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.246
Geez.

77
00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:17.346
And, what did you do with that envelope?

78
00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:19.546
I don't know!

79
00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:22.346
You're the one who bumped into me, no?

80
00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:23.846
What? Hey!

81
00:05:23.846 --> 00:05:24.946
What's your trip?

82
00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:26.246
Reverse a bit, will you?

83
00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:28.046
Will you park on the shoulder?

84
00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:29.246
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.746
Hey, just what do you two think you're doing?

86
00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:44.546
Yumi had a boyfriend?

87
00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:51.046
I don't feel like we've met for the first time.

88
00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:53.246
Maybe you're...

89
00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:56.446
Yes.

90
00:05:56.446 --> 00:06:01.146
The one who gave me a parking ticket at Haidocho the other day.

91
00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:04.846
Chiba is completely forgotten me.

92
00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:09.046
You shouldn't cross the street!

93
00:06:09.046 --> 00:06:11.746
Once you break the rule and let yourself go,

94
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.646
it turns into a habit, you know!

95
00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:16.646
A habit is hard to get rid of, once it becomes a habit!

96
00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:19.446
Don't tell me you don't know something basic like that?

97
00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:33.746
It's from Sakurako.

98
00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:37.646
What? I'm on duty now.

99
00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:39.946
What? Somebody is dead?

100
00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.946
But, that's not in my line of work.

101
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:46.746
Is it nearby?

102
00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:47.746
Yes.

103
00:06:52.146 --> 00:06:53.846
Hey, wait a second.

104
00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.946
No matter what you do, don't touch anything.

105
00:06:55.946 --> 00:06:56.946
I'll be right over.

106
00:06:56.946 --> 00:06:59.146
What's with those children? They went charging off.

107
00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.446
I just got a call from a friend of mine saying

108
00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:03.246
that someone's been killed.

109
00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:04.246
Where?

110
00:07:04.246 --> 00:07:07.346
At Chateau Beika Mansion near here.

111
00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:10.646
Chateau Beika Mansion?

112
00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.846
Just as I thought it was here after all.

113
00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:17.846
Have you been here before?

114
00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:19.146
No!

115
00:07:19.146 --> 00:07:22.546
Never to a mansion like this where only rich people seem to be living.

116
00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:25.846
Ms. Miyamoto.

117
00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.646
Long time no see.

118
00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.146
Hello.

119
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:33.646
You've been here before, after all.

120
00:07:33.646 --> 00:07:34.746
Shut up!

121
00:07:39.046 --> 00:07:41.246
And what floor did you say it was?

122
00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:42.346
The 18th floor.

123
00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:46.546
No joke. No joke.

124
00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:49.146
"Itami"

125
00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:51.546
Next door?

126
00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:56.246
Police ladies of the mini police car, you're here too.

127
00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:59.846
Aren't you both in the traffic control division, Yumi?

128
00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.146
I thought that cases like this were not handled by you.

129
00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:03.846
You can leave it to us!

130
00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:06.146
You're not supposed to handle this either!

131
00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:08.746
I just came to take you people back.

132
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:11.946
Conan's not around.

133
00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:12.946
He's inside!

134
00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:15.146
He told us to wait here.

135
00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:17.446
No joke! He's inside?

136
00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:21.546
What's this, what's with you, sonny?

137
00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:23.546
Is he someone you know, Sakurako?

138
00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:24.746
Yes.

139
00:08:24.746 --> 00:08:26.946
If I remember correctly, his name is...

140
00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:28.746
Conan Edogawa!

141
00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:31.946
I met you before at a crime scene, didn't I?

142
00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.046
Ms. Sakurako Yonehara.

143
00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:37.646
Yes. During the optical illusion case.

144
00:08:37.646 --> 00:08:42.346
Sonny, your way of talking has changed from a while ago?

145
00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:44.346
Because when you were with everybody,

146
00:08:44.346 --> 00:08:46.646
you were talking like any child would.

147
00:08:46.646 --> 00:08:49.146
But now, you sound just like a detective.

148
00:08:49.146 --> 00:08:50.946
Oh, well, you see...

149
00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:52.346
"Sakurako Yonehara (23)" -I've started working here

150
00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:55.746
"Housemaid" -as a maid from last week,

151
00:08:55.746 --> 00:08:57.746
and I'm messed up in something like this again.

152
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.046
Sakurako.

153
00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:00.246
Naeko!

154
00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:01.346
I'm sorry!

155
00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:04.646
I panicked and impulsively called you, Naeko.

156
00:09:04.646 --> 00:09:05.746
Everything will be okay.

157
00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:08.346
I already contacted the officers.

158
00:09:08.346 --> 00:09:09.546
Well...

159
00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:13.546
no matter how you look at it, it doesn't look to be a murder case.

160
00:09:13.546 --> 00:09:16.346
But, would you please tell me about it?

161
00:09:16.346 --> 00:09:17.946
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:09:17.946 --> 00:09:20.046
The fact is, about an hour ago,

163
00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:23.246
I had it out with my wife, Chiyoko.

164
00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.846
I decided to go out with Sakurako here

165
00:09:25.846 --> 00:09:30.246
to give my wife some time to get cooled off,

166
00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:31.646
"Naganobu Itami (52)" -isn't that right?

167
00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:32.646
"Resident of the mansion" -Yes.

168
00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:35.646
I didn't finish buying ingredients for dinner tonight yet

169
00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.046
so I went to a supermarket nearby with Mr. Itami.

170
00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.946
My wife sprained her wrist

171
00:09:40.946 --> 00:09:42.346
and ended up not being able to do housework,

172
00:09:42.346 --> 00:09:45.146
so I had no choice but to hire a maid.

173
00:09:45.146 --> 00:09:47.046
Since I didn't want her to get hysterical again

174
00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:50.546
and aggravate her wound even more.

175
00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:53.446
Besides, my eye turned out this way too so...

176
00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:56.346
What happened to your eye?

177
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.146
When my wife gets angry she has a habit of throwing things.

178
00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:02.746
And because of this, I asked for a day off today.

179
00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:04.146
And when you came back,

180
00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:06.346
you found that your wife had committed suicide?

181
00:10:06.346 --> 00:10:10.046
No, I finished shopping in about 30 minutes

182
00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:11.846
and came back with Mr. Itami.

183
00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:13.646
When I opened the front door,

184
00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:17.646
I heard the sound of this bedroom door slam shut.

185
00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:20.946
So, I think she was still alive then.

186
00:10:20.946 --> 00:10:24.046
I did knock on the door and called out to her.

187
00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:25.546
But since there was no answer,

188
00:10:25.546 --> 00:10:28.146
I thought she was still angry.

189
00:10:28.146 --> 00:10:31.146
That's why I had Sakurako make me coffee

190
00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:34.046
and after we talked about trivial things for about 30 minutes,

191
00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:36.846
I knocked on the door again

192
00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:39.446
and went inside...

193
00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:42.746
this is what I saw.

194
00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:47.046
I had no idea that my wife was so deadlocked over a brawl like that.

195
00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.446
I see.

196
00:10:49.546 --> 00:10:50.846
And?

197
00:10:51.946 --> 00:10:54.746
What about this memo at your wife's feet?

198
00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:57.746
It's a will written by her about how worried she is

199
00:10:57.746 --> 00:11:01.146
about my wound, our son's exam

200
00:11:01.146 --> 00:11:04.846
and about our niece's Shichigosan celebration.

201
00:11:04.846 --> 00:11:07.646
She put so much thought into writing these.

202
00:11:07.646 --> 00:11:11.646
She apologized for crossing over leaving us all behind.

203
00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:15.946
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

204
00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:17.646
No.

205
00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:19.546
It could be homicide, you know?

206
00:11:22.046 --> 00:11:26.146
That will was written on the memo pad that was on the desk,

207
00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:28.546
torn off and placed here, right?

208
00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:30.546
But, look. If you take a good look,

209
00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:34.346
only the part by the two lower holes of the paper are left

210
00:11:34.346 --> 00:11:36.746
on the metal binding.

211
00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:39.946
But as to the will, three holes are torn off.

212
00:11:39.946 --> 00:11:41.946
Don't you think that's strange?

213
00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:43.046
No joke?

214
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:45.546
True.

215
00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:46.746
Besides,

216
00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:49.646
the words on that will are pretty distorted.

217
00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:54.746
See! It seems that your wife used to leave memos behind on the pad,

218
00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:59.146
but she always wrote only her name at the end.

219
00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:03.646
But in that will only, she wrote her full name.

220
00:12:03.646 --> 00:12:06.946
It looks strange to me, you know?

221
00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:08.646
True.

222
00:12:08.646 --> 00:12:11.946
Was the door to the entrance locked?

223
00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:15.946
Yes. I opened it, but it was definitely locked.

224
00:12:15.946 --> 00:12:18.146
Then, who has the spare key?

225
00:12:18.146 --> 00:12:23.046
Just my wife, Sakurako, my son, Yasuie and I.

226
00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:24.946
Where is your son now?

227
00:12:24.946 --> 00:12:27.546
I think he's at driving school.

228
00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:30.646
He mentioned that his driving test was coming up soon.

229
00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:34.146
And I heard that there's another spare

230
00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:36.446
in the mailbox on the first floor too.

231
00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:40.046
That mailbox is locked, I presume?

232
00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:41.046
Yes.

233
00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:45.346
It's the dial type and not easy for outsiders to open.

234
00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:47.846
7 to the left, 2 to the right,

235
00:12:47.846 --> 00:12:50.046
and 3 to the left.

236
00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:54.346
There's one other person who knows the numbers to the dial.

237
00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:55.346
What?

238
00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:59.446
When I was taking out mails from that mailbox yesterday,

239
00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.646
I was in a fix

240
00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.246
because I forgot the memo with the numbers to the dial written on it,

241
00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:04.646
but a man told me what the numbers were!

242
00:13:04.646 --> 00:13:07.746
Why do you know the number?

243
00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:11.246
Didn't you drop a memo with the numbers of the dial on it,

244
00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:14.146
the other day when you tried to open the mailbox?

245
00:13:14.146 --> 00:13:16.346
I was the one who picked that memo up,

246
00:13:16.346 --> 00:13:17.946
but doesn't it ring a bell?

247
00:13:17.946 --> 00:13:23.846
But I don't think you had even a second to look at it.

248
00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:26.646
That much time is more than enough for me.

249
00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:30.046
I'm good at remembering things like this.

250
00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:31.346
I'm number one in Japan.

251
00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.846
No, maybe I'm the best in the world.

252
00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:38.646
Is he a resident of this condo?

253
00:13:38.646 --> 00:13:40.846
Yes. He lives next door.

254
00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:44.446
He's an unshaven, shabby guy.

255
00:13:44.446 --> 00:13:46.646
If I remember correctly, his name is...

256
00:13:46.646 --> 00:13:49.046
If he lives next door, it's faster if we just go there!

257
00:13:49.046 --> 00:13:50.846
-Yes. -Oh, hey.

258
00:13:53.846 --> 00:13:55.446
Hey, wait.

259
00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:00.946
Yes, what is it?

260
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:07.246
Yumi, my baby!

261
00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:10.346
Yumi, my baby?

262
00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:14.346
-Do you know him? -Yes.

263
00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:18.846
He's my "ex".

264
00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:35.939
Then, let me get this straight.

265
00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:37.839
In order to give your wife some time to cool down

266
00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:39.939
after you had it out with her,

267
00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:42.439
you left to go to the supermarket together

268
00:14:42.439 --> 00:14:44.739
with the maid for 30 minutes.

269
00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:47.939
After you returned home and opened the door

270
00:14:47.939 --> 00:14:51.439
you heard the door of this bedroom close

271
00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:54.339
and called out to her but since there was no answer

272
00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:57.239
you decided to wait another 30 minutes.

273
00:14:57.239 --> 00:14:59.439
Therefore, you killed time together with the maid in the kitchen,

274
00:14:59.439 --> 00:15:01.139
chatting and having coffee.

275
00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.539
Then, you went to knock on the door again,

276
00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:05.039
and went inside this time.

277
00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:07.939
That's when you found that your wife had hung herself

278
00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:09.739
with an electric cord.

279
00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:10.939
Yes.

280
00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:13.539
By the way, what did you fight over?

281
00:15:13.539 --> 00:15:17.839
-Stocks. -Stocks... did you say?

282
00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.939
My wife was hooked on stocks recently,

283
00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:23.539
and when I cautioned her about it she got hysterical.

284
00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:25.339
I see.

285
00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:28.939
Well, my son who'll be graduating university soon

286
00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:30.839
hasn't found a job yet.

287
00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:34.239
I think she'd been feeling a lot of stress too.

288
00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:36.139
You have a son?

289
00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:37.339
Yes.

290
00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:40.939
Ever since he began living on his own near the university,

291
00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:43.239
he doesn't come around much though.

292
00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:46.739
But, he called the other day.

293
00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:48.039
Saying that he wanted Mr. Itami to buy him a car

294
00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:50.139
after he gets his driver's license,

295
00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:53.639
and that he'll be bringing over the car catalogs.

296
00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.739
Catalogs?

297
00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:57.839
But, Mrs. Itami was against it saying that he's not even employed yet

298
00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.739
so there's no need for a car.

299
00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:02.439
She shouted at him and hung up.

300
00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:04.539
You're the one that was at the scene

301
00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.639
during the optical illusion case.

302
00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:11.139
Yes, sir. I ended up like this again. This is my work place.

303
00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.239
Please at all costs don't be a person

304
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.539
who summons death like Mr. Mouri does.

305
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:17.139
Inspector.

306
00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:21.039
But, why was this incident reported by Ms. Miike

307
00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.639
of the traffic control division?

308
00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:24.639
That's because...

309
00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.139
Sakurako saw the corpse

310
00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:31.339
and Ms. Naeko Miike, a police woman who is also her friend.

311
00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:34.739
Well, I came here because I happened to hear about it too!

312
00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:36.339
Conan?

313
00:16:37.339 --> 00:16:41.139
No wonder all the children were at the entrance.

314
00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:45.139
But, Conan, how did you get inside this condo?

315
00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:48.639
We came in together with a person who had a child with her,

316
00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:51.739
making believe that we were that child's friends.

317
00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:55.239
-That's not too cool. -Geez.

318
00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:59.239
Naeko, are you classmates with Sakurako?

319
00:16:59.239 --> 00:17:03.639
No, she's a childhood friend who lived near me!

320
00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:07.539
I'm a year older than Sakurako.

321
00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.739
Well, at any rate,

322
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:15.239
the only people here were you, your wife and the maid?

323
00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:19.239
Yes. I haven't seen my son for over a year.

324
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.739
If so, who's the man that is standing behind you, Yumi?

325
00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:26.239
He's...

326
00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:31.139
I live next door and I'm Yumi baby's...

327
00:17:31.139 --> 00:17:33.839
"Shukichi Haneda (28)" -I'm going with Yumi

328
00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.639
"Resident of the mansion" -and my name is Shukichi Haneda!

329
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:36.839
What?

330
00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:39.039
I'm his ex!

331
00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.439
I've already broken up with him though!

332
00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:45.639
But, what brings your boyfriend here?

333
00:17:45.639 --> 00:17:47.939
My ex-boyfriend said that

334
00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:50.439
he remembered the number to the dial of the mailbox

335
00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:51.939
where the spare key was inside,

336
00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:53.639
so I dragged him out here!

337
00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:57.039
You look familiar too.

338
00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.039
Now that you mentioned it,

339
00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:01.039
I think I've heard that name somewhere before too.

340
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:04.339
Don't tell me that you saw him on a fugitive want list or something.

341
00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:07.639
Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:18:07.639 --> 00:18:11.339
Well, but there was a will at the feet of the corpse too.

343
00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:13.839
I guess we could conclude this to be suicide.

344
00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:19.239
But Conan mentioned that it may not be suicide.

345
00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:20.339
What?

346
00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:27.239
I see. True!

347
00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:30.939
This will and the place where this letter was torn off doesn't match!

348
00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:32.939
What's written on the will is,

349
00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:35.439
I'm sorry for wounding you.

350
00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:38.239
I pray you'll get well soon.

351
00:18:38.239 --> 00:18:40.639
Yasuei, good luck in your exam.

352
00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:42.839
I'm sure you'll pass it.

353
00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:45.239
When celebrating Ichiko's Shichigosan,

354
00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:48.139
please let her wear my dressy kimono.

355
00:18:48.139 --> 00:18:49.339
Please forgive me for crossing over

356
00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.239
before all of you and leaving you behind.

357
00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:53.139
Chiyoko Itami.

358
00:18:54.139 --> 00:18:57.239
Is there anything suspicious about the contents?

359
00:18:57.239 --> 00:18:58.739
No.

360
00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:03.839
As you can see, my eye is bruised from the ashtray

361
00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:05.839
that my wife threw at me last night.

362
00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:07.339
My son Yasuie did mention

363
00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:11.239
that his driving license test was coming up soon.

364
00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:13.939
And, my younger sister's daughter

365
00:19:13.939 --> 00:19:16.239
is going to be seven years old this year.

366
00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:18.339
So, she's celebrating Shichigosan.

367
00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:20.439
Why did your wife throw an ashtray at you, though?

368
00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:23.539
My wife has a habit of throwing things when she gets angry.

369
00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:25.939
I saw her do it too.

370
00:19:25.939 --> 00:19:27.239
That's why I think that the cell phone

371
00:19:27.239 --> 00:19:28.639
that was found on the floor in front of the bedroom

372
00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:30.939
was thrown there by Mrs. Itami too.

373
00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:33.839
The cell phone was found on the floor?

374
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:34.939
Yes.

375
00:19:34.939 --> 00:19:36.639
When I came back from shopping,

376
00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:40.639
and first knocked on the bedroom door I noticed it there.

377
00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:42.639
Where is that cell phone?

378
00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:45.339
I have it with me

379
00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:48.439
I was going to give it back to my wife when was in a better mood.

380
00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:54.439
There is no outgoing or incoming call history today.

381
00:19:54.439 --> 00:19:56.139
If this were a homicide,

382
00:19:56.139 --> 00:19:59.039
I thought it may have been used for some trick or something but...

383
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:01.739
It seems to have nothing to do with the case.

384
00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:05.739
So, Mrs. Itami didn't commit suicide after all.

385
00:20:05.739 --> 00:20:07.139
After all?

386
00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.639
Because Mrs. Itami used to say

387
00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:13.739
that she was loved by God and that she was a lucky person!

388
00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:15.739
A lucky person?

389
00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:16.939
Which means?

390
00:20:16.939 --> 00:20:21.539
I think she's referring to the time several years ago,

391
00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:25.639
when the plane that she was on board was about to crash.

392
00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:27.939
Then, were you on board that plane too?

393
00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:31.339
No. I was scheduled to ride it too but,

394
00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:35.139
I broke my leg skiing just before I was scheduled to board the plane.

395
00:20:35.139 --> 00:20:37.039
That's why it's hard to believe

396
00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:40.339
that Mrs. Itami would commit suicide over a simple brawl.

397
00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.039
But, that was more like my wife's habit to say things like that.

398
00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:47.239
Besides, something's not right about that will too.

399
00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:48.539
What's not right?

400
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:52.039
Mrs. Itami caught a cold when she was 7 years old

401
00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:54.039
and wasn't able to celebrate Shichigosan

402
00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:56.039
and she mentioned that until the Coming of Age Day,

403
00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:59.039
she didn't have any opportunity to wear a kimono.

404
00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.939
I see.

405
00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:11.539
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

406
00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:14.739
Just what're you talking about, Chukichi?

407
00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:17.139
She's saying that she didn't make a kimono!

408
00:21:17.139 --> 00:21:19.239
I keep telling you, I'm Shukichi!

409
00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:21.139
How many times do I have to keep telling you that it's not Chukichi!

410
00:21:21.139 --> 00:21:23.639
Chukichi is a better name for you!

411
00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:26.139
Looking shabby like that.

412
00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:29.039
The one prepared move?

413
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.039
If I'm not mistaken...

414
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:33.839
I get it.

415
00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:35.339
If from that point of view,

416
00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:38.039
the unnaturalness of that will is...

417
00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:41.439
Although it's not enough to see the entire picture yet,

418
00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:44.539
if I take it move by move in due order...

419
00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:48.639
Right?

420
00:21:48.639 --> 00:21:50.739
Mr. Shukichi Haneda?

421
00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.339
So, this will is quite questionable after all.

422
00:21:56.339 --> 00:21:59.939
Yes, I guess we'll need to analyze the handwriting.

423
00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:02.239
Yeah. Moreover,

424
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.539
it bothers me to think that a person who has hurt her wrist

425
00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:07.539
would choose a method such as suicide by hanging herself

426
00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:11.039
which is a difficult feat to do with one hand.

427
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.639
True.

428
00:22:12.639 --> 00:22:14.439
Inspector Megure!

429
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:16.939
We got a testimony of a suspicious character being seen!

430
00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:17.939
What?

431
00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:21.939
According to the concierge on the first floor,

432
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:25.039
a suspicious looking person wearing a cap, mask and glasses,

433
00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:27.339
as if hiding his face went in and out of the condo!

434
00:23:53.239 --> 00:23:54.239
Officer Chiba!

435
00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:57.739
I'm not letting you go!

436
00:23:57.739 --> 00:23:59.939
I'm not anybody suspicious.

437
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:02.939
Like they say, perps return to the scene of the crime.

438
00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:05.239
Before finding Mrs. Itami's cell phone,

439
00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:10.039
Sakurako you said that you heard the bedroom door close, right?

440
00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:11.339
Yes.

441
00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:13.039
I can't tell you.

442
00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.239
It's a woman, isn't it?

443
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:16.939
I'll bet you were meeting some woman somewhere!

444
00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:18.239
Next Conan,

445
00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:22.139
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 2)"

446
00:24:37.939 --> 00:24:40.439
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:42.539
"Cell phone cover".

448
00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:44.139
Chukichi and Yumi baby.

449
00:24:44.139 --> 00:24:45.139
You're interested in them.

450
00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:47.139
A new couple has come to be again.
