1
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,058
I'm sorry for being late.

2
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,458
You're late.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,558
For you.

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,258
What's this?

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,758
Hey.

6
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:31,158
Don't open it until I get a hold of all seven of them.

7
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:33,458
I'm asking you, what is it?

8
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,958
When I get a hold of all of them, I'll contact you.

9
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,058
I promise.

10
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,058
Yumi.

11
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:41,058
Yumi.

12
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,158
Yumi.

13
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,358
Assistant Inspector, Yumi Miyamoto!

14
00:00:48,158 --> 00:00:52,458
I wish you wouldn't snooze on duty!

15
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,458
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

16
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,158
are slashed by the light of deduction.

17
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,158
Assistant Inspector Yumi Miyamoto's secret?

18
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,358
A new character, who makes sharp deductions appear!

19
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,958
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,758
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,358
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:58,946
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 1)"

23
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,246
Yumi. Did something happen last night?

24
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:06,346
Sorry.

25
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,246
Last night I played overnight mahjong

26
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,646
with the officers at Marubo.

27
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:12,346
Overnight mahjong isn't good,

28
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:13,946
for work or for your skin!

29
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,446
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:19,246
By the way, what did you mean by getting hold of all seven?

31
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,146
Did I say something like that?

32
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:22,946
Yes, you were talking in your sleep,

33
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,646
"Just when are you going to get a hold of all that?" like so.

34
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,846
It's something that my ex used to say.

35
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,246
When I told him that I wanted to break up

36
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,946
because I'm going to become a police officer,

37
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,746
he pushed a strange envelope at me

38
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:37,246
and said, "Wait, until I get a hold of all seven."

39
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,246
But, no matter how long I waited,

40
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:41,646
he never got in contact with me again,

41
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:42,946
so I brushed him off!

42
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,146
I told him off saying that I'm not waiting anymore,

43
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,546
I don't want to see his face,

44
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:47,446
or hear his voice ever again!

45
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,846
Where did you get to know him?

46
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,746
On the train when I was a university student.

47
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:53,946
He was living in a good district

48
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,646
so I guess he was some rich dude or something?

49
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:59,146
But, I wonder what he meant by the "seven" whatever's?

50
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,146
Beats me.

51
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,546
I'll bet it's just some nonsensical.

52
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,946
Wasn't he a sailor or something?

53
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,946
North Atlantic, South Atlantic,

54
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,846
North Pacific, South Pacific,

55
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:13,846
the Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Antarctic Ocean.

56
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,746
Maybe he wanted you to wait for him

57
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,146
until he completed crossing all 7 seas!

58
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,246
Conan?

59
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,346
Was he tanned?

60
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:25,646
No, he was pale and looked like an introverted freeloader to me.

61
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:28,146
He seemed to go out a lot, but it was on an irregular basis

62
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:31,146
and it didn't look as if he was working.

63
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,146
Maybe he was going around praying to the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune"?

64
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:37,446
Is that when you go around to shrines and temples

65
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:40,346
on New Year's day collecting the dolls of the 7 gods?

66
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,146
My mother does that every year!

67
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:45,446
Those are easy to get a hold of, no?

68
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:48,246
One other thing thinkable is

69
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,346
"The seven deadly sins".

70
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:55,846
Pride, envy, wrath, sloth,

71
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:59,746
greed, gluttony, and lust.

72
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:02,646
What good is there in collecting stuff like that?

73
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:06,146
Maybe the "Seven Deities of Good Fortune" is highly likely.

74
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:08,646
It was Christmas when he said that too.

75
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:13,146
I mean, why do I have to tell you guys something like this?

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,246
Geez.

77
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:17,346
And, what did you do with that envelope?

78
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:19,546
I don't know!

79
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,346
You're the one who bumped into me, no?

80
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,846
What? Hey!

81
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:24,946
What's your trip?

82
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:26,246
Reverse a bit, will you?

83
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,046
Will you park on the shoulder?

84
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:29,246
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,746
Hey, just what do you two think you're doing?

86
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:44,546
Yumi had a boyfriend?

87
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:51,046
I don't feel like we've met for the first time.

88
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,246
Maybe you're...

89
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:56,446
Yes.

90
00:05:56,446 --> 00:06:01,146
The one who gave me a parking ticket at Haidocho the other day.

91
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,846
Chiba is completely forgotten me.

92
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,046
You shouldn't cross the street!

93
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:11,746
Once you break the rule and let yourself go,

94
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,646
it turns into a habit, you know!

95
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:16,646
A habit is hard to get rid of, once it becomes a habit!

96
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,446
Don't tell me you don't know something basic like that?

97
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:33,746
It's from Sakurako.

98
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:37,646
What? I'm on duty now.

99
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,946
What? Somebody is dead?

100
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,946
But, that's not in my line of work.

101
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,746
Is it nearby?

102
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:47,746
Yes.

103
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,846
Hey, wait a second.

104
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,946
No matter what you do, don't touch anything.

105
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:56,946
I'll be right over.

106
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,146
What's with those children? They went charging off.

107
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,446
I just got a call from a friend of mine saying

108
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,246
that someone's been killed.

109
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,246
Where?

110
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,346
At Chateau Beika Mansion near here.

111
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:10,646
Chateau Beika Mansion?

112
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:14,846
Just as I thought it was here after all.

113
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,846
Have you been here before?

114
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:19,146
No!

115
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:22,546
Never to a mansion like this where only rich people seem to be living.

116
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:25,846
Ms. Miyamoto.

117
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,646
Long time no see.

118
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:31,146
Hello.

119
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,646
You've been here before, after all.

120
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:34,746
Shut up!

121
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,246
And what floor did you say it was?

122
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,346
The 18th floor.

123
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,546
No joke. No joke.

124
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,146
"Itami"

125
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,546
Next door?

126
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:56,246
Police ladies of the mini police car, you're here too.

127
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:59,846
Aren't you both in the traffic control division, Yumi?

128
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,146
I thought that cases like this were not handled by you.

129
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,846
You can leave it to us!

130
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:06,146
You're not supposed to handle this either!

131
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,746
I just came to take you people back.

132
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,946
Conan's not around.

133
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:12,946
He's inside!

134
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,146
He told us to wait here.

135
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,446
No joke! He's inside?

136
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:21,546
What's this, what's with you, sonny?

137
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,546
Is he someone you know, Sakurako?

138
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,746
Yes.

139
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,946
If I remember correctly, his name is...

140
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:28,746
Conan Edogawa!

141
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,946
I met you before at a crime scene, didn't I?

142
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:34,046
Ms. Sakurako Yonehara.

143
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,646
Yes. During the optical illusion case.

144
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:42,346
Sonny, your way of talking has changed from a while ago?

145
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,346
Because when you were with everybody,

146
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:46,646
you were talking like any child would.

147
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,146
But now, you sound just like a detective.

148
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,946
Oh, well, you see...

149
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,346
"Sakurako Yonehara (23)" -I've started working here

150
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:55,746
"Housemaid" -as a maid from last week,

151
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,746
and I'm messed up in something like this again.

152
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,046
Sakurako.

153
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,246
Naeko!

154
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,346
I'm sorry!

155
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:04,646
I panicked and impulsively called you, Naeko.

156
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:05,746
Everything will be okay.

157
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,346
I already contacted the officers.

158
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,546
Well...

159
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:13,546
no matter how you look at it, it doesn't look to be a murder case.

160
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,346
But, would you please tell me about it?

161
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:17,946
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:20,046
The fact is, about an hour ago,

163
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,246
I had it out with my wife, Chiyoko.

164
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,846
I decided to go out with Sakurako here

165
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:30,246
to give my wife some time to get cooled off,

166
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:31,646
"Naganobu Itami (52)" -isn't that right?

167
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,646
"Resident of the mansion" -Yes.

168
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,646
I didn't finish buying ingredients for dinner tonight yet

169
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:38,046
so I went to a supermarket nearby with Mr. Itami.

170
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,946
My wife sprained her wrist

171
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,346
and ended up not being able to do housework,

172
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,146
so I had no choice but to hire a maid.

173
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:47,046
Since I didn't want her to get hysterical again

174
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:50,546
and aggravate her wound even more.

175
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:53,446
Besides, my eye turned out this way too so...

176
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,346
What happened to your eye?

177
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,146
When my wife gets angry she has a habit of throwing things.

178
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:02,746
And because of this, I asked for a day off today.

179
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,146
And when you came back,

180
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,346
you found that your wife had committed suicide?

181
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:10,046
No, I finished shopping in about 30 minutes

182
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,846
and came back with Mr. Itami.

183
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,646
When I opened the front door,

184
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,646
I heard the sound of this bedroom door slam shut.

185
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:20,946
So, I think she was still alive then.

186
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:24,046
I did knock on the door and called out to her.

187
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,546
But since there was no answer,

188
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,146
I thought she was still angry.

189
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,146
That's why I had Sakurako make me coffee

190
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:34,046
and after we talked about trivial things for about 30 minutes,

191
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,846
I knocked on the door again

192
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,446
and went inside...

193
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:42,746
this is what I saw.

194
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:47,046
I had no idea that my wife was so deadlocked over a brawl like that.

195
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,446
I see.

196
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:50,846
And?

197
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,746
What about this memo at your wife's feet?

198
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,746
It's a will written by her about how worried she is

199
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:01,146
about my wound, our son's exam

200
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:04,846
and about our niece's Shichigosan celebration.

201
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,646
She put so much thought into writing these.

202
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:11,646
She apologized for crossing over leaving us all behind.

203
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,946
This is undoubtedly a suicide.

204
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:17,646
No.

205
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,546
It could be homicide, you know?

206
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:26,146
That will was written on the memo pad that was on the desk,

207
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,546
torn off and placed here, right?

208
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:30,546
But, look. If you take a good look,

209
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:34,346
only the part by the two lower holes of the paper are left

210
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,746
on the metal binding.

211
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,946
But as to the will, three holes are torn off.

212
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,946
Don't you think that's strange?

213
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:43,046
No joke?

214
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,546
True.

215
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:46,746
Besides,

216
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:49,646
the words on that will are pretty distorted.

217
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:54,746
See! It seems that your wife used to leave memos behind on the pad,

218
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:59,146
but she always wrote only her name at the end.

219
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:03,646
But in that will only, she wrote her full name.

220
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:06,946
It looks strange to me, you know?

221
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,646
True.

222
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,946
Was the door to the entrance locked?

223
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:15,946
Yes. I opened it, but it was definitely locked.

224
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,146
Then, who has the spare key?

225
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:23,046
Just my wife, Sakurako, my son, Yasuie and I.

226
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,946
Where is your son now?

227
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,546
I think he's at driving school.

228
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,646
He mentioned that his driving test was coming up soon.

229
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:34,146
And I heard that there's another spare

230
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,446
in the mailbox on the first floor too.

231
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:40,046
That mailbox is locked, I presume?

232
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,046
Yes.

233
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:45,346
It's the dial type and not easy for outsiders to open.

234
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:47,846
7 to the left, 2 to the right,

235
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:50,046
and 3 to the left.

236
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:54,346
There's one other person who knows the numbers to the dial.

237
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:55,346
What?

238
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:59,446
When I was taking out mails from that mailbox yesterday,

239
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,646
I was in a fix

240
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,246
because I forgot the memo with the numbers to the dial written on it,

241
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,646
but a man told me what the numbers were!

242
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:07,746
Why do you know the number?

243
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,246
Didn't you drop a memo with the numbers of the dial on it,

244
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,146
the other day when you tried to open the mailbox?

245
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,346
I was the one who picked that memo up,

246
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:17,946
but doesn't it ring a bell?

247
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:23,846
But I don't think you had even a second to look at it.

248
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,646
That much time is more than enough for me.

249
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:30,046
I'm good at remembering things like this.

250
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,346
I'm number one in Japan.

251
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,846
No, maybe I'm the best in the world.

252
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,646
Is he a resident of this condo?

253
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,846
Yes. He lives next door.

254
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:44,446
He's an unshaven, shabby guy.

255
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,646
If I remember correctly, his name is...

256
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:49,046
If he lives next door, it's faster if we just go there!

257
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,846
-Yes. -Oh, hey.

258
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,446
Hey, wait.

259
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:00,946
Yes, what is it?

260
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,246
Yumi, my baby!

261
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,346
Yumi, my baby?

262
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:14,346
-Do you know him? -Yes.

263
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:18,846
He's my "ex".

264
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,939
Then, let me get this straight.

265
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:37,839
In order to give your wife some time to cool down

266
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,939
after you had it out with her,

267
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:42,439
you left to go to the supermarket together

268
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,739
with the maid for 30 minutes.

269
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,939
After you returned home and opened the door

270
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:51,439
you heard the door of this bedroom close

271
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,339
and called out to her but since there was no answer

272
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,239
you decided to wait another 30 minutes.

273
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,439
Therefore, you killed time together with the maid in the kitchen,

274
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,139
chatting and having coffee.

275
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,539
Then, you went to knock on the door again,

276
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,039
and went inside this time.

277
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,939
That's when you found that your wife had hung herself

278
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,739
with an electric cord.

279
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:10,939
Yes.

280
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,539
By the way, what did you fight over?

281
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,839
-Stocks. -Stocks... did you say?

282
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,939
My wife was hooked on stocks recently,

283
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,539
and when I cautioned her about it she got hysterical.

284
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,339
I see.

285
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,939
Well, my son who'll be graduating university soon

286
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:30,839
hasn't found a job yet.

287
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,239
I think she'd been feeling a lot of stress too.

288
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,139
You have a son?

289
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,339
Yes.

290
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:40,939
Ever since he began living on his own near the university,

291
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,239
he doesn't come around much though.

292
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:46,739
But, he called the other day.

293
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,039
Saying that he wanted Mr. Itami to buy him a car

294
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,139
after he gets his driver's license,

295
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:53,639
and that he'll be bringing over the car catalogs.

296
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,739
Catalogs?

297
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:57,839
But, Mrs. Itami was against it saying that he's not even employed yet

298
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,739
so there's no need for a car.

299
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:02,439
She shouted at him and hung up.

300
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,539
You're the one that was at the scene

301
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,639
during the optical illusion case.

302
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,139
Yes, sir. I ended up like this again. This is my work place.

303
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,239
Please at all costs don't be a person

304
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:15,539
who summons death like Mr. Mouri does.

305
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,139
Inspector.

306
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,039
But, why was this incident reported by Ms. Miike

307
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,639
of the traffic control division?

308
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,639
That's because...

309
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,139
Sakurako saw the corpse

310
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,339
and Ms. Naeko Miike, a police woman who is also her friend.

311
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,739
Well, I came here because I happened to hear about it too!

312
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,339
Conan?

313
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:41,139
No wonder all the children were at the entrance.

314
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:45,139
But, Conan, how did you get inside this condo?

315
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,639
We came in together with a person who had a child with her,

316
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,739
making believe that we were that child's friends.

317
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,239
-That's not too cool. -Geez.

318
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:59,239
Naeko, are you classmates with Sakurako?

319
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:03,639
No, she's a childhood friend who lived near me!

320
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,539
I'm a year older than Sakurako.

321
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,739
Well, at any rate,

322
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,239
the only people here were you, your wife and the maid?

323
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:19,239
Yes. I haven't seen my son for over a year.

324
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,739
If so, who's the man that is standing behind you, Yumi?

325
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,239
He's...

326
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:31,139
I live next door and I'm Yumi baby's...

327
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,839
"Shukichi Haneda (28)" -I'm going with Yumi

328
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,639
"Resident of the mansion" -and my name is Shukichi Haneda!

329
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,839
What?

330
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,039
I'm his ex!

331
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,439
I've already broken up with him though!

332
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,639
But, what brings your boyfriend here?

333
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,939
My ex-boyfriend said that

334
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:50,439
he remembered the number to the dial of the mailbox

335
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,939
where the spare key was inside,

336
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:53,639
so I dragged him out here!

337
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,039
You look familiar too.

338
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,039
Now that you mentioned it,

339
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,039
I think I've heard that name somewhere before too.

340
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,339
Don't tell me that you saw him on a fugitive want list or something.

341
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:07,639
Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:11,339
Well, but there was a will at the feet of the corpse too.

343
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,839
I guess we could conclude this to be suicide.

344
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,239
But Conan mentioned that it may not be suicide.

345
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:20,339
What?

346
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:27,239
I see. True!

347
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,939
This will and the place where this letter was torn off doesn't match!

348
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,939
What's written on the will is,

349
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,439
I'm sorry for wounding you.

350
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,239
I pray you'll get well soon.

351
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,639
Yasuei, good luck in your exam.

352
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,839
I'm sure you'll pass it.

353
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,239
When celebrating Ichiko's Shichigosan,

354
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:48,139
please let her wear my dressy kimono.

355
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,339
Please forgive me for crossing over

356
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,239
before all of you and leaving you behind.

357
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,139
Chiyoko Itami.

358
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:57,239
Is there anything suspicious about the contents?

359
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,739
No.

360
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:03,839
As you can see, my eye is bruised from the ashtray

361
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,839
that my wife threw at me last night.

362
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,339
My son Yasuie did mention

363
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,239
that his driving license test was coming up soon.

364
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,939
And, my younger sister's daughter

365
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:16,239
is going to be seven years old this year.

366
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,339
So, she's celebrating Shichigosan.

367
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,439
Why did your wife throw an ashtray at you, though?

368
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,539
My wife has a habit of throwing things when she gets angry.

369
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,939
I saw her do it too.

370
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,239
That's why I think that the cell phone

371
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,639
that was found on the floor in front of the bedroom

372
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,939
was thrown there by Mrs. Itami too.

373
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:33,839
The cell phone was found on the floor?

374
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,939
Yes.

375
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,639
When I came back from shopping,

376
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:40,639
and first knocked on the bedroom door I noticed it there.

377
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,639
Where is that cell phone?

378
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,339
I have it with me

379
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,439
I was going to give it back to my wife when was in a better mood.

380
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,439
There is no outgoing or incoming call history today.

381
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,139
If this were a homicide,

382
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,039
I thought it may have been used for some trick or something but...

383
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,739
It seems to have nothing to do with the case.

384
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:05,739
So, Mrs. Itami didn't commit suicide after all.

385
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,139
After all?

386
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,639
Because Mrs. Itami used to say

387
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,739
that she was loved by God and that she was a lucky person!

388
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,739
A lucky person?

389
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:16,939
Which means?

390
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:21,539
I think she's referring to the time several years ago,

391
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,639
when the plane that she was on board was about to crash.

392
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,939
Then, were you on board that plane too?

393
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:31,339
No. I was scheduled to ride it too but,

394
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:35,139
I broke my leg skiing just before I was scheduled to board the plane.

395
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,039
That's why it's hard to believe

396
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,339
that Mrs. Itami would commit suicide over a simple brawl.

397
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,039
But, that was more like my wife's habit to say things like that.

398
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,239
Besides, something's not right about that will too.

399
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,539
What's not right?

400
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,039
Mrs. Itami caught a cold when she was 7 years old

401
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,039
and wasn't able to celebrate Shichigosan

402
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,039
and she mentioned that until the Coming of Age Day,

403
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,039
she didn't have any opportunity to wear a kimono.

404
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,939
I see.

405
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:11,539
So, that was the one kimono she had prepared?

406
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,739
Just what're you talking about, Chukichi?

407
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,139
She's saying that she didn't make a kimono!

408
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,239
I keep telling you, I'm Shukichi!

409
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:21,139
How many times do I have to keep telling you that it's not Chukichi!

410
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,639
Chukichi is a better name for you!

411
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,139
Looking shabby like that.

412
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:29,039
The one prepared move?

413
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,039
If I'm not mistaken...

414
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,839
I get it.

415
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,339
If from that point of view,

416
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:38,039
the unnaturalness of that will is...

417
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,439
Although it's not enough to see the entire picture yet,

418
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,539
if I take it move by move in due order...

419
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,639
Right?

420
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,739
Mr. Shukichi Haneda?

421
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,339
So, this will is quite questionable after all.

422
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,939
Yes, I guess we'll need to analyze the handwriting.

423
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:02,239
Yeah. Moreover,

424
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,539
it bothers me to think that a person who has hurt her wrist

425
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:07,539
would choose a method such as suicide by hanging herself

426
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,039
which is a difficult feat to do with one hand.

427
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,639
True.

428
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,439
Inspector Megure!

429
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,939
We got a testimony of a suspicious character being seen!

430
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:17,939
What?

431
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,939
According to the concierge on the first floor,

432
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:25,039
a suspicious looking person wearing a cap, mask and glasses,

433
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,339
as if hiding his face went in and out of the condo!

434
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,239
Officer Chiba!

435
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,739
I'm not letting you go!

436
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:59,939
I'm not anybody suspicious.

437
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,939
Like they say, perps return to the scene of the crime.

438
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:05,239
Before finding Mrs. Itami's cell phone,

439
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:10,039
Sakurako you said that you heard the bedroom door close, right?

440
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,339
Yes.

441
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,039
I can't tell you.

442
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,239
It's a woman, isn't it?

443
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,939
I'll bet you were meeting some woman somewhere!

444
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,239
Next Conan,

445
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:22,139
"The Neighbor at the Site is an Ex-Boyfriend (Part 2)"

446
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:40,439
Next Conan's Hint:

447
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,539
"Cell phone cover".

448
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,139
Chukichi and Yumi baby.

449
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:45,139
You're interested in them.

450
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:47,139
A new couple has come to be again.
