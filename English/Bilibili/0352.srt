1
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.240
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.740
They go off in great spirit for a big catch.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.440
And get caught in an unexpected crime.

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:04.668
Wow! It's fantastic!

9
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:07.068
What a beautiful lake!

10
00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:12.468
Okutani Lake is called the sanctuary of bass fishing.

11
00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.668
If things go well, they say you may even be able

12
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.368
to fish one as heavy as 5kg.

13
00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.368
5kg?

14
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:22.668
Okay!

15
00:02:22.668 --> 00:02:26.468
I'll eat to my heart's content and we'll win the match!

16
00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:32.268
Genta, I think you've got it wrong.

17
00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.168
No, I don't!

18
00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:37.168
You're talking about the big-eaters contest, right?

19
00:02:37.168 --> 00:02:38.868
Oh my.

20
00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.168
Hey.

21
00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:45.968
Ran and I are invited to attend a bass fishing contest

22
00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:49.068
that is sponsored by Sonoko's father's company.

23
00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.268
Genta and the others who hear of this

24
00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:53.968
insisted that they wanted to participate in the contest too.

25
00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:56.568
So, here we all are.

26
00:02:59.468 --> 00:03:05.368
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 1)"

27
00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:08.068
"Okutani Lake"

28
00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:10.968
Oh, there you are.

29
00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:13.668
Ran!

30
00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:14.968
Sonoko!

31
00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:16.268
Good morning!

32
00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:18.668
Good morning!

33
00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:23.668
Good morning! Thank you for inviting us here today!

34
00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:25.068
What's this, what's this?

35
00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:28.068
You guys know how to say your greetings!

36
00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:30.868
Okay! Give it all you got today, you group of little shrimpies!

37
00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:33.768
Well, I'm so sorry that we're shrimpies!

38
00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:36.968
The brat with the glasses is here with you today too!

39
00:03:36.968 --> 00:03:38.668
Well, sorry.

40
00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:45.368
Mr. Mizui!

41
00:03:45.368 --> 00:03:46.968
Sonoko.

42
00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:47.968
What can I do for you?

43
00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:50.668
These children are going to be entering the contest too,

44
00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.468
so could you please register them right away?

45
00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.568
Yes, all right.

46
00:03:56.568 --> 00:04:01.168
Please write your names and addresses here.

47
00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:04.868
This is Mr. Mizui from the head office.

48
00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:06.768
She's my best riend, Ran.

49
00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:08.868
Nice meeting you.

50
00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:12.068
Oh! How do you do? I'm Junichi Mizui.

51
00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:13.668
Nice meeting you!

52
00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:15.468
Let's see...

53
00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:18.068
I'm using this!

54
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:20.268
I'll take this, then.

55
00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:22.368
What about you, Conan?

56
00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:23.868
This one!

57
00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:27.368
That? It looks like a hornworm and is gross.

58
00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:29.868
But, Ayumi, it says here that

59
00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:34.968
these soft baits are better for this.

60
00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:37.468
Wow, this is interesting!

61
00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:39.068
See, it looks just like a frog!

62
00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:41.568
I didn't know there was bait like this!

63
00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:45.368
Really. It sure looks like a real frog.

64
00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:49.268
Oh, are you guys going to be entering the contest too?

65
00:04:49.268 --> 00:04:52.068
Yup, we're going to win for sure.

66
00:04:52.068 --> 00:04:55.368
"Saori Ayukawa (27), Contestant" -Oh, you two sure look strong.

67
00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:58.368
Are you going to enter the contest too?

68
00:04:58.368 --> 00:05:01.468
Of course! I registered long before at the reception desk already.

69
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.268
Don't be too hard on me, okay?

70
00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:13.768
The champion and little fishermen.

71
00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:16.368
"Toshihiko Funaki, Freelance Writer" -Thanks for the great picture.

72
00:05:17.968 --> 00:05:20.168
See you guys, good luck.

73
00:05:20.168 --> 00:05:22.868
Yes, we'll need it.

74
00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:30.068
I shook her hand.

75
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:32.868
Maybe I shouldn't take a bath tonight.

76
00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:35.168
Okay, shrimpies!

77
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.768
The contest will start soon.

78
00:05:37.768 --> 00:05:40.968
What did you talk about with that woman?

79
00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:43.268
She told us not to be too hard on her.

80
00:05:43.268 --> 00:05:45.968
After that, she grabbed my hand firmly.

81
00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:48.368
Ms. Ayukawa talked to you children?

82
00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:50.368
Yeah, firmly, like so...

83
00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:52.868
She sure is beautiful.

84
00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:56.168
Do you know that woman?

85
00:05:56.168 --> 00:06:00.968
She's the winner of last year's fishing contest.

86
00:06:00.968 --> 00:06:04.268
She's that famous.

87
00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:06.668
Yeah, that person who just came

88
00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:08.668
is the next candidate for winner of this contest

89
00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:10.768
called Takuya Masubuchi.

90
00:06:10.768 --> 00:06:13.468
He won the contest the year before last.

91
00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:18.168
The time now is 11:00.

92
00:06:18.168 --> 00:06:21.268
We will be be starting the first day

93
00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:23.768
of the Suzuki Cup Okutani Lake Tournament.

94
00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:27.268
Please bring the five bass that you have fished

95
00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:30.768
to the contest headquarters by 16:00 today.

96
00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:35.068
Okay, let's give it a try!

97
00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:36.768
We'll give it our best shot!

98
00:06:37.968 --> 00:06:40.068
I wonder how this is going to work out.

99
00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:48.468
Maybe a boat would've been better after all.

100
00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:53.268
Bass are usually hiding where there are algae and fallen trees.

101
00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:56.468
Okay, let's fish here!

102
00:06:56.468 --> 00:06:59.368
Are you sure you know what you're doing, Conan?

103
00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.768
Oh, it seems she's going to fish here too.

104
00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:07.068
See. Even the candidate for winner thinks this place is the point.

105
00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:09.168
Come on, let's get to it.

106
00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:11.768
Okay, just leave it to me!

107
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.468
No good.

108
00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:19.168
No luck here.

109
00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:23.668
Maybe using a boat would've been better, after all?

110
00:07:23.668 --> 00:07:26.568
How're you doing, little ones? Any luck?

111
00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:29.168
-Not at all. -None.

112
00:07:29.168 --> 00:07:32.968
I'm from Gekkan Bass, I write articles for this magazine.

113
00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:34.468
My name's Funaki.

114
00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:37.068
And, mind you, it's Bass, not bus.

115
00:07:37.068 --> 00:07:38.368
Give me a break.

116
00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:40.668
We know.

117
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:42.768
I'm interviewing because I'm going to be writing an article

118
00:07:42.768 --> 00:07:44.968
on this contest next month's edition.

119
00:07:44.968 --> 00:07:47.568
Right! Let me take you pictures and put it in the magazine!

120
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:50.268
Line up, all of you.

121
00:07:50.668 --> 00:07:54.268
Okay, here goes. One plus one is...

122
00:07:54.268 --> 00:07:56.068
You and me!

123
00:08:00.968 --> 00:08:03.668
Ms. Ayukawa seems to be doing good.

124
00:08:03.668 --> 00:08:05.768
I guess I'll go get a picture of her.

125
00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:09.868
Hey, if it's not the place that's bad, it must be the lure.

126
00:08:09.868 --> 00:08:11.968
I guess so.

127
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.768
Don't do this.

128
00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:19.468
We're just going to take a look at what kind of lure she's using.

129
00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:20.968
You stay here, Ayumi.

130
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:22.868
My goodness.

131
00:08:28.268 --> 00:08:30.768
She got all kinds.

132
00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:33.368
This is it! If we could only have this.

133
00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.668
I wonder if we can fish with this.

134
00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:36.968
Of course.

135
00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:39.068
No, you can't fish with that!

136
00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:44.968
We're sorry!

137
00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:48.768
Try fishing with this.

138
00:08:48.768 --> 00:08:51.368
This lure...

139
00:08:51.368 --> 00:08:53.268
has a certain smell.

140
00:08:53.268 --> 00:08:55.068
I'm sure you'll be able to fish something.

141
00:08:57.368 --> 00:08:59.768
Thank you so much!

142
00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:07.668
It's being pulled.

143
00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:10.468
It's being pulled! Talk about strong!

144
00:09:13.868 --> 00:09:15.468
Mitsuhiko, keep cool.

145
00:09:15.468 --> 00:09:18.268
Cool head! Calm down and wind the reel.

146
00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:19.968
-The other way! -Okay.

147
00:09:19.968 --> 00:09:22.868
Right, that's the way, keep it up!

148
00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:25.668
It's big, heavy, my hands are going numb.

149
00:09:25.668 --> 00:09:28.768
A little more. Wind it slowly.

150
00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.868
It's black, a bass! Now! There!

151
00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:40.668
-This is... -This is it?

152
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.568
Oh, my!

153
00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:49.568
Are you all right?

154
00:09:49.568 --> 00:09:50.868
Show it to me.

155
00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:53.668
No big deal.

156
00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:57.368
Let me clean your wound for you.

157
00:09:58.368 --> 00:09:59.868
Does it hurt?

158
00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:02.168
I've got bandage so hold on, okay?

159
00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.968
But, before that let's sterilize the wound first.

160
00:10:03.968 --> 00:10:05.168
Okay.

161
00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:18.668
Conan, you're late. I was worried about you.

162
00:10:18.668 --> 00:10:21.568
Hurry and get your fish weighed.

163
00:10:24.468 --> 00:10:26.168
What's the matter?

164
00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:28.568
Aren't you feeling well?

165
00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:34.968
Don't tell me, you don't have any fish to weigh.

166
00:10:37.568 --> 00:10:40.068
You couldn't fish even one?

167
00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:44.668
All four of you? 4 times 0, 0 fish?

168
00:10:45.468 --> 00:10:47.968
Sonoko, don't laugh!

169
00:10:47.968 --> 00:10:49.668
But...

170
00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:56.068
We'd like to announce the results for the first day.

171
00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:59.968
In first place is Ms. Saori Ayukawa who fished a total of

172
00:10:59.968 --> 00:11:01.568
13524 grams!

173
00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:04.268
All right!

174
00:11:04.768 --> 00:11:06.468
Wow!

175
00:11:06.468 --> 00:11:09.168
We moved places, changed lures.

176
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.368
All that's left is...

177
00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:12.768
All that's left is luck! Yup.

178
00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:14.468
Let's turn luck in our direction tomorrow

179
00:11:14.468 --> 00:11:16.368
and aim for a counter win!

180
00:11:16.368 --> 00:11:17.468
Okay!

181
00:11:20.568 --> 00:11:23.468
I wonder if it'll go that well.

182
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.490
Just what are you talking about?

183
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.090
Cut out the stupid talk.

184
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.290
It's nothing to get all worked up over, is it?

185
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.190
Excuse me.

186
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.290
It's really huge, don't you think?

187
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.490
My friend fished it.

188
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.590
The person who fished this is called Mr. Kanie?

189
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.290
Yeah, Mr. Kensuke Kanie.

190
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.990
He was a skilled fisher.

191
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.790
How can you fish a big fish like that?

192
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.090
Because we've been fishing since we were kids.

193
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.290
If you start from now, Ayumi,

194
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.690
I'm sure that by the time you become an adult,

195
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.790
you'll be a great fisherman.

196
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.090
Really?

197
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.990
Maybe I should start right now.

198
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.690
Saori, why did you decide to start fishing?

199
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.890
My father used to fish,

200
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.490
so he used to take me along with him to rivers and lakes

201
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.890
since I was really little.

202
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.990
That's why I never went to amusement parks or zoos

203
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.790
until I entered high school.

204
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.390
What? Poor thing.

205
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.590
Oh, there you are, Ms. Ayukawa.

206
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.390
Wanna drink with me, in advance celebration of your victory?

207
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.190
No, thank you, I'd rather not.

208
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.990
Oh, are you saying that you don't want to drink with me?

209
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.390
Are you sure about that?

210
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.390
Are you sure that's what you really want to say?

211
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.690
I'm just kidding, only joke.

212
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.090
The thing is, I want you to tell me something.

213
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.290
I thought that while I'm here anyway,

214
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.490
I'd go and finish my work on Rail Mania too.

215
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.590
You know almost everything about this place, don't you?

216
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.690
Not really.

217
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.590
Please tell me and help me.

218
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.090
Please, Saori.

219
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.790
Okay.

220
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.590
Oh, that'll be a great help.

221
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.590
I'm indebted to you. Thanks so much.

222
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:53.290
He said, Rail Mania. I bought that magazine before.

223
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.290
He's a freelance writer,

224
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.690
so he's writing for many different types of magazines.

225
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.390
I see.

226
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.790
Conan, let's fish by boat today.

227
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.690
During this season, I'm sure the bass

228
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.390
are hiding behind things near the shore and waiting for bait.

229
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.790
No matter what your reasoning is,

230
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.090
we were fishing all day near the shore yesterday, and caught nothing!

231
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.490
So, today...

232
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.590
-We're getting on the boat today in order to win. -Right!

233
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.290
I'm going to fish on land after all.

234
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.490
I'm thinking of going some place else today.

235
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.790
Okay, see you then.

236
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.090
What about you, Ayumi?

237
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.690
What should I do?

238
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.290
Oh, Ms. Ayukawa!

239
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.590
Good morning!

240
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.790
Ms. Ayukawa, where are you going to fish today?

241
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.590
I'm planning to Kutanisuji today.

242
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.990
May I go along with you?

243
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.990
It's dangerous there, so I'd rather you don't.

244
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.390
Oh.

245
00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.090
I'm sorry, Ayumi.

246
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.490
Good luck, all of you.

247
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.290
Kutanisuji.

248
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.090
Mitsuhiko, let's go there.

249
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.590
Let's take the boat and and beat her to the at Kutanisuji!

250
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.990
Good luck, all of you!

251
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.590
Let's go, Ayumi.

252
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.790
Okay.

253
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.590
Ms. Ayukawa!

254
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.090
Huh? Where?

255
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.590
Oh, true.

256
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.290
Ms. Ayukawa!

257
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.390
I should've gotten on the boat too.

258
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.590
A trolley!

259
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.490
Hello!

260
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.590
What? We hit something.

261
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.190
There was definitely a sound.

262
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.090
What could it be?

263
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.590
Could it be something used when fishing?

264
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.390
I've never seen something like this.

265
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.590
He's Mr. Masubuchi a candidate for champion, right?

266
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.890
Which means, this must be a good place to fish.

267
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.190
But even if the place is good...

268
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.190
Oh, but it's the second day,

269
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.890
I'm sure Conan and the others have fished a lot today.

270
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.590
I wonder.

271
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.490
It's just a little further upstream, right?

272
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.890
What's wrong?

273
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.490
Look, what's that?

274
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.990
I wonder what he's doing.

275
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.290
Maybe he sulked out because he can't catch fish and sleeping.

276
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.190
I doubt it.

277
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.190
What's the matter, Ran?

278
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.790
Conan.

279
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.090
A person is lying on the ground!

280
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.990
Ayumi, wait here, okay?

281
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.990
Oh, okay.

282
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.990
Mr. Funaki.

283
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.590
Kerosene?

284
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.590
If he slipped and hit his head,

285
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:31.190
there should be blood on the rock.

286
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.790
Search for it!

287
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.690
What is the estimated time of death?

288
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.890
He's still warm.

289
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.690
I'd say it's between 15 to 30 minutes.

290
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.790
He's so scary.

291
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.090
Oh, the ones who found him?

292
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.990
You guys are...

293
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.090
If I remember correctly, you're Smoky Kogoro's...

294
00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.290
You mean Sleeping Kogoro.

295
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.690
Officer Yokomizo, thank you so much always.

296
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.990
-And, you are? -I'm a junior at Teitan High school,

297
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.590
Sonoko Suzuki.

298
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.990
I'm the presenter of this fishing contest

299
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.790
and here on behalf of the chairman.

300
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.990
Oh, you're the one who thrives on attention,

301
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.590
the daughter of the host of this contest.

302
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.290
Will you explain the conditions when you found him?

303
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.790
Sonoko and I were at the contest headquarters,

304
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.290
but we came walking along to check on Conan and the others,

305
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.190
then, we found Mr. Funaki over there.

306
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.290
So, the victim's name is Funaki?

307
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.290
Yup. He said he was a freelance writer for magazines,

308
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.890
and was saying that he was going to write an article

309
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.290
of this fishing contest for a magazine called Gekkan Bass.

310
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.890
Where were you kids?

311
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:47.190
I was upstream about 30m from here together with Ayumi and fishing.

312
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.890
When you were there, didn't you hear his scream or something?

313
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.290
Nope.

314
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.390
We didn't, did we?

315
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.590
We didn't hear a thing.

316
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.390
Inspector, may I have a moment with you?

317
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.590
Did you find it?

318
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.190
Well, we searched all over

319
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.390
but didn't come up with anything the victim could've hit his head on.

320
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.390
What? You couldn't find anything?

321
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.590
I was near Otakeiwa between 10:00 to 10:30.

322
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.990
Do you have anyone who can prove that for you?

323
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.990
I was right near him all the time.

324
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.390
Both of us were fishing together from early morning at Otakeiwa.

325
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.490
Where is this Otakeiwa?

326
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.390
Around here.

327
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.190
You may both leave.

328
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.790
Thank you.

329
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.290
Talk about gruff.

330
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.490
Only 30 minutes had past since Mr. Funaki had died.

331
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.390
It takes 20 minutes from the contest headquarters

332
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.290
to where the corpse was found.

333
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.590
Without using a boat, the only way to cross the lake

334
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.190
would be to use the path above the dam.

335
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.290
It would take more than 5 minutes to cross the dam,

336
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.490
so it would've been impossible for anybody

337
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.790
who was on the right side of the lake to commit the crime.

338
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.290
You're Ms. Saori Ayukawa?

339
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.790
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.890
Oh, are you saying you don't want to drink with me?

341
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.790
Are you sure that's what you want?

342
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.690
Will you please tell me where and what you were doing

343
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.190
between 10:00 and 10:30?

344
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.390
Yes.

345
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.690
I was going up the opposite way to Kutanisuji

346
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.190
from the crossroad of the main trail.

347
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.190
Is there anyone who can prove that for you?

348
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.590
We saw her!

349
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.990
We were on the boat,

350
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.690
but we definitely saw Ms. Ayukawa go into Kutanisuji.

351
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.990
Yes, we waved goodbye to her.

352
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.790
-No doubt about it. -Yes.

353
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.990
Okay, you may go back to the contest.

354
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.990
Thank you.

355
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.490
What about us?

356
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.290
You guys can go too!

357
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.790
You don't need proof of our alibi?

358
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.490
No, I don't! I don't have time for kids.

359
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.290
What a surprise.

360
00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.290
He's the one who took our picture for us, right?

361
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.190
I wonder if that place is cursed.

362
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.690
Cursed?

363
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.090
Mr. Mizui, just what do you mean by that?

364
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.390
The thing is, half a year ago, somebody died there too.

365
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.490
Since there was no one around back then,

366
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.490
the case closed as an accident.

367
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.290
Who died?

368
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.090
A person called Mr. Kanie,

369
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.490
who was very intimate with Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

370
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.890
Kanie?

371
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.890
Kensuke Kanie, he was a skilled fisher.

372
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.890
Then, he was a candidate for champion too?

373
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:58.090
Yes. Just like Mr. Masubuchi, he was Ms. Ayukawas's father's student too.

374
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.590
Ms. Ayukawa's father?

375
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.590
He already passed away

376
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.290
but Ms. Ayukawa's father

377
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.590
is the person who spread sports fishing in Japan.

378
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.190
He established a fishing club and taught bass fishing.

379
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.390
Somebody died there 6 months ago.

380
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.490
This is no coincidence.

381
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.590
The murderer is most probably one of the two!

382
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.290
Conan, what are we going to do in a place like this?

383
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.890
Let's go home.

384
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.590
A trolley?

385
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.790
I see!

386
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.890
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

387
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.290
Never mind, let's go!

388
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.090
Isn't that Mr. Funaki's?

389
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.390
The actual murder place is here!

390
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.790
But, how?

391
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.490
Next Conan,

392
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.790
"Fishing Tournament Tragedy (Part 2)"

393
00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:25.817
Next Conan's Hint:

394
00:24:25.817 --> 00:24:27.917
"Newest model fishing pole"

395
00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:29.917
The fish played peek-a-boo right now.

396
00:24:29.917 --> 00:24:31.617
What a fish ball.

397
00:24:31.617 --> 00:24:32.617
What a fish!
