"Cafe Poirot - Closed"

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.440
Good morning!

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.140
Good morning.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.340
Good morning, Mr. Mouri.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.940
But we're not open yet.

7
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.240
Well, it smells so good.

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.540
We're serving meatballs and cabbage stewed in milk and tomato this morning.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.540
Looks good.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.140
I'll have the morning special.

11
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.140
Gosh.

12
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.740
Sorry.

13
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.240
Come in.

14
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.040
What will you have, Ran?

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.240
I'll have the morning special, too.

16
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.340
What do you want?

17
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.640
Me, too!

18
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.140
Roger that.

19
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
"Cafe Poirot - Open"

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.340
What? Has there always been a refrigerator here?

21
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.540
Yeah, since about a month ago.

22
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.240
It's a cake fridge.

23
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.640
"Poirot's Special Cake" -Oh, that cake?

24
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.540
Ran, have you had it?

25
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.140
"Tokyo Summit Starting Soon" -Yeah. It's really good.

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.540
After all, it's Amuro's special cake.

27
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.340
What? You use an electric kettle?

28
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.940
Yeah. Our water heater's old.

29
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.440
It takes forever to boil water first thing in the morning.

30
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
If I turn this on with my phone when I leave the house,

31
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.240
it's boiling right around now.

32
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.640
With your phone? So it's an IoT appliance.

33
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.340
IoT appliance?

34
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.140
They're electrical appliances that can connect to the internet.

35
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.540
Like that electric kettle.

36
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.740
-Really? -Really?

37
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.540
Now let's see.

38
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.940
Again.

39
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.940
What is it? What happened?

40
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.640
You don't need to shout.

41
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.340
But they melted again. Why?

42
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.340
There was nothing wrong when you made them last night.

43
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940
Again? This isn't the first time?

44
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.140
-Yeah. -Yeah.

45
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

46
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

47
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.140
Amuro's new special cakes face trouble first thing in the morning!

48
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

49
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

50
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.740
His name is Detective Conan!

51
00:04:05.097 --> 00:04:10.897
"The Melting Cake!"

52
00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.097
Here, Dad.

53
00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:30.497
I said I didn't want any.

54
00:04:30.497 --> 00:04:34.697
Why are we having cake first thing in the morning?

55
00:04:38.297 --> 00:04:39.397
It's good!

56
00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:42.697
You can really taste the egg.

57
00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:45.597
I use more than usual.

58
00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:48.697
It tastes as good as ever.

59
00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:50.697
But with them looking like this,

60
00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:53.597
we can't serve these to our regular customers.

61
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:55.597
Why did they fall apart?

62
00:04:55.597 --> 00:04:58.197
Maybe they were made wrong.

63
00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.697
Dad.

64
00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:01.897
If it happened twice, it could happen a third time.

65
00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:03.697
Dad!

66
00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:07.297
You might be right.

67
00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:09.097
Unless we can figure out why this is happening.

68
00:05:09.097 --> 00:05:10.397
Yes.

69
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:13.897
We should come up with some way to solve this.

70
00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:20.197
"Agasa" -Yes, we're at the Dr. Agasa's house right now.

71
00:05:20.197 --> 00:05:23.097
You should come, too.

72
00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:27.197
We're flying the drone the Dr. Agasa made.

73
00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:31.197
"Stand by" -Apparently it flies really high.

74
00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.497
Dr. Agasa, hurry.

75
00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:47.697
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

76
00:05:50.197 --> 00:05:51.497
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

77
00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:00.897
What was that about?

78
00:06:00.897 --> 00:06:03.097
How does this thing work?

79
00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:05.597
What happened, Mitsuhiko?

80
00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:09.797
The drone started flying on its own!

81
00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:12.897
No one touched the controller.

82
00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:16.097
It flew without anyone touching the controller?

83
00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:19.297
Hey... What is this?

84
00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:24.297
I told you not to fly it without me.

85
00:06:24.297 --> 00:06:25.897
We didn't.

86
00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:28.697
We didn't touch the controller.

87
00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:34.997
I just made this too.

88
00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:37.297
It'll take time to fix that.

89
00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:38.497
-What? -What?

90
00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:39.997
But what about today?

91
00:06:39.997 --> 00:06:41.697
Don't count on it.

92
00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:43.797
It won't be able to fly today.

93
00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:46.297
-No way. -No way.

94
00:06:46.297 --> 00:06:48.897
Anyway, the flight's been canceled.

95
00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:50.997
Where are you, Conan?

96
00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:52.897
I'm at Cafe Poirot.

97
00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:54.197
What?

98
00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.497
Cafe Poirot has this really yummy cake lately.

99
00:06:57.497 --> 00:06:59.397
We were just talking about that cake.

100
00:06:59.397 --> 00:07:01.897
It's not fair that you're the only one who gets cake, Conan!

101
00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:04.497
Then we'll go get some cake too!

102
00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:05.497
-Yeah! -Yeah!

103
00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:08.297
But the cake is...

104
00:07:08.297 --> 00:07:09.397
What?

105
00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:13.697
Haibara, come with us.

106
00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:15.497
I'll pass.

107
00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:17.497
I need to help the Dr. Agasa.

108
00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:19.497
"Beika Electric" -What?

109
00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:21.497
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -There's no cake?

110
00:07:21.497 --> 00:07:24.597
You should've said so earlier.

111
00:07:24.597 --> 00:07:27.397
I was trying to when you hung up.

112
00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:30.297
But I was so excited.

113
00:07:30.297 --> 00:07:31.797
Sorry.

114
00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:35.097
The electrician's fixing it right now.

115
00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.497
It should be fine tomorrow.

116
00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:39.997
I examined the refrigerator

117
00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:41.697
and there's nothing wrong with it.

118
00:07:41.697 --> 00:07:42.897
What?

119
00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:45.997
Then why are the cakes falling apart?

120
00:07:45.997 --> 00:07:47.397
I don't know.

121
00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:51.897
Maybe...

122
00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:55.897
Hold on! What's gotten into you, Ayumi?

123
00:07:57.097 --> 00:08:00.297
Look at these cakes.

124
00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:03.297
They look like the cake before it melts, don't they?

125
00:08:03.297 --> 00:08:07.197
Are these cakes copies of Amuro's?

126
00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:09.097
Keep your voice down.

127
00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:12.097
It is suspicious, though.

128
00:08:12.097 --> 00:08:13.297
Hey, guys.

129
00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:15.597
"Luxurious Extra Cream Cake" -How much do you have on you right now?

130
00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:16.897
Just this.

131
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.897
This isn't nearly enough.

132
00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:21.097
Conan, cough it up.

133
00:08:21.097 --> 00:08:24.197
We know you have a lot of money.

134
00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:25.897
Why?

135
00:08:29.697 --> 00:08:34.797
Dough that uses a lot of eggs is typically this color.

136
00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:38.097
And if you apply the same amount of cream in the same way,

137
00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:39.997
it does look similar.

138
00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:43.097
So it's not plagiarism?

139
00:08:43.097 --> 00:08:45.597
I don't think so.

140
00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:47.097
Thanks for the food.

141
00:08:52.697 --> 00:08:54.997
-Thanks for the food. -Thanks for the food.

142
00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:57.397
It tastes completely different.

143
00:08:57.397 --> 00:09:00.997
Yeah. Cafe Poirot's cakes taste way better.

144
00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:03.097
That solves the mystery.

145
00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:04.297
Does it?

146
00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:08.097
That baker is breaking in during the night,

147
00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:10.997
and destroying Amuro's cakes.

148
00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:15.297
So they can't sell their cakes since they taste better?

149
00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:18.197
I'm 100 percent sure they're wrong.

150
00:09:18.197 --> 00:09:21.097
That makes things simple.

151
00:09:21.097 --> 00:09:22.997
What's simple?

152
00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:25.697
We'll conduct a stake out here tonight.

153
00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:26.997
Who?

154
00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:29.197
Us, of course.

155
00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:33.397
-The Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

156
00:09:34.897 --> 00:09:36.597
You can't.

157
00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:38.597
You're children.

158
00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:40.997
It's all right. We can do it.

159
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.497
Guys.

160
00:09:43.597 --> 00:09:47.597
Do you not care if you never get to eat Amuro's cake again?

161
00:09:47.597 --> 00:09:50.897
That can't happen! We have to catch the perp!

162
00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.397
Fine...

163
00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:03.597
Azusa, can we set up a camera here tonight?

164
00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:05.797
What? A camera here?

165
00:10:05.797 --> 00:10:08.697
Conan, you don't need to do that.

166
00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:12.197
Yeah. This is the store's problem.

167
00:10:12.197 --> 00:10:13.497
But...

168
00:10:13.497 --> 00:10:14.697
Don't worry.

169
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:18.897
I'll feed all of you delicious cake soon.

170
00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:20.297
-Really? -Really?

171
00:10:20.297 --> 00:10:22.397
Have you come up with a solution?

172
00:10:22.397 --> 00:10:25.497
Yeah, I've got an idea.

173
00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:35.197
What? You were filming the store from outside?

174
00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:38.597
Yeah, from closing time yesterday to this morning.

175
00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:40.797
I'm curious why the cakes are melting

176
00:10:40.797 --> 00:10:43.597
when the fridge isn't broken.

177
00:10:43.597 --> 00:10:47.597
You look into anything that makes you curious.

178
00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:52.197
Actually, it's because those kids who are excited

179
00:10:52.197 --> 00:10:54.697
about your cake would be disappointed.

180
00:10:54.697 --> 00:10:55.897
Really?

181
00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:59.897
So you'll investigate anything for the people important to you.

182
00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:03.897
So, did you find anything after watching the store all night?

183
00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:08.997
I didn't notice anything suspicious.

184
00:11:08.997 --> 00:11:10.397
Here you go.

185
00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:12.297
What? It's not melted.

186
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.097
Yeah, it was fine today.

187
00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:17.997
They don't melt every day?

188
00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:21.097
They fall apart...

189
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.497
about two out of every three days.

190
00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:27.097
Two out of three days?

191
00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:29.597
And it's not regular either.

192
00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:30.897
Really?

193
00:11:41.864 --> 00:11:44.564
"Teitan Elementary school" -I set up a camera watching Cafe Poirot

194
00:11:44.564 --> 00:11:47.364
"Class 1-B" -for three days after that.

195
00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:51.964
What?

196
00:11:51.964 --> 00:11:54.764
We can't see inside the store.

197
00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:56.864
Why?

198
00:11:56.864 --> 00:11:59.064
It's hard to tell from this video.

199
00:11:59.064 --> 00:12:02.664
"Day 1 - 21 April, Day 2 - 22 April" -It happened twice out of three days.

200
00:12:02.664 --> 00:12:04.964
"Day 3 - 23 April" -The first time was 11 seconds

201
00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:07.064
"11 seconds at 01:00 am" -at 1 am on the 21st.

202
00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:09.564
"12 seconds at 02:26 am" -The second time was 12 seconds

203
00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:12.564
at 2:26 a.m. today, the 23rd.

204
00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:15.064
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -The 21st and today?

205
00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:17.564
Those are both days the cakes melted.

206
00:12:17.564 --> 00:12:19.064
-We knew it. -We knew it.

207
00:12:19.064 --> 00:12:23.264
In other words, it's likely something happened

208
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:25.564
during the time we couldn't see inside the store.

209
00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:26.664
I know!

210
00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:30.864
The perp came in during that time and melted the cakes.

211
00:12:30.864 --> 00:12:34.064
But the store was locked.

212
00:12:34.064 --> 00:12:36.564
Are there any signs the lock was broken?

213
00:12:36.564 --> 00:12:38.864
No, there aren't.

214
00:12:38.864 --> 00:12:41.364
In other words, this is an impossible crime.

215
00:12:41.364 --> 00:12:45.464
Or else the perp is someone who has the key.

216
00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:46.564
Oh.

217
00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:50.064
What? You think I did it?

218
00:12:50.064 --> 00:12:51.464
Hey.

219
00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:54.764
There's always a car passing by

220
00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:57.264
when we can't see inside the store.

221
00:12:57.264 --> 00:12:59.664
Yeah. What about it?

222
00:12:59.664 --> 00:13:04.764
It always passes by when we can't see inside the other stores, too.

223
00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:06.064
See?

224
00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:07.664
You're right.

225
00:13:07.664 --> 00:13:09.764
Is it the perp's car?

226
00:13:09.764 --> 00:13:11.364
It's possible.

227
00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:13.364
Right, Conan?

228
00:13:13.364 --> 00:13:18.864
Yeah, but cars pass by even on days when the cakes don't melt.

229
00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.864
We can't draw any conclusions from this.

230
00:13:21.864 --> 00:13:24.764
But it happens every time the cakes melt.

231
00:13:24.764 --> 00:13:27.464
It must be connected.

232
00:13:28.964 --> 00:13:33.164
Well, we don't have any other clues.

233
00:13:33.164 --> 00:13:36.764
I'll ask the Dr. Agasa to make it easier to see.

234
00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:42.564
By Dr. Agasa, do you mean the Dr. Agasa who makes all kinds

235
00:13:42.564 --> 00:13:43.964
of interesting gadgets for you?

236
00:13:43.964 --> 00:13:46.064
What? Yeah.

237
00:13:47.164 --> 00:13:48.564
I see.

238
00:13:57.164 --> 00:14:00.264
-That's a taxi. -And...

239
00:14:00.264 --> 00:14:02.464
"21 April" "23 April"

240
00:14:02.464 --> 00:14:04.764
"Teiko Transit 227" -It's the same taxi on both days.

241
00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:09.364
The same taxi passes by when we can't see the interior of the store?

242
00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:12.964
Has there always been a refrigerator here?

243
00:14:12.964 --> 00:14:16.264
It's a cake fridge.

244
00:14:16.264 --> 00:14:18.364
Why?

245
00:14:18.364 --> 00:14:21.264
There was nothing wrong when you made them last night.

246
00:14:21.264 --> 00:14:24.564
I examined the refrigerator and there's nothing wrong with it.

247
00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:27.064
The drone started flying on its own!

248
00:14:27.064 --> 00:14:30.464
No one touched the controller.

249
00:14:30.464 --> 00:14:32.364
Is it the perp's car?

250
00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:35.264
I finally figured it out.

251
00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:36.364
-What? -What?

252
00:14:36.364 --> 00:14:38.764
The perp destroying the cakes.

253
00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:46.964
"Teiko Transit 227" -Car 227, head to Beika Station.

254
00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:50.764
Car 227, there's a Mouri at Beika Station.

255
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:52.764
Can you get there?

256
00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:54.864
Yes. This is Car 227.

257
00:14:54.864 --> 00:14:57.964
Mouri at Beika Station. Roger that.

258
00:15:00.064 --> 00:15:02.164
Excuse me.

259
00:15:02.164 --> 00:15:04.064
"Azusa Calling" -It's from Azusa.

260
00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:05.464
Then it must be.

261
00:15:05.464 --> 00:15:06.764
Yeah.

262
00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:08.864
Excuse me.

263
00:15:08.864 --> 00:15:12.364
I'm sorry, but I already have a passenger.

264
00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.364
I know. I'm Mouri, the person who hired this taxi.

265
00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:17.364
What? Mouri?

266
00:15:17.364 --> 00:15:21.364
Yeah. We're the one who called for a taxi.

267
00:15:21.364 --> 00:15:25.364
But the perp who melted Cafe Poirot's cakes is...

268
00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:29.864
"Cafe Poirot"

269
00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:31.264
Ayumi was right.

270
00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.364
"Sorry. Poirot's special cake is sold out today." -The cakes melted

271
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:36.264
when we couldn't see inside the store.

272
00:15:36.264 --> 00:15:37.464
I knew it.

273
00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:39.964
But why couldn't we see inside?

274
00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:42.264
Because the windows fogged up.

275
00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:44.264
Why?

276
00:15:44.264 --> 00:15:46.364
It's because of...

277
00:15:46.364 --> 00:15:47.464
this.

278
00:15:47.464 --> 00:15:49.064
-What? -What?

279
00:15:50.264 --> 00:15:52.964
This kettle expels steam when the water boils, right?

280
00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:56.664
Yeah.

281
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.864
Is that what made the windows fog up?

282
00:15:58.864 --> 00:16:03.864
Yeah. And this electric kettle is an IoT appliance, right?

283
00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:07.464
So you used your phone to boil the water?

284
00:16:07.464 --> 00:16:08.664
I got it.

285
00:16:08.664 --> 00:16:12.964
She was turning the kettle on using her phone during the night.

286
00:16:12.964 --> 00:16:16.464
That makes it possible to melt the cakes without being in the store.

287
00:16:16.464 --> 00:16:19.964
Hold on. I wouldn't do that.

288
00:16:19.964 --> 00:16:22.664
It's not Azusa.

289
00:16:22.664 --> 00:16:25.164
What? Then who did it?

290
00:16:25.164 --> 00:16:30.064
The perp was reflected in the windows of the store.

291
00:16:30.064 --> 00:16:31.264
What?

292
00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:32.664
That car?

293
00:16:32.664 --> 00:16:34.764
It was a taxi, right?

294
00:16:34.764 --> 00:16:38.464
Yeah. We talked to the taxi driver of that car.

295
00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.664
"Teiko Transit 227" -Every night after midnight,

296
00:16:40.664 --> 00:16:43.764
he naps near Cafe Poirot.

297
00:16:43.764 --> 00:16:46.764
When he's radioed by dispatch...

298
00:16:49.064 --> 00:16:52.364
He passes by in front of Cafe Poirot.

299
00:16:53.864 --> 00:16:56.264
The window fogged up by the steam

300
00:16:56.264 --> 00:16:59.664
from the electric kettle makes it reflective like a mirror,

301
00:16:59.664 --> 00:17:03.564
reflecting the taxi passing in front of the store.

302
00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:06.664
When I examined the times he was radioed,

303
00:17:06.664 --> 00:17:08.664
it was the times the window fogged up.

304
00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:11.964
In other words, it matched the days the cakes melted.

305
00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:16.064
So did the taxi driver do it?

306
00:17:16.064 --> 00:17:18.464
No, the perp is...

307
00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:21.364
The perp is the taxi's radio.

308
00:17:21.364 --> 00:17:22.464
Right?

309
00:17:22.464 --> 00:17:24.864
That's right. The kettle's electrical circuits were being activated

310
00:17:24.864 --> 00:17:27.564
by the taxi's radio.

311
00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:28.864
The frequency of the taxi's radio

312
00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:33.464
and the on and off switch of the kettle happened to match.

313
00:17:33.464 --> 00:17:36.864
What? Is that possible?

314
00:17:36.864 --> 00:17:39.064
It's called radio-frequency interference.

315
00:17:39.064 --> 00:17:41.364
It happens all the time.

316
00:17:41.364 --> 00:17:42.964
Really?

317
00:17:42.964 --> 00:17:46.464
It's what happened to the drone that flew on its own at the Dr. Agasa's.

318
00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:47.464
What?

319
00:17:49.264 --> 00:17:52.764
You were talking to me with your badge, remember?

320
00:17:52.764 --> 00:17:54.264
That's it.

321
00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:58.064
Our badges were causing radio-frequency interference with the drone.

322
00:17:58.064 --> 00:18:02.664
Yeah. These badges have a broad range,

323
00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:05.064
so their radio waves must be strong.

324
00:18:05.064 --> 00:18:09.164
We'd better tell the Dr. Agasa to change the frequency of his drone.

325
00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:14.164
And that radio-frequency interference was causing the cakes to melt.

326
00:18:14.164 --> 00:18:16.264
-What? -How?

327
00:18:16.264 --> 00:18:18.764
You always keep the kettle here, right?

328
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.064
Yeah...

329
00:18:20.064 --> 00:18:21.164
Oh.

330
00:18:21.164 --> 00:18:22.264
That's right.

331
00:18:22.264 --> 00:18:23.864
This electric kettle...

332
00:18:25.264 --> 00:18:27.364
expels steam when it boils.

333
00:18:27.364 --> 00:18:33.964
The vent on the back of refrigerator draws in the hot vapor,

334
00:18:33.964 --> 00:18:38.064
turning the inside of the fridge into a sauna

335
00:18:38.064 --> 00:18:41.364
for the several seconds the windows are fogged up.

336
00:18:41.364 --> 00:18:43.164
That makes the cakes melt,

337
00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.864
and then they're chilled that way.

338
00:18:45.864 --> 00:18:48.864
Then I'd better stop using this.

339
00:18:48.864 --> 00:18:52.364
Couldn't you just put it somewhere else?

340
00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:55.664
Oh, right. I'll try it.

341
00:18:55.664 --> 00:18:59.364
Does this mean we can eat Amuro's cake again?

342
00:18:59.364 --> 00:19:01.664
Of course you can.

343
00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:05.264
But it's a slightly different cake now.

344
00:19:07.764 --> 00:19:10.964
It's a half-baked cake that's melted from the start.

345
00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:12.664
Half-baked cake?

346
00:19:12.664 --> 00:19:16.264
It looks like a shriveled cake.

347
00:19:16.264 --> 00:19:18.764
It's made that way on purpose.

348
00:19:18.764 --> 00:19:23.764
But the sponge inside is cooked.

349
00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:25.164
See?

350
00:19:26.764 --> 00:19:28.164
Amazing!

351
00:19:28.164 --> 00:19:29.764
It looks delicious!

352
00:19:29.764 --> 00:19:33.564
What? The solution you mentioned...

353
00:19:33.564 --> 00:19:34.664
Yeah.

354
00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:39.064
With these, unlike cakes that are already frosted,

355
00:19:39.064 --> 00:19:43.064
I can store the cream and cake separately.

356
00:19:43.064 --> 00:19:46.264
Then you don't have to worry about them melting.

357
00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:48.964
That's right. I just have to add the cream and fruit

358
00:19:48.964 --> 00:19:51.364
before serving them to customers.

359
00:19:51.364 --> 00:19:54.264
That's not too much trouble at all.

360
00:19:54.264 --> 00:19:57.964
Nope. And now you can tell them apart from the cakes

361
00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.964
from that other bakery.

362
00:19:59.964 --> 00:20:03.564
Amuro, you were thinking of recipes for cakes that couldn't melt

363
00:20:03.564 --> 00:20:07.164
instead of why the cakes were melting?

364
00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.364
Yeah.

365
00:20:08.364 --> 00:20:11.664
After all, isn't that my job?

366
00:20:11.664 --> 00:20:14.364
Well, that aside,

367
00:20:14.364 --> 00:20:18.364
I hope you're doing your job as a public security officer.

368
00:20:18.364 --> 00:20:19.764
Hey!

369
00:20:20.864 --> 00:20:24.364
You've got something tasty looking there.

370
00:20:24.364 --> 00:20:28.764
In that case, why don't all of you try it?

371
00:20:28.764 --> 00:20:31.264
-All right! -All right!

372
00:21:51.364 --> 00:21:53.364
"Cafe Poirot"

373
00:21:54.864 --> 00:21:58.364
This place's cakes are so good.

374
00:21:58.364 --> 00:22:02.264
Who said he didn't want cake first thing in the morning?

375
00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:04.664
Dude, these are really good!

376
00:22:04.664 --> 00:22:07.964
They're even better than the last cake!

377
00:22:07.964 --> 00:22:10.964
The creamy texture is great!

378
00:22:10.964 --> 00:22:16.064
Maybe that's why they taste even more strongly of eggs than before.

379
00:22:16.064 --> 00:22:19.164
Yeah. I use the same number of eggs,

380
00:22:19.164 --> 00:22:20.664
but in a half-baked cake,

381
00:22:20.664 --> 00:22:22.064
the flavor comes through stronger.

382
00:22:22.064 --> 00:22:25.764
And this cream. It's not too sweet.

383
00:22:25.764 --> 00:22:30.064
I use yogurt in the cream and dough.

384
00:22:30.064 --> 00:22:33.764
So this is yogurt cream I'm tasting.

385
00:22:33.764 --> 00:22:38.464
Yes. Putting yogurt in the dough makes it softer.

386
00:22:38.464 --> 00:22:42.564
Putting it in the cream makes it taste better with fruit.

387
00:22:42.564 --> 00:22:46.364
You can have bites of just dough or just cream and fruit.

388
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:50.164
It's fun how you can eat it in all kinds of ways.

389
00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:53.664
I'm delighted to hear that.

390
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:55.464
That's right.

391
00:22:55.464 --> 00:22:58.264
I forgot why I came here.

392
00:22:58.264 --> 00:22:59.564
Here.

393
00:22:59.564 --> 00:23:00.564
Thank you.

394
00:23:00.564 --> 00:23:02.164
"This letter is to notify you of the Tokyo Summit traffic control plan."

395
00:23:02.164 --> 00:23:05.364
Oh, it's for next month's Tokyo Summit.

396
00:23:05.364 --> 00:23:09.764
Those roads are going to be closed the day of the summit.

397
00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:14.964
Azusa, I've told the manager but I'm taking that day off.

398
00:23:14.964 --> 00:23:16.064
I'm counting on you.

399
00:23:16.064 --> 00:23:17.564
Sure.

400
00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:19.964
The manager told me.

401
00:23:19.964 --> 00:23:24.564
Which means Amuro will be involved in the summit's security?

402
00:23:24.564 --> 00:23:25.664
Amuro.

403
00:23:27.064 --> 00:23:30.664
You're not neglecting your public safety duties.

404
00:23:30.664 --> 00:23:33.664
You sure do love investigating, don't you?

405
00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:39.664
At the time, I had no idea the Amuro,

406
00:23:39.664 --> 00:23:42.164
who was enjoying baking cakes over solving cases,

407
00:23:42.164 --> 00:23:44.464
-There's more. -would do something like that.

408
00:23:44.464 --> 00:23:45.564
All right!

409
00:23:54.364 --> 00:23:57.364
"Next Episode" -Mifuyu! What's wrong, Mifuyu?

410
00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:01.764
Mifuyu, hang in there!

411
00:24:01.764 --> 00:24:03.264
Why?

412
00:24:03.264 --> 00:24:07.964
Is this really where your friend was stabbed in the chest and died?

413
00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:12.064
And there's a knife over here.

414
00:24:12.064 --> 00:24:16.364
Tabata must've dumped Mifuyu's body on the way here.

415
00:24:16.364 --> 00:24:18.264
Darn it! She got us!

416
00:24:18.264 --> 00:24:24.364
Next Conan, "The Real Perp's Scream"

417
00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:27.207
Next Conan's Hint:

"Suitcase"

419
00:24:29.207 --> 00:24:31.207
Our movie's such a hit, the frogs are croaking!

420
00:24:31.207 --> 00:24:32.207
Ribbit, ribbit!

421
00:24:32.207 --> 00:24:33.807
-But your joke level... -Is zero.
