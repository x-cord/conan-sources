1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,040
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Today Yoko's appearing. Long time no see.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
Even TV idols have a lot of worries.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,753
"Mouri Detective Agency"

9
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,953
"Mouri Detective Agency" -L-O-V-E

10
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,853
I love Yoko!

11
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:05,353
Cutie Yoko!

12
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,253
-Oh, boy, don't you get tired of watching the same video -Yoko!

13
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:12,953
-over and over again during the day? -Yoko!

14
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:14,653
-That's enough! -Yoko!

15
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,453
Why not? I have so little work to do anyway.

16
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:22,253
But you have a lot of mail.

17
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:24,453
It may be a job offer.

18
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:25,853
I will look through them later,

19
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,753
so just leave them somewhere around, okay?

20
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:33,253
You don't have any work to do, and neither are you motivated.

21
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,253
Let's see, the electricity bill

22
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:40,553
and an invitation to give a lecture.

23
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:42,753
Oh, my...

24
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:45,053
This letter is from Yoko.

25
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,053
What?

26
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,653
It's an invitation to a party.

27
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:51,953
Great.

28
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:56,153
An engagement party will be held at her friend's house.

29
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:59,153
Engagement?

30
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,753
It's her friend who got engaged

31
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:11,853
and asked her to arrange to meet the renowned Detective Mr. Mouri.

32
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:13,353
You're going to the party, aren't you? Father?

33
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:18,753
Engagement...

34
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:21,253
He's in a world of his own.

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:28,753
"The Secrets of Pop Stars (Part 1)"

36
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:32,853
Well, thank you, Yoko.

37
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:35,953
It is a great pleasure to be invited

38
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:38,353
to the engagement party of your best friend.

39
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:39,353
The pleasure is mine.

40
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,553
"Yoko Okino (22), Idol" -I'm sorry for inviting you on such short notice.

41
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:44,853
You must be surprised.

42
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,153
No. Not at all.

43
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:48,753
You're, right.

44
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,753
You were the one who was sadly mistaken and terribly disappointed.

45
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:56,253
So? Who is she? Your engaged friend?

46
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:57,853
You will see her soon.

47
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:59,853
All of you know her very well.

48
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,053
Do I know the person well?

49
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,253
Hi, Yoko.

50
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,753
Oh, dear...

51
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:07,153
You really brought him here.

52
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:10,053
The renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

53
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:13,253
If I'm not mistaken, you're...

54
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:17,953
the person playing the role of Detective Samonji.

55
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,653
Osamu Kenzaki.

56
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:21,953
"Osamu Kenzaki (26), Actor"

57
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:27,953
So, then, you're Yoko's engaged friend?

58
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,653
Well, actually, no... I am her future husband-to-be.

59
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:35,253
Yoko's best friend is my future bride.

60
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,753
Anyway, I think it's really great that you brought

61
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:39,053
the renowned Detective Mouri to us.

62
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,153
She'll sure be delighted to meet him.

63
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:45,153
In fact, she doesn't know that Mr. Mouri is here yet.

64
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:47,253
I wanted to surprise her.

65
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,253
Okay, let's go to see her surprised look.

66
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,053
There's no answer at all.

67
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,353
But, everyone should already be here by now.

68
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,353
The door's not locked.

69
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,253
I'm really sorry, Mr. Mouri.

70
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,553
You came all the way out here but I treated you so cruelly.

71
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:25,553
Don't worry about it.

72
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:28,153
Being struck by a famous actress like you

73
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,453
will be something special to look back on.

74
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,953
"Kaoru Kusano (20), Actress" -I'm recently being hassled by a stalker.

75
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:35,253
I saw a strange man looking through the peep hole of the door,

76
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,153
so I couldn't help striking at you.

77
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,253
If you are his admirer or fan, you should have known his face?

78
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:45,053
Well then, Yoko's friend who got engaged to Mr. Kenzaki is...

79
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,453
Yes, it is me.

80
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:51,053
The formal wedding ceremony will be this coming spring.

81
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:54,253
It's still off-the-records to the media.

82
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,953
That reminds me,

83
00:05:55,953 --> 00:06:00,053
Kaoru co-starred with Mr. Kenzaki in "Detective Samonji".

84
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,953
That's right.

85
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:05,053
We brought them both here to celebrate and tease them,

86
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:08,253
while watching the TV program being aired tonight.

87
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:10,953
"Yuki Takeno (22), Multi-talented" -The perfect couple...

88
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,553
Yuki Takeno.

89
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,853
I think your nails are a little bit too flashy, Yuki.

90
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:21,453
These false nails are cool, isn't it?

91
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:26,253
But it's a pity, Yoko Okino.

92
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,553
Yuki Takeno and Kaoru Kusano...

93
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:32,053
One more person, and all four would be present.

94
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,553
How regrettable indeed.

95
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,653
Did someone call me?

96
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:40,453
Terumi.

97
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,753
Well, well, you have turned out quite nicely.

98
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:49,353
"Terumi Hoshino (23), Actress" -Well, Yoko told me that I had to come.

99
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:52,053
Am I interrupting? If so, I can leave.

100
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,153
Come, come.

101
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:56,853
Now the four "Earth Ladies" have gathered here again after a long recess.

102
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:58,653
Earth Ladies?

103
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,353
You may not know, but...

104
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,553
Kaoru Kusano means "Fragrant" and "Field of Grass"

105
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,153
which is represented for the fragrant field of sweet grass!

106
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,953
Yuki Takeno means "Snow" and "Mountain Area"

107
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:09,253
is for white snow covering the high mountain.

108
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,653
Terumi Hoshino means "Beautifully glittering" and "Stars"

109
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:12,953
is for the glittering stars in heaven.

110
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:16,153
Yoko Okino means "Ocean" and "Offshore"

111
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,353
is for the sparkling waves of the blue sea.

112
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:23,153
So, all four of them together are called "Earth Ladies".

113
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,553
That's figures.

114
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:28,853
Each of the names stands for a superb view of the earth.

115
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,353
Yeah, but Earth Ladies broke up

116
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,753
because of a quarrel between Terumi and Kaoru.

117
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,753
So, only Yoko continued on as a singer.

118
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:41,553
Anyway, I was surprised that Kaoru, the youngest of the four of us,

119
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,553
turned out to be the first to get married.

120
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,153
Actually, so did I.

121
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:48,753
I thought Terumi would be the first to get married and settle down.

122
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:52,253
Hey, I thought you once said something about your loved one?

123
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:54,853
Yes, yes, tell us what happened to your relationship with the guy?

124
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,153
Did you confess your love to him?

125
00:07:57,453 --> 00:08:00,153
Not really.

126
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:04,253
Besides, like some people say, "Marriage is the tomb of love and trust."

127
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:07,753
So, it's much easier to love him from a distance.

128
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,153
That way I can keep him in my heart as my ideal man.

129
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,353
Hey, just what do you mean by that?

130
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,053
Terumi...

131
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,853
But who is that old man with the kid?

132
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:20,853
Oh, yeah...

133
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:23,153
Are you Kenzaki's brother or something?

134
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,053
I'm...

135
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:30,253
It's about time "Detective Samonji" will be starting.

136
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,853
"Atsushi Maguma (23), Kaoru's manager" -Don't you want to watch it?

137
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,453
I'll pass it up.

138
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:36,353
In the meantime, I'm going to take a bath.

139
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,953
Just tell me when it's over.

140
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,953
But... As the food's getting cold,

141
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,253
I'd like to have dinner together now.

142
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,653
Please don't bug me.

143
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,353
I said "Pass". Don't make me say the same thing over and over again.

144
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:49,653
When will a loser like you get off telling me what to do?

145
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:52,353
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,253
Wait. Kaoru.

147
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,453
She hasn't changed at all.

148
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,353
She's always embarrassed to watch the programs she stars on,

149
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,153
with other people.

150
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,853
Just as we planned.

151
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,253
Are you really going to do it?

152
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:10,553
Of course. That's why we invited you.

153
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:12,353
Do what?

154
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,753
We'll be waiting for you in the living room.

155
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:15,853
Yoko, why don't you go first,

156
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,453
and change into your costume in the restroom?

157
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,453
All right.

158
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:29,453
That's none other than

159
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,853
the costume that the "Earth Ladies" wore at the time they debuted.

160
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:36,853
I see. When Kaoru comes out of the bathroom...

161
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:40,253
Yes. Three of us are going to celebrate her engagement

162
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,853
by wearing these costumes and singing our debut song.

163
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:47,353
It's so embarrassing to wear this costume, though.

164
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,953
Great! It looks nice! Lovely Yoko!

165
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:54,953
You're just too much! You know that?

166
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:58,253
Thank you for waiting.

167
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,653
Do you really want to do it?

168
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:06,753
Well then, next I'll go get rejuvenated.

169
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:09,853
Hey, Yuki. Hurry up. I also have to change into.

170
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:10,853
See you later.

171
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,553
Hey, let's all write a few lines each

172
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,153
in celebration of Kaoru's engagement.

173
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:23,253
I wish you much love and happiness.

174
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,453
Here you go.

175
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,553
Okay then, next, Terumi.

176
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,853
Don't mind me, I think I'll pass.

177
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,253
It's a good opportunity to make peace with Kaoru.

178
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,653
I guess I have no choice, then.

179
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,553
Hey.

180
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:44,853
Did Kaoru really want to see Pops?

181
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:51,153
Yeah, as she said, weirdo follows her around.

182
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,553
She wants him to find out who the man is...

183
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,753
Once she moves in with me,

184
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,553
she won't be troubled by the man anymore?

185
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:00,953
Yeah.

186
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:07,953
That's a message card?

187
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:11,353
Yeah, we're all writing our comments on the card.

188
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:13,953
All right, then I'll go get transform myself.

189
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:17,953
Look. What is this?

190
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,253
"I express my condolences" -Oh, no.

191
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,853
"I express my condolences" and she stubs out her cigarette on it.

192
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,453
Just what Terumi would do.

193
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:28,753
If Terumi dares to do that, then I can do this...

194
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:34,253
With a loving kiss.

195
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:37,853
Hey! Manager, why don't you write something to her?

196
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,753
No, I...

197
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,753
Come on, you don't have to be modest.

198
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,653
Well, now, you can write anything, comments,

199
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,053
complaints, whatever you like.

200
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,053
Please.

201
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:58,253
"Congratulations"

202
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,953
I'm sorry,

203
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,753
you don't have to if you really don't want to.

204
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:07,253
No, I'm just glad.

205
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,553
Here, I changed clothes.

206
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:13,253
It fits you just right.

207
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,853
Then, I'll go call Kaoru.

208
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,853
What's wrong with him?

209
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,153
I have no idea.

210
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:33,753
Hey! None of you watched my drama seriously,

211
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,353
so none of you really care.

212
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:37,853
Calm down.

213
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:40,153
It finished rewinding.

214
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,453
Okay, well just wait for Kaoru to come.

215
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,753
Where is she?

216
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,053
Well...

217
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:52,053
I tried calling her many times, but she didn't answer.

218
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:55,853
She may have become dizzy or fainted in the bathroom.

219
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:59,853
Then, Mr. Kenzaki, you should go check it out.

220
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:04,153
I think she's just sulky and locked herself in the bathroom.

221
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,453
Blood stains.

222
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,353
They lead to the front entrance.

223
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:13,553
Don't tell me that...

224
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:17,253
Kaoru! Now please come out from there.

225
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:19,553
Everyone is waiting for you.

226
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,553
Mr. Kenzaki, open the door.

227
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,753
Hurry!

228
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,753
Kaoru! I'm coming in!

229
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:27,753
Kaoru.

230
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:31,753
Kaoru.

231
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:33,753
Kaoru!

232
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,461
Kaoru.

233
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:45,761
What happened?

234
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,061
How did this all come about?

235
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,361
She still has a pulse.

236
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,361
We must get her to the hospital immediately. Her life depends on it.

237
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,861
Hurry!

238
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:01,161
What happened? I heard someone shouting something.

239
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,361
Kaoru?

240
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,061
Hey! Kaoru! Are you all right?

241
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,061
Kaoru!

242
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:13,361
-Ran, call the ambulance! -Yes.

243
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:20,861
The victim is Ms. Kaoru Kusano, 20 years old.

244
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,761
Room number 1 on the 28th floor.

245
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:30,461
A 20-year-old living alone in this luxury condo.

246
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,761
Some rich kid or something?

247
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:34,161
You don't know, Inspector?

248
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,661
The Earth Ladies?

249
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,361
Earth what? What's that?

250
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,361
Oh, yes.

251
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:41,561
We're the police.

252
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,061
Please.

253
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,461
We're coming.

254
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,761
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,461
I must have the wrong room.

256
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,761
Inspector Megure. We've been waiting for you.

257
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:02,861
There's a lots of TV celebrities.

258
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,761
I see. Now let me ask you one more time.

259
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:10,961
You three women were invited to Ms. Kusano's engagement party.

260
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,561
And while she was in the bathroom,

261
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:17,361
you, one by one, changed into your costumes in the rest room,

262
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,861
to surprise her.

263
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:23,761
Ms. Okino, Ms. Takeno and Ms. Hoshino in that order.

264
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:26,461
And when three of you finished changing,

265
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:30,061
the manager, Mr. Maguma went to the bathroom to call her

266
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,461
but there was no answer.

267
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,961
Next, her fiancee, Mr. Kenzaki went to call her

268
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,361
and opened the door of the bathroom.

269
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:39,161
You found Ms. Kusano lying on the ground

270
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:43,061
and bleeding from the neck, right?

271
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:45,461
Yes.

272
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:48,961
And once again, just like the devil had planned it,

273
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,461
at the scene of the crime, I run into...

274
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,361
Don't be like that.

275
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:56,461
I just happened to be invited here by Ms. Okino.

276
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:58,261
It's just a coincidence.

277
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,461
It is not a mere coincidence but a "meaningful" coincidence.

278
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:01,961
Or maybe better said, mere curse.

279
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:07,761
And? Where is the victim, Ms. Kusano now?

280
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,561
She's been transported to Haido Hospital by ambulance.

281
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,761
We haven't heard from Mr. Maguma,

282
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:14,361
who accompanied her to the hospital,

283
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:16,161
so, we don't know how she is now.

284
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:19,361
Kaoru, is she going to die?

285
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,361
There's no point in waiting,

286
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,061
I'll go call the hospital and ask about her condition.

287
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,161
I'll go with you.

288
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,361
My dad often goes to see the doctor at this hospital

289
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,661
because of his diabetes,

290
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:32,561
so I know the number.

291
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,561
Really? Great! Thanks.

292
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:41,461
And about the person who cut her neck.

293
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,261
Do you think that the killer is someone in this very room?

294
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,261
No way.

295
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,761
But there is possibility, right?

296
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:48,961
But, people often say that the first finder of the body

297
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,061
is the most suspicious.

298
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:55,061
Hey, Hey. I don't have any reason to kill Kaoru

299
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:57,261
and when I found her in the bathroom,

300
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,861
that kid with glasses was with me.

301
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:01,761
Besides, he's the one who told me

302
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,861
to open the door of the bath room to begin with.

303
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,161
Is that right?

304
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:08,061
Yeah! Because...

305
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,461
there was blood dripping from the hall into the entrance.

306
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,461
And when I opened the entrance door,

307
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,461
I found that stuff lying there.

308
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:22,661
A rain jacket, work gloves with holes

309
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:25,261
an eye dropper and a handkerchief.

310
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,061
We found them outside the front door,

311
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,161
so we laid them aside before the ambulance came.

312
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,461
The rain jacket and gloves are covered with blood.

313
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,861
This must be the clothes that the criminal was wearing.

314
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,961
It's slight, but there's a lipstick stain on the handkerchief.

315
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,861
If someone filled this bottle with anesthetic

316
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:53,561
and the culprit used the anesthetic soaked handkerchief

317
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,861
to put her to sleep before committing the murder.

318
00:17:55,861 --> 00:18:00,761
But who did it to Kaoru? It's outrageous.

319
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,061
It's the stalker. He did to her.

320
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:08,361
The stalker scared her, playing spooky Ding-Dong Dash.

321
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:09,461
Ding-Dong?

322
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:12,061
It's a trick of ringing the front doorbell

323
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:14,761
and then running away.

324
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,561
But it's not just a joke, it's a crime.

325
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:21,961
A strange note was always left outside the front door.

326
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,861
It said, "I'll come again,"

327
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:26,461
"I'll come next time,"

328
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,461
and "I'll come even if I die."

329
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,061
It got worse and worse over time.

330
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:37,061
That creepy piece of paper typed with a word processor.

331
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:42,261
I see. That's why Ms. Kusano tried to hit me out of blue

332
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:45,061
when I rang the bell.

333
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,661
Was the door locked at the time of the murder?

334
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,961
It was open.

335
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,361
There were lots of people here

336
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:53,561
so she may have felt safe and left the door unlocked.

337
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:57,661
So, the stalker found the door left open,

338
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,361
went inside the room,

339
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:02,261
came across Ms. Kusano who had just come out after taking a bath.

340
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,861
Then, because Ms. Kusano saw the stalker's face,

341
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,561
the stalker put her to sleep with medicine

342
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,961
and slashed her throat with a weapon.

343
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:12,761
The bloody rain jacket and work gloves were disposed of

344
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:15,461
because they were too conspicuous and would attract negative attention,

345
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:18,561
then the killer fled.

346
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:19,961
Alright, Takagi.

347
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:22,661
Start poking around the condo, looking for clues.

348
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,661
The criminal wore a rain jacket on a day that wasn't raining.

349
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,361
There's got to be a witness.

350
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:30,361
Yes, sir.

351
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,361
But I don't think anyone saw that person

352
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,861
because the person's very cautious.

353
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:37,961
Very cautious?

354
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:42,661
Well, if you were wearing a bloody rain jacket,

355
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,061
you would step on the blood that drips from the jacket, right?

356
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:46,461
But when I saw it,

357
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:51,561
there were no traces of footprints at the bloody entrance.

358
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:54,061
This means that the criminal tried to avoid stepping on the blood

359
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,661
when running away.

360
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,361
That's right.

361
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,461
That's odd...

362
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:08,461
If the criminal saw many shoes in the entrance way,

363
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,561
why did that cautious person come into a room with so many people?

364
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,161
Inspector.

365
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:16,961
What if the criminal deliberately walked with the rain jacket in hand

366
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:20,161
to make the blood drip down on the hallway,

367
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,761
and then tossed them over outside,

368
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:25,461
in order to make it look like he or she ran outside?

369
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:30,561
Yes, and if Ms. Kusano was acquainted with the aggressor,

370
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,761
the person could call her without alerting her.

371
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:34,561
If she defenselessly comes out from the bathtub,

372
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:37,361
then it wouldn't be difficult to make her smell the medicine

373
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,361
and put her to sleep at the door.

374
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,061
Hey, wait!

375
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,261
You mean the murderer is...

376
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,961
Could be one of us.

377
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:52,261
Is that right?

378
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:55,361
Terumi.

379
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,661
That's true.

380
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,961
The restroom that was used as a changing room

381
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:03,861
is between the living room and the bathroom.

382
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,861
Each of us would have had a chance to commit the murder.

383
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,361
Even you...

384
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:12,461
Even so, Yoko couldn't have...

385
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,461
While she was changing, we were waiting in front of the restroom

386
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:19,261
and after that, we went back to the living room with Yoko.

387
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,261
Then I'm also clean.

388
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:25,061
When I found her, I was with this kid.

389
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,661
Yeah.

390
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,761
First, when Kaoru went to the bathroom,

391
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:33,661
you very kindly accompanied her. You couldn't have killed her.

392
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:36,561
You walked to the bathroom with her?

393
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,761
Yes.

394
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:42,261
So, you had the chance to attack her then?

395
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:47,161
Anyway, let me ask each of you.

396
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:48,961
But before that,

397
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:51,461
aren't you forgetting to do something?

398
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,161
The deadly weapon.

399
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,261
The knife that was used to cut Kaoru's throat.

400
00:21:57,261 --> 00:22:02,661
If It's found in our belongings or indoors,

401
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:05,461
the criminal's among us.

402
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,761
I don't think a criminal from outside

403
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,961
would hide the weapon somewhere in this condo.

404
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,361
The criminal may have wiped the blood from the knife,

405
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,861
and the hemoglobin of the blood may be invisible to the naked eye.

406
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:16,461
But, luminol solution can detect

407
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,061
the small amount of hemoglobin in the blood.

408
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,461
It's not something you can hide after all, right?

409
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,361
You're right.

410
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,061
What?

411
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:34,761
What on earth is she?

412
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,061
"Next Episode"

413
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:10,061
This picture...

414
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:12,461
What?

415
00:24:12,461 --> 00:24:14,261
Kaoru...

416
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:15,961
Don't tell me that Kaoru...

417
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:18,761
Maybe it's about time you let it all out?

418
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,661
The real reason for this engagement party.

419
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,761
The real reason?

420
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,561
Oh, well...

421
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:29,061
She may have been planning to kill herself all along.

422
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,161
Next Conan,

423
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,182
"The Secrets of Pop Stars (Part 2)"

424
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,779
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,579
"Work gloves with holes"

426
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,079
-Next. -Well, the victim, Kaoru Kusano.

427
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,779
Her fiancee, Kenzaki. Terumi knows too much...

428
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,179
I don't know.
