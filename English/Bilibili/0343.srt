1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,740
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,640
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,640
The bright convenience store that we all frequently go to.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,440
Something happens in the back of the store.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,268
Yes, this is the Mouri.

9
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:55,068
Oh, Conan?

10
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:57,568
Where are you? It's already late.

11
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,568
You're going to stay over at Dr. Agasa's house tonight?

12
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:05,568
Yep, Haibara's cold got worse because of me

13
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:09,168
so I want to take care of her.

14
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:12,668
Okay, but what about your change of clothes and school things?

15
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:16,168
Yep! Don't worry. I brought them all here.

16
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,968
Besides, it's almost winter vacation.

17
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,968
May I, Ran?

18
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:24,668
Okay! Take good care of her now.

19
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:26,568
Thank you, Ran.

20
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:27,868
See you!

21
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,668
You don't have to spend the night here

22
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,068
to take care of Ai, Shinichi.

23
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,868
I can take care of her myself.

24
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,268
No.

25
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,668
It's because there have been a lot of

26
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,768
weird people around us lately.

27
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:47,368
I feel like something disturbing may happen soon.

28
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:57,568
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 1)"

29
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,568
Who are you?

30
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:31,168
Teacher.

31
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,068
Jodie?

32
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:38,268
You look very tired, but are you okay?

33
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,068
Oh, yes!

34
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:42,368
I understand that you may be having a tough time

35
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,868
with the bad behavior of the brats of Japan,

36
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:45,668
but don't let them get to you!

37
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:49,668
No! No! They're all good students!

38
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,168
I'll have to say goodbye to all of you soon.

39
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:55,968
It's so very sad.

40
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,768
Jodie, you're going to quit?

41
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,368
No!

42
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,468
She has some family affairs to attend to,

43
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,768
so she'll be leaving us at the end of this month

44
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:08,568
to return to the U.S.

45
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,768
I wonder what her real affair is all about.

46
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,268
I wonder.

47
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:18,168
Although it was only for a short time,

48
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,668
I really enjoyed studying together with all of you!

49
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:24,568
I'm sure that you'll be going through a lot of things

50
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,168
from now on too,

51
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:30,368
but I know that you'll all pull through!

52
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,668
So, good luck and stick it out!

53
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:35,768
Jodie.

54
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,368
Jodie.

55
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,868
Isn't it about time you tell us?

56
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,468
Tell you what?

57
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,568
The reason why you're quitting school.

58
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:48,268
What is this family affair that you're referring to?

59
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,368
Oh! That's a lie!

60
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:55,368
The truth is I've been looking for something for a long time.

61
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:58,768
It's a map of a very precious treasure

62
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,868
and I finally found it.

63
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,468
Well, I think I found it!

64
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:06,468
A treasure map?

65
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:09,568
Maybe she's talking about her first love?

66
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,868
But if so, I don't think she'd say map

67
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:15,568
because it would be the treasure itself that's precious.

68
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,268
Oh, wait, Jodie!

69
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,368
You're not making sense!

70
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:20,868
No! It's a secret!

71
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:24,368
I can't tell you two!

72
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:27,468
A secret makes a woman a woman!

73
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,668
-Okay? -Okay.

74
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:32,668
But, how disappointing.

75
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:35,768
I really wish he could've taken your classes too.

76
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,268
"He"?

77
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:39,468
Oh! You mean Shinichi?

78
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:40,668
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:43,168
Let him be!

80
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,768
He leaves his wife all alone

81
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,168
saying that he has cases to solve, the pits.

82
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:50,568
He would never be able to appreciate the merits of Jodie's lessons!

83
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,868
Wife...

84
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:56,868
I mean how long is he going to take to solve one case.

85
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:59,468
He should just give up and come home.

86
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,668
No way, he would never.

87
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,468
He'll never run from something part way.

88
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:08,468
Because he loves to put on airs.

89
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,568
Oh, that's the thing you love, love, love about him.

90
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:14,768
-Just totally irresistible. -Excuse me!

91
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:18,768
I'm just saying that he likes to put on airs and is stubborn.

92
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,568
Who cares if he comes home or not?

93
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:26,668
Oh! Talking about coming home, did the cool kid come home?

94
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,768
-What? You mean, Conan? -That brat with glasses?

95
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:33,768
Yes! He's always at Dr. Agasa's house when I call recently!

96
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,068
You mean he ran away from home? How sassy of him.

97
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,468
-Next time I see him, I'll... -No!

98
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:41,868
He's taking care of Ai.

99
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,268
He says that he's to blame for Ai catching a cold,

100
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,868
so he's going to take care of her until she recovers completely

101
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,968
and brought his change of clothes and everything over.

102
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:52,368
Oh, you mean that brat has a soft side too.

103
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:54,268
Well, sorry.

104
00:06:56,168 --> 00:07:00,068
Right! Why don't we go to Jodie's condo and have a party?

105
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:02,168
What is it, all of a sudden?

106
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,668
Party?

107
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,368
A small farewell party for you, Jodie!

108
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,968
We can buy snacks and drinks at the convenience store!

109
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:10,268
Sounds great!

110
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,668
-What do you say, Jodie? -Okay!

111
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,268
Let's go to the convenience store in front of the station then!

112
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,568
Oh, the one that Aya is working at!

113
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:19,268
Aya?

114
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:21,668
Was there a student by that name?

115
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,868
She's our classmate when we were in intermediate school!

116
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:27,968
She's a cheerful girl, so I'm sure you'll like her too!

117
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,968
Thank you very much!

118
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,468
Welcome!

119
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,868
-Excuse me. -Yes?

120
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:47,868
Is there a girl by the name of Aya Nanakawa working here?

121
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,768
Oh.

122
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,768
She's inside with the shopkeeper.

123
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,968
How many times do I have to tell you?

124
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:02,068
During peak hours, we're desperate and need all the help we can get.

125
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,368
It seems we're just going to have to hire someone new

126
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:06,268
to take your place.

127
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,768
Oh, no.

128
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:09,668
What's wrong, Aya?

129
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:12,368
Ran.

130
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,668
-Ran! -Aya.

131
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,968
What's the matter, Aya?

132
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:21,668
Who are you people?

133
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,468
Friends!

134
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:26,668
I'm a high school teacher!

135
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,468
What seems to be the matter?

136
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,568
A lot's the matter.

137
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,068
The total sales of the store

138
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,968
and the number of items in the store don't match!

139
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:38,568
And this happens only when Aya's in charge of closing the store!

140
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:39,768
How rude!

141
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,668
Why should Aya be blamed for it?

142
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,568
Maybe one of your customers is shoplifting.

143
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,868
Aya tells me that this shop is crowded in the mornings and at nights,

144
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,168
so maybe then...

145
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:54,468
Yeah, I thought so too,

146
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,768
that's why I set up surveillance cameras

147
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:59,168
when this shop was renovated!

148
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:04,668
I kept very close watch, but there was no such customer.

149
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,968
Then, maybe it was a burglar?

150
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,768
I thought of that too!

151
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:12,368
That's why last night, I parked my car opposite the store

152
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,668
and kept watch right through!

153
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:17,268
But, all I saw was Aya who came out after cleaning the store

154
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,868
and closing the shutter.

155
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,968
Nobody came to the store from then to the following morning

156
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:24,868
when the store was opened.

157
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,968
When I opened the shop and checked the storeroom,

158
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,268
the figures didn't match.

159
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,368
The only thing thinkable is that Aya stole.

160
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,968
I didn't steal anything!!

161
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:37,268
By the way, what was stolen?

162
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,368
A lot of things.

163
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,068
Game software, DVDs, CDs,

164
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,868
lunch boxes and riceballs, mineral water, Oolong tea,

165
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:48,368
Cokes and snacks including chocolate.

166
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,968
I can just see young kids gather around,

167
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,468
playing music and games, watching DVDs

168
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:56,368
and catching their thrills!

169
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,068
True.

170
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,568
But, if Aya were the one,

171
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,668
wouldn't Aya be displayed on the surveillance camera?

172
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:07,868
The surveillance cameras are set to go off at closing.

173
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,368
Because the electric bills aren't all that cheap either.

174
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:13,168
Then, the light here is turned off because of that?

175
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:16,068
Well, I'm trying to economize to regain what I can,

176
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,268
of my losses.

177
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,868
The customers who come to use the restroom

178
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,568
are all regular customers,

179
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,968
so they can find the restroom even if it's dark.

180
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:28,768
Aya, have you noticed anyone who looks suspicious?

181
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:31,868
No. I wouldn't say suspicious, but...

182
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:34,968
There are three customers that I'm concerned about.

183
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,368
-Huh? -Is something bothering you?

184
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,268
What type of people are they?

185
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:42,768
They all come to use the toilet a lot.

186
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,668
Tell us more about it!

187
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:48,468
One looks to be a university student

188
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:50,568
and occasionally stands and reads game magazines

189
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,768
until almost closing time.

190
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,668
A game freak.

191
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:58,168
But, he never bought any games here.

192
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:01,468
All he buys are cup noodles and pouched food.

193
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:04,068
Besides, he's pretty selfish,

194
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:07,068
and cuts in line at the register.

195
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,568
Oh.

196
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,168
The second one is a man who looks to be a salaried worker.

197
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,668
He seems to be very timid and is overly hesitant over everything.

198
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:16,168
Overly hesitant?

199
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:19,068
Yes, he's always looking down.

200
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,468
Even when the university student I mentioned earlier cuts in line,

201
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:24,068
he lets him do so without getting angry.

202
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,068
Even when using the restroom, he lets everybody go on before him

203
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,968
saying that he's not in a rush.

204
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:32,168
He always buys things like a toothbrush set, batteries,

205
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,668
shaving razor sets and towels.

206
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:38,068
All things you would take along when traveling.

207
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:42,368
The third one is a stubborn and thrifty old woman.

208
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,068
Yeah, I know that old lady too.

209
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:49,368
She asks for discounts on lunches that are almost expired.

210
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:52,168
She lectures telling us to compare prices with other stores

211
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:54,568
and to stay on our balls.

212
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:57,368
But that old woman's not a bad person!

213
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,768
She turns off unneeded lights,

214
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,868
and also told me what temperature

215
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:07,168
I should set the air conditioning at, to save money.

216
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:09,368
Well, she talks all she wants with us

217
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:12,168
and leaves without buying a thing, though.

218
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:15,968
Which makes all three of them suspicious.

219
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,568
-Why? -Why do you say that?

220
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,868
Because it could be that the game freak

221
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:25,168
wanted the game software that he couldn't buy.

222
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:26,768
The salaried worker may like to go on trips

223
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:29,268
and maybe wants snacks to take along with him.

224
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:31,068
And, the granny could've been checking out

225
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:34,968
which lunch she wanted to eat without buying anything.

226
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:38,168
All three of them have a possibility of being the culprit.

227
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,368
Gosh!

228
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:41,468
I think that it's more appropriate to suspect Aya

229
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,368
before suspecting the customers.

230
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:48,668
So, I've been trying to tell you that Aya's not that type of girl!

231
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,568
Give me an explanation then,

232
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,468
of why after scolding Aya last month about the same thing,

233
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:56,068
the items stopped missing!

234
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,468
-Huh? -Huh? Really?

235
00:12:58,468 --> 00:12:59,968
Yeah.

236
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:03,368
Since the items stopped missing for a month now,

237
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:07,368
I was determined to stop watching the store after closing last night.

238
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:10,368
I figured that Aya finally repented what she did.

239
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,068
But, when I opened the store this morning,

240
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:15,968
a lot of things were missing again.

241
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,268
She probably couldn't stop herself any longer!

242
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,468
So, if you apologize for what you did up to today,

243
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,868
I'll let you go this time!

244
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,768
If not, you're fired!

245
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:27,768
Hey, Ran, things look really bad!

246
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:28,868
Yes.

247
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,068
Right! Why don't you talk about this to Shinichi?

248
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,068
He can probably solve something like this in no time at all.

249
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:38,068
But, I don't have his phone number.

250
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,368
His number is never displayed.

251
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:43,568
How about you, Sonoko, no inspiration at all?

252
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:47,468
If I was inspired, I wouldn't be saying things like this, would I?

253
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,468
Maybe we can ask Conan?

254
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:53,968
He always comes up with interesting ideas and notices odd things!

255
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,068
I guess so.

256
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:00,268
Although it irks me to ask that glasses kid, a bit.

257
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:03,868
He's at Dr. Agasa's house, so...

258
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:07,768
Jodie.

259
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,268
It's not good relying on somebody

260
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,168
without trying all we can ourselves first!

261
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:20,068
Let's try to work things out for her ourselves.

262
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,368
But...

263
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:23,968
I really haven't stole anything!

264
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,168
You still insist.

265
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:32,468
You never know when you will lose the one you can rely on, so...

266
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:33,768
What?

267
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:40,889
Be honest with me, will you?

268
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:43,289
You're the one who did it, right?

269
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,189
You've got me wrong, shopkeeper!

270
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:49,289
I haven't stolen anything from the store!

271
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:53,889
I'm sure Conan would be able to come up with something but...

272
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,889
Are you sure that I shouldn't call him, Jodie?

273
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,989
Yes, I'm sure. The cool kid is busy looking after Ai!

274
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,789
We shouldn't bother him!

275
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,489
I guess so, but...

276
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,589
But if we leave Aya as is...

277
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,089
No!

278
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,889
She'll be fine! We don't have to rely on that kid!

279
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,389
I, the Queen of deduction Sonoko

280
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,889
will solve this case without his help!

281
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,089
Oh? Right.

282
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,489
First, let's organize what went on.

283
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,089
The total sales of this convenience store

284
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:28,489
and the number of items in the storeroom

285
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,089
for some reason don't match.

286
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,089
And the items start missing

287
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:34,989
after Aya is in charge of cleaning the store

288
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,189
and closing the shop.

289
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,289
Therefore, it's only natural that

290
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,789
the shopkeeper suspects Aya of having stolen the items.

291
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,989
But, we've known Aya since intermediate school

292
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:44,089
and know that she's a good girl.

293
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:48,189
So, we think there's another culprit and begin investigation.

294
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,789
Everything's okay up to here, right?

295
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,189
Right.

296
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:55,289
What concerns me are the three customers that Aya referred to.

297
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,389
One is the university student type game freak.

298
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,189
The other is the timid and hesitant salaried worker type man.

299
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:08,689
And the last one is a stubborn granny.

300
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:14,089
Each of them buys different things such as...

301
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,589
The game freak buys only cup noodles and pouched food.

302
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:21,889
The salaried worker buys toothbrush sets, batteries,

303
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,189
shaving razor sets and towels.

304
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,689
They were all things that one would take on trips.

305
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,889
The granny buys nothing!

306
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,189
All she used to do was talk to the personnel of the store

307
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,389
and buy nothing!

308
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,689
All three of them seem suspicious and yet it could be otherwise.

309
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,489
Maybe it's just that somebody shoplifted

310
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,089
or the store was robbed, after all?

311
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,889
I think that's impossible!

312
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,589
The shopkeeper had surveillance cameras set up.

313
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,089
No chance for burglars. No can do!

314
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:53,589
The problem is, when she was scolded by the shopkeeper

315
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,189
after he suspected her, the items stopped missing.

316
00:16:58,189 --> 00:16:59,889
And yesterday, a month after that,

317
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,589
again on the day that she is in charge,

318
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,789
a large amount of things were stolen again!

319
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,889
Come to think of it, Aya.

320
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:09,489
You like snacks and juice, don't you?

321
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,589
You used to be hooked on games too.

322
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,989
Hey!

323
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:16,189
We're trying to prove Aya's innocence, aren't we?

324
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,189
I know.

325
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,889
Think what he would think at times like this.

326
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,589
What would Shinichi think.

327
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,489
What would he think...

328
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,489
The point is the discrepancies you find

329
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,689
when compared with the usual situation.

330
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,589
Whenever a case occurs, something is different from the usual.

331
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,589
First, observe very closely and pinpoint what it is.

332
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,189
No matter if it's something that anyone would do,

333
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,789
or something that's so trivial and apt to occur,

334
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,389
if it's different from the usual, it's a great problem!

335
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:45,289
Those more than usual and plain things

336
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,389
are the most worth noticing as different.

337
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,789
Something different from the usual?

338
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:54,889
I see. So if the items only start missing when Aya's in charge...

339
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,889
Do you do anything special on the days you're on closing duty, Aya?

340
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,189
Nothing really...

341
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,189
All I do is clean the store.

342
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,389
Is there anything you noticed, shopkeeper?

343
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,789
No, not really.

344
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,589
Anything, no matter how trivial it may seem!

345
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,689
Sorry...

346
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,889
It's nothing much, but...

347
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:17,289
What is it?

348
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,889
When Aya is in charge, the inside of the store is especially clean!

349
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:24,989
See, the boxes with the items inside that arrived just before closing

350
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:27,889
are all in order!

351
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:30,889
The other employees and I leave organizing the boxes

352
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:34,989
to the employees who come in the morning and go home.

353
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,789
It's the same with you too, isn't it, shopkeeper?

354
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,489
She probably did it to rid herself of her guilty conscience,

355
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,289
but I won't be deceived.

356
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,089
Oh, no.

357
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,389
Even for the lunches.

358
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,889
She probably thought it was okay because all of them

359
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:54,189
were near the expiration date.

360
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:56,589
But a thief's a thief!

361
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,889
I could go ahead and call the police and have them investigate!

362
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,389
Hey? The police?

363
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,189
Then what is it?

364
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,589
Are you people going to figure out what's going on?

365
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,389
And capture the real culprit.

366
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:24,989
Shi...

367
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,789
Shinichi.

368
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,489
Shinichi!

369
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,589
Shinichi!

370
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,989
Ran.

371
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,389
Just my imagination, I guess.

372
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:08,289
Hey, Shinichi! Where were you?

373
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,089
Nowhere special.

374
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,789
Haibara doesn't seem to be around.

375
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,389
Oh, Ai is in her room.

376
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:23,689
She's still not all that well, is she?

377
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,689
She's fine! The heater is on,

378
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:32,389
and besides, I thought it best to leave her alone.

379
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:36,489
She's probably listening to that tape again.

380
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:44,589
Shiho, don't you regret what you're trying to do now.

381
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:47,189
I'm with you all the way!

382
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:51,689
I'll always be with you, so give it your all.

383
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,389
Mother.

384
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:57,289
I'll talk to you again on your 19th birthday.

385
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,389
Bye, bye for now. Catch you later.

386
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,189
Oh, and...

387
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,889
Welcome!

388
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:18,389
Excuse me! The restroom!

389
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:23,089
Wow, look at the people at the cash register!

390
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,489
Oh my.

391
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:27,189
It's really starting to get crowded.

392
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:28,689
Yes, really.

393
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,289
Thank you.

394
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,389
Welcome to our shop.

395
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,889
Even the restroom's starting to get crowded.

396
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,389
Come to think of it, Aya was saying that

397
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:42,189
the suspicious three customers used to use the restroom a lot.

398
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:45,489
We'll get back to this after we take care of all these customers.

399
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:47,489
Go back to the cash register, will you?

400
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,589
Yes, sir.

401
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,189
If you guys have no intention of buying anything,

402
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:52,689
go on outside, will you?

403
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,189
But...

404
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,089
You're interfering with business!

405
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:59,689
-Go on. -Wait.

406
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,389
If we leave things as is,

407
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,089
Aya...

408
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,489
Aya will be blamed as the burglar!

409
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:12,389
Aya!

410
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:17,189
Ran, what shall we do?

411
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,789
Shinichi.

412
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:24,289
What on earth should I do?

413
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,889
Shinichi!

414
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,989
We exclude the impossibilities

415
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:58,489
and no matter how impossible the remaining things may seem,

416
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:00,289
it is the truth!

417
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:03,189
Hurry, everybody! Run for it!

418
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:04,589
What shall I do?

419
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,889
I could tell them my deduction but...

420
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:11,589
What if it's a mistake? What if I'm off the point?

421
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:15,189
If you think your deduction is correct, try it.

422
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:17,189
Huh? Try it?

423
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,989
Next Conan,

424
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:22,877
"Convenience Store Trap (Part 2)"

425
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,816
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,916
"The restroom of the convenience store"

427
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,416
The next episode is the last for this year's Detective Conan.

428
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,816
There will be a lot of great specials.

429
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,804
Conan's special New Year's gift will start on Jan, 5th!
