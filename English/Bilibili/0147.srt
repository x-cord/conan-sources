1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.366
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.966
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.766
The case is full of mystery and love is a labyrinth.

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.266
Officers have it tough, too.

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.966
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.866
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.066
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.179
When the branch manager of the bank that was robbed

9
00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.979
comes to the police station for questioning,

10
00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.079
his wife is murdered.

11
00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.879
The murderer is definitely the branch manager.

12
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.879
But he had a perfect alibi of being at the police station

13
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.079
when the crime was committed!

14
00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:21.679
"Detective Love Story (Part 2)"

15
00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.179
Assistant Inspector Shiratori!

16
00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.679
We checked the victim's room

17
00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.479
and found her wallet and jewelry out in the open.

18
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.179
Therefore, the possibility of it having been a robbery is very little.

19
00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.979
Just as I thought!

20
00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.779
Start questioning the neighborhood

21
00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.479
to see if there was anyone asking around

22
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.379
about this residence for the past two or three days.

23
00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.479
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

24
00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.179
And...

25
00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:48.279
I'd like you to know that

26
00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.379
I have become an inspector as of today.

27
00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.979
Understand?

28
00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.779
Yes, sir. I understand.

29
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:58.579
There is a large loophole in Inspector Shiratori's deduction.

30
00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.179
I've got to let him know somehow.

31
00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:03.879
Inspector Shiratori!

32
00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.979
You go on home, sonny.

33
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.279
I'll ask someone to take you home.

34
00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.779
Don't you think it's strange?

35
00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.879
The killer killed her

36
00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.779
because she was on the phone with the police, right?

37
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.379
Then, why did the killer have to put the shelves back?

38
00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.079
It's obvious that the police will rush over here

39
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.779
after the scream is heard,

40
00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.679
so there would be no time to waste.

41
00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:30.479
Well...

42
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.579
That's true.

43
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.279
The bookshelf on the side is full of books

44
00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:37.979
and nobody can hide inside.

45
00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.479
Inspector Shiratori!

46
00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.179
What is it?

47
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.379
I found a strange album in the victim's room.

48
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.579
Please take a look.

49
00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.179
Strange circles are written in here and there on the pictures.

50
00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:54.279
That's just some of my wife's doodlings!

51
00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:55.479
I kept telling her to stop doing it

52
00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.279
because it would soil the pictures

53
00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.879
I see. That's why he killed his wife.

54
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.379
There's no doubt.

55
00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.179
He's the killer.

56
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.279
But he has an alibi.

57
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.279
He has a perfect alibi of being at the police station

58
00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.179
right before my very eyes.

59
00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:18.879
There's got be something.

60
00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.879
A way to kill a person

61
00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.479
who is several kilometers away from the police station.

62
00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.679
Inspector Shiratori.

63
00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:35.479
It will be better to wait untill the special squad contacts us.

64
00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.479
There are too many mysteries involved in this case.

65
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.679
I'd like to ask you then!

66
00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:43.179
Who and where is the killer,

67
00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:45.979
and how did he commit the murder?

68
00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.779
It is an obvious fact that the killer snuck in here

69
00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.479
and killed the victim.

70
00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.079
Judging from the circumstances,

71
00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:55.179
what other possibility can you think of

72
00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:58.279
other than the killer ambushing her and killing her?

73
00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.579
A knife couldn't have come flying on its own.

74
00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.879
A knife come flying on its own?

75
00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.279
Wait a second.

76
00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.679
Maybe...

77
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.379
I've found it! This is it!

78
00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.079
If so, it should be there.

79
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:19.679
If that is there...

80
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:26.279
-Hey! -Get down, sonny!

81
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.979
Huh? It's not here.

82
00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.479
Strange... There are slight blood stains

83
00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.679
on the bookshelf and the curtains,

84
00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:35.579
and yet why is it not here?

85
00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:39.379
There are splotches of blood?

86
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.279
I see. So, that's what it is.

87
00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:49.179
I've got the entire picture.

88
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.079
I've figured out the trick you used

89
00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:58.779
to kill your wife who was kilometers away from here.

90
00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.879
Anyway, judging from the circumstances at the scene,

91
00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.079
the fact that the killer snuck into this house

92
00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.979
and stabbed the victim in the back with a knife

93
00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.179
while she was on the phone is more than obvious.

94
00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:14.979
And the killer is probably

95
00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.979
one of the robbers who robbed the Tohto Bank the other day.

96
00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.179
The motive is that when the victim was taken hostage,

97
00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:24.279
she took note of his characteristic,

98
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.679
and he wanted to shut her up.

99
00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:29.479
Moreover, the victim has told her husband

100
00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.179
that the killer is a foreigner.

101
00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:34.779
Well, although there are some unexplainable points,

102
00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.079
I think that it'd be wiser for you

103
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:41.479
to inform the special squad in charge of the robbery about it.

104
00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.379
All right. I'll call them, okay?

105
00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:51.679
Officer Takagi, take this little one back to Mr. Mouri's house.

106
00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.079
What are you doing?

107
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:58.279
I am folding origami.

108
00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.879
Origami?

109
00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.979
This is not a play room, sonny.

110
00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.879
Do that at home.

111
00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.879
I had something I wanted to ask you,

112
00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.279
so I asked the investigation officer for paper

113
00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:13.279
to make a knife.

114
00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.379
What is it you want to ask, sonny?

115
00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:20.179
When you stab something with a knife,

116
00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:21.479
you hold it this way or this way, right?

117
00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:22.879
That's right.

118
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.679
She was attacked from behind

119
00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:26.879
when she was pedaling the aero-bike

120
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.879
and talking on the phone, right?

121
00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.779
Yes, the victim has perspiration on her,

122
00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:33.379
and the place that she is lying

123
00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:34.679
as well as the place of the phone

124
00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:37.079
are all near the aero-bike.

125
00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:39.279
Besides, the victim is bare-footed.

126
00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.779
Since there are no perspiration marks made by her feet,

127
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:45.079
nor signs of her body having moved at all.

128
00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:47.979
So, it's most likely that she was stabbed

129
00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:49.779
and fell here right on the spot.

130
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:52.079
Then, isn't it strange?

131
00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:56.079
So, what's so strange?

132
00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:58.779
The knife that stabbed her back.

133
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.179
See, it's stabbed sideways facing the corpse.

134
00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.879
That's right!

135
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.679
If she was attacked from behind,

136
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:10.979
the knife should be facing vertically.

137
00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:12.279
Right.

138
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:15.779
It's understandable if she was attacked from the side,

139
00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:20.179
but it's strange that she couldn't see the killer coming at her

140
00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:23.279
and didn't flee at all.

141
00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:26.979
That's easy to answer.

142
00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:30.279
The killer probably attacked the victim from behind

143
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.879
and pushed her down on the floor.

144
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:35.879
He put both his knees on top of the victim's neck and hip,

145
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.679
and killed her while pinning her down.

146
00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.379
Just as expected of you, Inspector!

147
00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.179
You're so smart!

148
00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.779
It's no big deal.

149
00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:46.779
But I think that's wrong.

150
00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:47.779
Huh?

151
00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.179
Because if you're pinned down to the floor,

152
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:53.979
you would normally struggle trying to get away, right?

153
00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:57.179
But Officer Sato mentioned just a while ago

154
00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:00.279
that there were no such perspiration stains on the floor.

155
00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:03.379
Besides, I think that the phone lying on the floor like that

156
00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:05.879
is strange, too.

157
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.279
Right.

158
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.679
After she screamed,

159
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.679
Officer Takagi kept calling her,

160
00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:14.079
so I am sure the killer heard him.

161
00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:17.479
If the killer knew that the one on the phone the police,

162
00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:21.179
why didn't he switch the phone off?

163
00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:23.279
With the phone turned on,

164
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:25.579
he risks a chance of leaving some kind of sound

165
00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:28.279
that may lead to his arrest.

166
00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.079
Well...

167
00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:33.279
The killer panicked and fled with all his might.

168
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:36.679
The killer left behind the murder weapon knife,

169
00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:41.679
which could after some investigation lead to his arrest, too.

170
00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:44.179
But when we first got here,

171
00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:47.579
the door to the living room was locked.

172
00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:52.179
Why would a killer who is in a rush lock the door?

173
00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:57.679
Besides, the window that the killer supposedly snuck in from

174
00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.979
was also locked.

175
00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:03.679
See, aren't you starting to feel

176
00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:06.879
that something is not right too, Inspector?

177
00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:15.779
It's just as if no one else but the victim was here to begin with.

178
00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:18.179
It's very strange.

179
00:10:25.268 --> 00:10:27.368
You're right, sonny.

180
00:10:27.368 --> 00:10:31.068
We need to check this room a little more carefully.

181
00:10:31.068 --> 00:10:36.668
So, are you saying that a knife came flying on its own

182
00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:40.068
towards the victim who was alone in this room?

183
00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:42.368
Besides, if there were to be such an equipment,

184
00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:45.668
you guys who found the corpse would have found it.

185
00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:48.968
Huh?

186
00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:51.768
What's this string?

187
00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:52.968
String?

188
00:10:55.268 --> 00:10:56.968
What are you talking about?

189
00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:58.468
Look.

190
00:10:58.468 --> 00:11:01.868
There's string tangled onto it inside.

191
00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:02.968
Right?

192
00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:05.868
Oh, I see. It's there.

193
00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:09.568
Do you know what that string is there for?

194
00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.168
I wonder.

195
00:11:11.168 --> 00:11:14.368
Well, some string for packing or something

196
00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:16.068
must have gotten tangle onto it.

197
00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:21.768
But look at the end of this string.

198
00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:24.268
See, there's a little circle made on it.

199
00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:27.468
Here.

200
00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:28.868
Oh, really.

201
00:11:28.868 --> 00:11:31.468
This sure doesn't look like a string for packing.

202
00:11:31.468 --> 00:11:35.068
Now I remember!

203
00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:37.468
Some children of my friend came to spend the night here

204
00:11:37.468 --> 00:11:38.968
about six months ago.

205
00:11:38.968 --> 00:11:42.868
They seem to have been playing around the aero-bike then,

206
00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:46.668
so they may have done it.

207
00:11:46.668 --> 00:11:48.968
But...

208
00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:50.968
It's a waste of time thinking about it.

209
00:11:50.968 --> 00:11:53.968
Just what can you do with a string like that?

210
00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:56.468
Wait a minute please!

211
00:11:56.468 --> 00:11:59.368
Maybe, maybe...

212
00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.768
On the top of the bookshelf behind,

213
00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:04.668
a knife was fixed on using masking tape or something.

214
00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:08.768
Then, if the string is hooked on to the edge of the curtain rail,

215
00:12:08.768 --> 00:12:12.968
the string would wind just by the victim pedaling the aero-bike.

216
00:12:12.968 --> 00:12:14.668
The bookshelf would fall,

217
00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:19.168
and the knife would automatically stab the victim in the back!

218
00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:23.868
That's a very interesting deduction,

219
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.068
but can you actually stab someone in that manner?

220
00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:28.568
That plan could easily go wrong.

221
00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:31.968
But the possibility of the knife stabbing the victim is more likely.

222
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:33.668
Beside that bookshelf

223
00:12:33.668 --> 00:12:35.968
is another bookshelf that is packed with books,

224
00:12:35.968 --> 00:12:38.568
so it'll fall where it's supposed to.

225
00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:40.468
The victim who was the target

226
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.768
would obviously be on the aero-bike.

227
00:12:42.768 --> 00:12:44.068
Moreover, the bookshelf will come falling

228
00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:46.568
from an angle that is a blind spot for the victim.

229
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.268
But if the pedal suddenly gets heavy,

230
00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:53.168
wouldn't the victim realize that something is wrong?

231
00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:54.968
Oh, don't you know?

232
00:12:54.968 --> 00:12:59.368
Aero-bikes are set so that they gradually get heavier.

233
00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:01.668
If this was a routine for the victim,

234
00:13:01.668 --> 00:13:04.268
she probably wouldn't have noticed a thing.

235
00:13:04.268 --> 00:13:06.168
But...

236
00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:08.268
the bookshelf wasn't tipped over

237
00:13:08.268 --> 00:13:11.268
when you found the corpse, was it?

238
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:13.068
Besides, if the killer were to come in here

239
00:13:13.068 --> 00:13:14.968
and set up such thing,

240
00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:17.468
it'd be much easier for him to just come in here

241
00:13:17.468 --> 00:13:18.868
and kill her.

242
00:13:20.368 --> 00:13:22.468
There is just one person

243
00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:27.268
who can restore the bookshelf to it's original place

244
00:13:27.268 --> 00:13:30.268
and needed to use this trick.

245
00:13:31.668 --> 00:13:35.068
That person is someone who knows the layout of this room

246
00:13:35.068 --> 00:13:36.968
and is aware of the habits of the victim.

247
00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:39.568
He is the one who entered this room before anyone else,

248
00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.568
the husband of the victim.

249
00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:45.568
That person is you, Mr. Keizo Masuo!

250
00:13:46.268 --> 00:13:48.068
What the...

251
00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:49.268
I see.

252
00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:51.768
That's why you made that phone call from the police.

253
00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:55.068
Knowing that your wife exercises using the aero-bike

254
00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:56.668
at 2:00 everyday,

255
00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:57.968
you would more or less have an idea

256
00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:00.168
of when the knife would stab her.

257
00:14:00.168 --> 00:14:02.668
There wouldn't be a better alibi

258
00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:05.468
if your wife were to be stabbed while you are on the phone

259
00:14:05.468 --> 00:14:07.768
talking to her in front of our very eyes.

260
00:14:07.768 --> 00:14:09.368
You gave Officer Takagi the phone

261
00:14:09.368 --> 00:14:10.568
in the the middle of the conversation,

262
00:14:10.568 --> 00:14:15.668
just so that he could confirm that it was your wife.

263
00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:17.868
Besides, when we arrived,

264
00:14:17.868 --> 00:14:21.268
you told us to go look upstairs.

265
00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:22.768
I see.

266
00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:24.968
You picked the bookshelf up

267
00:14:24.968 --> 00:14:28.268
and put it back in place while we were upstairs.

268
00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:31.268
Wait, don't be ridiculous!

269
00:14:31.268 --> 00:14:34.668
If there were many officers then,

270
00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:39.368
I'm sure someone came into this room earlier than I did!

271
00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:45.968
If so, they would have seen the knife and the bookself.

272
00:14:47.468 --> 00:14:49.768
This is how you probably did it, right?

273
00:14:49.768 --> 00:14:50.868
Huh?

274
00:14:50.868 --> 00:14:53.568
See, if you fill just the very top of the bookshelf

275
00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:57.468
with books and poke the knife into the space here,

276
00:14:57.468 --> 00:14:59.168
you wouldn't need masking tape

277
00:14:59.168 --> 00:15:01.068
to fix the knife in place, would you?

278
00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.968
It'll fall easier too if the top is heavy.

279
00:15:03.968 --> 00:15:05.368
I see!

280
00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:08.168
If so, after the knife stabs the victim,

281
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:09.368
the books would slide down,

282
00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:11.068
and the victim would fall to the floor

283
00:15:11.068 --> 00:15:12.768
with the knife still poked inside her.

284
00:15:12.768 --> 00:15:14.468
All he has to do after that is put the bookshelf back

285
00:15:14.468 --> 00:15:16.268
and pick up the books that are scattered,

286
00:15:16.268 --> 00:15:18.768
so no one realizes that anything had been rigged.

287
00:15:18.768 --> 00:15:21.368
But, sonny,

288
00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:23.768
if there were to be a knife sticking out of the bookshelf,

289
00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:26.768
my wife would have noticed it.

290
00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:28.268
All right, then.

291
00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:31.868
There! What if it's placed like this?

292
00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:32.968
What the...

293
00:15:32.968 --> 00:15:34.368
I see!

294
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:36.468
That way the knife would be hidden

295
00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:40.168
and it explains why the knife had stabbed the victim from the side.

296
00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:42.068
You're really something, sonny.

297
00:15:42.068 --> 00:15:44.268
Besides, even if the officers were to get here before the killer

298
00:15:44.268 --> 00:15:47.068
and see the tilted bookshelf and scattered books,

299
00:15:47.068 --> 00:15:49.968
it would just look like the victim had struggled with the killer

300
00:15:49.968 --> 00:15:53.268
and it wouldn't even dawn on anyone

301
00:15:53.268 --> 00:15:56.468
that there had ever been something rigged here.

302
00:15:56.468 --> 00:16:00.068
Well, how about it, Mr. Masuo?

303
00:16:03.668 --> 00:16:07.268
The string would still be stuck to the curtain rail,

304
00:16:07.268 --> 00:16:10.768
and it would be so obvious that you've have noticed right away.

305
00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:15.668
And where's the proof that I'm the one who did this?

306
00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:19.468
What's the matter?

307
00:16:19.468 --> 00:16:23.168
It seems you poked your finger with something and got hurt.

308
00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:25.868
Oh, I get it!

309
00:16:25.868 --> 00:16:28.768
When you put your handkerchief back in your pocket a while ago,

310
00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:30.668
you seemed to be in pain, right?

311
00:16:31.768 --> 00:16:33.968
You've got something in your pocket, don't you?

312
00:16:33.968 --> 00:16:35.668
Won't you please show it to us?

313
00:16:35.668 --> 00:16:36.968
The contents in his pocket

314
00:16:36.968 --> 00:16:41.368
is probably a thumbtack or something stuck onto a tape

315
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.668
with the blood stain of the on it.

316
00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:46.068
Oh, how do you know?

317
00:16:46.068 --> 00:16:48.168
Just by looking at the slight snatches of blood stains

318
00:16:48.168 --> 00:16:50.068
that are that are splattered on the bookshelf.

319
00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:53.668
It is obvious that something had been stuck on here.

320
00:16:53.668 --> 00:16:56.068
You adjusted the direction of the thumbtack

321
00:16:56.068 --> 00:16:57.968
and stuck it on to the bookshelf.

322
00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.268
Then, you hooked the loop of the string on,

323
00:17:00.268 --> 00:17:03.168
so that when the bookshelf falls, it'll come off easily.

324
00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:05.368
The string that comes off then is wound up

325
00:17:05.368 --> 00:17:08.668
by the inertia of the pedal of the aero-bike spinning.

326
00:17:08.668 --> 00:17:10.968
But how was he going to justify himself

327
00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:19.268
He was probably going to say that his wife

328
00:17:19.268 --> 00:17:21.668
used the thumbtack to hook this on behind,

329
00:17:21.668 --> 00:17:24.268
and that she poked her finger accidentally.

330
00:17:24.268 --> 00:17:30.168
Therefore, the blood stain being there is just a coincidence.

331
00:17:31.768 --> 00:17:35.768
Shall we try it out to see if it'll really work?

332
00:17:38.668 --> 00:17:40.568
Let's stick that thing that you have

333
00:17:40.568 --> 00:17:43.268
in your pocket onto the bookshelf.

334
00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:50.068
It will work, so don't bother trying.

335
00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:52.568
Because I tried several hundred times last night

336
00:17:52.568 --> 00:17:55.968
and perfected the angle of the thumbtack.

337
00:17:55.968 --> 00:17:58.968
I just wanted to be safe and peeled it off

338
00:17:58.968 --> 00:18:01.068
when I placed the bookshelf back up.

339
00:18:01.068 --> 00:18:03.068
But to think that in turn worked against me...

340
00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:05.268
Why did you kill your wife?

341
00:18:05.268 --> 00:18:07.468
Insurance money.

342
00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:11.268
My wife was covered by a very expensive life insurance.

343
00:18:11.268 --> 00:18:13.768
That's why I made it look like a killing committed

344
00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:16.368
by the bank robber and killed her.

345
00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:18.668
It's good that you're considerate towards your friend,

346
00:18:18.668 --> 00:18:21.368
but everything will come out in the open in no time.

347
00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:26.068
That is, you made your friends rob your own bank!

348
00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:29.068
Really?

349
00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:32.768
Yes. And he's probably the leader of the band!

350
00:18:32.768 --> 00:18:35.468
The boss is the branch manager of the bank,

351
00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:37.768
so of course the robbery wouldn't face any troubles.

352
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.568
But it was really unfortunate

353
00:18:39.568 --> 00:18:41.968
that your friends mistakenly took your wife

354
00:18:41.968 --> 00:18:45.768
who happened to walk into the bank as hostage.

355
00:18:45.768 --> 00:18:52.068
Your wife realized he was your friend based on his voice

356
00:18:52.068 --> 00:18:54.568
and she was getting ready to tell the police about that,

357
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.668
so you killed her to shut her up.

358
00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:59.468
Then, the robber didn't change hostages back then

359
00:18:59.468 --> 00:19:02.068
because she put up too much of fight...

360
00:19:02.068 --> 00:19:04.068
But because she was the boss's wife.

361
00:19:07.168 --> 00:19:10.068
How did you figure all that out?

362
00:19:10.068 --> 00:19:13.968
Remember the album with strange circles around the pictures?

363
00:19:13.968 --> 00:19:18.068
Mrs. Masuo was probably planning to bring that to the police.

364
00:19:18.068 --> 00:19:21.168
And inform us that the bank robbers were those people.

365
00:19:21.168 --> 00:19:23.668
And besides, that boy has been standing there

366
00:19:23.668 --> 00:19:25.768
while holding the album open all this time.

367
00:19:32.968 --> 00:19:34.668
Two hours later,

368
00:19:34.668 --> 00:19:37.368
the two robbers who were at their condo counting cash

369
00:19:37.368 --> 00:19:39.968
were arrested.

370
00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:42.668
Thus, two cases were solved at once.

371
00:19:46.668 --> 00:19:48.968
According to Mr. Masuo's testimony,

372
00:19:48.968 --> 00:19:52.168
he says he robbed the bank for his extravagant,

373
00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:54.868
money-spending wife.

374
00:19:55.968 --> 00:20:01.668
How ironic that he would end up killing his wife.

375
00:21:31.368 --> 00:21:35.868
Hey, I heard you seem to have already performed some feat

376
00:21:35.868 --> 00:21:38.268
the minute you were promoted inspector!

377
00:21:38.268 --> 00:21:40.368
Just as expected of you!

378
00:21:40.368 --> 00:21:43.268
It was no big deal, Superintendent Matsumoto.

379
00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:47.468
Such simple case hardly require my attention.

380
00:21:47.468 --> 00:21:50.168
That's right. Because the case was solved...

381
00:21:50.168 --> 00:21:53.468
Thanks to this little one here!

382
00:21:53.468 --> 00:21:57.368
Huh? Aren't you the boy staying at Mr. Mouri's place?

383
00:21:57.368 --> 00:22:01.268
He was really fantastic, finding one hint after another!

384
00:22:01.268 --> 00:22:03.468
It was all coincidence.

385
00:22:03.468 --> 00:22:04.868
I bet like they say,

386
00:22:04.868 --> 00:22:10.568
little children can solve puzzle rings faster than adults.

387
00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:15.968
Oh, no.

388
00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.668
It's this late already?

389
00:22:17.668 --> 00:22:20.568
No wonder I am so hungry.

390
00:22:20.568 --> 00:22:22.768
Officer Sato.

391
00:22:22.768 --> 00:22:24.268
If it's okay with you, will you join me...

392
00:22:24.268 --> 00:22:27.268
Why don't you join me for dinner?

393
00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:30.768
Why don't we enjoy the night scenery over a drink?

394
00:22:30.768 --> 00:22:34.568
Right, I have a French restaurant in mind.

395
00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:36.768
Oh, how nice.

396
00:22:36.768 --> 00:22:38.568
Just as I thought.

397
00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:42.068
It's just as I thought.

398
00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:45.968
My uncle happens to be a chef at a three star restaurant.

399
00:22:45.968 --> 00:22:47.868
That's amazing!

400
00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:49.568
But no thanks.

401
00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:52.868
I don't really care for French food.

402
00:22:52.868 --> 00:22:55.068
Oh, what a shame.

403
00:22:55.068 --> 00:22:57.268
Then, maybe some other time.

404
00:23:01.368 --> 00:23:05.368
Officer Sato, you don't like French food?

405
00:23:05.368 --> 00:23:08.168
I have no likes or dislikes.

406
00:23:08.168 --> 00:23:09.368
I just don't like expensive restaurants

407
00:23:09.368 --> 00:23:11.468
where I have to get all stiff.

408
00:23:11.468 --> 00:23:12.968
What do you say

409
00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:17.968
about going to a good noodle shop that I found nearby?

410
00:23:17.968 --> 00:23:20.268
Yes! It will be my pleasure!

411
00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:23.168
Officer Sato and Officer Takagi!

412
00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.268
How about it?

413
00:23:24.268 --> 00:23:26.568
Would you like to go for a drink to celebrate solving the case?

414
00:23:26.568 --> 00:23:29.468
The others are already gathered at the pub!

415
00:23:29.468 --> 00:23:33.268
Yes, sir! Miwako Sato will accept your kindly offer!

416
00:23:33.268 --> 00:23:37.868
Don't tell me that the one Officer Sato likes is...

417
00:23:38.968 --> 00:23:41.568
Come on, Let's go, Officer Takagi!

418
00:23:41.568 --> 00:23:44.568
No, I've still got work left to do.

419
00:23:48.968 --> 00:23:53.468
When are you going to start questioning us?

420
00:23:53.468 --> 00:23:55.268
It's already 8:00 pm.

421
00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:56.868
I'm going to forget everything,

422
00:23:56.868 --> 00:23:58.568
since it so way back in the past!

423
00:24:00.968 --> 00:24:02.468
He is a hopeless case.

424
00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:05.868
"Next Episode"

425
00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:07.168
Amazing!

426
00:24:07.168 --> 00:24:10.968
It sure is more fascinating than the driving game.

427
00:24:20.568 --> 00:24:22.868
Huh? I wonder what's wrong?

428
00:24:22.868 --> 00:24:25.568
This person's not breathing any longer.

429
00:24:27.468 --> 00:24:33.389
Next Conan, "The Streetcar Case"

430
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.070
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.170
"Camera Case"

432
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.870
The next episode is about a streetcar.

433
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:40.970
That's wrong.

434
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.770
That's the wrong one, too.
