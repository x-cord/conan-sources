1
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:04,113
Ai, would you like to come over to my house today?

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,983
Mom baked some cookies yesterday.

3
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:09,253
Sorry, I don't think so.

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,783
I'll go have some then! Those cookies!

5
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:15,113
You like eels over rice, don't you, Genta?

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,253
I'll go and have them, the cookies!

7
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,253
I wonder if there are "eels over rice" cookies.

8
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,563
It sounds good.

9
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:24,943
I wouldn't dare eat them even if there were.

10
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,013
Hold it! Freeze!

11
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,603
Stay away. Stay away, I said.

12
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,233
Cool it!

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,551
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,686
Darn!

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,573
-I'm really sorry. -What?

16
00:00:46,453 --> 00:00:47,753
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,963
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

18
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,883
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

19
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,803
Who's the strange one?

20
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:02,673
The inconspicuous relationship between doctor and patient.

21
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:04,220
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,073
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:08,593
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,540
"A Troublesome Emergency Patient"

25
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,040
"Beika Emergency Medical Center"

26
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
You can't identify him?

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,570
No, all he has on him is a knife and wallet.

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,320
He has no sort of identification on him.

29
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,110
We got word that there is no data matching his prints

30
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,690
on the ex-con list either.

31
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,460
And, why was he being pursued by the police to begin with?

32
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,940
Interrogation.

33
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,846
He was being interrogated about 100m from where Conan and the others were

34
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:51,090
because he looked suspicious.

35
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,590
Then he suddenly fled.

36
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,510
Judging from the fact that he had a knife on him,

37
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,210
maybe he was intending to commit robbery or something?

38
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,970
Did he have it out with the police officer back then?

39
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,100
Have it out?

40
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,980
That man had a wound on his head, didn't he?

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,090
About that...

42
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:17,390
It seems he was already staggering when he was being interrogated.

43
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,000
Since that made him look suspicious,

44
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,660
the officer stopped him to question him.

45
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,870
Just what's going on?

46
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,230
I'm from MPD. How's the patient doing?

47
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,100
He's suffering from cerebral hemorrhage

48
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,260
due to a strong blow to the back of his head.

49
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,700
"Tatsuhiko Kido (40)" -He is in critical condition

50
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,410
and I can't very well tell whether he'll make it or not.

51
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,790
Could he have been struck or something?

52
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,260
Or, did he fall on his own?

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,560
-I wonder. I can't really tell. -I see.

54
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,900
His identity and whether we've got a case or not are both unknown.

55
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,670
This is a tough one.

56
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,280
What about his dental records or traces of past surgery?

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,690
Can't you figure something out from medical records?

58
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,040
You sure know a lot, sonny.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,620
Pops Kogoro told me about this some time ago.

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,810
Pops Kogoro?

61
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,970
The Sleeping Kogoro, in other words, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri!

62
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,770
And, we're members of the Youth Detective Squad!

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,550
I wonder if that man'll make it.

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,450
Ayumi, don't tell me you're on his side?

65
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,890
Right.

66
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,740
He's a bad guy that held a knife up against you, Ayumi!

67
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,070
It's true that I was surprised and scared but...

68
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,880
I just couldn't think he was such a bad person.

69
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,130
-And... -He had no traces of previous surgery.

70
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,590
As to his dental records, our dentistry department is looking into it now.

71
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,420
I'm sure they'll be getting back to us. If you will excuse me.

72
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,080
-Inspector! -Mouri.

73
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,860
I see.

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,290
-No clue. -No.

75
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,200
I guess we'll just have to wait for the man to regain consciousness.

76
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,700
What's this sticking out of his wallet?

77
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,010
"Haido Construction Suspected of Bribery"

78
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,050
It's a clipping from a magazine. See.

79
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,300
Isn't that the article that's the talk of the town

80
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,730
regarding the scandal of the political and business circles?

81
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,320
Don't tell me this has something to do with that?

82
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,470
And somebody's after his life...

83
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,640
Which means they could be coming after him again?

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,560
Post police officers throughout the hospital on the double!

85
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,340
Ask for back up from the Second Investigation Division!

86
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,159
As for cooperation from the District Public Prosecutors Office too.

87
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,520
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

88
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,970
What a way to go!

89
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,990
I don't get it, but it sure is exciting!

90
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,370
-What do you think? -Well...

91
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,910
Ayumi.

92
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,010
Just before he collapsed, did he say anything to you, Ayumi?

93
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,160
What?

94
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,130
Well...

95
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,170
-Come to think of it. -What?

96
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm sorry, just because Daddy's such a coward.

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,130
I'm really sorry.

98
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,110
Daddy? Was he your father?

99
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,040
No, Genta.

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,650
He was probably so dazed out that he mistook Ayumi for his own child.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,600
The question is whether that has anything to do

102
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,900
with happened this time or not.

103
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,119
Right.

104
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,610
-Conan, let's investigate too! -What?

105
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,530
I just can't make myself think that the man is a bad person.

106
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,000
So, I'd like to help him somehow!

107
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,650
OK, let's give it a try.

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,760
All right! The Youth Detective Squad!

109
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,350
This is a hospital, you know, Genta.

110
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,260
-Off we go. -Aye!

111
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,770
If I'm not mistaken, he came from that side, right, that man?

112
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,240
He was being interrogated about 100m away from here...

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
And then he fled.

114
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,470
Let's go check!

115
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,590
Oh, I remember him.

116
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,680
See, right over there.

117
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,940
He got off the cab right over there but...

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,420
Hurry up, will you! Move out of the way!

119
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,230
The one who got on next was rough, you see.

120
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,530
Maybe he got hurt back then? You know, the wound on his head.

121
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,920
I wonder.

122
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,290
Granny, do you know what taxi company it was?

123
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,960
No. My eyes are bad recently.

124
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,250
But I know the rough guy well.

125
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,630
-What? -Really, granny?

126
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,010
Oh, we get the perpetrator already?

127
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,880
That kid used to shop at my shop since he was a little child.

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,520
At this time of day, I'm sure that he's...

129
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,196
-Who are you guys? -Hi, there.

130
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,480
-Hello. -Hello.

131
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,420
What the heck? You're distracting me so go away!

132
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,080
Uh, what were in such a rush for?

133
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,090
I mean you knocked a person over to get onto the cab.

134
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,170
That man's unconscious now, you know.

135
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,960
-No joke? -What a terrible thing to do.

136
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,723
-Go apologize to him. -Hold it. I was just in a rush and...

137
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,430
We're asking you why?

138
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,490
Really?

139
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,190
He said he was in a rush because he was late for his part-time work

140
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,600
and was told that he'd be fired if he was late again.

141
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,730
Do you believe what a guy like that says?

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,480
That's what we're going to check on from now, right?

143
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,980
Besides, according to granny,

144
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,990
he seems to have looked ill even before he was knocked down.

145
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,740
At the very least...

146
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,120
-He's not the perpetrator. -Right.

147
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,140
Yeah, he was blabbering that he'd be late for work so to hurry it up.

148
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,130
Do you remember the person who was riding the cab before him?

149
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,300
The customer before him?

150
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,010
Yeah. He looked sick already at the time he got on the cab.

151
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,920
Where'd he go? What did he say, sir?

152
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,230
Nothing. Only, he did say, "Go after the car in front."

153
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,100
The car in front?

154
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,910
But there was no such car in sight.

155
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,360
Then he says, "Never mind already, I'm getting off."

156
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,860
So, that's the place we saw him.

157
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,860
He got off the cab there but...

158
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,990
Where did you pick that man up to begin with?

159
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,910
Let's see.

160
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,400
Oh, here it is.

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,670
Haido-cho Sanchome.

162
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,120
Haido-cho Sanchome?

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,000
It's quite a distance from here.

164
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,870
What now? Shall we go there?

165
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,670
Yeah, of course.

166
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,840
Will you take us there?

167
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,970
Yeah, okay. Don't tell anyone, though.

168
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,000
A great spot that only a few people know about.

169
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,030
It's a place that we haven't told our company about.

170
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,300
I see. A great secret spot for taking a nap.

171
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,610
A secret place to slack off, I guess you could say.

172
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,650
Did that man get on from here?

173
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,450
Yeah. I was resting like usual you see.

174
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,130
Isn't Haido-cho Sanchome...

175
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,190
-Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. -What?

176
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,720
It's true this town is right next door

177
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,220
but the fact is, it's back to back with that place.

178
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,240
-That place? -That.

179
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,719
"Beika Emergency Medical Center"

180
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:40,011
"Beika Emergency Medical Center"

181
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:44,411
The answer to the mystery is at the hospital! Right?

182
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,751
All right, let's go!

183
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,351
This is a trace of sudden acceleration.

184
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,851
He said, "Go after the car in front."

185
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,771
Was he talking about this car, maybe?

186
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,921
If so, why is this car parked here again?

187
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,861
Whose car is it, anyway?

188
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,371
"Kido"

189
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:20,561
Kido.

190
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,501
This is...

191
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,631
There seems to be no doubt about it.

192
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,221
Yeah.

193
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:34,011
Look, there's something that looks like evidence here too.

194
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,102
There are fibers from different clothes stuck

195
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:38,891
on two spots of the bench.

196
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:43,121
All that's left to do now is to find out about the personal belongings.

197
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,321
What is this?

198
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:55,421
It really exists, eels over rice cookies!

199
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,371
Genta, we've got no time for that now.

200
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,461
Talk about stingy, I mean thrifty.

201
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:05,411
Using the back of a flyer like this.

202
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,021
Maybe.

203
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,521
"Haido Construction Suspected of Bribery"

204
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,591
Last week's magazine article, right?

205
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,211
Yeah, the problem is what's written on the back.

206
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,061
Just as I thought!

207
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,721
Inspector, what do you want calling me out to a place like this?

208
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:26,191
No... That's...

209
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,811
Inspector!

210
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,081
Just what is the meaning of this, Mouri?

211
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,191
How'd the bribery case go?

212
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:36,481
What? You're the one who told me to come here

213
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,951
because you'd be disclosing the truth of the case.

214
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,091
It's come! The Sleeping Kogoro!

215
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,471
Sleeping Kogoro?

216
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,711
Excuse me. Please let me explain.

217
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:03,991
First of all, that's your car, isn't it, Dr. Kido?

218
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,941
Yes, that's right. Just what do you want with me?

219
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,491
I'll get right to the point

220
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:15,071
and tell you why that unidentified man ended up the way he is.

221
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:20,011
You're the one who put him in that state, Dr. Kido.

222
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,201
What?

223
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,201
-Conan! -Yes, sir!

224
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:32,651
Ayumi, when you were caught by that man, you noticed something, didn't you?

225
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,591
Yep. Back then...

226
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:39,331
I'm sorry, just because Daddy's such a coward.

227
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:41,391
I'm really sorry.

228
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:45,511
-What else? -Well...

229
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:47,221
I smelled something.

230
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,971
Smelled? What kind of smell?

231
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,611
-Eels over rice? -Genta!

232
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:55,731
The same smell that I smelled at the hospital.

233
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:00,391
In other words, that's the smell

234
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,491
that both the victim and the perpetrator shared in common.

235
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:05,121
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,861
Hospital smell, if it's the smell of antiseptics

237
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:13,501
it could be that the patient went to some other hospital.

238
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:17,091
Connecting me with something like that...

239
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,691
You're distorting things a bit too far, Detective.

240
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,761
That's true, Mouri.

241
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,681
It wasn't the smell of antiseptics, but of paint!

242
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,141
Paint?

243
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:33,081
Right. And that adhered to the perpetrator and victim as well

244
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,081
because right here.

245
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:40,261
The two fought and the wet paint from the newly painted bench rubbed off.

246
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:41,991
The perpetrator who desperately fled

247
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:45,141
knocked the victim away trying to pull free.

248
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,081
And his button came off.

249
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:56,661
He was knocked away and hit the back of his head.

250
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:03,201
He then went down the stairs to the vacant lot below to catch a cab.

251
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,391
Inspector Megure!

252
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:09,051
Where were you two?

253
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,898
Mr. Mouri instructed us

254
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,438
to check on the fingerprints on the window frame of this car

255
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:16,781
so we had forensics check on it.

256
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,401
The prints matched those of that patient!

257
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,841
Moreover, the button that Conan picked up here

258
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:26,031
also turned out to be for the clothes he was wearing.

259
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:32,041
I'm sorry but I asked them to go on my own discretion.

260
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:37,251
That's okay but why did you do something like this?

261
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,011
His motive is the magazine clipping.

262
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:45,491
What? Then this had something to do with the bribery case after all.

263
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:49,711
No, rather behind it. Correct, Doctor?

264
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,238
-Behind it? -This is it.

265
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:56,521
The advertisement of the book that Dr. Kido wrote.

266
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,441
Doctor!

267
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,241
It was a month ago.

268
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,921
We have person who suddenly fell ill.

269
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:11,351
Is there a doctor here? I repeat.

270
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:14,232
Excuse me, are you a doctor?

271
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,482
What?

272
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,271
Oh, because you seem to be reading a medical book.

273
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:22,901
Please! My child, my daughter, has a fever.

274
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:24,631
Will you please examine her?

275
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,221
I'm sorry. I'm not a doctor.

276
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,261
But...

277
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:36,661
Since I'm a married man,

278
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,501
I didn't want to risk danger of having my relationship

279
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:42,101
with the woman that I was with exposed.

280
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,311
That was supposed to have ended there.

281
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,532
Unless that man didn't appear before me this morning

282
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,491
after my night shift.

283
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:54,771
You were a doctor after all!

284
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:56,751
You lied!

285
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,501
He got suspicious of me back then

286
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:04,731
and said he traced me from the book that I was reading.

287
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,191
You're not going to tell me you forgot!

288
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:11,511
After that, my daughter was carried into the hospital at the next station!

289
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,261
But, she didn't make it.

290
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,391
Apologize to my daughter.

291
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,080
According to his story,

292
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,708
her cause of death seems to have been

293
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,808
the worsening of a chronic disease that she had.

294
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:29,333
It wasn't a problem of her life having been saved

295
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,247
if I examined her right away or not.

296
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:36,291
He told me that he couldn't forgive me

297
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,661
the fact that I lied to him.

298
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,171
I agree.

299
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,391
Therefore, I thought that it was neither a coincidence nor an irony,

300
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:47,311
but rather divine punishment,

301
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:52,204
that he was brought to this hospital and ended up being my patient.

302
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:58,251
Although I feel that you can't believe me, I wanted to save him.

303
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:03,191
As a doctor if I had done the same back then for his daughter, maybe...

304
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:04,781
I...

305
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,491
I regret it.

306
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,631
What is this? Something's still not right.

307
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,331
What about the jacket that was soiled with paint?

308
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,461
Over there. In the trunk of the car.

309
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,461
It's not in here.

310
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,511
No way. I'm sure that...

311
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,411
I see. That's the story!

312
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,061
What's the matter, Conan?

313
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,131
That's murder, you know!

314
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:54,201
Weren't you riding together?

315
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,451
"Natsumi Morita (25), Nurse" -On Dr. Kido's car?

316
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:04,711
When you told him that you'd get rid of the jacket with the paint on it,

317
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:07,621
I'll bet the Doctor told you not to.

318
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,251
Yes.

319
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:12,391
I thought that maybe he was going to turn himself in

320
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:16,171
to the police if this man was saved.

321
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,891
If he does that,

322
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,771
the fact that I was having an affair with him would come to light.

323
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,521
That's why. That's why...

324
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,591
The man's awake!

325
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:41,981

No problem. I'm glad you're okay.

By the way, what's your name, sir?

00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:22,101
I forgot to introduce myself.

331
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:24,011
Forgot?

332
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:29,271
Come to think of it. I had a feeling I had forgotten something.

333
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,401
It's cold.

334
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,651
Why am I here? I guess I'll get going home.
