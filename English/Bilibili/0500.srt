1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:05,775
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:07,475
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:10,175
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:13,875
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,575
The Organization is trying to recover their member, Rena Mizunashi.

6
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:21,275
They sprung a clever trap.

7
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:23,175
The fake image of Rena Mizunashi

8
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:26,475
that the Organization aired on TV.

9
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:31,075
As a result, the FBI revealed her hospital room.

10
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:33,675
Now that we know, we'd better get out of here fast.

11
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:35,075
We will take the last resort

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,975
that we talked of this morning.

13
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,875
We're splitting up in three different cars

14
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,575
and going to confuse the Organization

15
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,975
while we make it out of this hospital.

16
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,575
It just dawned on me

17
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,375
after hearing what the boy had to say.

18
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,075
An excellent plan to deceive them

19
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,775
and get Rena Mizunashi out of here.

20
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:55,675
So, three cars that driven by Camel and two other agents,

21
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:57,975
start off with Rena Mizunashi inside.

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,975
It looks as if the plan had succeeded, however...

23
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:07,875
No, the one that we've gotta go after

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,975
is the third car that Vodka is pursuing.

25
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,375
Kir is in there.

26
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,275
Huh? Why?

27
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,775
Akai would never goof and overtake us in a single spurt

28
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:26,275
in an attempt to divert our attention

29
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,075
from the car he's guarding.

30
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,275
It's a trap that he used to lure us to him.

31
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,275
Trap.

32
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,675
But, boss...

33
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:42,075
The backseat of the car I'm pursuing is empty,

34
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:44,675
and there are only two FBI agents sitting in the front.

35
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,075
It's true that an FBI agent is driving.

36
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,875
But the one sitting in the passenger's seat is Kir.

37
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:58,975
They expected us to assume that the unconscious Kir

38
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:03,075
would placed be on a stretcher in the back of the car.

39
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,875
So, they tried to making her hold a communicator

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,775
and put her in the passenger's seat to disguise her as an FBI agent.

41
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:13,975
But, wasn't that third car headed for the hospital again?

42
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:16,175
All the more, it made me come to this conclusion.

43
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:19,175
Although the FBI knew that we found out where Kir was,

44
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:22,075
they couldn't move her right away

45
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,075
because they had nowhere to take her in this situation.

46
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,475
So, they wanted to make it look like they moved her to another hospital

47
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,875
and returned to the same hospital

48
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:34,975
as if nothing had happened.

49
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,175
Because they figured...

50
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:40,175
we would never search that hospital again.

51
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,475
Sizzling hot suspense.

52
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:00,075
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

53
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,775
It's a sink or swim contest.

54
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,575
Kir's secret is revealed.

55
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,075
He sees through the one and only truth.

56
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:06,875
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

57
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,775
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

58
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:46,923
"Red and Black Crash: Last Words"

59
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:17,223
What? A black Chevy and four motorbikes?

60
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:19,823
Don't tell me they found out?

61
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,623
Most probably yes.

62
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,323
But, I'm sure I can break them away

63
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,323
with my driving skills.

64
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,323
Hey, what's up, Camel?

65
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,923
Camel! What's up?

66
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:18,623
It's hurt.

67
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,123
Kir.

68
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,323
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,023
What's with the car?

70
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,723
I found out that you came to save me

71
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,023
through the wireless of the FBI,

72
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:36,523
so I hit him with the bomb case I was holding

73
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:38,123
and pulled the side brakes.

74
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:41,223
Which means that the FBI hospitalized you

75
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,623
but you were conscious?

76
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:45,623
Yes, I regained consciousness two or three days ago.

77
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:49,723
Although the FBI seems to have thought I was in a coma all this time.

78
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,823
Well, since we got Kir back

79
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,723
and all shall we split.

80
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:56,023
Yeah.

81
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,823
After we get rid of this stupid FBI agent

82
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,323
who took on this fat role all alone.

83
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,323
Kill him, Chianti.

84
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:07,323
Okay.

85
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,423
If you must blame someone,

86
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:15,723
blame the FBI who thought up such a stupid strategy...

87
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:29,923
Explosion?

88
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:32,023
Don't tell me he had the bomb in his pocket

89
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:33,423
without removing the fuse?

90
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,623
Maybe the fuse coincidentally returned in tact

91
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,423
from the impact of the crash.

92
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,523
Huh, an accident?

93
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:48,123
Oh my.

94
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,223
Oh no. Gotta call an ambulance!

95
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:53,023
The mob...

96
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,423
Kir, get inside my car.

97
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:55,423
We're splitting.

98
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,823
Succeeded...

99
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,823
Great, good work.

100
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,523
"Haido Central Hospital" -What?

101
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:28,723
You deliberately handed Rena Mizunashi

102
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,623
over to the Organization?

103
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:33,123
Yeah, that's why I told Camel

104
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:36,423
to boast about his driving technique.

105
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:40,323
So that he would be chosen as the driver of the car

106
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,723
that would help Rena Mizunashi escape from this hospital.

107
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,523
Then we made the Organization pick out the car

108
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,823
and made them get her back.

109
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:51,523
We made them think that they outfoxed us

110
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,223
after figuring out what our plan was.

111
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:55,323
I thought it out together with this boy here,

112
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:57,723
after racking out brains.

113
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:59,223
Then, what?

114
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:02,623
-Gorilla? -You mean this gorilla hitting me...

115
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:04,423
was also part of the plan?

116
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:07,523
Yeah, I ordered him to silence anyone

117
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:10,823
who would get in the way of this plan.

118
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:14,923
Besides, this time we were fortunately able to make them think

119
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:17,923
the driver died because of their bomb.

120
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,423
At that time...

121
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:24,023
He had the car drift

122
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,323
in order to face the driver's seat towards the guardrail,

123
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,623
and stop the car at the best position possible for the door

124
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:31,223
to be for escaping.

125
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,523
Moreover, he had to match the timing of explosion

126
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:35,823
and escape at the right time.

127
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,523
Otherwise, he had no chance of succeeding.

128
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,223
I couldn't possibly have made you

129
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,823
who have no driving technique to do the job, right?

130
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:52,623
But, Rena Mizunashi was the only line connecting them to us.

131
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:56,223
Why did you hand her over to them just like that?

132
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,623
I made a contract with her last night.

133
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:01,323
I asked her to become not a plain line

134
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:04,823
but a fishing line for us the FBI.

135
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:10,323
I was maneuvered into doing so by this boy.

136
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:16,723
Oh... you never fail to surprise me, sonny.

137
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:19,423
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

138
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:20,923
Same here, sonny.

139
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:26,923
It's time you get some rest.

140
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:27,923
We've got a long night ahead of us.

141
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,523
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:44,623
And? What do you say, Mr. Akai?

143
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:48,523
Do you want to try this sink or swim plan?

144
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,123
Of course.

145
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,723
First, please bring the Prince

146
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:54,223
that will be waking Sleeping Beauty here.

147
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,023
Mr. Akai, emergency conference.

148
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,523
A strategy meeting?

149
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,523
Yes.

150
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,923
I sure hope they have a great plan.

151
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,623
Hey, wake up, Rena Mizunashi.

152
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,423
If you don't get up,

153
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,923
I can't ask you how Hidemi is right now.

154
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,423
Hey, wake up!

155
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,623
Wake up, please!

156
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:37,723
They're going to take you some place again, aren't they?

157
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:40,323
Before that happens, open your eyes!

158
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:43,623
Hey, I'm telling you! Open your eyes!

159
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,723
No, Ei-chan.

160
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,223
I told you, didn't I?

161
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,123
That you should never become a person who hurt other people.

162
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,123
Big sis?

163
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:58,023
Yes, right, Ei-chan.

164
00:11:58,023 --> 00:11:59,723
So, don't ask any questions now

165
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,123
and just get out of this dangerous place.

166
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,623
Please.

167
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,823
No! You have type AB blood!

168
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:09,123
If you're big sis who gave me blood,

169
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,423
you should have type O blood!

170
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:12,323
Because I am her younger brother

171
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:15,823
who can only receive blood from others with type O!

172
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:18,523
Your blood changed to type AB

173
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,523
during the bone-marrow transplant

174
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,023
for treatment of leukemia.

175
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,923
Your older sister's bone-marrow was used for the transplant

176
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:26,223
was the H.L.A.

177
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,323
In other words, the bone-marrow of siblings

178
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:32,223
often have a higher matching rate of human leukocyte antigen.

179
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:35,823
At the same time, Eisuke's type O blood that was infected with leukemia

180
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,423
was destroyed using X-rays.

181
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:42,023
They transplanted bone-marrow from your sister who has AB blood.

182
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:45,323
That's why your blood type

183
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:49,223
changed from O to AB, Eisuke.

184
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,623
I am type AB?

185
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:53,323
Yep, I'm sure there's no mistake about it.

186
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:56,023
The nurse who was present during your surgery

187
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:58,723
told me that you had leukemia.

188
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:01,323
She also told me that the wound on your chest

189
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:05,123
is the mark left behind because of repeated needles injected there

190
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:08,723
to examine the condition of the tumor cells within the bone-marrow.

191
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:10,623
But, if so...

192
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,223
Why?

193
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:14,723
Why didn't you tell me about it?

194
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,023
Why did you even change your name

195
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,723
and work as an announcer?

196
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,423
Ei-chan.

197
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:21,823
Sis!

198
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,023
It can't be helped.

199
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:27,223
Because your sister...

200
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,323
is a CIA agent.

201
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,193
CIA?

202
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:52,593
What're you talking about?

203
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,893
Why would you be doing something like that?

204
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,493
Not only your older sister,

205
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:58,493
but your father was one too.

206
00:13:58,493 --> 00:13:59,893
Father too?

207
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:00,893
Yeah.

208
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:04,393
They snuck into a certain Organization to make investigations.

209
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:08,893
And, she was forced to become an announcer to suit their needs.

210
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,993
She pretended to be someone else,

211
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,693
and deliberately didn't explain anything to you

212
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:14,593
to keep you from coming to see her after seeing her on TV.

213
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:18,593
I guess that's what it was.

214
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,693
Well, it turned out the way she didn't expect

215
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,093
because you came to see her anyway.

216
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:27,293
Hey, hold it. I can't make it out.

217
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,293
What on earth is that certain Organization anyway?

218
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,093
Enough.

219
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,593
That's as far as you need to know.

220
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,793
Camel, do your thing.

221
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,293
-Yes, sir. -Huh? Hey...

222
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,593
I'm still not finished!

223
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:47,493
By the way, I think the strategy meeting is about to start.

224
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:50,793
Lock that boy inside a vacant room and go on ahead.

225
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,093
I'll be right over when I'm finished here.

226
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:56,093
Just do as I asked you to over the phone.

227
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:57,693
Roger.

228
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:00,993
So, do you know me?

229
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,093
Yes, I do,

230
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:04,493
Shuichi Akai.

231
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:07,793
The FBI agent that the Organization fears the most.

232
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:09,493
Okay, then I guess it won't take much time,

233
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,493
then I'll get right to the point.

234
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:14,893
Before that tell me,

235
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:18,493
how did you know that I was a CIA agent?

236
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:22,093
First, the method of detecting lies that you tried on me at the park

237
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:25,193
when you were interviewing Mr. Domon.

238
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,693
Don't tell me you followed me here?

239
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,293
Nope, I just happened to come here.

240
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:30,693
It's just a coincidence.

241
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,693
You tried to check whether I was lying

242
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,493
by checking my pulse,

243
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:36,893
steadiness of breathing and whether my pupils were dilated.

244
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,693
These are methods that the CIA usually use.

245
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,093
And later...

246
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:44,593
Thank you, you're a life-saver.

247
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,493
Thank you so very much.

248
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,093
You knowing that I was lying to you

249
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,193
about being there coincidentally,

250
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,193
but thanked me anyway, right?

251
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,193
You were actually saying,

252
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:58,893
thanks to you, I didn't end up killing Mr. Domon, right?

253
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:03,193
And besides, the words you mumbled before Gin and the others.

254
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:07,093
Our achievements never see the light.

255
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:10,393
But when we fail, everything is disclosed.

256
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:13,793
That's a CIA cliche, right?

257
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:17,693
Well, it seems that Bellmot sort of knew already.

258
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:20,193
Don't tell me you're...

259
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,293
like this?

260
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:26,093
That knocking was a play on words Vermouth

261
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,093
used for non official cover or NOC, wasn't it?

262
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:31,993
She wanted to ask if you were a CIA agent.

263
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:34,493
Actually back then a communicator and wiretap

264
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,193
was on the sole of your shoe.

265
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:38,293
It coincidentally happened to be there,

266
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:41,093
the one that you used trying to catch the prankster

267
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,193
who rung your doorbell and fled.

268
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:45,993
Oh I see.

269
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:48,193
But, how did you find out about father?

270
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:50,593
Since we already knew his name was Hondo,

271
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,093
it was simple.

272
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,393
Besides, this boy had already informed us

273
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:57,793
that he maybe a member of what was called the Company too.

274
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:02,393
But, you didn't think I could do it, did you?

275
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,193
That I could kill...

276
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,193
You own father, you mean?

277
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,393
Huh?

278
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,393
He bit his own wrist and shot himself under the chin.

279
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:15,193
Rather, he made it look that way, is more correct.

280
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:19,393
Your father, Ethern Hondo did so to protect his daughter.

281
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:23,393
He also prepared an MD that had a recording of him questioning you.

282
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:24,893
He made it just in case,

283
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:28,393
under the assumption that they found out you were a CIA agent.

284
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:29,793
Isn't that right?

285
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:33,093
Yes. It was all father's idea.

286
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,993
I was so involved in melting in with the Organization

287
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:37,693
that I couldn't handle anything more than that.

288
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:38,693
At the same time,

289
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:41,393
I wasn't planning to stay that long in the Organization.

290
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,293
Yes, my mission as a CIA agent

291
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,093
was to find a new person to act as connection

292
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,993
for my father who snuck into the Organization,

293
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,993
and introduce him to them.

294
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:51,693
The former person was killed

295
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,193
and all contacts were severed.

296
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,493
After all was done,

297
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,093
I was supposed to look like I died

298
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:01,093
and leave the Organization.

299
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,293
But...

300
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,393
He's the new connection.

301
00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:09,093
Barney. You know him, don't you?

302
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,793
He'll be here soon.

303
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:14,393
Okay. You haven't been followed, have you?

304
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,693
No, I was taping a TV program,

305
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,593
but I said that I'd go to take a quick nap for about an hour

306
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:23,393
because I wasn't feeling well.

307
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,793
Since this place is near the station

308
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,093
as well as the next transaction site of the Organization,

309
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,293
I figured it was my chance to see you

310
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:32,593
since I heard you were coming.

311
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,093
Did you change your clothes?

312
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:36,693
No, I didn't.

313
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,093
Don't move.

314
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,493
Come on, father, nothing's on me.

315
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:41,693
Look.

316
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,693
It's a communicator.

317
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:47,493
I never had anything like that put on me before.

318
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,693
It's a specially developed item

319
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,293
and will vanish in 24 hours.

320
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:55,093
It's a bell that they use on newcomers to watch them.

321
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:02,993
That's a Porsche.

322
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,693
It's Gin.

323
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,093
Father.

324
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,293
Just what're you...

325
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,893
Endure it, this is the only way out.

326
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,993
You...

327
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,693
Listen, this is the story.

328
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:29,993
You found me who was acting suspicious,

329
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:31,893
so you pursued me and cornered me.

330
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:35,493
But, you were caught by me instead and interrogated.

331
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,993
And you bit my wrist,

332
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:40,093
took my gun and blew my head off.

333
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,593
If you shoot from under my chin,

334
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:44,593
the blood in my mouth won't be suspected.

335
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,893
In case for times like this,

336
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:50,093
I have an MD of me questioning you

337
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:52,693
in the chest pocket of my jacket.

338
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:57,193
All you have to do is say I didn't say anything.

339
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,593
And this is...

340
00:19:58,593 --> 00:19:59,993
a truth serum.

341
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:01,893
I'll inject a little in you,

342
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:03,693
so they believe you.

343
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,293
I don't want you to go confessing everything, you see.

344
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:10,093
Don't give up, Hidemi.

345
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,793
If you keep waiting,

346
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,593
people on your side will surely appear.

347
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:17,193
Fulfill the mission for me!

348
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:24,593
Soon later Gin and Vodka came along.

349
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:26,693
I told them what father told me to say,

350
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,493
so I wasn't killed.

351
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,693
Barney who came later saw them

352
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,593
and killed himself on the spot.

353
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:37,693
Then, you wanted Pops...

354
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,093
to look for the prankster that kept ringing your doorbell,

355
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:42,593
because you wanted to find a new person to act as connector?

356
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:47,693
No, I just wanted to know how to contact the renown detective.

357
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,893
I wanted to ask him to guard Eisuke.

358
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:53,593
He kept calling the station repeatedly

359
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:56,893
that I thought he'd end up coming to see me one day.

360
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,493
Of course, I wrote him an honest mail,

361
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,193
telling him that approaching me

362
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:05,293
would mean getting involved with a dangerous organization.

363
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:09,393
I wasn't sure if he was going to believe me though.

364
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,093
But, maybe I should've wrote to you instead?

365
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:16,593
You knew that I had regained consciousness, didn't you?

366
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,593
Yep. Remember the time I came back to this room

367
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,193
saying that I forgot something?

368
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,793
I realized back then.

369
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,393
Because the wrinkles of the sheets around your neck

370
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:33,693
were slightly moved from when I first left the room.

371
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,893
By the way, I also knew that Eisuke

372
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:39,593
was hiding some place in this hospital.

373
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:43,293
His classmate Nakamichi

374
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:45,393
just happened to be hospitalized here.

375
00:21:45,393 --> 00:21:48,393
Because when I asked him if he saw Eisuke, he said no.

376
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:51,693
No, I didn't see Hondo,

377
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:54,193
but if it's a member of my soccer club Eisuke Aizawa,

378
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:57,093
he came to see me right away.

379
00:21:57,093 --> 00:22:00,093
With only that much information, how?

380
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,093
Because all I said was Eisuke

381
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:04,693
and he knew that it was Eisuke Hondo that I was looking for

382
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,293
and not Eisuke Aizawa.

383
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:11,093
So I could tell that Nakamichi knew but was hiding it from me.

384
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,193
That's how I knew for sure

385
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:17,893
that he was letting Eisuke hide in his room.

386
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:20,993
You sure are really something.

387
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:25,893
Yeah, he's awesome to the point of amazing even the FBI.

388
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:27,793
And what do you plan to do?

389
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,593
The Organization is coming to get me back, aren't they?

390
00:22:30,593 --> 00:22:33,493
Yeah, this is what I propose.

391
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,493
I hope you're not going to tell me

392
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:41,493
to go back to that Organization again?

393
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,893
Of course.

394
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,993
That's exactly what I want you to do.

395
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:12,093
"Next Episode"

396
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:14,993
Rena Mizunashi returns to the Organization.

397
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:16,993
Although quite thin,

398
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:20,293
the string that is drawn taut finally connects to them.

399
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,993
We must be extremely careful

400
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,893
and keep on the look-out

401
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,993
that this string is not severed.

402
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,293
However...

403
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:33,293
The ominous Friday the 13th arrives.

404
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:36,793
Next on Detective Conan,

405
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:40,793
"The Red and Black Crash: Suspicion"

406
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,493
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:01,093
Foreign talents.

408
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:02,393
This is the 500th episode that has been aired.

409
00:25:02,393 --> 00:25:03,693
Thank you, everybody.

410
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:06,193
This is no more than a point of transit, though.
