1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.640
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.540
Deductions take all shapes and styles in each and every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.940
That unforgettable melody

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.740
brought us an unusual case.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.840
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.299
I get involved in a case

10
00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.299
and end up getting hurt.

11
00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.699
The blood transfusion from Ran saves me.

12
00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.799
But Ran has guessed who I really am.

13
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.899
An antidote Haibara makes for me

14
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.999
changes me back into Shinichi,

15
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.199
and then she disguises herself to look like Conan

16
00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.899
so that Ran's suspicions will vanish.

17
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.199
Please.

18
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.199
I need just a little more time.

19
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.599
She...

20
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.499
she's waiting for me.

21
00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.399
I can't turn into Conan again now... not yet.

22
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.899
Haibara? You...

23
00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.499
Why...

24
00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.199
24 minutes over time.

25
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.999
I guess that's the maximum tolerance level.

26
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.099
I'll consider this a loan.

27
00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.599
Edogawa.

28
00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:04.899
"The Entrusted Music Box (Part 1)"

29
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.799
What is it?

30
00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.899
The antidote for the APTX4869.

31
00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.199
You still have some, don't you?

32
00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.599
May I have some?

33
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.099
Not on your life.

34
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.399
I wouldn't think of giving you any,

35
00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.099
not with your habit of unthinkingly getting involved

36
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.299
with any dangerous crime you come across.

37
00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.999
Forget about it.

38
00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.199
Well, let me apologize then.

39
00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.699
I'll try to be more careful next time.

40
00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.999
I already told you. That was a trial drug.

41
00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.999
I can't go around administering unperfected drugs.

42
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.499
You could really die from it next time.

43
00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.499
I guess you can't come up with the real thing

44
00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.999
using only the ingredients for paikal (a Chinese liquor).

45
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.799
Yes, if only we had the data for the real drug.

46
00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.199
Oh well, you should just be grateful she fell for our ruse

47
00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.699
and count your blessings.

48
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.799
Oh, rats. If I'd known it was going to turn out like this,

49
00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.699
I should have just told her what I intended to.

50
00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.999
It's Doctor Agasa.

51
00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.199
Conan, are you sure you won't come?

52
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.999
We're going to the city's indoor pool.

53
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.399
It has a wave making machine, it's really cool.

54
00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:14.999
Sorry, I've still got a cold.

55
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.099
See you later.

56
00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:24.599
Haibara, you're in a good mood.

57
00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.199
I bet something nice happened to you.

58
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.899
Yeah, the school lunch today was curry.

59
00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.499
She's not you, Genta.

60
00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.799
Well, here we go all over again.

61
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.699
"Mouri Detective Agency"

62
00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.599
Good grief...

63
00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.499
and it's already summer.

64
00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.599
I guess spring won't be entering my life for a long time.

65
00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.899
Huh? I know this song.

66
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.299
It's "Haru yo Koi"?

67
00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.499
I'm back.

68
00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.699
Hi, Conan, welcome home.

69
00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.299
Why I didn't know you had a son too?

70
00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:12.999
I don't, I'm just taking care of this kid and...

71
00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.699
What's wrong with this music box?

72
00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.099
It sounds like it's skipping a few keys here and there.

73
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.499
This is none of your business.

74
00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:22.799
How old are you, son?

75
00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:24.899
I'm 7 years old.

76
00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:28.199
He's in the 1st grade but he's very perceptive

77
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.699
and he's a big help when it come to solving crimes.

78
00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:32.899
I see.

79
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.299
I guess that makes you a little detective, doesn't it?

80
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.999
Oh, that's right. Why don't you tell Conan about it?

81
00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.599
Maybe he'll be able to help finding

82
00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.599
the person Haruna is looking for.

83
00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.299
She's looking for someone?

84
00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:47.999
The truth is...

85
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.599
A bell friend?

86
00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.799
You're looking for a pocket bell (beeper) friend?

87
00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:59.299
Yes, that's right. His name is Shugo.

88
00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:01.399
We met 3 years ago.

89
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.699
I came to Tokyo around then to attend an art university.

90
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.599
I had a hard time making friends and I was very lonely,

91
00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.199
so I started pressing numbers at random on my pocket bell

92
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.199
and sent messages saying, "My name is Haruna,

93
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.699
will you be my friend?"

94
00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.599
And who would have imagined.

95
00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.499
I got a reply saying "My first girlfriend's name was Haruna.

96
00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.399
This must be fate, let's be friends".

97
00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.699
We've been bell friends ever since.

98
00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:30.999
He seemed like such a nice old man

99
00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.799
that I could confide all my secrets to.

100
00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:36.499
Then if you send a message with your pocket bell

101
00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:38.499
that you want to see him, won't he come?

102
00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.099
That's no longer possible.

103
00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.999
You see, his pocket bell is here with me.

104
00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.099
It was last Christmas.

105
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.499
I'd been working part-time to pay for my tuition

106
00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.899
but it was hard making ends meet

107
00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.899
so I'd decided to quit school and go back home,

108
00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.999
so I figured that before I left, I'd meet him just once

109
00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.799
so we decided to meet in front of the Hachiko statue

110
00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:09.499
at the Shibuya station.

111
00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.499
I waited for a long time,

112
00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.999
but no one fitting his description appeared.

113
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:17.499
And just when I decided to give up and leave.

114
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:25.699
I looked inside and found his pocket bell

115
00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.099
along with this music box

116
00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.699
But how did you know, that was his pocket bell?

117
00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.099
There was a message on that pocket bell,

118
00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.999
it said, "This music box is worth a lot of money,

119
00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.399
please use it to pay for your tuition

120
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.699
and don't give up your dreams, Haruna"

121
00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:45.999
I couldn't very well

122
00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.499
accept such an expensive present, how could I?

123
00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:50.899
That's why I thought I'd have it looked at

124
00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:54.999
and maybe the owner could be found, then I could give it back.

125
00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.799
I took it to an antique shop.

126
00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.199
But the antique dealer said

127
00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.899
it was just an old, broken music box.

128
00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.499
And I've started getting strange messages on my pocket bell.

129
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.999
Strange messages?

130
00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:14.799
It said, "I have something to ask you.

131
00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:18.299
Meet me at the place I've indicated, come alone."

132
00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.099
And then? Did you go?

133
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.799
No, because the tone just wasn't Shugo's style.

134
00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:27.699
It scared me somehow, that's why I didn't go.

135
00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:30.499
Later that night though, I got messages reading,

136
00:08:30.499 --> 00:08:34.799
"Thief", more than 10 of them.

137
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.399
More than 10?

138
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.999
Thief, eh? Do you know what it mean?

139
00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:43.499
No, and there was no way to contact the sender

140
00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:45.199
to ask what it meant.

141
00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:48.899
I thought it might have something to do with Shugo,

142
00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.099
that's why I came to you for help.

143
00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:53.499
And are you still getting those messages?

144
00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:57.199
No, they kept coming for some time but not anymore.

145
00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:02.899
That means this music box is our only clue.

146
00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:07.099
But what can an off tune music box possibly tell us?

147
00:09:07.099 --> 00:09:09.499
I don't think it's a lost cause...

148
00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:11.399
Here, look.

149
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:14.999
The pins on the drum of this music box are broken.

150
00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:17.399
And it doesn't look like they broke off naturally because of long use,

151
00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.599
it looks like they were deliberately twisted

152
00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.599
and broken off, doesn't it?

153
00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:25.199
-You're right. -It could be some kind of message.

154
00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:27.699
It's possible. The song is, "Haru yo Koi"

155
00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:30.999
and the missing notes are the la, do and la at the end.

156
00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:34.099
Ladola? It sounds like some kind of monster.

157
00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:36.999
Do you know the words for the missing parts?

158
00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.199
Let's see, that part of the song goes,

159
00:09:38.199 --> 00:09:41.099
"Onmo e detai to matte iru"...

160
00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:45.799
Which means the missing parts are 'mo' and 'de' and 'ru'.

161
00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.999
'Mo de ru'?

162
00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:51.799
Model. Shugo's a model.

163
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.299
Now that we know that much,

164
00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:55.199
we can ask around all the model agencies.

165
00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:56.999
That won't be necessary,

166
00:09:56.999 --> 00:10:00.399
it'll be faster if we go talk to him personally.

167
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.399
Stupid, she can't do that, that's why she's here.

168
00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.199
But you have the number for his pocket bell, don't you?

169
00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:10.099
Then you can explain the situation to Officer Takagi

170
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:13.199
and have him contact the pocket bell company.

171
00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:15.599
I'm sure we'll be able to get an address.

172
00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.799
Way to go, Conan.

173
00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:21.699
We've got the address and the telephone number.

174
00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:23.799
You could be smarter than Shinichi.

175
00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:28.199
Not, really. Officer Takagi did the work.

176
00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.999
That's what I call abusing his authority.

177
00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.499
By the way, Haruna,

178
00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:36.599
are you sure he said you could visit him?

179
00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:38.499
Yes, but I don't think

180
00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:41.399
he was the one who answered the phone.

181
00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.499
Everyone in his family seemed to know

182
00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:46.099
he was very much into pocket bell communication.

183
00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:47.799
So when I told them that,

184
00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:48.999
I wanted to return the pocket bell and music box

185
00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:50.699
I was keeping for him,

186
00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:52.899
I was told to come by anytime.

187
00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:55.699
I'm really looking forward to meeting him.

188
00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:57.299
Yes, so am I.

189
00:11:02.699 --> 00:11:04.999
Excuse me. It's me, Haruna.

190
00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:08.299
Yes. Please come in.

191
00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:10.999
"Kazuko Ogata (50), Tsuneo's wife" -Oh my,

192
00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:14.099
you've brought friends along.

193
00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:17.199
I guess you could say we're her escorts.

194
00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:19.799
Mother, we can talk about that later.

195
00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.999
Shiro.

196
00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:24.299
The infamous "Haruna" has come to pay us a visit.

197
00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:27.099
Let's have her relax in her room for a while.

198
00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:31.199
After all, she was such a comfort to our grandfather.

199
00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:32.499
Your grandfather?

200
00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:33.899
That's right.

201
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:37.399
But first, why don't you offer him some incense?

202
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.799
Did she say incense?

203
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.499
You don't think...

204
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:45.499
Did he pass away?

205
00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:49.099
Yes, very suddenly at the end of last year.

206
00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:51.299
That's terrible.

207
00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:54.799
Did he do any modeling?

208
00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:57.399
-What? -I guess not.

209
00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:04.299
By the way, about the music box you got from my father...

210
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:07.199
Yes, this is it. Here you are.

211
00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:09.399
I understand it's worth a lot of money

212
00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:11.099
so I'd like to return it.

213
00:12:11.099 --> 00:12:12.999
That's very kind of you.

214
00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:16.499
Why... this tune...

215
00:12:16.499 --> 00:12:18.499
Haru yo Koi?

216
00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:19.599
You...

217
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:22.599
It's the song mother often played on the harp.

218
00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:23.799
"Tsuneo Ogata (53), Current Ogata family head"

219
00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:27.099
Mother? The woman in the photo?

220
00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:30.699
That's right, that's my mother Haruna next to father's photo,

221
00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:32.799
she died 3 years ago.

222
00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:35.899
-Haruna? -3 years ago?

223
00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:42.999
I think you reminded my grandfather of our late grandmother.

224
00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:46.199
He was very happy,

225
00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:48.399
he told everyone Haruna had come back.

226
00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:53.299
I realize this is rude, but isn't it rather unusual

227
00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:55.299
for a man his age to be using a pocket bell?

228
00:12:55.299 --> 00:12:56.799
Not at all.

229
00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:02.399
After mother died, father began to taking late night walks.

230
00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:05.599
We made him carry one along because we were worried about him.

231
00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:09.199
By the way...

232
00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:13.099
Was there anything in the music box?

233
00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:14.399
Like what?

234
00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.199
Well, for instance...

235
00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:17.699
Stamps.

236
00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:20.299
"Minoru Ogata (25), Ogata family eldest son" -A set of four,

237
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.499
they're hand carved and worth about 200 million yen.

238
00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:24.899
Minoru.

239
00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:27.599
There's only one reason for you to come all the way here,

240
00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.399
grandfather told you where he hid it

241
00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:31.999
and you're here to look for it, aren't you?

242
00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:33.599
That's not why I'm here.

243
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:38.199
Oh, never mind. You'll show your true colors eventually.

244
00:13:38.199 --> 00:13:41.799
You just relax and have a nice stay, Haruna.

245
00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:44.699
Good grief. Don't mind him.

246
00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:48.999
He's just irritated because his company's not doing too good.

247
00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.999
We appreciate you coming here today,

248
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.699
why don't you join us for dinner?

249
00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:58.899
We'd like to hear about dad from you.

250
00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:01.899
I wonder what that guy meant about stamps

251
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:03.999
worth 200 million yen

252
00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:09.299
and I wonder what those missing keys on the music box mean.

253
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.899
What does it mean?

254
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:28.589
All those questions... during dinner.

255
00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:31.689
Poor Haruna, I feel sorry for her.

256
00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:34.089
And on top of that, it starts to pour

257
00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:36.189
so we end up having to spend the night.

258
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:38.489
Hey, don't you think this is weird?

259
00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:40.289
Yes, everyone in this family

260
00:14:40.289 --> 00:14:43.889
except for Shiro the second son is weird.

261
00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:45.289
That's not what I meant.

262
00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:47.989
Look at that, behind Shugo's mortuary tablet.

263
00:14:47.989 --> 00:14:51.089
It says he died on December 6th.

264
00:14:51.689 --> 00:14:54.089
So, what about it?

265
00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:57.189
Well, Haruna said she got the music box

266
00:14:57.189 --> 00:15:00.689
last year at Christmas.

267
00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:04.389
Which means, if Haruna is telling the truth,

268
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:08.489
then it wasn't Shugo that gave it to her,

269
00:15:08.489 --> 00:15:11.089
it must have been someone else, right?

270
00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:17.189
Let's just forget all about the unpleasantness

271
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:18.389
and get some sleep.

272
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:19.589
All right.

273
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:34.889
Hey, what's the matter, Ran?

274
00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:36.789
An... an old man with a cane

275
00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:38.889
just walked down the corridor and went to the left!

276
00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:40.289
Who's there?

277
00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:44.289
There's nobody out there.

278
00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:47.289
But I'm positive I saw him go left.

279
00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:51.389
But that's where I'm sleeping.

280
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:52.489
What's wrong?

281
00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:56.489
Has something happened?

282
00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:57.989
It's nothing, my daughter thought

283
00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:01.289
she saw a strange shadow of someone.

284
00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:02.789
Someone's shadow?

285
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:09.589
I think their imagination got the best of them.

286
00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:11.289
It wasn't our imagination.

287
00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:14.289
Didn't the guest who stayed with us the last time

288
00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:16.889
say they thought they felt someone walk past their pillow

289
00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:18.289
when they were asleep?

290
00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:20.789
You mean it happened before?

291
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:22.089
Well, yes.

292
00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:27.289
But we should be the only ones here tonight.

293
00:16:27.289 --> 00:16:28.889
By the way, where's Minoru?

294
00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:30.689
Probably in the bath.

295
00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:33.989
Good grief, now what?

296
00:16:33.989 --> 00:16:36.789
It sounded like a bowstring breaking.

297
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:39.789
You don't think it's from the room where mother keeps her koto?

298
00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:42.389
Let's go and have a look.

299
00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:48.089
Hey, wait for us!

300
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:58.089
Minoru...

301
00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:01.589
Hang in there, Minoru. Minoru.

302
00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:03.289
Minoru, wake up.

303
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:05.589
Hang on, Minoru.

304
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:15.889
-It's impossible. -What's wrong, Haruna?

305
00:17:15.889 --> 00:17:17.089
Haruna.

306
00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.889
I don't believe it.

307
00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.689
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"?

308
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:23.689
What?

309
00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:29.789
"I was waiting for you, Haruna"

310
00:17:30.689 --> 00:17:34.789
Do you suppose this means that old man's shadow we just saw

311
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:37.189
as well as what just happened is all the work of Shugo,

312
00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.889
the man who died last year...

313
00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:42.789
You idiot! Once a person dies, they can't do anything.

314
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:44.789
Instead of wasting time making silly deductions,

315
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:45.989
get on the phone and call the police.

316
00:17:45.989 --> 00:17:48.289
This could be a murder case.

317
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:49.989
Hey, wait.

318
00:17:51.189 --> 00:17:53.389
Don't go killing me off.

319
00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:54.589
Minoru.

320
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.789
Minoru, what in the world happened?

321
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:57.889
How should I know?

322
00:17:57.889 --> 00:17:59.089
Somebody came out of nowhere

323
00:17:59.089 --> 00:18:01.289
and hit me on the head with something hard.

324
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.989
Something hard? You mean that koto?

325
00:18:03.989 --> 00:18:05.489
Probably.

326
00:18:05.489 --> 00:18:09.189
Isn't that koto the one grandmother loved the most?

327
00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:13.889
Haruna, don't tell me you were the one who hit me.

328
00:18:13.889 --> 00:18:15.789
I would never.

329
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.189
You're wrong.

330
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:23.089
When we heard the loud noise, we were all in Ran's room.

331
00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:24.389
Right?

332
00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:25.689
Yeah, that's right.

333
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.889
Then who did it?

334
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:31.189
Why are you asking? You saw who hit you, didn't you?

335
00:18:31.189 --> 00:18:35.489
-What? -See, you were hit on the forehead.

336
00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:39.289
That means you were hit from the front, right?

337
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:42.189
It was so dark, I couldn't see anything.

338
00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:45.289
You mean this room was dark too, when you got hit?

339
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:47.389
That's right. When I heard a strange noise

340
00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:49.589
and felt someone's presence in the dark,

341
00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:51.289
it was too late.

342
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:52.989
But, isn't that strange?

343
00:18:52.989 --> 00:18:54.589
What do you mean?

344
00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:58.789
What were you doing all by yourself in the dark?

345
00:19:00.589 --> 00:19:01.989
Well?

346
00:19:02.489 --> 00:19:04.589
I, uh...

347
00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:05.989
Minoru.

348
00:19:05.989 --> 00:19:07.189
Minoru?

349
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:18.389
You idiot. I'm sure Minoru came into this room

350
00:19:18.389 --> 00:19:21.089
because he could feel someone's presence.

351
00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:23.889
And just when he was about to turn the lights on,

352
00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:27.289
that person hit him with the koto.

353
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:29.889
Isn't that right, Minoru?

354
00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:31.789
Yes. I guess.

355
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:33.389
Then dad,

356
00:19:33.389 --> 00:19:36.089
what about the message on Haruna's pocket bell?

357
00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:39.989
Oh, that. That's probably from one of her friends.

358
00:19:39.989 --> 00:19:41.289
A friend?

359
00:19:41.289 --> 00:19:46.689
You had probably promised to meet a friend tonight

360
00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:50.789
but you forgot all about it and came here,

361
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:53.889
and so that message, "I was waiting for you"

362
00:19:53.889 --> 00:19:56.889
was probably from your friend complaining.

363
00:19:56.889 --> 00:19:59.089
Am I wrong, Haruna?

364
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:02.689
Yes. I don't remember making any such promise.

365
00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:03.889
Eh?

366
00:20:04.689 --> 00:20:06.989
Yes, well, a lot has happened to you today,

367
00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:09.689
I don't blame you for forgetting.

368
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:13.289
Then what about the old man's shadow I saw?

369
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:16.589
-Oh, that... -Maybe...

370
00:20:16.589 --> 00:20:18.589
that's who attacked my brother.

371
00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:20.789
I don't think an old man with a cane

372
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:23.889
could lift a koto as heavy as that and knock someone out.

373
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.489
You're absolutely right.

374
00:20:25.489 --> 00:20:27.589
Even if that old man did exist,

375
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:31.389
he wouldn't have been able to knock Minoru unconscious.

376
00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:33.889
Besides, the old man Ran saw

377
00:20:33.889 --> 00:20:36.789
was heading toward the end of the corridor

378
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:38.989
and even if he tried to hide in the room at the end,

379
00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:41.089
that's where Conan and I were sleeping.

380
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:42.789
Are you saying...

381
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:45.189
That old man was probably...

382
00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:47.189
Probably...

383
00:20:47.189 --> 00:20:49.089
Just your imagination.

384
00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:50.589
What?

385
00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:51.889
As people used to say,

386
00:20:51.889 --> 00:20:53.989
"Ghosts are usually withered eulalia grass."

387
00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:57.689
Wait just one minute. I really saw the old man.

388
00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.989
You're so scared of seeing ghosts,

389
00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:02.389
that's why you imagined seeing one.

390
00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:04.089
Dad.

391
00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:07.089
Anyway, ma'am, you'd better call the police.

392
00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:08.689
There's one thing we can be sure of,

393
00:21:08.689 --> 00:21:11.889
someone else besides us is in this house.

394
00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:13.889
Yes, right away.

395
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:16.989
Could Pops be right,

396
00:21:16.989 --> 00:21:20.889
is somebody hiding somewhere in this house?

397
00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:23.989
If there is, what do they want?

398
00:21:25.289 --> 00:21:29.189
By the looks of the room, nothing seems to have been touched.

399
00:21:29.189 --> 00:21:33.689
So whoever it is, Minoru is the target.

400
00:21:33.689 --> 00:21:37.889
But this isn't his room

401
00:21:37.889 --> 00:21:40.489
and I have a pretty good idea what he was doing here

402
00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:42.389
in the dark room.

403
00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:48.889
But I wonder how and when the attacker found out about it?

404
00:21:48.889 --> 00:21:51.789
And about the koto used as the weapon.

405
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:54.389
Did the attacker have a reason for picking

406
00:21:54.389 --> 00:21:56.489
the koto as the weapon?

407
00:21:57.689 --> 00:22:01.389
Rats. There's so many unanswered questions.

408
00:22:01.389 --> 00:22:04.889
The shadow of the old man Ran saw is another mystery.

409
00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:09.089
Was it really just her imagination?

410
00:22:09.089 --> 00:22:11.589
And the last mystery is...

411
00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:13.889
the off tune music box.

412
00:22:14.589 --> 00:22:16.089
I'm positive the music box

413
00:22:16.089 --> 00:22:19.089
is the key to a very important secret.

414
00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:22.089
It'll tell us where the very thing everyone in this household

415
00:22:22.089 --> 00:22:23.589
is searching for, is...

416
00:22:25.089 --> 00:22:29.989
It'll tell us where the stamps worth 200 million is hidden.

417
00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:01.389
What does this sharp mean?

418
00:24:01.389 --> 00:24:04.389
Oh, that indicates an A major.

419
00:24:04.389 --> 00:24:06.189
A major?

420
00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:11.089
No, I got the music box last Christmas.

421
00:24:11.089 --> 00:24:12.089
That's ridiculous.

422
00:24:12.089 --> 00:24:15.189
My father died last year, on December 6th.

423
00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:17.189
How can that be?

424
00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:19.689
You're not implying it was a ghost.

425
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:22.589
Conan?

426
00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:24.689
Next Conan,

427
00:24:24.689 --> 00:24:28.510
"The Entrusted Music Box (Part 2)"

428
00:24:29.107 --> 00:24:31.407
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:31.407 --> 00:24:33.307
"Fan"
