1
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:10.075
Darn, it's burnt to a crisp.

2
00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:14.975
It's so bad we determine the time of death or identify the victim.

3
00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:18.975
It's possible the victim is Saizo Kano,

4
00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.875
the man who disappeared from the ship.

5
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.975
We can't say for sure until we do a thorough investigation.

6
00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.675
I think it could be Mr. Kanie.

7
00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:32.775
Look at the wristwatch he's wearing.

8
00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.375
When I asked him for the time,

9
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.675
I'm pretty sure that was the watch he had on.

10
00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:40.775
Now that you mention it.

11
00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:45.375
Although it's badly burned, that looks like the sweater he was wearing.

12
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.075
Those slacks look like the ones he was wearing.

13
00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:53.375
How awful. Why would anyone kill Mr. Kanie?

14
00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.275
It's pretty funny though.

15
00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:57.975
Funny?

16
00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.475
Just look at him, looks how he's posed.

17
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.075
His upper body and his arm is raised,

18
00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:07.075
it looks like he's deliberately trying to show us his watch.

19
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:10.575
-Let me explain... -It's heat stiffening!

20
00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.675
When a body is burning,

21
00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:16.675
the heat causes the skeletal muscles to coagulate and shrink.

22
00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.575
"Heat Stiffening" -The result is heat stiffening!

23
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.075
There are more muscles to bend the arms and legs

24
00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:22.875
rather than stretch them.

25
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.075
And the joints begin to bend halfway

26
00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:30.675
and the result is the body looks like it's in a boxer's fighting position.

27
00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:35.275
So you see, the body gets into that position quite naturally!

28
00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.075
Is that so?

29
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:41.075
But the important question is his watchband.

30
00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:44.375
Watchband? What about it?

31
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.975
Take a good look, it's unbuckled, isn't it?

32
00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:52.375
That doesn't mean anything. See the can near the victim's feet?

33
00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:57.975
That explosion was probably set off with the gasoline in this can.

34
00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:00.175
The explosion was powerful enough to destroy the can,

35
00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:02.575
it probably blew the watch loose.

36
00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:03.875
You're probably right.

37
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:07.775
It was must've also blown the plastic sheet off.

38
00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.875
Plastic sheet?

39
00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.175
Well, when we came here looking for Kano,

40
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.875
it was on the box.

41
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.075
Just like that one.

42
00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:22.675
And then? You did look inside the box, didn't you?

43
00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.675
No, as you can see, the box is tied securely from the outside,

44
00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:29.675
I didn't think anyone could hide inside.

45
00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:34.275
Besides, no one was inside the box.

46
00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:39.175
When I got back to the lounge, Mr. Kanie was still there.

47
00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.275
Hey, Mouri.

48
00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:43.875
Who is that smart aleck kid?

49
00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:46.375
His name is Heiji Hattori.

50
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.075
His father is the Chief of Police of the Osaka Metropolitan Police.

51
00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:51.475
You mean, he's Heizo's kid?

52
00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:54.075
No wonder he knows so much.

53
00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.575
So you know the Chief of Police?

54
00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:00.875
Yes, we sparred with each other quite often during kendo practice.

55
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:04.075
But I was no match for him.

56
00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:06.075
Hey, Hattori!

57
00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:09.775
Look at that strange thing on his face.

58
00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.375
What?

59
00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:16.475
It... It's silicone!

60
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:20.975
Yes, the material is polygemethylcyclosun,

61
00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:23.075
commonly known as silicone!

62
00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:26.075
The fire warped it but these things are widely used in plastic surgery

63
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.375
to heighten the bridge of the nose.

64
00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.975
So that means this fellow had changed his looks.

65
00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:34.975
Yes, I'm sure about it!

66
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:37.675
Excuse me.

67
00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.875
We'll cover him with this.

68
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.075
Why would he have plastic surgery?

69
00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:47.375
Well, maybe he is one of the four

70
00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:50.175
who pulled off the 400 million yen robbery.

71
00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.075
He could've been part of the gang.

72
00:03:53.075 --> 00:03:55.875
If the victim really is Mr. Kanie,

73
00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:58.075
then there's a strong possibility Mr. Kameda is also part of the gang.

74
00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:01.375
They seemed to get along so well.

75
00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.075
It seemed like a get-together between friends who'd had plastic surgery

76
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.575
and hadn't seen each other since then.

77
00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.975
Which means the other partner is...

78
00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:10.975
it could be Kujirai, he seemed so interested in the case

79
00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:12.975
and he looks very nervous.

80
00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:15.975
He seems a likely candidate.

81
00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:17.975
You may be right.

82
00:04:17.975 --> 00:04:22.375
He acted a little strange when Mr. Kanie gave him his lighter.

83
00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:25.075
And another thing bothers me,

84
00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:28.575
it's what he shouted on the upper deck.

85
00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:31.375
He is alive.

86
00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:35.775
That guy is alive!

87
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:41.275
It was so obvious, he panicked when he saw the knife through the bill!

88
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.375
The writing on the bill said,

89
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.575
"Poseidon, the God of the Sea gave me life,"

90
00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:49.575
"thus my shadow is resurrected."

91
00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:52.375
The "shadow" is referring to Saizo Kano,

92
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.575
the Mastermind in the shadows

93
00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:59.175
and "resurrected", means he was once killed somewhere!

94
00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:04.575
He was probably killed by his three partners in that robbery

95
00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:09.575
and then he took on the identity of the mysterious old man.

96
00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.075
But I don't understand,

97
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:13.875
not just about the identity of the old man

98
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:16.475
who disappeared from the ship,

99
00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:18.675
but why do all three of the men involved in the robbery

100
00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:21.475
have to be on the same ship on the day the statute of limitations runs out?

101
00:05:21.475 --> 00:05:24.075
And putting out that strange advertisement to boot?

102
00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:26.375
And I'm curious about that fellow,

103
00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:29.375
Masaru Furukawa who put out that advertisement.

104
00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:33.375
Is that the real name of one of the robbers? Or is it...

105
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:37.075
Anyway, that old man holds the key to the mystery.

106
00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:40.075
I'll bet we'll find a lot of skeletons when we rattle the closet.

107
00:05:40.075 --> 00:05:42.075
Yes.

108
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.375
What? You don't remember?

109
00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:46.975
I hear you very clearly on the upper deck!

110
00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:49.175
You said "I knew it, that guy is alive!"

111
00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:51.575
Did I say that?

112
00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:53.275
Don't play games with me!

113
00:05:53.275 --> 00:05:57.375
Come on, tell the truth, you'll feel better.

114
00:05:57.375 --> 00:06:01.375
You meant Saizo Kano, didn't you?

115
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.675
I... I don't know.

116
00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.175
I don't know anything!

117
00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:08.775
I really don't!

118
00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.175
We're not getting anywhere!

119
00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.075
Sir!

120
00:06:13.075 --> 00:06:15.075
I've talked to the crew members!

121
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.475
And, how did it go?

122
00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:20.275
All their alibis are perfect.

123
00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.575
At the time of the explosion,

124
00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:26.175
excluding us passengers, all the crew members,

125
00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:28.675
including the Captain were always working in a group.

126
00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:31.375
And since the explosion took place

127
00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:33.675
after we heard what sounded like a gunshot

128
00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:36.175
and ran up to the upper deck,

129
00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:38.375
it means the only person capable of starting the fire

130
00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.375
is someone who wasn't with us on the deck.

131
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.575
So it must be Saizo Kano,

132
00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:45.675
he's the only one we can't account for.

133
00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:48.275
No, there's one other person, isn't there?

134
00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:51.575
Well, Mr. Kameda, he went back to his cabin

135
00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:53.275
because he wasn't feeling well.

136
00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:56.075
No one's seen him since then.

137
00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:57.875
Now that you mentioned it...

138
00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:01.575
Hurry down to his cabin right now and bring him here!

139
00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:03.275
Yes, sir!

140
00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:05.175
Okay! I'm going with him!

141
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.675
-Me too! -Wait...

142
00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:10.375
Wait for me! I'm going with you!

143
00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:18.054
Yes, I understand.

144
00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:20.054
I'll see you there then.

145
00:07:20.054 --> 00:07:21.454
Yes, sir!

146
00:07:22.554 --> 00:07:24.554
Continue on to Ogasawara!

147
00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:26.554
Aren't we turning back, Captain?

148
00:07:26.554 --> 00:07:29.554
No, they're sending a helicopter out first thing in the morning.

149
00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:33.954
Our ship is loaded with cargo, they need on the island.

150
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.454
And as soon as they're ready,

151
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.454
the Coast Guard will also send their boat out.

152
00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:41.654
So those detectives will have to do their best until help arrives.

153
00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:44.854
Start engines! Raise speed up to 20 knots!

154
00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:47.854
-Start engines! -Start engines!

155
00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:52.354
Mr. Kameda.

156
00:07:53.454 --> 00:07:55.154
Mr. Kameda.

157
00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:58.454
Seems like he's not in. Hey! Go and borrow the master key again.

158
00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:01.054
What? It's not locked.

159
00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:04.854
Mr. Kameda, I'm coming in.

160
00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:08.754
What's this?

161
00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:12.354
It looks like no one's in.

162
00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:15.954
If so, we'd better hurry and report this to Mr. Samezaki.

163
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.954
Isn't that right, Heiji?

164
00:08:20.454 --> 00:08:23.454
Hey, where are you?

165
00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:26.454
Hattori? Conan?

166
00:09:05.354 --> 00:09:07.354
How'd it go? You find anything?

167
00:09:11.054 --> 00:09:13.454
Yes, in the engine room below.

168
00:09:13.454 --> 00:09:15.554
There was a little blood on the floor

169
00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.554
and I found empty shell casings

170
00:09:17.554 --> 00:09:20.554
and this strange letter.

171
00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:23.054
I found a suspicious piece of paper too.

172
00:09:23.054 --> 00:09:25.654
It was crushed up and thrown away though.

173
00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:26.654
Where'd you find it?

174
00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:28.854
You know the toilet at the entrance to the restaurant,

175
00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:30.854
it was in the trash can inside.

176
00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:32.954
Inside the toilet's trash can?

177
00:09:32.954 --> 00:09:37.154
And then? What does the letter say?

178
00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:41.054
"Waiting in the engine room. Masaru Furukawa."

179
00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:43.154
Masaru Furukawa again.

180
00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:46.354
Blood stains and an empty shell casing?

181
00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:53.454
There it is! One shot to the temple!

182
00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:56.354
There's no doubt about it, it's a gunshot wound!

183
00:09:56.354 --> 00:10:01.454
The victim came to the engine room because of this letter.

184
00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:05.154
And he was shot in the head, then put inside the box.

185
00:10:05.154 --> 00:10:08.554
Yes, I think that's reasonably correct.

186
00:10:10.154 --> 00:10:12.354
What about that piece of paper you found?

187
00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:15.554
It was probably written on the same word processor as yours.

188
00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:21.154
"Meet me at the stern, Masaru Furukawa."

189
00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:25.754
This is proof that someone lured that fellow Mr. Kujirai out!

190
00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:28.654
How do you know it was Mr. Kujirai?

191
00:10:28.654 --> 00:10:31.454
Two of the crew members saw him.

192
00:10:31.454 --> 00:10:34.054
It was past midnight, that guy looked scared

193
00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:37.554
and they heard he was yelling, "Hey, I'm here!".

194
00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:41.754
And when the crew called out to him, the fellow got shook up.

195
00:10:41.754 --> 00:10:44.754
Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.

196
00:10:44.754 --> 00:10:45.854
That's what he said.

197
00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:50.054
Then it seems he went back to the lounge where we all were.

198
00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:54.454
Those crew thought someone might show up there,

199
00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.154
so they kept watch but no one came.

200
00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:58.454
And just when they were about to return to their posts,

201
00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:02.054
they said they heard gunshots from the upper deck.

202
00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:04.254
And was that box burning?

203
00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:06.454
Of course not!

204
00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:10.354
And there didn't seem to be any timing device either.

205
00:11:10.354 --> 00:11:14.054
What this means is, the killer fired a shot on the upper deck,

206
00:11:14.054 --> 00:11:15.854
then set the flag on fire

207
00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:17.554
and when he saw everyone was on the upper deck,

208
00:11:17.554 --> 00:11:20.854
he snuck down here and set the box on fire.

209
00:11:22.154 --> 00:11:26.154
If that's true, then Mr. Kujirai's fear is understandable.

210
00:11:26.154 --> 00:11:28.254
Yes. After all, if he was unlucky,

211
00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:31.554
he'd have been killed and set on fire here too.

212
00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:34.454
One problem remains,

213
00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:37.454
is it possible for the killer to fire the shot on the upper deck,

214
00:11:37.454 --> 00:11:41.654
then come here without being seen by anyone?

215
00:11:41.654 --> 00:11:44.154
Well, I have an idea who the killer is,

216
00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:47.654
and in time, I'll be able to prove it.

217
00:11:47.654 --> 00:11:49.954
You've figured it out too?

218
00:11:49.954 --> 00:11:53.154
You mean you have too?

219
00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:56.054
Then shall we compare notes?

220
00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:05.554
First, the mysterious old man calling himself Saizo Kano.

221
00:12:05.554 --> 00:12:09.954
Like you said, he left the ship

222
00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:12.154
and no one noticed that he returned,

223
00:12:12.154 --> 00:12:15.854
but somehow he was on board, then.

224
00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:17.854
That's a trick set up by the killer.

225
00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:18.854
-A fake! -A fake!

226
00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:21.054
"Fake: To make it seem like. To pretend."

227
00:12:22.654 --> 00:12:25.554
There are only two people who could've done it.

228
00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:26.554
That's right!

229
00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:28.654
What we have to look at very carefully here is

230
00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:33.254
the heat stiffened body's elbows were in front of his face

231
00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:36.054
and the fact that his knees were completely bent!

232
00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:39.354
It proves both arms were raised

233
00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:42.954
when the body was put in the box and shifted!

234
00:12:42.954 --> 00:12:46.154
Only one person had a reason for doing that!

235
00:12:46.154 --> 00:12:48.454
But that too was a ruse!

236
00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:50.054
The real killer faked his death

237
00:12:50.054 --> 00:12:53.554
and is still hiding somewhere on this ship.

238
00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:56.554
What? What are you talking about?

239
00:12:56.554 --> 00:12:59.054
Look at this! This watch is the proof.

240
00:12:59.054 --> 00:13:00.754
What are you talking about?

241
00:13:00.754 --> 00:13:03.054
That's the killer's trump card.

242
00:13:05.754 --> 00:13:07.554
This is very interesting.

243
00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:11.854
How unusual. Our deductions aren't the same.

244
00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:16.354
Yes, this has only happened once when we first met.

245
00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:21.054
All right.

246
00:13:21.054 --> 00:13:23.954
Let's see whose deduction is correct.

247
00:13:23.954 --> 00:13:25.554
Shall we make a contest of this?

248
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:27.954
-Hey! Wait up! -Oh, yeah!

249
00:13:27.954 --> 00:13:29.354
Fix that watch, will you?

250
00:13:29.354 --> 00:13:30.554
What?

251
00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:33.854
Are you telling me to get this burnt up watch moving again?

252
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:38.054
Of course not! I mean put it back where it came from.

253
00:13:39.454 --> 00:13:41.054
I see.

254
00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:45.154
What? Kameda wasn't in his cabin?

255
00:13:45.154 --> 00:13:48.554
Yes, we looked for him for a while.

256
00:13:48.554 --> 00:13:52.254
You fool! I don't know so many people can just disappear!

257
00:13:52.254 --> 00:13:55.054
Out of my way! I'll look for him!

258
00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:02.754
I'm off to search for him too,

259
00:14:02.754 --> 00:14:04.554
so I'd like all of you to wait here for just a little longer...

260
00:14:04.554 --> 00:14:07.554
I refuse. You're a private detective

261
00:14:07.554 --> 00:14:10.954
and the other man is a former police officer, isn't that right?

262
00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:15.354
I don't think either of you have any right to keep us here.

263
00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.554
But...

264
00:14:17.554 --> 00:14:21.754
Sorry, but I'm going back to my room and rest.

265
00:14:21.754 --> 00:14:23.254
I'm going too.

266
00:14:23.254 --> 00:14:25.454
-Me too. -Wait!

267
00:14:25.454 --> 00:14:28.554
You could put yourselves danger if you act rashly!

268
00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:30.754
No need to worry.

269
00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:34.454
We can take care of ourselves.

270
00:14:34.454 --> 00:14:35.854
Right?

271
00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:46.554
It has to be here!

272
00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:49.354
If my deduction is right,

273
00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:54.054
there has to be a place someone can hide without being discovered.

274
00:14:58.354 --> 00:15:00.054
It can't be.

275
00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:02.854
A good hiding place?

276
00:15:02.854 --> 00:15:03.954
You have an idea don't you?

277
00:15:03.954 --> 00:15:06.854
Some place that you usually can't get into.

278
00:15:06.854 --> 00:15:09.854
Some place that's off limits!

279
00:15:09.854 --> 00:15:12.954
You little troublemaker. There's a a killer on board

280
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.154
and you go gallivanting!

281
00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:17.254
It was strange.

282
00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:19.554
Where's Hattori?

283
00:15:19.554 --> 00:15:20.854
You didn't run into him?

284
00:15:25.854 --> 00:15:27.454
It's wrong!

285
00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.854
Kudo and I were both wrong!

286
00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:35.154
Captain!

287
00:15:35.154 --> 00:15:38.054
The ship's route is clear for the next 30 kilometers!

288
00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:42.054
Okay! Raise speed up to 293 points, 30 knots!

289
00:15:42.054 --> 00:15:44.454
Speed to 30 knots!

290
00:15:48.954 --> 00:15:52.154
Who is it?

291
00:15:52.154 --> 00:15:54.454
Who is the real killer?

292
00:16:08.954 --> 00:16:12.454
Hey, didn't you hear a strange water noise?

293
00:16:12.454 --> 00:16:14.454
Strange water noise?

294
00:16:15.554 --> 00:16:17.554
A bonito probably jumped.
