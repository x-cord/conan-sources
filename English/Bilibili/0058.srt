1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,300
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,510
a pop-up doll,
and broken ceramic!

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,710
Mystery-solving logic is helpful
against people's dry hearts!

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,960
Heiji Hattori looks poised to discover
Conan's real identity today!

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,460
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,260
and there's no
outwitting his logic!

7
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:40,775
The old man, Ran, and I went
on a trip for Sherlock Holmes fans.

8
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:44,075
However, the car of Kanaya-san,

9
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:47,405
this trip's director and
owner of the Mycroft Lodge,

10
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:50,155
fell over a cliff and exploded!

11
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,545
Moreover, having been
isolated from the outside world,

12
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:03,615
we shut ourselves in the lodge
to prevent any further casualties,

13
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:06,385
but Ayako-san, who claimed
to know the identity of the killer,

14
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,525
died in an explosion in the garage!

15
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,025
Was the owner responsible?

16
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:16,235
Or was it one of the five other guests

17
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,405
excluding us three and Heiji Hattori?

18
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:23,075
Suddenly, Fujisawa-san was
attacked by someone with an ice pick!

19
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:33,565
The Holmes Freak Murder Case (Part 2).

20
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,385
Who would do such a thing?!

21
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:38,585
It was the owner.

22
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:42,525
He faked his death
during the first incident,

23
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,905
hid somewhere inside this lodge,

24
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:47,265
burned Ayako-san
to death in the garage,

25
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:50,485
then attacked Fujisawa-san
with an ice pick

26
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:53,225
and escaped out that window!

27
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:56,235
Damn it! Why would
the owner want to kill me?!

28
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,345
I even helped him
with the book he published!

29
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:01,025
Book?

30
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,235
A Holmes book he published
last year with his own money.

31
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,535
I believe the title was
"The Disparagement of Irene Adler."

32
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,445
Irene Adler?

33
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,405
Alright, Ran!
We're going after the owner!

34
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,205
Right!

35
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,045
Forget about it.
There's no point.

36
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,675
You'd never find the
killer by looking out there!

37
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:24,405
What do you know?!

38
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,615
Take a closer look at this chair.

39
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,885
See how it's unnaturally
placed at the narrow end?

40
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,615
It's proof that the
killer quickly pushed it under

41
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,075
after breaking the window.

42
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:36,735
He's right! There are
pieces of glass stuck in it!

43
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,065
The killer must have used this chair!

44
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:43,275
But that only proves
the killer used the chair to--

45
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,775
You idiot! Who would
bother putting a chair back

46
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,535
after smashing a
window to escape through it?

47
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:51,695
The killer probably
held the chair with bare hands

48
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,575
when they broke the window!

49
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:56,115
It was too dark to
remove the fingerprints,

50
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,525
so the killer put the
chair back under the table--

51
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:04,945
so we wouldn't notice and so
they could wipe the fingerprints off

52
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,255
when no one was looking.

53
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,775
After the lights came back on?

54
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:12,405
Wait, we were the
only ones in the room then...

55
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:13,475
That's right.

56
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:17,615
Now do you see
that the owner didn't do it,

57
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:20,935
and that the killer
is in this very room?!

58
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:27,735
Maid. You said a fuse had blown

59
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,245
when the lights went out, correct?

60
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:34,235
Yes! When I tried to
plug in the coffee maker,

61
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,575
it suddenly sparked!

62
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,585
It was this outlet!

63
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:42,545
There was a thin wire
wrapped around the plug

64
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:46,505
so that it would cause a
short if someone were to plug it in.

65
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:50,575
But where did
the killer get this wire?

66
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:51,725
I bet it was this!

67
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:55,685
The wire attached to
the top of this coffee pack!

68
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:00,275
The width and length
do match perfectly...

69
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,115
Who opened the packs?

70
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,605
Kawatsu-san and Togano-san...

71
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,695
Now it's clear.

72
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:12,285
You're the killer, Kawatsu-san!

73
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:15,405
Hold on, now!

74
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:18,415
There were three other people
in the kitchen besides me--

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,735
You moron!

76
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:25,005
All three of those people
have alibis for the first incident!

77
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:28,775
You most likely took a wire off
a pack when no one was looking,

78
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:32,275
wrapped it around the plug,
and then returned to the living room

79
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,885
to wait for the lights to go out!

80
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,235
Then, in the darkness,

81
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:39,775
you attacked Fujisawa-san
with an ice pick

82
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,065
that you carried in
here with some ice--

83
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,695
using the flame from
his lighter to find him!

84
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:48,775
However, some unexpected
obstacles caused you to fail.

85
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,075
Isn't that right?

86
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:56,025
Yeah, but something's not quite right.

87
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:56,745
Right, boy?

88
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,025
Yeah.

89
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,655
The third incident in which
Fujisawa-san was attacked

90
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,865
is different than the first two

91
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,215
in that the culprit plainly
left evidence behind.

92
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:11,575
Perhaps this third incident
wasn't part of the killer's plan?

93
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,145
Conan-kun...

94
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:18,435
But I'm just a kid,
so what would I know?

95
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:22,325
Don't pay any attention to him!

96
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:25,445
He just loves to play detective!

97
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,275
Come over here.

98
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:30,695
There's something really
strange about this kid!

99
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:35,155
He isn't playing detective!
He's really analyzing!

100
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:39,705
His voice and body are different,
but he's almost just like Kudo!

101
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,525
Kudo?!

102
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:45,775
Yeah! When Kudo showed
up during that previous incident,

103
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,835
that kid disappeared somewhere!

104
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:51,885
And then when Kudo disappeared,
he just popped up again...

105
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:56,145
Could he really be?!

106
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:03,225
But isn't it strange, Detective?

107
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:06,485
If Kawatsu-san really is the killer,

108
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:10,235
how did he set the garage on
fire during the second incident?

109
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,945
And during the first incident,

110
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:17,825
the owner's car sped up
before it went over the cliff!

111
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,205
That's right!

112
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,025
Yeah.

113
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,115
I've got almost all of
the second incident solved,

114
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,915
but the first incident
makes no sense...

115
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:28,945
Eh? You know how they set
the garage on fire?!

116
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:29,795
Well, yeah...

117
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:32,945
At any rate, what I don't
understand about the first incident

118
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,045
are the following four points.

119
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,885
Why we didn't see the
owner for almost an entire day...

120
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,345
Why the car suddenly sped up...

121
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:44,075
The odd sound coming
from inside the car

122
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,905
and the blanket on the dashboard...

123
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,985
And then one more mystery
appeared when we came here.

124
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:53,945
The owner was holding
the steering wheel tightly.

125
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,905
The car was on a bumpy road,
but his body never slumped.

126
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:01,525
That means by the time
he was placed in the car,

127
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:04,275
he was long dead
and rigor mortis had set in!

128
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,665
Rigor mortis?!

129
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:12,155
A body usually begins to stiffen
thirty minutes to two hours after death,

130
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:15,525
and nine to twelve hours later,
the body becomes completely stiff.

131
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:19,275
Thirty hours after that,
under the best circumstances,

132
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,865
the body loosens up again and
approximately seventy hours later

133
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,845
it's back to normal.

134
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:27,525
If we assume the
owner was completely stiff

135
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,195
when he was placed
in the car at 3:30 a.m.,

136
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,855
then he was killed between
3:30 and 5:30 p.m. the previous day.

137
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:38,075
In other words,
sometime before dinner,

138
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:40,485
but what I don't understand

139
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,905
is why they had to
put him in the car so early...

140
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:45,875
Maybe to make
it look like a suicide?

141
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:48,735
My guess is that they
killed the owner before dinner,

142
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:52,735
put him in the car, had him
sit with his hands on the wheel,

143
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,885
waited for him to stiffen,
then went to the garage after dinner

144
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,025
and sent the car on its way.

145
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:58,845
In other words,

146
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,405
the killer was one of
you who left after dinner!

147
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,275
Then why did the car speed up?

148
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,855
A dead person couldn't
possibly have done that...

149
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:10,565
A dead person?!

150
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,985
Could the killer's trick be--

151
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:17,365
If so, then only that
person could've done it,

152
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:18,945
but there's still no proof!

153
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,405
Wait a minute!

154
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:24,365
She did say that Ayako-san was
loitering in the hall in the afternoon...

155
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:29,375
If she had actually seen
something in that person's room...

156
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:33,165
That's it!

157
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,335
Now I see!

158
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,085
I know the killer's identity!

159
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:41,075
Yes, the killer is you!

160
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,715
Fortuneteller Maria Toda-san!

161
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:44,635
I beg your pardon?!

162
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:49,525
You must have used hypnosis
to make the owner drive the car!

163
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:50,435
Give me a break.

164
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:54,235
I can't wait to use
a sleeping dart on him...

165
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:58,235
But it's all over if he catches
me during my explanation.

166
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,905
Say! What would
happen to the rigor mortis

167
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:01,905
if the temperature went up?

168
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,495
Would it start sooner?

169
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:06,075
If so, then you
know who did it, huh?

170
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,785
I haven't the slightest idea.
I'm pretty dumb, you see.

171
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,615
Darn it!

172
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:17,025
He knows all right, he's just
trying to make me explain it!

173
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,715
Alright, in that case!

174
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,575
I'll just be going
to the bathroom now...

175
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,305
Oh. Then I will, too...

176
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,805
Huh? Where'd he go?

177
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,945
Will you get serious?!

178
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,685
I'm a fortuneteller, not a magician!

179
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:36,405
That's enough of this farce, old man.

180
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,195
What?

181
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:42,575
I just figured out
who the killer is, too!

182
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:43,905
You did?

183
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:45,485
That's right.

184
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:50,575
The person behind all three
incidents at this lodge... was you!

185
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,151
That's right.

186
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,791
The person behind all
three incidents at this lodge...

187
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:05,091
...was you!

188
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,551
Eh? Me?!

189
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,511
No!

190
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:12,471
The man in a cold sweat behind you...

191
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:15,191
...you, Togano-san!

192
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,271
Wait!

193
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:25,271
I was here in the living room
hours before the car even took off!

194
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:28,191
And when Ayako was killed,
I was with everyone else!

195
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,941
He's right, you moron!

196
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,071
Oh, man! I hope he didn't wake up!

197
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,941
Stop that, Dad!

198
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,411
Don't you mock me with
your fancy Kansai dialect!

199
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:45,381
And besides, you were with us
too when the car started moving!

200
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:49,151
How could Togano-san
possibly have started the car?!

201
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:52,801
You're right, it certainly
appears impossible.

202
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,811
But if he were to
utilize the rigor mortis

203
00:11:55,811 --> 00:12:00,271
and a certain function of the car,
it would become possible.

204
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,651
The trick goes like this.

205
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:05,311
The culprit killed the owner
almost exactly one day ago,

206
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:09,811
sat him in the car seat,
and stuck his foot on the brake.

207
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,021
Rigor mortis would
occur half a day later,

208
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,691
and the brakes would have
kept the car motionless

209
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,871
even if the engine
was running and in drive.

210
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:21,651
Before dinner last night,
the killer opened the garage

211
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:26,311
and then waited in the living room
for the foot on the brake to loosen up

212
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:27,841
and cause the
car to start moving...

213
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,651
You fool!

214
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,901
Rigor mortis doesn't go away

215
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,261
until at least forty hours after death!

216
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,061
You even said so yourself-

217
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,271
What if the outside
temperature increases?

218
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:44,271
If the temperature around the body
was about 95 degrees Fahrenheit,

219
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:47,401
the rigor mortis and rate of
loosening up would speed up,

220
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:51,191
so it would start to go away after
only twenty-four to thirty hours.

221
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:56,311
It was after 10:00 p.m. two nights
ago that the owner disappeared.

222
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,991
If he had been
killed shortly afterward...

223
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,981
The car started moving approximately
twenty-nine hours later

224
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,441
--before 3:30 this morning--

225
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,461
which was just
about the right time.

226
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:09,441
The hissing sound
we heard inside the car

227
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,631
wasn't the air conditioner--
it was the heater!

228
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,111
Had it been the AC,

229
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:16,051
water drops would have
fallen by the front tires.

230
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:20,811
So that's why you were
checking around the tire tracks?

231
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,651
That's right.

232
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:25,021
Naturally, there were
no water marks to be found.

233
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,811
But that trick would
be easy to see through

234
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,361
by checking the body...

235
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:33,941
That's why the killer sent
the owner over the cliff in the car!

236
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,071
To make the body unrecoverable

237
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,911
so we couldn't check
the state of rigor mortis!

238
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,611
So why did the car speed up?

239
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,481
That was probably because his
foot slipped off the brake pedal

240
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,481
as the car bumped around.

241
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,771
And the blanket on the dashboard

242
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:55,271
was there to conceal
the heater indicator

243
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:58,441
from people
who got near the car!

244
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,901
I see!

245
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:06,271
So by witnessing the car
with someone else in the room...

246
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,901
...they would
have an airtight alibi!

247
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:15,151
So the reason Togano-san kept
Ayako-san in the living room

248
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:19,111
was because he wanted someone
who would witness the car with him?

249
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,021
Precisely.

250
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:24,111
And the only person who
could have done such a thing

251
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,831
was Togano-san!

252
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,981
Interesting.

253
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:32,291
Your theory almost sounds
like it's straight out of a novel.

254
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:36,761
It's too bad you have
no evidence to prove it.

255
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:41,271
And as I've said before,
when the fire erupted in the garage,

256
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,981
I was in here with everyone else.

257
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:45,731
No matter how you look at it,
there's no way

258
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:49,941
I could have set the fire exactly
when Ayako happened to go in there.

259
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,191
No, but it would
still be easy enough...

260
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,441
All you had to do was tell her

261
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:59,481
that the first-edition Holmes book
was hidden beneath the back seat

262
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,031
of the car in the garage!

263
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:05,661
The first-edition book?
What's that have to do with anything?

264
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,441
Have you forgotten?

265
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,771
At that time, the car in the
garage was drained of its gasoline

266
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,881
and its battery removed!

267
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:15,061
She wanted to look for the book,
but with the car lights unusable

268
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:18,801
the back seat would
have been pitch black.

269
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,981
What would you have done?

270
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:24,761
If it were pitch dark, I'd have
to use a lighter or something...

271
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,721
That's it! A lighter!

272
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:31,391
Ayako-san used a
lighter to look for the book!

273
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:37,861
The flame ignited the gasoline
that had leaked from the car!

274
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:40,111
So she was the
one who started the fire?!

275
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:44,821
But she was an important
witness from the first incident!

276
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:49,151
There were four
other witnesses besides her!

277
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,941
There was no
need to keep her alive...

278
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:56,111
But aren't Ayako-san
and Togano-san lovers?

279
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:57,301
Why would he do that?

280
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,731
Because she figured
out his rigor mortis trick

281
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:03,981
and found evidence that
he was the one responsible!

282
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,221
You all remember.

283
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:09,311
Ayako-san declared
she knew who the killer was.

284
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:12,021
Hearing that,
Togano-san grew flustered

285
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,521
and pretended to
follow her to the bathroom.

286
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,521
He then told her
about the first-edition book

287
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,401
and lured her into
the trap in the garage!

288
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,361
Now that you mention it,

289
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:24,691
Togano-san was
the only one alone with her...

290
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,371
So that's why she changed her
attitude after leaving the bathroom!

291
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:32,831
But he certainly was clever
to come up with that garage trick...

292
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:38,501
No. That trap had been prepared
in advance for a certain person...

293
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,901
The killer lucked out because
Ayako-san had a lighter,

294
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,341
just as that other
person would have had!

295
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:51,311
Yes. The trap in the garage
was really meant to kill Fujisawa-san!

296
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:53,181
What?!

297
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:57,611
That card that
was stuck in your door...

298
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:02,571
The killer intended to lure
you into the garage and murder you!

299
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,811
But things didn't go according to plan

300
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,691
and the garage trap
wound up killing Ayako-san.

301
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:10,811
He quickly devised
a plan to cause a blackout

302
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,581
by fiddling with the outlet

303
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:15,041
and then attacked
Fujisawa-san with an ice pick!

304
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:18,731
I see. So that's why
there was so much evidence

305
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,501
after the third incident...

306
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,561
Togano-san was in
the kitchen at the time--

307
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:26,471
he could've very
easily fiddled with it!

308
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,981
In other words, the only person

309
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,311
who could've pulled
off all three incidents...

310
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,941
...was Togano-san!

311
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:37,651
Then show us your proof!

312
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:41,731
If you're going to make such accusations,
then surely you have proof?

313
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,521
Oh? You mean you didn't know?

314
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,811
Ayako-san saw a certain
something in your room

315
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:49,911
yesterday afternoon!

316
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:53,611
It doesn't matter what she saw!
She can't talk now--

317
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,911
Question ♪1.

318
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:57,691
"Which hand does
Holmes write with?"

319
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,811
Question ♪2.

320
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,401
"What is the name
of Dr. Watson's wife?"

321
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,841
What is this?!

322
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:06,311
Oh, my. Have you forgotten?

323
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:09,611
Didn't you take the Holmes Cult
Test of 1000 Questions too?

324
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,761
Question ♪241.

325
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:16,901
"What did Holmes' letter
written in the 'Dancing Men' code

326
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,231
say to the killer?"

327
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:22,021
Oh, I remember
that question very well...

328
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:25,441
The answer is,
"Come here at once!"

329
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,401
That question wasn't on the test...

330
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:32,561
There was only that one question
about "The Dancing Men"!

331
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:36,371
"Write down the entire 'Dancing
Men' code as it appeared!"

332
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,811
That's right.

333
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:41,361
That question was so hard it
would be impossible to forget.

334
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:45,091
Isn't it a little strange
that you don't remember it?

335
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,551
I was just-

336
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,311
The reason Ayako-san
went to your room

337
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,971
was to copy your test answers!

338
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:55,311
But you weren't in your room.

339
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:57,151
You had probably gone to the garage

340
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,941
to check the state of
the owner's rigor mortis!

341
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:02,651
So what Ayako-san saw was--

342
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:07,611
Yes. A completely blank test
with no answers written at all!

343
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,271
The reason he
didn't write anything down

344
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,331
was because
there would be no point.

345
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:15,981
In other words,

346
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,311
you knew that the owner
wouldn't be grading the tests

347
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,751
because he was no longer alive!

348
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,651
If you're going to claim
this is all nonsense,

349
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:27,111
then would you kindly
show us your test?

350
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,191
Right now!

351
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,651
D-Damn it!

352
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,531
Why, you...

353
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,931
Speak up! Why did you
want me and the owner dead?!

354
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,811
"The Disparagement of Irene Adler."

355
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:47,401
His motive was most likely
the book you helped the owner write.

356
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,191
What?!

357
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:54,651
Irene? The actress who outwitted
Holmes in one of the stories?

358
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,771
Yes. But the owner's
book was mostly about

359
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,661
Holmes' failure as a detective.

360
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,111
Now I see.

361
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:04,131
Togano-san felt that
the book insulted Holmes, so he--

362
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,021
Just the opposite.

363
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,811
Irene was the only
woman Sherlock admired.

364
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:15,051
I couldn't possibly see
such a woman ridiculing him.

365
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:20,401
I couldn't allow it...

366
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,771
I absolutely couldn't!

367
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,481
That was incredible, Hattori-kun!

368
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:36,241
Just what I'd expect from
the great western detective!

369
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:38,561
Uh oh!

370
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,111
But of course!

371
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,941
A case like this is
like a walk in the park for me!

372
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:48,111
Looks like I made it through
this without having my cover blown...

373
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:49,521
Conan-kun!

374
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:51,981
Conan-kun!

375
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,591
I'm right here, Ran!

376
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:56,221
Hey.

377
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,721
You're Kudo, aren't you?

378
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:03,681
What are you
talking about? I'm just a kid!

379
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,941
Your fake Kansai
dialect was pathetic!

380
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:11,401
Oh! So this is the gizmo
you used to imitate my voice!

381
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,361
I saw you using it
in the corner of my eye!

382
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,951
At what point?

383
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:19,411
"It would become possible."

384
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:22,111
You talk a little strangely,

385
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,271
but from your tone and the
way you set up your theories

386
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:26,021
you're definitely Shinichi Kudo!

387
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,731
What do you mean?
Look at me! I'm just a kid!

388
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:29,881
Fine, have it your way.

389
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:36,111
Hey, check this out!
You'll never guess!

390
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,511
The truth is--

391
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,361
Hold on!

392
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,231
So their drug shrunk you

393
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:11,941
and now you're living
with your girlfriend

394
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:15,481
to find out about
their organization?

395
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:19,241
She's not my girlfriend.
She's a pain in the ass.

396
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,371
You two sure
are getting along well!

397
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,811
Yeah!

398
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:29,831
Hey, wanna hear what
Kudo once said about you?

399
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,791
He said you're so annoying
he can't stand you!

400
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:35,771
Annoying?!

401
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,111
Jerk!

402
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:41,611
That's what you get
for putting me to sleep!

403
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:01,936
Next Conan's hint:

404
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:01,937
Next Conan's hint:
Traffic Mirror.

405
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,172
Traffic Mirror.
