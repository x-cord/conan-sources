1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,298
As times change, difficult
cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,300
Today's case is a manhunt!

3
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,302
Don't put out the flames of love!

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,555
He sees the truth
in people's hearts,

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,057
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,393
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,782
The Cactus Flower Murder Case.

8
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,378
My name is Okaya Noriko.

9
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:13,090
I was hoping you
could find the address

10
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,051
of a man named
Kitagawa Tsuyoshi-san.

11
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:20,306
Pardon my asking,
but how are you two related?

12
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,519
I met him in early June,
during a trip to Shinshu...

13
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:32,401
I didn't think much
of him at the time,

14
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:37,031
but lately I've
wanted to see him again.

15
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:43,245
Oh, I get it!
You've fallen in love with him!

16
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,206
Yes... Well...

17
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,834
That's so sweet!

18
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,463
Just a simple search.
No need for me here.

19
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,466
Here's some tea!

20
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,467
Thank you.

21
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,428
Why's she so nervous?

22
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:02,723
Do you have any clues or leads?

23
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,809
Yes. His license plate number

24
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:08,687
and a quick sketch of him.

25
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,774
Oh! He's quite
the unique individual!

26
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,694
Alright, just leave it to me.

27
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:18,155
This sketch...

28
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,449
Thank you for your help.

29
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,625
This'll be a cinch! I can
use his license plate number

30
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,544
to get his address from
the transportation office!

31
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,759
Are you sure she really likes him?

32
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,886
What're you trying to say?

33
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,014
They say that when
you draw someone's picture,

34
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:48,352
your feelings for
that person go into it.

35
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,104
Her drawing doesn't look very--

36
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,731
Enough of your lip!

37
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,068
Go do your homework
and mind your own business!

38
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,153
I'll be back.

39
00:03:58,153 --> 00:03:59,530
See you later!

40
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:03,492
Conan-kun. You shouldn't
get in the way of--

41
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,453
Okaya Noriko-san, lives at--

42
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,831
Stay out of his work!

43
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,415
Alright!

44
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,876
I already saw what I needed!

45
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,921
A handkerchief. Is it hers?

46
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,133
I'll be back later!

47
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,217
Conan-kun! Ugh!

48
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:32,062
Let's see. 3-9-8...
Sumire Lodge...

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,522
Bingo!

50
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:39,069
Thanks for bringing
me my handkerchief!

51
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,738
Conan-kun. Want some cocoa?

52
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,405
Sure!

53
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,073
Just a minute, then!

54
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,912
You have a nice apartment!

55
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,080
Thank you!

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,958
Say, what's your job?

57
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,752
Who, me?

58
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,088
I used to work
at a business firm,

59
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,173
but now I'm taking a break.

60
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,382
Eh? How come?

61
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:04,344
I got sick.
I'm recuperating now.

62
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,682
Kerosene?

63
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,518
That's strange.

64
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,812
I don't see any gas heaters...

65
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,941
A can of mace.

66
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,902
Huh? What's that picture?

67
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,906
It's dated May 19th...

68
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:29,536
Now, now. Is a girl's
apartment that rare for you?

69
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,331
How embarrassing...

70
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:36,168
This was my boyfriend,

71
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,253
until he dumped me a while ago...

72
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,508
So now I'm looking
for a new boyfriend.

73
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:47,805
That man in the sketch
sure seems different, though.

74
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:54,812
I'm thinking things might go smoother
with a different type of person!

75
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,233
That's enough about me.
Tell me about yourself.

76
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,859
I bet you have a girlfriend!

77
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,361
No...

78
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:09,243
I didn't learn much about her...

79
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,455
Oh, well. I guess I'll
wait around for the old man.

80
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,793
But will he really
find him that easily?

81
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,383
One Week Later

82
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,136
I haven't been
to the aquarium in forever!

83
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,347
Me neither! I hope
I can pet the dolphins!

84
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,851
Too bad about the weather.

85
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,811
It probably won't rain, though.

86
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,438
The old man's working again today.

87
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,487
This Kitagawa guy moved

88
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:49,491
without giving his new address
to the transportation office.

89
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,743
This is gonna take awhile...

90
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,956
I thought it was strange
she hired a detective

91
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:59,668
when she already had
his license plate number...

92
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,879
So that's what this really is...

93
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,261
It's Noriko-san!

94
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,264
But why does she look so sad?

95
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,018
Sorry! I just remembered
I hafta do something!

96
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,145
Wait, Conan!

97
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,354
Conan-kun!

98
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,735
Flowers and mourning clothes...

99
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,944
She's visiting a grave?

100
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:51,345
I wonder whose grave it is.
It still looks new.

101
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,513
Oh, Noriko-san.

102
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,015
Saeki-san.

103
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,020
Hard to believe it's been
six months already...

104
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,896
Yes...

105
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,689
How are you?

106
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,899
Much better.

107
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,360
Thank you for everything you did.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,030
No, all I did was help
with your rehabilitation.

109
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,282
You did all the hard work.

110
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:16,370
What do you say we
have coffee somewhere?

111
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:20,082
I'm sorry, I need to hurry home.

112
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,876
Oh. Then let me drive you.

113
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,005
That's okay. Thanks, though.

114
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,635
Noriko-san...

115
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:32,970
Hello!

116
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,098
Oh, hello.

117
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,766
Whose grave is that?

118
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,769
My friend's.

119
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:46,400
I figured it was that
lady's boyfriend's grave.

120
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:51,863
It is. He was both
my friend and her fiancé.

121
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,825
Her fiancé? When did he die?

122
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,786
Yamaguchi Family Grave
- Early June.

123
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,454
June?!

124
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,999
No doubt about it!
It was the guy in the picture!

125
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,544
This was my boyfriend,

126
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,963
until he dumped me a while ago...

127
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:11,883
Noriko-san lied
about being dumped

128
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:15,095
when her boyfriend
was actually dead...

129
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,304
Why?

130
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,849
Say, how did he die?

131
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,892
A car accident.

132
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:24,563
The two were driving
through scenic Shinshu

133
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,440
when they drove into a cliff.

134
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:33,071
Pardon my asking,
but how are you two related?

135
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:38,076
I met him in early June,
during a trip to Shinshu...

136
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,205
What does it mean?!

137
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:45,792
Did she meet him when her
fiancé caused the accident?!

138
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,462
Have you ever heard
the name Kitagawa Tsuyoshi?

139
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,088
Eh?

140
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,841
He drives a red sports car.

141
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,468
A red sports car?!

142
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,761
What is it?

143
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,471
No, nothing...

144
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,141
Tell me! It has
to do with that lady!

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,644
With Noriko-san?!
Who exactly are you?

146
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,606
I'm Conan Edogawa. A detective!

147
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,316
A detective?

148
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,363
What a surprise.

149
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:19,659
To think that the famous Detective
Mori would have an assistant like you.

150
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,830
It was the only
way to get you to talk.

151
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,708
So what are you investigating?

152
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,669
I can't give any details,
but could you start

153
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:33,632
by giving me the name
of Noriko-san's fiance?

154
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,260
His name was Yamaguchi Tatsuo.

155
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,554
He worked at the same
company as she did.

156
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:44,017
Earlier, you seemed surprised
when I mentioned a red sports car.

157
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,774
I heard her talking to
the police after the accident...

158
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,819
A red sports car?

159
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,573
Yes. There was a young
couple in it, chasing us.

160
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,200
We tried to lose them, but then--

161
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,496
We did find two sets of tire tracks,

162
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,123
but why would they do that?

163
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,500
They were just harassing us.

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,838
At first they kept honking
their horn from behind,

165
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,133
and when we let them go ahead

166
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,094
they swerved right in front of us.

167
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:22,097
Tatsuo-san tried to avoid them, but--

168
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,682
Noriko-san...

169
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,561
Alright. We're looking
into the incident,

170
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,064
but even if we do catch them,
they'll probably get off easy.

171
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:32,816
How come?!

172
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,362
Things might've been different
had you actually collided,

173
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,867
but as they are now, this would
be deemed Yamaguchi-san's fault.

174
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,035
He was speeding, after all.

175
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,833
Do you remember the car's
model or license plate number?

176
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,172
Okaya-san?

177
00:11:56,673 --> 00:12:02,262
Then she answered clearly with,
"I don't remember."

178
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,223
She said she didn't remember?!

179
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:08,810
Yeah. It was really hard on her.

180
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,272
She couldn't describe
the couple very well either,

181
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:18,195
and with no other leads, the police
investigation ended after only a month.

182
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,156
So those clues...

183
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:24,284
Yes. His license plate number

184
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:27,078
and a quick sketch of him.

185
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,248
Oh! He's quite
the unique individual!

186
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,878
Noriko-san remembered
his plate number and his face!

187
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,672
Does the fact that
she didn't tell the police

188
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,968
mean that she's going to
take matters into her own hands?!

189
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:57,608
Saeki-san! What was the rehabilitation
you and Noriko-san talked about?!

190
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:02,571
I was the doctor in
charge of her rehabilitation.

191
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:05,074
How did she seem at the time?

192
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,995
She worked extremely hard.

193
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,792
What normally takes half a year,
she did in three months.

194
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,461
It was amazing...

195
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,088
No doubt about it!

196
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:23,384
Her lust for revenge inspired
her to get better quickly!

197
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:27,388
Saeki-san! Let's go
see Noriko-san right now!

198
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,723
Come on! Hurry!

199
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:29,807
Conan-kun!

200
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:35,730
I have to somehow change
Noriko-san's feelings

201
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,899
before the old man
finds this Kitagawa guy!

202
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,027
But how--

203
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:41,861
Ouch!

204
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:46,991
Oh, sorry! That's
a Shakoba Cactus needle!

205
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:50,077
It must've gotten
there when I recently

206
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,455
took one to a friend's house.

207
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,084
A Shakoba Cactus?
Was it Yamaguchi-san's?!

208
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:03,049
He had raised cactuses
since he was a kid.

209
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,886
I took all of them
in after the accident,

210
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:10,765
but someone asked for one, so...

211
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,643
I'd like to share
them with Noriko-san,

212
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:18,981
but that would
only remind her of him...

213
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,734
So she doesn't know I have them.

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,031
Wait! Shakoba Cactuses are
also known as Christmas Cactuses!

215
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:28,199
What if--!

216
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,409
Say, is your house far from here?!

217
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:34,372
No, it's on the way
to Noriko-san's place.

218
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,165
Then let's stop by there first!

219
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,083
Eh?

220
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:41,796
Looks like she's not home yet.

221
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:42,963
Nope.

222
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:47,134
That's odd. There's no telling
when the old man will contact her,

223
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:49,595
so she should be at home!

224
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,431
Don't tell me he's
already found the address?!

225
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,894
Mori Detective Agency.

226
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,522
Oh, you're home?

227
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,358
Did you find out
the guy's address already?

228
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,194
Yep, sure did!
Wasn't easy, either!

229
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:07,905
I wore the
bottoms off of my shoes!

230
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,657
Who is it? Conan-kun?

231
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:13,160
I just got off
the phone with her.

232
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,537
Dammit!

233
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:18,374
But the guy's already
living with some chick,

234
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,751
so I guess she's out of luck--

235
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,170
Give me the address, too!

236
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,422
What for?!

237
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:28,134
Hurry, before that couple gets killed!

238
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,760
What?!

239
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,310
Damn!

240
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,235
Tatsuo-san!

241
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,125
Noriko-san probably went
to the transportation office

242
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,920
on her own to find
Kitagawa's address.

243
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,049
Unable to find his new address,
she hired the old man!

244
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:35,594
If she was that intent
on rehabilitation,

245
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:39,807
then there's probably no stopping
her from wanting vengeance!

246
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:45,479
How is she planning
to get revenge, anyway?!

247
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,816
Say, did Yamaguchi-san die instantly?

248
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:53,904
No. He was still alive
after he smashed into the cliff.

249
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,240
He burned to death.

250
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,199
Burned?!

251
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,871
The car's gasoline ignited
before he could be pulled out...

252
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:06,917
Aha! That wasn't
kerosene at all!

253
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,169
It was probably gasoline!

254
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,502
It's you!

255
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,297
It sounds like you remember me.

256
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,299
What do you want?!

257
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,468
That accident wasn't our fault!

258
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:01,430
I don't need your excuses;
you're both going to die now.

259
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,348
What?!

260
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,273
What was that for?!

261
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,860
You two are human scum!
Get ready to die!

262
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,155
You're going to suffer
exactly like my boyfriend did!

263
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:21,950
You're the crazy one!

264
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,872
Conan-kun!

265
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:28,874
The roof!

266
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,926
This is probably the
only way to calm her feelings!

267
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,733
Stop! What are you doin'?!

268
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,695
Stop right there!

269
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,907
Noriko-san!
Stop this foolishness!

270
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,410
Stay back! Please!

271
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,205
Doing this won't bring
Yamaguchi-san back!

272
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:12,167
I know that!
But this is all I can do!

273
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:17,131
Don't do it! Light it on fire
and you'll be injured too!

274
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,799
I don't care!

275
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,345
I have no future now
that Tatsuo-san is gone!

276
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:26,098
The least I can do
is make these people pay...

277
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,362
Whew, I'm pooped...

278
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:42,072
Conan-kun...

279
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,869
This Shakoba Cactus sure is pretty!

280
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,246
They bloom in the winter,
so in some countries

281
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,707
they're given as Christmas presents

282
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,293
and even referred to
as Christmas Cactuses!

283
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:06,430
Is that Tatsuo-san's
Shakoba Cactus?

284
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:12,269
Yes. I took in all of his
cactuses as mementos.

285
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,747
Noriko-san.

286
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:34,166
Yamaguchi-san may have died,

287
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,170
but he lives on in
each one of these flowers.

288
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,728
Tatsuo-san!

289
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:45,923
You should've come!
The aquarium was awesome!

290
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,717
All three of us fed the dolphins!

291
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,261
But Genta-kun slipped and fell!

292
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:57,809
The aquarium guy took
a picture at that exact moment!

293
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,186
See!

294
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,651
Wow! Looks like fun!

295
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:09,529
Boy, am I glad I didn't go!

296
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:19,331
Abe took out an insurance
policy on Negishi-san

297
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:22,793
worth 500 million yen!

298
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:29,049
And he had me
vouch for his alibi!

299
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:30,258
No way!

300
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,302
You?!

301
00:24:32,594 --> 00:24:36,890
I'll smash in that
rotten head of yours!

302
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,142
On the next Conan--

303
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:42,896
"The Akaoni Fire
Festival Murder Case."

304
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,372
Next Conan's Hint:

305
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:02,790
Left handed.
