00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.130

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.030
Find the question that solves the mystery!

7
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

8
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.850
The Detective Boys are everyone's idols!

9
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
What plot is hidden behind their smiles?

10
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.870
Always determining the one truth

11
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.770
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

12
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.210
his name is Detective Conan!

Come on. Everyone is waiting, Edogawa-sama.

17
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.721
Everyone?

18
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.361
Sakura-sama, Sumire-sama,

19
00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:04.021
Botan-sama, Azami-sama, and...

20
00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:05.481
Hey, Conan!

21
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:07.001
Conan-kun!

22
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.981
You're late.

23
00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:10.541

26
00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:19.561
D-Devoted fans?

27
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.781
It happened two weeks ago.

28
00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:27.951
We were on a luxurious sightseeing
bus tour of Beika City.

29
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:33.421
An acorn rolled down and down

30
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:38.301
and fell into a pond.

31
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:42.231
A loach swam up and...

32
00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:45.191
Oh, my!

33
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.951
These are delicious.

34
00:03:56.371 --> 00:04:00.151
Since then, the Detective
Boys have become Sakura-sama,

35
00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:04.951
Sumire-sama, Botan-sama
and Azami-sama's idols.

36
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:05.361
Genta
Mitsuhiko
Ayumi
Conan

37
00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:08.211
They even formed a fan club.

38
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:10.461
Now then.

39
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:14.511
Since all the members of the
Detective Boys are here...

40
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:15.221
Azami-sama.

41
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.311

Sakuma Sakura (78)

56
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:33.171
Imagine that the Detective Boys
are your own grandchildren

57
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:34.981
and show them to your rooms.

58
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.001
Actually, I'm not so sure about...

59
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:39.611
Edogawa-sama.

60
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.741
Think of them as your grandmothers, okay?

61
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.031
B-But...

62
00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:48.121
Ondo.

63
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:49.501
Ondo?

64
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.261
Shibuzura Ondo (30)
"Smile Village" Employee

65
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:09.001
Lay him down on that bed over there.

66
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.151
Thank you.

67
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:23.521
Anyway, this room is really luxurious.

68
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:27.291
I had it remodeled in a
Baroque architectural style.

69
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:29.291
I see.

70
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:35.211
It was my dream to sing
lullabies to my grandchildren.

71
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:37.741
Was it?

72
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:52.271
Hushabye, hushabye.

73
00:05:52.691 --> 00:06:02.701
My good baby, sleep.

74
00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:05.751
My good baby...

75
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:17.411
She put herself to sleep
with her own lullaby.

76
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:31.101
Um, where's the bathroom?

77
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:36.151
Gotta go, gotta go.

78
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.191
Gotta go.

79
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.591
You guys, too?

80
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:39.711
I was with Botan-obaasan.

81
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:12.491
It was my dream to peel fruit from
around the world for my grandchildren.

82
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:15.371
Say ah. Eat up.

83
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:21.711
Say ah.

84
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.721
Ah.

85
00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:29.181
Ah.

86
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:43.731
Excuse me for a moment.

87
00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.201
I was with Azami-obaasama.

88
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:15.721
This is my collection.

89
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:17.341
What?

90
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:39.621
I especially like these dentures
decorated with diamonds.

91
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:44.621
I'll show you some ventriloquism.

92
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:46.631
Ventriloquism?

93
00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:50.881
Please tell me your name.

94
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:58.531
Please tell me your name.

95
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:01.771
It's Ayumi.

96
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:07.371
My name is Azagami Azami.

97
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:09.451
Nice to meet you.

98
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:30.551
As soon as we entered
Sumire-baachan's room...

99
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:01.581
Ow!

100
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:03.221
My butt, my butt!

101
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:06.111
You pinched me!

102
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:08.401
What are you doing, Grandma?

103
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:14.971
Pain, pain, fly away.

104
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:20.191
Pain, pain, fly away.

105
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:31.011
Hey, w-w-wait.

106
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:39.741
Crap!

107
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:44.371
Are you okay?

108
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.381
Oh, no. Oh, no.

109
00:11:58.401 --> 00:12:03.391
So all the old women are insanely wealthy.

110
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:06.391
Indeed.

111
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:13.151
I guess we can let it slide
since they're our fans.

112
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:16.931
It's the married couple Chief
Director Hohoemi Waltz-san

113
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:19.811
and Administration Manager
Tango-san that creep me out.

114
00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:22.481
They're always smiling.

115
00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:26.781
Yeah, they've been smiling since we met.

116
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:35.921
All right.

117
00:12:49.441 --> 00:12:51.441
1 Million Yen Savings

118
00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.451
They're smiling.

119
00:13:05.431 --> 00:13:09.351
Maybe they have to smile because
they're the chief director

120
00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:11.951
and administration manager of Smile Village.

121
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.751
Isn't that what they call
a customer service smile?

122
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.591
Customer Service Smile
Isn't that what they call
a customer service smile?

123
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:18.561
They're right.

124
00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:34.521
Were those old hags...?

125
00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:39.031
Yes, those old hags.

126
00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.418
Smile Village

127
00:13:53.058 --> 00:13:57.728
I never imagined that those old hags

128
00:13:57.728 --> 00:14:00.178
would be scouted by another nursing home.

129
00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:05.658
Considering how much money they have,

130
00:14:05.658 --> 00:14:09.958
I understand why other nursing
homes would want them to move in.

131
00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:16.158
By letting them meet their
idols the Detective Boys,

132
00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:19.198
they'll stay at Smile Village.

133
00:14:19.668 --> 00:14:23.258
We should thank the Detective Boys.

134
00:14:23.258 --> 00:14:24.828
Indeed.

135
00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:28.088
They appreciate us.

136
00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:30.338
They used us.

137
00:14:30.788 --> 00:14:31.608
What?

138
00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:34.058
Waltz.

139
00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:36.088
What is it, Tango?

140
00:14:36.088 --> 00:14:41.968
We need to buy a high-class hotel in
Dubai before those old hags catch on.

141
00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:47.808
Using their money that we've been managing.

142
00:14:49.508 --> 00:14:54.318
This is the list of high-class
hotels Dubai we'll purchase.

143
00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:02.608
If those old hags learned we're planning
to buy a high-class hotel in Dubai,

144
00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:07.218
I'm sure their blood pressure would rise.

145
00:15:13.468 --> 00:15:15.298
What's Dubai?

146
00:15:15.408 --> 00:15:18.548
A world famous resort
city in the Middle East.

147
00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:20.118
Middle East?

148
00:15:20.118 --> 00:15:24.358
They said they're planning to buy a
hotel using the old women's money.

149
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:28.048
They're using their money
without their knowledge.

150
00:15:28.048 --> 00:15:29.438
Those poor old ladies.

151
00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:35.778
Tango, you decide which hotel we'll buy.

152
00:15:35.778 --> 00:15:38.558
Waltz, you decide.

153
00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:43.218
Darling, you're my husband.
You should decide.

154
00:15:43.218 --> 00:15:46.758
Oh, Waltz. You're my wife.

155
00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:48.718
You should decide.

156
00:15:48.718 --> 00:15:49.628
Tango.

157
00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:50.678
Waltz.

158
00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:51.578
Tango.

159
00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:52.668
Waltz.

160
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:57.048
They're dancing even though they're bad guys.

161
00:15:57.258 --> 00:15:59.428
It's not pretty at all.

162
00:15:59.898 --> 00:16:02.178
In fact, it's unsightly.

163
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.488
Waltz.

164
00:16:03.488 --> 00:16:04.178
Tango.

165
00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:05.438
Waltz.

166
00:16:05.438 --> 00:16:06.098
Tango.

167
00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.058
Waltz.

168
00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:08.478
Tango.

169
00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:13.188
I'm sick of taking care of
wealthy old Japanese people.

170
00:16:13.908 --> 00:16:18.228
So we'll use their money to buy
a high-class hotel in Dubai

171
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:23.208
and open a Smile Village there.

172
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.748
Smile Village Dubai.

173
00:16:26.978 --> 00:16:34.228
We'll care for the world's wealthy
old people and use their money

174
00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:38.468
to build a Smile Village in space.

175
00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:43.178
I'm thinking about making Cosmic
Smile Village Japanese style.

176
00:16:43.178 --> 00:16:45.308
Japanese style.

177
00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:46.428
And once we do,

178
00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:51.238
I'll devote my heart the Manyoshu and
wear a twelve-layered ceremonial kimono.

179
00:16:51.238 --> 00:16:54.678
Devote your heart to the Manyoshu.

180
00:16:58.908 --> 00:17:00.358
More importantly...

181
00:17:00.358 --> 00:17:02.068
What is it, Waltz?

182
00:17:02.628 --> 00:17:06.338
We need to make those old hags
sign an exclusive contract

183
00:17:06.338 --> 00:17:11.208
so they can't be scouted by
another nursing home again.

184
00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:14.588
You're right.

185
00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:19.488
Exclusive contract!

186
00:17:24.078 --> 00:17:25.138
Guys.

187
00:17:26.168 --> 00:17:28.768
The Detective Boys?

188
00:17:28.768 --> 00:17:30.848
Ondo!

189
00:17:33.348 --> 00:17:35.808
Chief Director's Office

190
00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.098
Let go of me!

191
00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:03.528
Let go of me! Hey!

192
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.018
Let go! Let go!

193
00:18:10.018 --> 00:18:11.818
Please let go!

194
00:18:11.818 --> 00:18:12.898
Let me go!

195
00:18:22.358 --> 00:18:25.358
Let us go!
Chief Director's Office

196
00:18:25.528 --> 00:18:28.118
Lock them in the basement.

197
00:18:33.398 --> 00:18:35.118
Let us go!

198
00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.018
What are you doing?

199
00:18:37.018 --> 00:18:39.448
Where are you taking us?

200
00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:42.538
Stop it! Stop!

201
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:44.258
Let us go!

202
00:18:46.228 --> 00:18:47.618
Ow!

203
00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:09.258
Hey, let us out! Let us out!

204
00:19:09.258 --> 00:19:14.198
Ow. I hurt my teeth biting
him as hard as I could.

205
00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.908
Guys.

206
00:19:15.908 --> 00:19:16.618
Conan?

207
00:19:16.618 --> 00:19:17.898
Conan-kun?

208
00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:20.948
They've installed multiple
solid locks on the door.

209
00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:23.168
Stand back. I'll break it open.

210
00:19:23.608 --> 00:19:24.648
All right.

211
00:19:38.728 --> 00:19:42.798
Please sign the contract.

212
00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:43.948
All right.

213
00:19:45.138 --> 00:19:48.278
By the way, where are the Detective Boys?

214
00:19:48.278 --> 00:19:51.528
How many times do we have to tell you?

215
00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:54.538
The Detective Boys left.

216
00:19:54.768 --> 00:19:57.688
Oh, that's right.

217
00:19:57.688 --> 00:19:59.578
Now sign the contract.

218
00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:00.888
Okay.

219
00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:04.548
Is there something else?

220
00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:06.628
We were just wondering...

221
00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:08.258
...what our idols...

222
00:20:08.258 --> 00:20:09.288
...the Detective Boys...

223
00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:11.548
...are doing right now.

224
00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:20.308
We told you, they decided to leave.

225
00:20:20.498 --> 00:20:24.338
You don't need to smile like
that when you're angry.

226
00:20:24.338 --> 00:20:26.188
We just need to sign, right?

227
00:20:26.188 --> 00:20:28.058
Just need to sign, right?

228
00:20:28.058 --> 00:20:30.198
Yes, please.

229
00:20:30.778 --> 00:20:34.938
No, you don't!

230
00:20:40.508 --> 00:20:44.338
The Detective Boys haven't left yet!

231
00:20:45.498 --> 00:20:49.338
It's our idols, the Detective Boys!

232
00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.848
Ondo!

233
00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:05.118
Ondo?

234
00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:10.058
Ondo-san says he likes
working at Smile Village.

235
00:21:10.058 --> 00:21:16.218
So he finds your plan to
use the old ladies' money

236
00:21:16.218 --> 00:21:21.118
you've been managing to buy a
high-class hotel in Dubai...

237
00:21:22.428 --> 00:21:24.328
Unforgivable.

238
00:21:30.838 --> 00:21:33.218
Ondo-sama!

239
00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:37.108
You're so wonderful!

240
00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:40.558
Ondo-sama! Ondo-sama!

241
00:21:44.918 --> 00:21:47.768
Ondo-sama! Ondo-sama!

242
00:23:18.178 --> 00:23:22.908
Everyone, we've almost arrived
at the butcher's storefront.

243
00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:28.668
The Detective Boys are eating croquettes.

244
00:23:46.278 --> 00:23:47.598
So cute!

245
00:23:47.598 --> 00:23:51.688
Chief Director Ondo-sama!
