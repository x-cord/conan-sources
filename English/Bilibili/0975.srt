Excuse me.

Your help is appreciated.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,490
Excuse me.

00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,080
Please.

9
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,000
Excuse me. I'm looking for my wi—

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,820
Tomomi...

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,250
Tomomi!

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,970
Excuse me.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,200
May I take a flyer?

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,970
Yes. Here you go.

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,780
Could I see one, too?

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,900
Here.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,260
Thank you.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,580
You know her, Ran-neechan?

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,420
Yeah.

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,590
She works at the florist in
the shopping center, right?

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,070
Th-That's right! That's her!

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,290
Have you seen her anywhere?

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,280
I don't know where she's been since she
came home from the florist three days ago.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,580
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,290
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

28
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,170
A strange mystery lies in the flyers

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,170
passed out by a desperate man standing
on a street corner searching for his wife!

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,790
Always determining the one truth

31
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,690
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

32
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,970
his name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:47,207
I see.

38
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:50,357
So this is one of those flyers.

39
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:51,527
Please!

40
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,957
Please find Tomomi—my wife!

41
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,687
Please!

42
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,767
He was desperately looking
for her in this rain.

43
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,347
At least do something for him.

44
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,857
Easier said than done.

45
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:07,647
It's only been three days
since she went missing, right?

46
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,727
Maybe she'll return if
you wait a little longer.

47
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,767
But...

48
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:14,317
People run away from home all the time.

49
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:17,547
Are you sure you didn't
do something to upset her?

50
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:21,247
Maybe you stood her up because you
got caught up playing mahjong.

51
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,467
Are you talking about yourself?

52
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:22,907
What?

53
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,617
No.

54
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:30,917
She's the one who didn't show up that day.

55
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:31,377
What? The Beika Center Building's
observation tower and restaurant?

56
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:34,797
Higuchi Tomomi (29)
Masaki's Wife
What? The Beika Center Building's
observation tower and restaurant?

57
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:34,917
What? The Beika Center Building's
observation tower and restaurant?

58
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:35,917
Yeah.

59
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:40,127
I'm surprised you got a reservation
at such a fancy restaurant.

60
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,297
Tomorrow is special.

61
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,927
I'm so happy!

62
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,057
It was our wedding anniversary.

63
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,697
I made a reservation at a restaurant.

64
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:56,667
She was genuinely excited since it wasn't
the type of restaurant we could normally visit.

65
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,067
So she couldn't have run away!

66
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:08,867
Besides, her phone and wallet
were left in the living room.

67
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,997
Have you told the police?

68
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:14,047
Of course I told them.

69
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,117
But they couldn't say for
certain if a crime took place.

70
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,377
I see.

71
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:23,287
I'm worried she was kidnapped
or got caught up in something.

72
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,887
I'm just so anxious.

73
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:27,557
Dad.

74
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:30,767
Very well. I'll take on your case.

75
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,267
Thank you!

76
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,267
Really, thank you!

77
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,497
I appreciate your help!

78
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:46,447
That husband looks like he's going
to break before his wife is found.

79
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,417
Try to find her soon.

80
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,287
I know.

81
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,297
That said,

82
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:58,477
all I can do is question her
workplace and neighbors.

83
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:04,647
Tomomi-san went missing
three days ago on Wednesday.

84
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:07,557
That's the day after the
photo on the flyer was taken.

85
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:11,307
She left her job at the florist at 2 PM.

86
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,357
Her date with Higuchi-san was at seven.

87
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,457
It was a weekday afternoon.

88
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,277
It'd be convenient if someone saw her.

89
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:20,567
Ow!

90
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,567
You followed me again, brat?

91
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:23,937
Why not?

92
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:28,577
I think people will be more relaxed and
willing to speak to you if I'm around.

93
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:35,887
Well, if you're going to beg, not even Mori
Kogoro is heartless enough to turn you away.

94
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:38,927
You can tag along, but don't get in my way.

95
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,797
I'm not begging.

96
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:42,247

00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,087

98
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,097
This is Higuchi-san's house.

99
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:50,267
Let's start by questioning
his next door neighbor.

100
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,027
Yeah.

101
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,407
Three days ago?

102
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,227
Yes.

103
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:59,287
I saw Tomomi-san return from work.

104
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,707
What time?

105
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,737
I think it was around 2:30.

106
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,737
Did you notice anything unusual then?

107
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:09,997
No. She was her usual self.

108
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:14,247
She seemed happy and said she'd be having
dinner at a restaurant that night.

109
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:19,377
Did you see any suspicious people
or vehicles around here that day?

110
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:24,877
I can't recall.

111
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:28,807
Recently I've been so forgetful.

112
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,887
I remember the distant past so well, though.

113
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,067
Does that mean you didn't hear
any suspicious sounds either?

114
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,387
No.

115
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:40,207
Besides, if that kind of sound were made in
a residential neighborhood like this one,

116
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,337
people would've made a fuss.

117
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,777
You're right.

118
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,227
I don't know.

119
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:49,277
I don't interact much with the
people who live around here.

120
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:57,037
Damn it!

121
00:07:57,037 --> 00:07:59,477
There isn't a single clue.

122
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:04,147
All we learned is that she was looking
forward to eating at the restaurant.

123
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,047
Yeah.

124
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,927
Let's try asking around behind
Higuchi-san's house next.

125
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,807
Higuchi-san's wife?

126
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:17,807
I didn't see her that day, but last
week I saw her by the Teimuzu River.

127
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,027
Last week?

128
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,317
How did she seem?

129
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:27,447
It seemed like she was arguing with
her husband, so I didn't speak to her.

130
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,827
Arguing with her husband?

131
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:30,697
Yeah.

132
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:37,397
She was saying ominous things like "let
me live tonight" and "kill me tomorrow."

133
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:42,457
I did hear shouting.

134
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,957
From Higuchi-san's house?

135
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:45,957
Yes.

136
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,867
They often argued at night.

137
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,967
It seems like those two didn't get along.

138
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,147
Did the wife run away or something?

139
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:59,847
Yes, I did see her fighting with her husband

140
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,097
on Sunday in the park next
to Higuchi-san's house.

141
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:06,147
How exactly were they fighting?

142
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:07,357
Well...

143
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,237
"Send me away!"

144
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,757
Hey! Go finish your homework.

145
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,047
Okay.

146
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:16,237
Uh, what was that?

147
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:20,497
I'm sorry. That's actually
what she was screaming.

148
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,997
Higuchi-san's wife shouted that at him.

149
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:27,457
Did something happen to Higuchi-san's family?

150
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,257
Please leave!

151
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:37,897
Who are you people?

152
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,027
That's Higuchi-san's voice.

153
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:39,637
Yeah.

154
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:41,847
You said you were the police,

155
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,447
so I thought you came to investigate
Tomomi's disappearance.

156
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,647
Is something the matter, Higuchi-san?

157
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:47,697
Mori-san!

158
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,027
What's all the fuss, Takagi?

159
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:54,457
We just received an anonymous tip.

160
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:59,907
This officer is saying I murdered Tomomi
and buried her body in the yard!

165
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:10,047
Just get it over with quickly.

166
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:12,417
Go ahead. Get started.

167
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,047
Yes, sir.

168
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,557
You won't find a body.

169
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,557
First of all, Tomomi isn't dead.

170
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:30,317
We found something,
Detective Takagi. A woman's body.

171
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:33,707
N-No!

172
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:35,827
Tomomi!

173
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:36,487
Don't!

174
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:40,997
I understand how you feel, but
please stay away from the body.

175
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:45,367
Tomomi...

176
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,527
Tomomi!

177
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:09,404
The victim is Higuchi Tomomi-san,
twenty-nine years old.

178
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,664
She's a housewife who lived in this house.

179
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:17,064
We believe the cause of death is blood
loss after being stabbed in the abdomen

180
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:20,434
with these pruning shears
buried along with the body.

181
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:25,914
That man over there is the victim's
husband Higuchi Masaki-san.

182
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,694
I see.

183
00:11:27,694 --> 00:11:30,174
And at Mori-san's recommendation,

184
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:33,414
we've had several of the neighbors
come to serve as witnesses.

185
00:11:35,234 --> 00:11:37,224
Higuchi-san, according to the tip,

186
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:41,674
you murdered your wife and
buried her in your yard.

187
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:43,224
There must be some mistake!

188
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,914
I would never murder Tomomi!

189
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,984
It's not possible!

190
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:52,404
You can tell us all about it at the station.

191
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:53,374
Takagi-kun.

192
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:54,114
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,344
Mori-san.

194
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,204
Mori-san...

195
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,084
What's this?

196
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:18,884
I don't believe it. "Look
for my wife?" Yeah, right.

197
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:20,764
Hey, Mori-kun!

198
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:24,114
According to your neighbors, you and
your wife had a terrible relationship.

199
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,524
They said you fought about
whether or not you'd kill her.

200
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:31,524
Wait a minute. We never fought.

201
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:34,774
And I thought you were innocent.

202
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:38,654
But over the course of making inquiries,
I became certain you did it.

203
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:45,284
Why? Why is this happening?

204
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,904
I was completely fooled by your act.

205
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,374
Takagi-kun.

206
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:52,554
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,504
Please stand up.

208
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,174
Hold it right there.

209
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,134
What is it, Mori-kun?

210
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,364
What? Who, me?

211
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:12,814
I've figured out the true culprit
who murdered Tomomi-san.

212
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:19,824
Hey, didn't you just say you were
fooled by Higuchi-san's acting?

213
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:24,774
Yes, but it wasn't me who
was fooled by his acting.

214
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:26,834
It's those people standing over there.

215
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,334
What?

216
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:34,834
These people are the neighbors who testified
that Higuchi-san argued with Tomomi-san.

217
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:39,094
All three of them clearly remembered
what they argued about.

218
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:44,224
I remembered because their
argument sounded so ominous.

219
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:50,144
After all, she was screaming "let me
live tonight" and "kill me tomorrow."

220
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:51,624
Me, too.

221
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:54,784
I heard her screaming "forgive me" and
"don't kill me" in the middle of the night.

222
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:58,904
When I heard them arguing, she
was screaming, "send me away."

223
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:00,654
That's...

224
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:01,804
Yes.

225
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:05,284
"Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight."

226
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:06,454
What?

227
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,034
Don't you recognize them?

228
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:13,044
They're lines spoken by Desdemona
in Shakespeare's "Othello."

229
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:15,434
What? "Othello"?

230
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:18,924
That's right. We weren't arguing.

231
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,404
We were rehearsing.

232
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:22,794
Conan.

233
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,174
Here.

234
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,014
Conan-kun?

235
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:28,514
Look. It's written here, too.

236
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:29,374
What?

237
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:31,624
You're right.

238
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,944
Tomomi-san was part of a community theater.

239
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:37,064
Y-Yes.

240
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:38,794
That day...

241
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,104
Hey, look.

242
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:47,324
What is it?

243
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:50,714
Something great happened today.

244
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:56,984
It was the first time she'd
been given a big role.

245
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,834
She was so excited.

246
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:03,854
So you went to the riverside
and park to rehearse together.

247
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,044
Yes.

248
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:07,844
We couldn't speak loudly at home.

249
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,424
You thought you'd bother the neighbors.

250
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:14,854
But doesn't that make
things a little strange?

251
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,524
Sakie-san's testimony, which claimed
she heard you rehearsing at night...

252
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,584
Tsutsumi Sakie (35)
Sakie-san's testimony, which claimed
she heard you rehearsing at night...

253
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:19,984
Tsutsumi Sakie (35)

254
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,014
You're right.

255
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:23,484
I-I...

256
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,554
I just made a mistake.

257
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,494
No, it wasn't a mistake.

258
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,874
You deliberately gave false testimony.

259
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:35,764
Why would I lie?

260
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:40,734
Because you're the true culprit
who murdered Tomomi-san

261
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,884
with the pruning shears.

262
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:43,754
What?

263
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,714
Wh-What are you talking about?

264
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,934
She just lives in the house behind mine.

265
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:56,144
I didn't have any motive to kill her.

266
00:15:56,144 --> 00:16:01,154
The flyers made by Higuchi-san
told me the answer to that.

267
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,054
These missing person flyers?

268
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:05,074
Yes.

269
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:10,144
This photo was taken the day
before Tomomi-san went missing.

270
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:14,994
Look closely at the picture. Notice anything?

271
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,754
Notice anything?

272
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:20,084
There doesn't seem to be anything unnatural.

273
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:25,134
Look at the fragrant olive
tree behind Tomomi-san.

274
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:29,594
See how the branches are currently
shorter than they are in the photo?

275
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,054
You're right.

276
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,814
Tomomi-san cut them

277
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,854
using the pruning shears
used as the murder weapon.

278
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:40,414
Come to think of it,

279
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:45,274
she said she wanted to cut them because
they cast a shadow on her kitchen garden.

280
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:50,254
But how is that a reason to murder Tomomi?

281
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,874
It's perfectly plausible.

282
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:57,874
Neighborhood disputes over whether or not
to cut branches can become quite serious.

283
00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:02,254
It's not unusual for them
to turn into lawsuits.

284
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,384
That's right,

285
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:09,514
but Tomomi-san cut the olive
branches without realizing that.

286
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:15,764
Sakie-san, you became furious and stabbed
Tomomi-san with those pruning shears.

287
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:19,444
Wait a minute! I cut those branches!

288
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,774
Huh?

289
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:25,564
But all the flowers in your yard are dead.

290
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,904
You're right.

291
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:30,424
Judging by the state of your yard,

292
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:35,534
it's hard to imagine that you
gardened on a regular basis.

293
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:38,554
That's right!

294
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,964
She's the one who cut the branches!

295
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,684
But so, what?

296
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:46,174
That doesn't prove that I killed her!

297
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:48,624
Y-Yes, but...

298
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:51,174
Mori-kun, is there proof?

299
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:52,834
Of course.

300
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,684
Furious at having your branches cut,

301
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:59,174
you didn't go to the trouble of
using the gate to enter the yard.

302
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:01,004
What are you saying?

303
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:07,034
In other words, you climbed
over that rose bush.

304
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:10,074
H-How do you know that?!

305
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:11,944
The scratches on your legs.

306
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,674
Did you not get those then?

307
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:23,264
When I looked at the bushes earlier, there
was just one area unnaturally devoid of roses.

308
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,834
That's how I knew.

309
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,964
Takagi-kun, doesn't the photo on
the flyer show roses in this spot?

310
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:32,494
Huh? Yes, there are roses there.

311
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:35,964
Huh? There's something that looks
like blood on these thorns.

312
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:37,224
What?

313
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,024
Go get the forensics team waiting outside!

314
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:40,774
Yes, sir!

315
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:46,104
If examined, I'm sure it
will match your blood.

316
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:53,114
Will you tell us why you climbed over
the bushes to enter another home's yard?

317
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,074
I-I...

318
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,074
Inspector Megure.

319
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:57,584
What is it?

320
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:04,834
There was blood other than
the victim's on the weapon.

321
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:09,114
It's almost certainly your blood.

322
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:13,884
You can wipe away fingerprints,
but the blood remains.

323
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,024
It's a shame.

324
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:23,144
Did she call in the anonymous tip, too?

325
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:27,924
Definitely. She wouldn't have been
exposed if she hadn't reported it.

326
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:34,634
She probably thought she could frame Higuchi
since we were questioning the neighborhood.

327
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:36,784
That's right.

328
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:40,914
I was going to frame you!

329
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:42,664
Why would you do that?

330
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:48,424
I was sick and tired you seeing you happily
fiddle with your garden day after day!

331
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:53,924
And ultimately, you even ended up
messing with another person's tree!

332
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:01,114
Hey, you!

333
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:02,054
Yes?

334
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:03,814
What are you doing?

335
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,654
Your branches are growing into our
yard, so I thought I would cut—

336
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,334
Don't touch my tree!

337
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,074
I-I'm sorry.

338
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,014
But the branches are crowding each other.

339
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,654
It would be better if you pruned them.

340
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,454
Don't you feel bad for the tree?

341
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,214
What did you say?

342
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:24,544
It's none of your business!

343
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,904
You're always looking down on me!

344
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,144
Who do you think you are?!

345
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:38,344
In any case, we'll hear what you have
to say once we return to the station.

346
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:40,974
Hold on.

347
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,204
That's...

348
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:46,854
That's why you killed Tomomi?

349
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:47,604
Crap!

350
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:50,394
Wait, Higuchi-san! Calm down!

351
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,194
Stop, Higuchi-san!

352
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:55,484
Think about it.

353
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:58,694
Doing that won't make your wife happy.

354
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:04,774
Tomomi...

355
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:09,624
Something great happened today.

356
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,714
I finally got a big role.

357
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:16,364
What are you doing?

358
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:20,224
I was planting herb seeds.

359
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,764
These herbs are supposed
to be good for your throat.

360
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:27,824
Tomomi...

361
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:30,354
Tomomi...

362
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:34,984
Tomomi...

363
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:37,924
Tomomi...

364
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:05,374
Your help is appreciated!

365
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:09,574
Please! I'm looking for my lost cat!

366
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:11,014
Excuse me.

367
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:12,494
Yes?

368
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:15,004
May I take a flyer?

369
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:17,184
Yes! Thank you.

370
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:18,794
Miss.

371
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,384
Dad.

372
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:25,104
Let the great Mori Kogoro find
your missing cat for you.

373
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,934
I promise I'll find him.

374
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,274
It's the great detective!

375
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:32,844
That's the Sleeping Kogoro!

376
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,604
Huh?

377
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,834
Find my dog, too!

378
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:36,534
Huh?

379
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:38,284
And my turtle!

380
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,154
What?

381
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,734
And my goldfish!

382
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:41,864
What?!

383
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,644
H-Hey, wait!

384
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:46,044
Why don't you find all of them?

385
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,984
Good luck, mister.

386
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:51,874
Is there a goldfish in the local fish-inity?
