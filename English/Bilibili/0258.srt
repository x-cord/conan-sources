1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,140
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,140
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,040
Today's case is a very strange kidnapping.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,940
Understanding English is very hard.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:28,453
Boy, what a terrific show!

9
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,453
The animals were so cute.

10
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:36,253
That white lion's act was especially good!

11
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:39,753
Well, that lion is the star of the show.

12
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:43,653
Look! That lion's also on this strap.

13
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:45,453
I really like that!

14
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,853
Cute, isn't it?

15
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,453
Before the show started,

16
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,653
Ai and I saw it at the souvenir shop

17
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,353
-so we both bought one, didn't we? -Yes.

18
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:57,853
Really? I didn't think you liked things like that.

19
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:00,453
Well, I think it's a whole lot healthier

20
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,753
than someone who reads bloody mysteries

21
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,753
day in and day out without fail.

22
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,953
Don't you think?

23
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,353
Just leave me alone.

24
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:14,453
Who's that guy surrounded by all those people?

25
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:16,753
Huh?

26
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:19,953
He's the man who sponsors the animal show,

27
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,053
that's Randy Hawk.

28
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,653
He's from Oklahoma, a southern state in the United States.

29
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,853
He struck it rich in oil

30
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:30,153
and he started collecting animals as a hobby,

31
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,753
but then his son Paul and daughter Annie

32
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,153
also became interested in animals

33
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:39,853
and now they take their animal show all over the world.

34
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,453
That's right! See.

35
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:46,453
His picture's on the last page of the pamphlet.

36
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:49,953
Recently, his hobby is travelling around the world with his show

37
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:53,253
and going to the zoo in each country.

38
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,553
According to him, he says,

39
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,453
"We've been cowboys for generations.

40
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,753
We protect it ourselves."

41
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:01,653
That's why he doesn't take bodyguards with him when he travels.

42
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,653
I heard him say it on television.

43
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:07,253
He speaks Japanese very well.

44
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,353
Mr. Hawk. Could we have a comment please?

45
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,153
Mr. Hawk...

46
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:17,653
You've made a mistake! My name isn't Hawk!

47
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,153
Come on, you can't fool us.

48
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:24,653
Is it true that you're donating half the proceeds of your show

49
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,053
to zoos all over the world?

50
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,853
No, I...

51
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,053
You haven't been to Japan in three years, how does it feel?

52
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:32,453
Please say something, Mr. Hawk.

53
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,453
Mr. Hawk...

54
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:35,653
Over here, Mr. Hawk!

55
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:40,753
I can't give answers to all your questions at the same time!

56
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:52,853
"The Man From Chicago (Part 1)"

57
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:57,453
Oh my.

58
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,053
He doesn't look anything like a tough cowboy now.

59
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,553
He's quite lucky.

60
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,853
I have to hide and look behind my shoulder all the time

61
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,953
because I can't afford a bodyguard.

62
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,853
He brought this upon himself.

63
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:14,253
Come on. Don't be like that. Let's go help him out.

64
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:18,053
That cowboy looks like he was raised in high society

65
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,553
and surrounded by a herd of cows, he doesn't know what to do.

66
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:27,353
Listen. I've been trying to tell you that I...

67
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:29,653
There you are, Uncle Thomas!

68
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:32,053
-Huh? -Uncle Thomas?

69
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,253
He's not Mr. Hawk?

70
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:38,853
No. He's a friend of my grandfather's.

71
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,753
He's an English teacher.

72
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,353
Yes, that's right.

73
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:47,053
Come on, let's go, Uncle Thomas.

74
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,753
You promised we were all going to have lunch at a restaurant.

75
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,653
Come on, hurry!

76
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:03,353
Thank you very much.

77
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:06,353
You kids were a big help!

78
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,953
I get mistaken for Mr. Hawk a lot

79
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:12,553
but I've never been in that kind of situation before.

80
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:16,353
Then you should disguise yourself when you go out.

81
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:19,953
That would just make things worse.

82
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:24,353
Do you like Paul and Annie's animal show that much?

83
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:28,053
Yes! Their show is the best!

84
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:29,453
And besides...

85
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,653
I wanted this so badly.

86
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,953
That's why I came all the way to Japan.

87
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:39,653
Oh, we bought that one too!

88
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:44,953
But that strap's popular around the world, it's sold everywhere.

89
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:47,553
You didn't have to come to Japan for it.

90
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:51,153
No, no. Look at the back of the strap.

91
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,253
It says "In Japan", doesn't it?

92
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,853
This is the only place you can get it.

93
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:02,153
I see. So it's a collector's item.

94
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:07,153
However, that incident back there was very, very unfortunate.

95
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,453
I didn't get to meet my friend.

96
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,953
We were supposed to meet after the show.

97
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:14,953
Did you happen to see a man with long hair?

98
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:19,453
I don't think so. After all, that place was packed.

99
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:22,353
And you're very astute.

100
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,353
How did you know he wasn't Mr. Hawk?

101
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,953
It's the way he talked.

102
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:28,753
The way he talked?

103
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:29,953
What?

104
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:31,253
Mister, back there

105
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:36,453
you pronounced the word "can't" as "count", didn't you?

106
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:39,153
That's the Queen English.

107
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,053
If you came from a long line of cowboys,

108
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,953
then there's no way a man from the South

109
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:45,653
would have an English accent.

110
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,953
It just seemed unnatural.

111
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:52,153
Now that you mention it, the Mr. Hawk I saw on TV

112
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:55,753
had a strong Southern draw and spoke rather loudly.

113
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:59,453
I looked at the picture in the pamphlet very carefully

114
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:01,453
and saw it was completely different.

115
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,853
But then, I don't blame the Japanese reporters

116
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,653
for making that mistake.

117
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:09,653
Like Westerners can't tell one Oriental from the other,

118
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:13,953
we Orientals can't tell one Westerner from another

119
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:15,753
if they have the same hair and skin coloring.

120
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,053
How perceptive of you!

121
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,653
My name is James Black.

122
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,053
What's yours?

123
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,753
Conan Edogawa.

124
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:28,653
I'm a private investigator.

125
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,053
Conan Edogawa?

126
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:32,553
Private investigator?

127
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:35,053
Conan's not the only one.

128
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,853
We all belong to the same group.

129
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:38,953
That's right.

130
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,153
See!

131
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:44,653
Sherlock Holmes!

132
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:48,653
Then you kids must be the Baker Street Irregulars.

133
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,253
Baker Street...

134
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,153
Holmes used some kids who lived on Baker Street

135
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,253
to gather information for him, that's what they were called.

136
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,853
I see.

137
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:05,453
I was born on Baker Street.

138
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:06,553
I know!

139
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:08,653
Let's have a celebration in honor of my meeting up

140
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,653
with the Baker Street Irregulars.

141
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:14,953
I'll treat you to a superb lunch at a great restaurant I know.

142
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,453
Did you come by car?

143
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:22,153
Yes. But there's so many people,

144
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:24,053
I don't think there's room for you.

145
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:28,653
No problem! We'll use the van I rented.

146
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,153
I'll bring it around. Please wait here.

147
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:39,253
But unlike lunch, my driving isn't very good.

148
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,253
You'll have to drive!

149
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,053
Huh?

150
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:46,953
Driving cars with the handles on the right is most difficult.

151
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:50,553
Mister. What do you mean you can't drive right handed cars?

152
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,553
Does that mean you're not living in England now?

153
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,153
Oh, yes.

154
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:59,553
I was born in London,

155
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,553
but I was raised in Chicago.

156
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:06,253
The windy city where Al Capone stormed.

157
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:10,353
Hey.

158
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:12,453
Don't you feel something about that guy?

159
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,353
Huh?

160
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:15,453
No, not really.

161
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:18,453
I see. I guess it's all right then.

162
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,753
Excuse me, sir.

163
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,553
We're with the police.

164
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:47,153
Is this your car?

165
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,853
Yes.

166
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:51,453
This is the car I'm renting.

167
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:55,353
I see. Actually, this is a stolen vehicle.

168
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:57,453
Oh, no!

169
00:12:57,453 --> 00:13:01,453
It was reported stolen a week ago.

170
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,353
Could you tell us where you rented it and give us the details?

171
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:06,153
We'd also like your name

172
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,753
and the name of the hotel you're staying at.

173
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,653
Rather than stand here in the middle of the street,

174
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:15,053
why don't we go to the police car on the other side of the alley?

175
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,853
Do you mind?

176
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:21,653
We won't take up too much of your time.

177
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:27,053
What's the matter?

178
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,153
Please get in.

179
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:37,953
I just remembered I have friends waiting for me.

180
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,953
May I go and tell them I'll be late?

181
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,153
Get in.

182
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,253
What?

183
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,453
Shut up and get in the car!

184
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:03,253
-What is it? -The guy dropped something.

185
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:11,053
It's just a strap.

186
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,853
-Okay! Let's get going. -All right.

187
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,253
Ouch!

188
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:27,253
Look what you did. I cut my finger.

189
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,353
Good grief. What a bother.

190
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:32,653
You men...

191
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,553
You're not really police officers, are you?

192
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:36,653
Be quiet!

193
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,653
You're just a cowboy wannabe that come into a lot of money.

194
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:42,553
No, you're wrong! I... I'm not...

195
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:46,653
You made your money by whipping poor defenseless animals.

196
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,553
We just want you to share it with us.

197
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,061
That's strange.

198
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,761
40 minutes have gone by already.

199
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,561
He's so late.

200
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,561
I wonder what he's doing.

201
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,161
I'm so hungry.

202
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,061
Come on, Dr. Agasa can wait here,

203
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:17,561
the rest of us will go check on him.

204
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,961
Good idea.

205
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:23,461
There aren't that many parking lots around here in walking distance.

206
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,061
Ai, come with us!

207
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,461
Okay.

208
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,761
I wonder if this is the place.

209
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:36,261
Mr. Black...

210
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,461
Hey, are you in here?

211
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:41,061
Oh? We're not looking for cats.

212
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:43,161
Mr. Black!

213
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,561
I found it! I'm sure this is it!

214
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,561
This is his car.

215
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:54,861
See? There's a stuffed lion by the driver's seat.

216
00:15:56,961 --> 00:16:00,561
But there's nobody inside.

217
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,261
The door was left open.

218
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,861
The key are still inside.

219
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,561
Hey, you guys! Are you looking for somebody?

220
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,261
If it's the foreigner with the beard,

221
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,061
he was going to get inside the car

222
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,661
but went that way with two guys wearing coats!

223
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:15,861
Huh?

224
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,361
Hey, Conan!

225
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:36,161
-Conan! -What's the matter?

226
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,361
Hey! Did you find him?

227
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,861
Conan?

228
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,161
It's a lion strap, isn't it?

229
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:44,961
I wonder if it's Mr. Black's.

230
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:49,261
If it is, this is where he probably got into another car.

231
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:55,861
He did say he was supposed to meet a friend, didn't he?

232
00:16:55,861 --> 00:17:00,561
Hey, do you think that guy forgot all about us

233
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,161
and went to go eat with his friend?

234
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,561
What? I don't believe it.

235
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,661
No, I don't think he forgot.

236
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,161
Huh?

237
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:14,861
Most likely... He got himself mixed up in something.

238
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,961
See! Look at this strap.

239
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,461
The P and A have been smeared with blood.

240
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:34,761
Maybe he was trying to leave us a message

241
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,861
because he thought we might come to look for him.

242
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,561
Don't you think so?

243
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,661
What?

244
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:42,061
That's terrible!

245
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,761
-We've got to call police! -She's right!

246
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:48,161
But, why?

247
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:51,661
I don't get it. Why the P and A?

248
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,461
It was so easy!

249
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:01,261
Now all we've got to do is

250
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,561
to see how much this moneybag's son and daughter

251
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,261
will dish out for him.

252
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:08,361
I'm thinking 5 million at least.

253
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:12,061
After all, this guy has so much money to spare

254
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:14,361
he gives it away to all kinds of zoos.

255
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,961
Well, we can thank you

256
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:21,961
for fixing this car up to look like a real cop car.

257
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:28,961
Mr. Hawk here, who thinks he's some tough cowboy

258
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:32,961
and wonders around without a bodyguard to protect him...

259
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,661
No! You've made a mistake! I'm not Hawk!

260
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,461
My name's James Black! You've got the wrong man!

261
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:41,961
James?

262
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:46,361
First a cowboy, now you're an English secret agent?

263
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,361
No, no!

264
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,861
You mean James Bond!

265
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:55,561
Never mind. That's not important.

266
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,661
I just want you to keep your mouth shut

267
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,261
until we get to our hideout.

268
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,361
Mr. 007.

269
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:15,061
Just you watch...

270
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,761
how we snatch the ransom.

271
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:21,661
Our plan's beautiful.

272
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:27,961
No, I don't want to see...

273
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:34,661
how you play out your plan.

274
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:45,661
-What? -Pay attention!

275
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:48,061
I've been trying to explain!

276
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,661
He's a foreigner and he has glasses and beard.

277
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,261
He's teen involved in some accident or something!

278
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:57,761
He might have been kidnapped or something.

279
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,461
But boys,

280
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:05,761
you didn't actually see him being kidnapped, did you?

281
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,761
Besides, there are a lot of foreigners with beards and glasses.

282
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,461
We wouldn't know where to begin.

283
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,261
It would be easier if you had a picture or something.

284
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,861
I've got a picture!

285
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,861
If you need a picture! Here!

286
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,461
This is how he looks.

287
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,361
This is Randy Hawk.

288
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:27,261
If this is the guy, he's safe.

289
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:30,361
I just heard him talking on the radio.

290
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,861
No, you don't understand!

291
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:35,861
James Black looks just like Randy Hawk.

292
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,361
Huh?

293
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,161
Listen. Was that radio program a live broadcast?

294
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:44,961
Yes, that's right. I think he's still on.

295
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,761
Yes, more than likely.

296
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,561
That's not good.

297
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:54,161
if the men kidnapped Mr. Black thinking he was Randy Hawk,

298
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:57,261
they'd probably listen to the radio program

299
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:59,061
he was supposed to be on, wouldn't they?

300
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:02,361
Oh, no! Then they're bound to find out the truth.

301
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,661
Yes, after they find out they've got the wrong man,

302
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:10,561
they'll probably kill him.

303
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,861
Hey! What is this?

304
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:16,161
And I'd like all of you to continue supporting Paul and Annie.

305
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,661
and of course, me, Randy Hawk.

306
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:23,861
Why Randy Hawk on a live radio show?

307
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:28,061
Then, who the heck are you?

308
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:30,361
That's what I've been trying to tell you

309
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,561
you've got the wrong person!

310
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,461
Gosh! Now what!

311
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,761
Hey! What're we going to do?

312
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:40,861
The guy's seen our faces!

313
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,561
All we gotta do is kill him! That's all!

314
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:48,061
Don't do it!

315
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:50,161
What do you intend to do, drive all over town

316
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,461
with a bloody corpse in the car?

317
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:57,261
We'll blow his brains out like we planned

318
00:21:57,261 --> 00:22:00,461
when we got to the mountains in Gunma.

319
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,461
And after his grave's been dug,

320
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:06,961
we'll figure out another plan. Okay?

321
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,561
No big deal. We'll just do like we planned.

322
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,861
We won't get caught.

323
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:19,261
The cops have no idea who we are.

324
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:22,161
And besides, they wouldn't have a clue

325
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:27,261
as to why some foreigner would get kidnapped.

326
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,561
"Next Episode" -Listen.

327
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,161
Doesn't something strike you as odd?

328
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:10,561
What're you trying to say?

329
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,961
I feel something.

330
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,561
Like something's calling me.

331
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:17,061
I hate to ask, but could you let us through?

332
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,261
We've got to get this guy

333
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,961
on scene investigation done by sundown.

334
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,961
Nice going, Ayumi!

335
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,561
I've figured it out.

336
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,361
I know where Mr. Black is.

337
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:35,161
Next Conan, "The Man From Chicago (Part 2)"

338
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:37,879
Next Conan's Hint:

339
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,079
"P and A"

340
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,479
Next Conan is the man from Chicago, part two.

341
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,079
Part two, eh?
