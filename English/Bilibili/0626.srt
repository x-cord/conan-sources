1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.240
Pops Kogoro was invited over to the

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.440
university festival of his alma mater, Beika University.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.040
Ran, Sonoko and I who accompanied him there

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.640
were called over by Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei, a movie art major,

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.740
and taken to the haunted "Screaming Hospital"

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.440
that he was managing.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.740
He asks Ran and the others who have encountered numerous cases

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640
to check out how good the zombies look.

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.540
Anna Tadami in particular,

10
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.140
seemed to be very confident in the zombie

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.340
she was performing.

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.740
However, Anna ended up showing us,

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.940
how it actually looked to be dead.

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.440
She suddenly had a convulsion before our eyes and died.

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.540
She died of potassium cyanide poisoning,

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.740
and it was thought at first that she drank it herself

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.340
and committed suicide,

18
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.040
but, I'm not being deceived!

19
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.840
This is homicide made to look like suicide!

20
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.440
Moreover, it turns out that this case

21
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.340
has something to do with the death of their friend,

22
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.140
Mr. Hashiguchi who killed himself and died a month ago.

23
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.440
Who on earth was it that poisoned Anna in the dark?

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.940
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.140
You must be true to yourself.

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
There's a ghostly phenomenon at the school festival?

27
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.140
Solve the mystery of the moving corpse.

28
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

29
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

30
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

31
00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:11.415
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 2)"

32
00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.515
It's from that time on, wasn't it? That Anna changed.

33
00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:18.715
Yeah. She suddenly started saying that it was a tribute to Hashiguchi

34
00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:20.215
and began making the graduation project movie,

35
00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:22.715
and started getting carried away with this haunted room too.

36
00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.215
But, isn't it natural to want to try hard

37
00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:27.315
for a friend who has crossed over?

38
00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:30.315
But, she was way out of line!

39
00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:33.015
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

40
00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:35.015
and was taken to the hospital too.

41
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.615
Her reason for doing so, was that she wanted to experience

42
00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.315
how it felt to be in between life and death

43
00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:41.415
and use it as reference as to how to look really dead.

44
00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.615
-Right? -Yeah.

45
00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:45.715
One day I thought she was being quite reticent

46
00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:48.915
and found out that she had nails in her mouth the whole day.

47
00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:50.715
Nails?

48
00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:53.115
Maybe Anna

49
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.515
had the capsule with the poison inside it in her mouth.

50
00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.915
Right! It's the same as the nails!

51
00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:01.715
Then, she may have accidentally bitten it and...

52
00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:04.015
Therefore, before getting to experience how it felt to be

53
00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:05.415
in between life and death,

54
00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:07.915
she ended up really dying.

55
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:11.815
So, did she actually commit suicide after all then?

56
00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:14.815
I wonder if it's really so?

57
00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:19.015
Conan?

58
00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:23.415
Because look at the cheek of this woman!

59
00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:27.115
There's what looks to be a real scratch, not make-up.

60
00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:29.915
It even looks as if the blood had smeared!

61
00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.915
Maybe somebody tried to cover her mouth by force

62
00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.315
so she in an attempt to pull free mistakenly scratched herself

63
00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:37.815
with her own nails?

64
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.715
What?

65
00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:43.915
Inspector! There are traces of skin and blood between her nails.

66
00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:46.715
What?

67
00:04:46.715 --> 00:04:49.015
In other words, someone tried to shove the poisoned capsule

68
00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:50.615
into her mouth

69
00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:52.915
and covered her mouth and nose

70
00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:55.215
until she swallowed it?

71
00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.315
But, if so, she would've already been dead

72
00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:00.815
by the time Ran and the others got here.

73
00:05:00.815 --> 00:05:03.315
She was really kicking her legs up and down

74
00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.815
and struggling, right?

75
00:05:04.815 --> 00:05:06.615
Yes.

76
00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:09.615
I see, so that's what happened!

77
00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:10.815
Sonoko?

78
00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:14.315
The culprit came before we did, made Anna drink the poison

79
00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:17.915
and killed her, then hid under the bed!

80
00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:21.315
He shook the bed himself, kicked his legs up and down,

81
00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:23.315
then flipped the sheet that was on her over

82
00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:25.415
to show Anna's leg.

83
00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:27.315
Then he slipped out of bed,

84
00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:31.515
and made it look as if Anna was still alive!

85
00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:34.715
In other words, the only one who could've done it

86
00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:37.315
would've been you, Mutusmi, right?

87
00:05:37.315 --> 00:05:39.615
What? Me?

88
00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:42.115
Being as small as you are,

89
00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.215
you could slip out of the bed without anyone noticing.

90
00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:47.715
Besides, you're the only one here who's...

91
00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:50.015
wearing sandals!

92
00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.515
You would be able to wear sandals right away

93
00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:53.515
even if you came out of the bed, right?

94
00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:54.915
You know what?

95
00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:56.915
Her legs weren't visible anyway,

96
00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:59.415
so she wouldn't have had to take off her shoes, right?

97
00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:02.215
Then, the next person that's small is you, so you're the culprit!

98
00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:04.215
You seem to be much faster than Mutsumi, besides.

99
00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:08.115
Idiot! I've got a sprained ankle, you know!

100
00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:10.215
I can somehow manage to walk normally

101
00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:12.015
but I wouldn't be able to kick my legs up and down

102
00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:14.415
because it would be too painful.

103
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:17.215
See, look! I've got compress on it

104
00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.415
and it's held in place with a bandage, isn't it?

105
00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:23.415
Then, it's you who's been fidgeting for a while now!

106
00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:24.715
You're probably not comfortable

107
00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:26.515
because of feelings of guilt, right?

108
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:29.815
I'm fidgeting with my foot because my athlete's foot itches.

109
00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:33.815
Hey, your shoe is bright red?

110
00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:36.015
Well, I was trying to relieve the itch

111
00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:38.815
by holding my foot down with the other foot but...

112
00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.315
That's blood paint.

113
00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:42.715
You must've stepped on it somewhere.

114
00:06:42.715 --> 00:06:46.115
Then, maybe it's when you shook the bed a while ago?

115
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:48.515
Because the blood paint burst out

116
00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:51.915
would accumulate under the upper right leg of the bed.

117
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:55.615
At any rate, anyone of you three,

118
00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.315
after poisoning her, sneak under the bed,

119
00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:00.915
and make it look as if she were alive

120
00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:05.415
then appear again as if nothing had happened.

121
00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:07.015
Oh my.

122
00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:09.215
We couldn't have.

123
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:12.015
As you can see,

124
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.315
mannequins of a doctor standing are on both sides of the bed.

125
00:07:15.315 --> 00:07:17.615
So, even if you try to sneak out from the side of the bed,

126
00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:18.615
you would bump into the mannequins

127
00:07:18.615 --> 00:07:20.315
and give yourself away on the spot.

128
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.015
If you tried to get away from the place

129
00:07:22.015 --> 00:07:23.315
where there are no obstacles,

130
00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:24.315
you would be in full view of these girls

131
00:07:24.315 --> 00:07:25.915
that were standing at the head of the bed.

132
00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:27.215
Besides!

133
00:07:27.215 --> 00:07:29.215
This bed is handmade so...

134
00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:31.615
two adults could never get on it.

135
00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.715
Handmade?

136
00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:36.415
Yeah, because Anna said that it would creak

137
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:40.115
when she struggled and give more impact that way.

138
00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:42.315
Since it's so uncomfortable,

139
00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:46.215
others who had to play the role didn't care for it, though.

140
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:50.815
Maybe Anna scratched herself on her cheek too.

141
00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:55.015
Because with real blood coming out, it would have more impact.

142
00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:56.915
Anna would think of something like that.

143
00:07:56.915 --> 00:07:58.315
Yeah.

144
00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:02.115
I wonder if she committed suicide after all, then?

145
00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.515
No. The position of the scratch is one that was made

146
00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:07.315
when she fought back at the culprit.

147
00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:08.915
But, I don't understand.

148
00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:13.015
How on earth did the culprit make it look like she was alive?

149
00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:22.415
On the back side of the upper cover by the legs is a red streak.

150
00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:25.115
It's water based paint.

151
00:08:25.115 --> 00:08:26.915
Is it blood paint?

152
00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:30.915
Wait a sec. If I remember correctly, under the bed...

153
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:37.515
A cardboard box and this masking tape

154
00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:39.415
on the cut piece of the sheet.

155
00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.615
No doubt about it!

156
00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:44.515
The culprit made use of this space!

157
00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:50.915
In order to make Anna's death look as real as possible.

158
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:57.815
Anna!

159
00:08:59.615 --> 00:09:02.915
And? How about it, coroner?

160
00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:05.515
The death spot is pink.

161
00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:09.915
This is unmistakably death from potassium cyanide poisoning.

162
00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:11.615
I see.

163
00:09:11.615 --> 00:09:15.815
Just in case, I also checked the mask and the tubes

164
00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:20.015
that were connected to it when the victim died but...

165
00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:22.615
the cause of her death isn't that.

166
00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:25.115
You mean it's the capsule that was in her mouth?

167
00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.415
Yeah.

168
00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:29.215
A high concentrate of cyanide response was detected.

169
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:32.915
The scratch on her cheek bothers me a bit but...

170
00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:37.915
If there are people who witnessed the deceased suddenly suffering,

171
00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:40.215
there's no other explanation than that she herself,

172
00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:43.915
bit the capsule with the poison inside it.

173
00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.415
After all she was wearing a mask,

174
00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:50.515
so nobody could've put the capsule in her mouth.

175
00:09:50.515 --> 00:09:52.815
Gosh. If the story about her

176
00:09:52.815 --> 00:09:54.115
wanting to experience a near death experience

177
00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:58.015
and put something like that in her mouth is true,

178
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:00.115
all decency has been lost.

179
00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:04.815
Can we go home already?

180
00:10:04.815 --> 00:10:06.315
After all, it's been concluded that she committed suicide...

181
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:09.315
rather, that she died of an accident.

182
00:10:09.315 --> 00:10:12.515
Yeah. After you go with Officer Takagi to the station

183
00:10:12.515 --> 00:10:14.815
and finish interrogation, you may leave.

184
00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.715
Where's Officer Takagi?

185
00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:18.415
If you're talking about the other officer,

186
00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:21.215
a boy wearing glasses called and stopped him.

187
00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:23.015
Why?

188
00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:25.615
-I have no idea. -Sorry, but...

189
00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:28.515
Sonoko suddenly says that she's going to start a deduction show

190
00:10:28.515 --> 00:10:31.715
so to gather in the operation room, the scene of the crime.

191
00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:38.215
Okay.

192
00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:40.215
I've already fired the needle of the tranquilizer gun.

193
00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:43.315
The mini mike is also attached to the back of her collar.

194
00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:44.415
All I have to do now is use the voice changer

195
00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:46.015
to mimic Sonoko's voice.

196
00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:52.915
Just what is the meaning of this?

197
00:10:52.915 --> 00:10:54.615
Sonoko!

198
00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:58.515
The cause of Anna's

199
00:10:58.515 --> 00:11:00.715
could be none other than accidental death

200
00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:03.415
because she mistakenly bit the poisoned capsule.

201
00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:07.115
Therefore, just what and how do you propose to make a deduction?

202
00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:11.315
No. As you can tell from the scratch mark on Anna's cheek,

203
00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:16.215
someone shoved the poisoned capsule into her mouth

204
00:11:16.215 --> 00:11:17.415
and killed her.

205
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:22.115
In other words, before Ran and I came into this operation room,

206
00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:25.415
Anna was already poisoned to death.

207
00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:29.115
Mutsumi was in the X-Ray room next door.

208
00:11:29.115 --> 00:11:31.015
Mr. Tsujiei and Mr. Hachiya

209
00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:35.115
who came into this operation room after us.

210
00:11:35.115 --> 00:11:37.815
One of the three is the one who did it!

211
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.120
Hey, you guys saw

212
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.720
Anna suffer and struggle about, didn't you?

213
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.220
Yes, she was having a convulsion.

214
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.720
She was kicking her legs up and down.

215
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720
If so...

216
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.720
It looked like she was having a convulsion

217
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.420
because the bed was shaking and rattling.

218
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.220
Then what about her kicking her legs up and down?

219
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.720
The sheet flipped over and her feet were showing, right?

220
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.020
Yes.

221
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.920
Can't you figure it out?

222
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.520
The bed is handmade, the framework is latticed

223
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.620
and is loosely made, you know?

224
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.120
If you're under the bed, don't you think something can be done?

225
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.420
Under the bed?

226
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.120
I see! The culprit grabbed dead Anna's legs

227
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.320
from under the bed sheets and all,

228
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.620
made it look like she was kicking her legs up and down

229
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.320
so she looked like she was suffering, no?

230
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.520
Like this?

231
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.720
Hey! Is someone under the bed?

232
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.620
It's me!

233
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.220
Conan?

234
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.420
Just like Sonoko told me to,

235
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.320
I stuck both my arms up from under the bed.

236
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.620
How was it?

237
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.920
Well... her legs were kicking up and down faster

238
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.020
when we were watching.

239
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.520
And, the way it was done now,

240
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.520
the sheet underneath would also flip over

241
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.920
so I think it was a bit different.

242
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.220
Besides, if the sheet on top of her flipped over more than it should

243
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.120
and the culprit's hand that grabbed her legs is in view,

244
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.120
everything would be more than conspicuous.

245
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.220
Then, how about this?

246
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.220
Officer Takagi?

247
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220
Officer Takagi is sticking his hands from out

248
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.020
under the bed like Conan did.

249
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.420
But the kicking is faster than before

250
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.420
and the sheet underneath isn't flipped over either.

251
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.920
No way.

252
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.820
There's no one on the bed and yet how come only the legs are...

253
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.920
It can't be, it's impossible.

254
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.120
Legs from out under the bed!

255
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.420
The legs are showing from the cut part of the sheet?

256
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.220
What on earth is going on anyway?

257
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.120
Ta... Officer Takagi.

258
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.420
Oh, yes, sir.

259
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.020
The trick's easy.

260
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.020
First you roll up the sheet up to your knee,

261
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.720
then fold the sheet until it comes to the knee.

262
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.120
Pick up the cut piece of sheet that's under the bed

263
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.020
and cover the wooden framework of the bed,

264
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.720
then fix it in place with masking tape.

265
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.120
Pull the switch that ejects blood

266
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.720
through the joint part of the sheet

267
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.620
and all is set!

268
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.220
All that's left to do next, is to stick both your legs out

269
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.920
from the joint part of the sheet.

270
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.920
Then do as Officer Takagi did a while ago,

271
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.320
kicking his legs up and down

272
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.120
and flip the sheet over to show his legs.

273
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.920
It would look like Anna is still alive

274
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.220
and struggling in pain!

275
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.120
If the switch is pushed immediately and blood gushes out.

276
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.920
While we were surprised watching this happen,

277
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.420
the culprit quietly took his legs out

278
00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.920
of the joint part of the sheet,

279
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.320
wore his shoes,

280
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.020
pulled the sheet that he added on under the bed,

281
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.520
removed the masking tape.

282
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.920
Then left from the foot of the bed,

283
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.920
which was a blind spot from where we were.

284
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.320
In other words, the culprit

285
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.320
came to this operation room before we came,

286
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.320
forced Anna to drink the poison and killed her.

287
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.220
He then rigged the sheet,

288
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.820
and when we went over to the head of the bed where Anna was,

289
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.220
he shook the bed with both hands.

290
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.020
This way, after making it look as if Anna were alive,

291
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.520
he snuck out from the bed,

292
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.720
and appeared before us as if nothing had happened!

293
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.420
So, the one capable of doing this

294
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.520
is the one who appeared before us immediately after that.

295
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.320
Hey.

296
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.120
It's nothing to get that scared about is there, you two.

297
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.220
He's right.

298
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.620
All of this is just fake stuff.

299
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.320
What? Is something wrong?

300
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.920
I see. So, anyone of you three could've committed the crime.

301
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.220
Hey, I didn't do it!

302
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.520
Besides, if it were that way,

303
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.320
when her legs are kicked up and down,

304
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.820
the covers on top her would flip over too much

305
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.520
and Anna's legs would show, right?

306
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.120
Right!

307
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.320
If Anna's legs come into view, the trick will be seen through!

308
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.520
To avoid this from happening, the culprit...

309
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.420
has bent Anna's legs toward the outside.

310
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.820
Don't be ridiculous!

311
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.720
That kind of deception will be see right through

312
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.320
as soon as the sheet is flipped up.

313
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320
That's why the culprit prepared things beforehand.

314
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.820
Right?

315
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.620
Saying that you were taking Anna to the hospital,

316
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.220
you put your hand into the bed and carried her up.

317
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.820
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

318
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.420
Mr. Sonsaku Tsujiei?

319
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.920
I see! If he carries her up,

320
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.520
even if her legs were folded in bed, you wouldn't be able to tell.

321
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.820
No!

322
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.320
I really thought that Anna fell sick or something and...

323
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.120
By the way,

324
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.520
is your athlete's foot okay already?

325
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.120
In order to throw the poisoned capsule into Anna's mouth

326
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.220
while she was lying on the bed

327
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.720
and cover her mouth and nose until she swallows it.

328
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.920
Since the culprit wasn't able to hold her

329
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.420
while the bed was shaking,

330
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.520
he stuck his shoe in the space

331
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.420
under the upper right leg of the bed

332
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.320
so that it wouldn't shake, no?

333
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.720
Only, he forgot that there was a pool of blood paint there.

334
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.220
Because of this, a red square mark of the leg of the bed

335
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.320
remained on his shoe.

336
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.020
Unfortunately, you realized this,

337
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.920
only after the police arrived.

338
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.520
That's why you pretended to have athlete's foot

339
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.920
and rubbed the shoe with the blood paint on it onto the other shoe

340
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.920
and tried to get the square trace

341
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.320
that was on the shoe to smear off!

342
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.520
But, this trick wouldn't have worked

343
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.220
unless we served as guides for you

344
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.520
in this haunted operation room, would it?

345
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.620
Right. We brought you here coincidentally

346
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.920
only because Mr. Mouri couldn't come here.

347
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.920
It wasn't a coincidence!

348
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.020
Your target was Ran his daughter, to begin with,

349
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.720
who you thought would most probably accompany him here.

350
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.820
First, the wisdom bag!

351
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.520
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

352
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.020
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

353
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.720
I wanted him to take a look and then.

354
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.320
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

355
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.220
Did you want to see my father about something?

356
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.320
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

357
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.120
No, that's not it but...

358
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.920
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

359
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.620
Yes, at times.

360
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.320
Then... you've seen it, haven't you?

361
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.520
You deliberately talked about

362
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.520
Detective Mouri right beside Ran and brought us here

363
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.220
and set us up as eye-witnesses

364
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.820
because you figured girls would be terrified. Isn't that right?

365
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.220
Serving as an escort would probably come up too,

366
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.620
and you could also fake losing sight of us,

367
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.820
making it easy for you to prepare to scare us inside the room.

368
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.520
By hiding a surprise device under the bed,

369
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.420
you could put it on right away, and appear too.

370
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.320
Nonsense! What proof do you have of this?

371
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.820
Then, why not show us your athlete's foot?

372
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.020
Well...

373
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.420
On the back side of the covers,

374
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.420
there were several streaks of red lines.

375
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.520
That's the trace of your nail

376
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.920
when you slipped your foot inside the bed.

377
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.920
You realized for the first time only after you murdered Anna

378
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.820
and bent her legs toward the outside, right?

379
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.620
That she was wearing red pedicure.

380
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.720
So, you should still have traces of it on your foot.

381
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.220
The red blood paint that you put on your nails to get yourself

382
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.320
out of the predicament!

383
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.520
Excuse me.

384
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.520
I see.

385
00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.620
He slipped his legs into the bed before the pedicure dried

386
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.620
so the blood paint on his nails smeared onto the upper cover.

387
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.720
Well, Mutsumi is wearing sandals.

388
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.320
Mr. Hachiya showed us his toes

389
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.220
so the only suspect left is you.

390
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.620
-Hey, no joke? -Why would you want to kill Anna?

391
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.520
You're aware that Anna I

392
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.920
used to argue a lot about how to perform being dead, right?

393
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.320
She made so much fuss that I asked her.

394
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:36.420
Have you ever seen a person die?

395
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.820
Then, she said.

396
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.620
I have!

397
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.520
I've seen it over and over for a hundred times,

398
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.320
that's why I even see it in my dreams!

399
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.120
Just what do you mean by that?

400
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.420
I asked Mr. Hashiguchi

401
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.720
to shoot everything on video for me

402
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.120
if he was planning to kill himself anyway!

403
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.720
No...

404
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.920
No joke?

405
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.620
When we found the body of Hashiguchi in his room,

406
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.520
Anna was acting strange, wasn't she?

407
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.320
She was really excited saying things like,

408
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.220
"Call the police,"

409
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.420
Or, "Search the room because his last will must be somewhere".

410
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.720
Then, don't tell me that she...

411
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.120
Yeah.

412
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.320
She said she took the tape out of the video camera

413
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.720
that was hidden inside the bookshelf at that time.

414
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.620
That's why, I made her go through

415
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.820
the same thing that Hashiguchi did!

416
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.220
I told her that the black paint she had on her teeth

417
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.020
was wearing off so that I'd fix it for her.

418
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.520
I cracked the capsule with my mouth

419
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.420
and threw the capsule into her mouth!

420
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.420
Rather than try to stop him from committing suicide,

421
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.320
she had the nerve to urge him on.

422
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.720
Even if he only had six more months to live

423
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.520
because of his illness,

424
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.620
with six more months to go,

425
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.120
we could've maybe completed our graduation project movie.

426
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.920
Anw we may have been able to show it to him...

427
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.620
And yet... and yet she had the nerve to...

428
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:42.020
Well... but Pops never came, after all.

429
00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.820
Okay, bag 104 is what everybody has.

430
00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.520
A bag stored with patience!

431
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.920
If this bag of stored patience bursts,

432
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.820
I can't continue on with the detective business.

433
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.120
-I don't believe it. -He's still lecturing.

434
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.420
Talk about too long...
