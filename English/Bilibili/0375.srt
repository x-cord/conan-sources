1
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.640
Today's code is pretty difficult.

2
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.240
The star and the killer are called by the same name.

3
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.940
Search and see through the telescope trick!

4
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.240
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.725 --> 00:02:00.925
We go over to a pension in the mountains to observe stars.

8
00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:04.725
Besides the owner of the pension, Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi,

9
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:07.925
three people received an invitation card, Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya,

10
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.925
Mr. Hajime Futagawa, and Mr. Heihachi Mikami.

11
00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:15.725
We went to look at the stars...

12
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:16.725
When we got to a hill nearby,

13
00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:19.025
to our surprise we found a skeletonized corpse!

14
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.225
Moreover, in its hand it was holding six cigarettes

15
00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.225
thought to be a dying message.

16
00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:26.725
-And, that night... -What was that sound?

17
00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:29.525
Mr. Futagawa?

18
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:34.925
The same dying message again?

19
00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.425
No, this time...

20
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:39.125
there's one more.

21
00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:47.025
"Stars, a Cigarette and a Code (Part 2)"

22
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:50.925
True.

23
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.025
There are seven cigarettes in all.

24
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:54.925
What does this mean?

25
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.625
It's likely that the person that the six cigarettes stand for,

26
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:04.525
which Mr. Kono, who was killed a year ago was holding

27
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:08.225
and the person that Mr. Futagawa is trying to describe

28
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:10.825
using the seven cigarettes may not be the same.

29
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:14.525
Maybe the killer deliberately added one more

30
00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.825
just to throw investigation off.

31
00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.525
That's not possible.

32
00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:21.425
We heard something drop to the ground

33
00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:24.125
and went running over right away.

34
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:28.125
There was no light when we ran over here, was there?

35
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.225
No, it was pitch dark.

36
00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.825
Which means that one who killed Mr. Kono,

37
00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:35.425
and the one who killed Mr. Futagawa are two different people.

38
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:39.525
Or, it could be that Mr. Futagawa tried to leave some kind of clue behind.

39
00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.525
There's blood on just one match.

40
00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:45.925
There is blood on his hand that was holding the cigarette case.

41
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:52.425
There's blood on the other cigarette case in his pocket too.

42
00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:54.625
It could be that...

43
00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:01.525
Your detective badge is beeping.

44
00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:06.125
Oh, it's me! Can you see me?

45
00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.525
Above. Look up!

46
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:09.625
Dr. Agasa!

47
00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:14.325
Hey, is anybody there?

48
00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:15.725
No, no one in particular.

49
00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:18.025
We didn't see anyone, did we?

50
00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.425
But, we did find something on the ground!

51
00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:21.725
Something on the ground?

52
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.825
A cell phone.

53
00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.425
There's a mail that hasn't been sent out.

54
00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:29.125
What's written on the mail?

55
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:30.125
"Will"

56
00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.725
A will.

57
00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.525
A will?

58
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.825
Mr. Futagawa is dead?

59
00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.125
Oh no. It can't be.

60
00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.225
He fell off the cliff and I think he died instantly.

61
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:48.225
Mr. Futagawa's cell phone was found on the cliff.

62
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:52.025
A mail "will" with no "send to" address was found in his cell phone.

63
00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.225
There was a will in his cell phone?

64
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:56.425
This is what is written.

65
00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:59.225
I invited everyone to this pension

66
00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:03.425
because I wanted to confess before everyone what I did a year ago,

67
00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:04.925
here at this pension.

68
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:09.325
Right. The one who killed Mr. Asao Kono a year ago is I,

69
00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:11.125
Hajime Futagawa

70
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:14.025
Ms. Etsuko Nonomiya, who was his fiance,

71
00:05:14.025 --> 00:05:18.025
I am sorry to have killed someone so precious to you.

72
00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:21.525
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi, Mr. Kono's upper classman during his university days.

73
00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:26.525
I am sorry for throwing dirt on this pension that you manage.

74
00:05:26.525 --> 00:05:28.925
And Editor Mikami,

75
00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:33.425
please carry on with Space Sunday even after my death.

76
00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:36.425
He died because I had a slight argument with him

77
00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:38.625
on the cliff and pushed him.

78
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.125
He unfortunately fell off

79
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.725
I was going to confess to this truthfully

80
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.425
and ask for your forgiveness.

81
00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.025
But I found it hard to come up with the subject.

82
00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:49.725
Therefore, I have decided to make amends by killing myself

83
00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:54.725
before the police arrive here tomorrow, Hajime Futagawa.

84
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:57.325
Then, he's dead after all, Asao's...

85
00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.325
Asao's really...

86
00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:04.125
I'm sorry, please accept my apologies too, as his superior.

87
00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.425
Don't cry, Etsuko.

88
00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:09.925
Now we know why he suddenly disappeared

89
00:06:09.925 --> 00:06:11.925
as well as found out who killed him.

90
00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.125
But, I wonder...

91
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.625
Would a person who writes a letter then commit suicide,

92
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.425
leave something like this behind?

93
00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.225
What?

94
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:23.025
Mr. Futagawa, who fell from the cliff,

95
00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:25.125
was holding on tightly to these seven cigarettes.

96
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.825
Mr. Kono had six.

97
00:06:26.825 --> 00:06:29.625
Mr. Futagawa was holding one longer cigarette more.

98
00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.825
If Mr. Futagawa killed Mr. Kono,

99
00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:36.825
and if he realized that the message was about himself,

100
00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:38.725
leading him to commit suicide.

101
00:06:38.725 --> 00:06:41.425
I don't think he would increase the number of cigarettes, do you?

102
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:46.125
On top of that, there's blood only on the one that has been increased.

103
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.725
There was blood on Mr. Futagawa's hand

104
00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:53.425
and the other cigarette case that was in his pocket.

105
00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:55.225
There were also traces of him having been hit

106
00:06:55.225 --> 00:06:57.325
on the head with a steel pipe too.

107
00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:58.725
Hit?

108
00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:01.325
Yes! I think the blood got on

109
00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:04.725
when he touched his bleeding head with his hands.

110
00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.125
In other words, while the someone on the cliff,

111
00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:10.225
who hit Mr. Futagawa on the head, stole his cell phone

112
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:11.625
and was keying in the will,

113
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:13.925
Mr. Futagawa deliberately took out one cigarette

114
00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:15.825
from another cigarette case that he had,

115
00:07:15.825 --> 00:07:18.025
and put that extra cigarette

116
00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:20.125
into the original cigarette case with the six cigarettes inside it,

117
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:22.525
and completed the message.

118
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.425
I feel that this is indeed a dying message.

119
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.825
Oh no.

120
00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:29.925
He probably had the cigarette case with six cigarettes in it,

121
00:07:29.925 --> 00:07:34.425
to verify whether Mr. Kono's dying message applied to him.

122
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:36.125
Wait.

123
00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:37.225
If there were seven,

124
00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:41.225
doesn't that mean that you're the killer, Mr. Amatsuchi?

125
00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:47.025
Mr. Mikami's name Heihachi is also seven cigarettes.

126
00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:54.325
Aren't your initials seven cigarettes too, Ms. Nonomiya?

127
00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:56.725
Come, come, let's stay cool.

128
00:07:56.725 --> 00:08:00.225
Then all three of you, didn't see him in the forest?

129
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:01.925
-No. -No.

130
00:08:01.925 --> 00:08:04.625
Then, let us check all your rooms.

131
00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:09.625
We don't want the one who hit Mr. Futagawa with the steel pipe,

132
00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:13.125
hiding it somewhere and come after us with it, do we?

133
00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:17.925
Hey, don't mess things up too much.

134
00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:21.525
Oh, you brought a telescope with you, sir?

135
00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:24.225
Yeah. It's the one that was in the editing room.

136
00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:28.525
A lens barrel, a stand, a finder and a tripod.

137
00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:32.625
The lens barrel of a telescope is not hard enough to hit someone with.

138
00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:35.325
A tripod like that would probably bend

139
00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:37.025
if you hit someone with it, right?

140
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:38.525
True.

141
00:08:38.525 --> 00:08:42.525
You tried a lot of different cigarettes too, didn't you, sir?

142
00:08:42.525 --> 00:08:43.525
Yeah.

143
00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:47.025
I couldn't figure anything out though.

144
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:49.725
Hey, that's enough!

145
00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:51.925
How long are you going to keep searching?

146
00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:53.525
The only thing that could serve as a murder weapon

147
00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.325
would be this umbrella.

148
00:08:55.325 --> 00:08:57.725
But, it's not bent anywhere.

149
00:08:57.725 --> 00:09:01.525
Of course not. Because I'm not the killer.

150
00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:04.525
What about the liquor bottle you had?

151
00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.225
I threw it away in the forest.

152
00:09:07.225 --> 00:09:09.625
When I threw you guys off.

153
00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:11.425
Threw us off?

154
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.525
You came after me, didn't you?

155
00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:17.125
You, the freckled boy and the girl with the bangs.

156
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:19.325
I suddenly felt nauseated back then

157
00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.325
and was throwing up behind a tree.

158
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:31.325
You were trying to figure out Mr. Kono's dying message too, weren't you?

159
00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:35.925
Yes. But I didn't think they were Mr. Futagawa's initials.

160
00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:39.325
I didn't know his first name.

161
00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:44.125
Then, finally, it's your turn Mr. Amatsuchi.

162
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:47.625
But since this pension is in its entirety like your own room,

163
00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:49.325
I guess we'll ask the police to investigate

164
00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:51.025
when we call them in the morning.

165
00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.225
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:56.225
Make sure you tell the police to search inside the forest!

167
00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:59.125
Because if I were the killer, I'd hide the murder weapon there.

168
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.425
Yes.

169
00:10:01.425 --> 00:10:03.625
Ai, so how was it?

170
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.325
I searched every nook and cranny of Mr. Futagawa's room

171
00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.125
for the thing you told me to look for

172
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.425
but found nothing.

173
00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:12.925
That's strange.

174
00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:15.125
If the killer left such a will behind and killed him,

175
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.125
it should be around somewhere.

176
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.525
While you were investigating the rooms,

177
00:10:20.525 --> 00:10:23.325
I was here watching over the people who were waiting.

178
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:26.025
That man called Amatsuchi is suspicious.

179
00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:29.125
-He sure is suspicious. -Why?

180
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.925
Because he was looking over the guest list over and over.

181
00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:33.925
Yes, really carefully, over and over.

182
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.125
And with a frightening face like this.

183
00:10:37.125 --> 00:10:38.825
The guest list.

184
00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:44.025
Come to think of it, Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa said that

185
00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:46.025
they met Mr. Kono only once.

186
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:48.425
After Mr. Kono's whereabouts became unknown,

187
00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:50.825
these two men have been here several times.

188
00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:51.925
Here it is.

189
00:10:51.925 --> 00:10:53.425
It's probably this day.

190
00:10:53.425 --> 00:10:56.225
The day when Mr. Kono died.

191
00:10:56.225 --> 00:11:00.325
Yes, after Mr. Kono and Ms. Nonomiya's names

192
00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.625
come the names of Mr. Mikami and Mr. Futagawa,

193
00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.125
so there's no doubt about it.

194
00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:05.625
Maybe this is...

195
00:11:09.025 --> 00:11:11.325
I see, so that's the story.

196
00:11:14.225 --> 00:11:16.525
Ai, come here a minute.

197
00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:24.125
Okay! Please.

198
00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:27.125
I agree with Ayumi too.

199
00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:28.325
Right?

200
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:31.625
A Fusae brand wallet about this size.

201
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:34.125
If you get it for me, I'll help you.

202
00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.425
Its hurt.

203
00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:41.925
Ai! What's wrong?

204
00:11:41.925 --> 00:11:44.925
-Ai, are you okay? -Ai!

205
00:11:44.925 --> 00:11:47.225
Oh no! She may have appendicitis!

206
00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:49.625
What? Does it hurt, Ai?

207
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.625
But, we've got a problem. The phone won't connect.

208
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:54.425
And even if we were to carry her down,

209
00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:56.125
-who knows how long it'll take. -Ai!

210
00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.125
It hurts, Dr. Agasa.

211
00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.425
Do something, Dr. Agasa.

212
00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:06.525
Its hurt. Help.

213
00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:16.925
Hello, could you send an ambulance up here?

214
00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:19.225
Yes, a child suddenly fell ill.

215
00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:20.925
Just as I thought.

216
00:12:29.447 --> 00:12:32.147
Hello, please send an ambulance up here.

217
00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:33.347
-Yes, a child suddenly fell ill. -No joke.

218
00:12:33.347 --> 00:12:36.747
I thought the modular cable for the phone was gone?

219
00:12:36.747 --> 00:12:39.147
The address is Gunma prefecture...

220
00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:45.947
Conan?

221
00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.247
We have to contact the ambulance quickly or Ai will...

222
00:12:48.247 --> 00:12:50.047
Just what do you think you're doing?

223
00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:52.947
There's no need to call one I was just acting.

224
00:12:52.947 --> 00:12:58.447
In order to reveal the one who hid the modular cable

225
00:12:58.447 --> 00:13:03.147
and flattened the tires of our cars to confine us here.

226
00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:06.447
Don't tell me that the one who used Asao's name

227
00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:08.547
and sent out the invitation card to gather us here was...

228
00:13:08.547 --> 00:13:10.347
You.

229
00:13:10.347 --> 00:13:13.647
You're the one who left a will in Mr. Futagawa's cell phone,

230
00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:15.147
made it look like he committed suicide

231
00:13:15.147 --> 00:13:17.347
and pushed him off the cliff,

232
00:13:17.347 --> 00:13:20.547
Mr. Ryoji Amatsuchi!

233
00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:21.547
Oh, no...

234
00:13:28.347 --> 00:13:29.547
Wrong.

235
00:13:31.147 --> 00:13:32.347
Wrong?

236
00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:35.747
It's true that Mr. Amatsuchi is the one who invited everyone here

237
00:13:35.747 --> 00:13:37.347
and confined us here.

238
00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:39.047
But, he's not the killer.

239
00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:41.047
Why not, Conan?

240
00:13:41.047 --> 00:13:44.747
It was in the will that the killer wrote, wasn't it?

241
00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:47.347
That the killer's the one who invited everyone here.

242
00:13:47.347 --> 00:13:50.947
If Mr. Amatsuchi was the one who killed Mr. Futagawa,

243
00:13:50.947 --> 00:13:53.247
wouldn't he have made it look like...

244
00:13:53.247 --> 00:13:56.647
Mr. Futagawa was the one who confined everyone here?

245
00:13:56.647 --> 00:14:01.247
And he would've hidden that modular cable into Mr. Futagawa's clothes,

246
00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:02.747
or hidden it in the room.

247
00:14:02.747 --> 00:14:04.447
True.

248
00:14:04.447 --> 00:14:07.447
Mr. Amatsuchi called everyone here

249
00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.647
because he found the bones,

250
00:14:09.647 --> 00:14:12.547
the ring and dying message cigarettes of Mr. Kono,

251
00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:15.947
whose whereabouts became unknown a year ago.

252
00:14:15.947 --> 00:14:19.047
If not, he couldn't have been so accurate

253
00:14:19.047 --> 00:14:20.547
just taking a quick glance at the cigarettes

254
00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:22.147
and remarking that there were four long cigarettes

255
00:14:22.147 --> 00:14:24.147
and two short ones, right?

256
00:14:24.147 --> 00:14:26.747
Yeah. I sent out the invitation

257
00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:28.747
to the people who spent the night here that day

258
00:14:28.747 --> 00:14:30.847
because I found those things.

259
00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:32.647
I figured that if the killer found out

260
00:14:32.647 --> 00:14:34.347
that I found the bones and the message,

261
00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:37.347
the killer would confess.

262
00:14:37.347 --> 00:14:39.847
But, since Mr. Futagawa died,

263
00:14:39.847 --> 00:14:41.247
I couldn't come out and say so.

264
00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.747
Which means then that the person who killed Mr. Futagawa is...

265
00:14:44.747 --> 00:14:49.147
Of course! The killer is that woman called Ms. Nonomiya, right?

266
00:14:49.147 --> 00:14:51.547
What a thing to say?

267
00:14:51.547 --> 00:14:53.247
That is possible.

268
00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:57.447
If she realized that the cigarettes stood for Mr. Futagawa's initials.

269
00:14:57.447 --> 00:15:00.647
Avenging the death of her fiance that was killed.

270
00:15:00.647 --> 00:15:02.547
That's more than enough motive.

271
00:15:02.547 --> 00:15:08.047
No, Ms. Nonomiya said she passed us in the forest.

272
00:15:08.047 --> 00:15:11.347
She couldn't possibly have gone up the hill before us,

273
00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:12.847
meet Mr. Futagawa and push him off the cliff.

274
00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:16.547
But when Mr. Futagawa fell off,

275
00:15:16.547 --> 00:15:18.547
all three of you ran right over, didn't you?

276
00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:21.447
If somebody was watching that from on top of the cliff...

277
00:15:21.447 --> 00:15:23.547
Seen from on top the cliff

278
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:26.547
were only three little lights the size of a bean.

279
00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:30.647
It's impossible to make out who the three of us were from that distance.

280
00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:33.347
In other words, by means of elimination

281
00:15:33.347 --> 00:15:35.647
the only one capable of being the killer is,

282
00:15:35.647 --> 00:15:37.847
Mr. Futagawa's boss and editor,

283
00:15:37.847 --> 00:15:40.647
Mr. Heihachi Mikami, you are the killer, right?

284
00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:48.947
If the other two aren't the killer, you say that it's me?

285
00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:54.747
But, Mr. Futagawa was holding seven cigarettes.

286
00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:58.247
That was a message pointing out your name, Heihachi.

287
00:15:58.247 --> 00:15:59.747
It's only a coincidence.

288
00:15:59.747 --> 00:16:03.747
And, besides, why do I have to go and kill Futagawa?

289
00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:08.447
If he did kill the guy called Kono a year ago, then the more so.

290
00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:10.447
I have no obligation to avenge the death

291
00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.947
of a person that I've met for the first time.

292
00:16:12.947 --> 00:16:14.247
True.

293
00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:18.747
But that's only if Mr. Futagawa had actually killed Mr. Kono.

294
00:16:18.747 --> 00:16:20.047
What?

295
00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:23.647
I looked through the guest book

296
00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:27.747
and noticed that Mr. Mikami's name was listed after Mr. Kono's name.

297
00:16:27.747 --> 00:16:29.747
It dawned on me that maybe Mr. Kono knew Mr. Mikami's name

298
00:16:29.747 --> 00:16:32.847
only by sound and not the kanji character.

299
00:16:32.847 --> 00:16:34.347
By sound?

300
00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:36.847
The kanji for the word "mi" in Mr. Mikami's name

301
00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:39.347
is also pronounced as "o", right?

302
00:16:39.347 --> 00:16:40.747
Yes, the usual kanji character for "Mikami"

303
00:16:40.747 --> 00:16:42.247
is made out of the word three (San) and top (Ue).

304
00:16:42.247 --> 00:16:44.147
The number of strokes for the kanji character are...

305
00:16:44.147 --> 00:16:46.347
One, two, three...

306
00:16:46.347 --> 00:16:48.547
-Six! -Six!

307
00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:52.147
Right, the six cigarettes left behind by Mr. Kono

308
00:16:52.147 --> 00:16:55.547
as well as the seven cigarettes left behind by Mr. Futagawa

309
00:16:55.547 --> 00:17:00.247
are both dying messages that stand for Heihachi Mikami!

310
00:17:00.247 --> 00:17:02.547
Mr. Futagawa increased the number of cigarettes

311
00:17:02.547 --> 00:17:04.447
to make it easier to understand.

312
00:17:04.447 --> 00:17:06.047
He chose the same brand of cigarette

313
00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:09.547
because the killer for both incidents was the same person.

314
00:17:09.547 --> 00:17:11.347
Come to think of it,

315
00:17:11.347 --> 00:17:16.547
Mr. Futagawa was laughing while looking at the guest book back then.

316
00:17:16.547 --> 00:17:19.947
That's when he realized that Mr. Mikami killed Mr. Kono.

317
00:17:19.947 --> 00:17:21.947
So, when he tried to confirm it,

318
00:17:21.947 --> 00:17:25.347
he was probably killed instead, no?

319
00:17:25.347 --> 00:17:28.547
This is ridiculous. Do you have any evidence?

320
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:33.147
The evidence is the bag that was found in your room.

321
00:17:33.147 --> 00:17:38.647
If something like the steel pipe that killed Mr. Futagawa is found,

322
00:17:38.647 --> 00:17:41.647
it will serve as concrete evidence!

323
00:17:41.647 --> 00:17:43.647
Hey.

324
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:46.747
You checked that bag a while ago.

325
00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:49.547
Yeah. I couldn't find the steel pipe,

326
00:17:49.547 --> 00:17:51.447
but I couldn't find something that should've been there either.

327
00:17:51.447 --> 00:17:52.747
Something that should've been there?

328
00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:55.547
The heavy-weight for the telescope.

329
00:17:55.547 --> 00:17:58.947
You put something else into this lens barrel

330
00:17:58.947 --> 00:18:01.347
and removed the heavy-weight.

331
00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:04.047
In order to keep the weight what is should be.

332
00:18:04.047 --> 00:18:07.047
So, will you show us the inside of the lens barrel?

333
00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:09.647
No matter how well you wipe it,

334
00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:11.647
the luminol reaction from the blood that stuck to it

335
00:18:11.647 --> 00:18:14.447
after you hit Mr. Futagawa is bound to be there.

336
00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:18.447
Futagawa's blood is definitely still here.

337
00:18:18.447 --> 00:18:20.347
So, you're the one after all.

338
00:18:20.347 --> 00:18:22.947
Right. I went out of my way to look after him

339
00:18:22.947 --> 00:18:24.547
and see that he made it to the desk,

340
00:18:24.547 --> 00:18:26.647
yet he had the nerve to say to pay him 50,000,000 yen

341
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:29.447
if I wanted him to keep his mouth shut about the murder.

342
00:18:29.447 --> 00:18:33.047
All I did was punish Kono for not being grateful.

343
00:18:33.047 --> 00:18:34.347
Punished him?

344
00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:36.547
Just what do you mean?

345
00:18:36.547 --> 00:18:38.747
A comet.

346
00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:45.347
A year ago, that day, the guy named Kono came to ask me a favor.

347
00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:50.647
He asked me to verify whether the comet he found was a new one or not.

348
00:18:50.647 --> 00:18:54.147
You mean the comet that was named after you?

349
00:18:54.147 --> 00:18:59.247
It was found by that man and I confirmed it on that cliff.

350
00:18:59.247 --> 00:19:01.047
Don't tell me that you killed Asao

351
00:19:01.047 --> 00:19:03.047
so that you could hog that comet all for yourself?

352
00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:06.947
I asked him to put my name on the comet, of course.

353
00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:08.747
But that guy...

354
00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.147
Talk about ungrateful.

355
00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:13.647
No, I can't.

356
00:19:13.647 --> 00:19:17.147
We've already decided that the name of the star is...

357
00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:18.347
Amatsuchi, Nonomiya, Kono comet.

358
00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:21.647
I thought...

359
00:19:21.647 --> 00:19:22.947
Come to think of it,

360
00:19:22.947 --> 00:19:26.447
he mentioned that the time's finally come.

361
00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:29.847
I thought that he found somebody else.

362
00:19:29.847 --> 00:19:33.947
It was a dream I've held since childhood too.

363
00:19:33.947 --> 00:19:37.747
And yet he refused to listen to me.

364
00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:40.147
So, I figured that I'd go and submit it before he does

365
00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:42.147
and headed back for the pension.

366
00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:45.447
Then, that guy came clinging onto me so I brushed him away

367
00:19:45.447 --> 00:19:47.947
and he fell off the cliff.

368
00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:51.447
Then, later when you came here again

369
00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:52.747
in order to hasten skeletonizing of the corpse,

370
00:19:52.747 --> 00:19:54.447
you poured lime over it, right?

371
00:19:54.447 --> 00:19:55.447
Right.

372
00:19:55.447 --> 00:19:57.247
What a surprise it was to find that

373
00:19:57.247 --> 00:20:00.847
Mr. Amatsuchi was the sender of the invitations.

374
00:20:00.847 --> 00:20:03.647
I thought it was Futagawa all this time.

375
00:20:03.647 --> 00:20:05.847
Hey, hurry and take out the steel pipe.

376
00:20:05.847 --> 00:20:07.247
Stop pushing me.

377
00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:09.547
It's a steel pipe...

378
00:20:10.547 --> 00:20:13.247
but, not an ordinary steel pipe.

379
00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:15.647
Shot gun.

380
00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:18.747
Okay! You line up there too!

381
00:20:20.147 --> 00:20:24.847
In Futagawa's case, I just hit him to avoid the gun shot,

382
00:20:24.847 --> 00:20:28.047
but this time I'll finish you all off in a blow.

383
00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:29.947
I'll sure need a lot of lime.

384
00:20:32.647 --> 00:20:34.747
No need to be scared little lady.

385
00:20:34.747 --> 00:20:38.747
I'll turn you into a star in no time.

386
00:20:38.747 --> 00:20:40.247
What are you doing brat?

387
00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:42.547
Can't you see? I'm wearing my shoes.

388
00:20:42.547 --> 00:20:44.347
Shoes?

389
00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:47.447
You idiot! Do you think you can get away?

390
00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.747
No. Mine's the same as yours.

391
00:20:49.747 --> 00:20:51.447
What?

392
00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:54.447
Mine is also...

393
00:20:55.947 --> 00:20:57.247
not an ordinary shoe.

394
00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:01.847
See.

395
00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:14.147
Aren't you glad

396
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:17.847
now that your name will finally be branded

397
00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:21.347
as one owned by a criminal, a convict, rather than comet?

398
00:22:52.547 --> 00:22:57.047
I wonder why Mr. Kono was so obsessed about the name of the comet?

399
00:22:57.047 --> 00:22:59.747
I can understand him wanting to name it after his fiance, Ms. Nonomiya,

400
00:22:59.747 --> 00:23:02.947
but why couldn't he let Mr. Amatsuchi wait and name it after Mr. Mikami?

401
00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:04.047
Then, this wouldn't have happened.

402
00:23:04.047 --> 00:23:07.647
But, they were upper classman and under classman at the university.

403
00:23:07.647 --> 00:23:10.447
-They were probably very good friends! -Guess so.

404
00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:12.647
I don't think that's all there is to it.

405
00:23:12.647 --> 00:23:15.047
He really didn't want to leave out Mr. Amatsuchi

406
00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:17.347
because "Ama" from Amatsuchi's name, "No" from Nonomiya's name,

407
00:23:17.347 --> 00:23:19.447
and "Kawa" from his name, when you them line up horizontally

408
00:23:19.447 --> 00:23:21.247
stands for Amanogawa, which means the Milky Way.

409
00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:22.747
-I understand. -I see.

410
00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:25.247
Conan, you're fantastic!

411
00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:28.347
Hey, will you guys be a little quieter?

412
00:23:28.347 --> 00:23:30.347
I was going to go to the country over to grandma's place

413
00:23:30.347 --> 00:23:33.647
and I get dispatched so early in the morning like this.

414
00:23:33.647 --> 00:23:35.547
I guess it'll be a while till I get to go again.

415
00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:38.247
I'm so sleepy...

416
00:23:38.247 --> 00:23:39.947
Where?

417
00:23:39.947 --> 00:23:41.547
Where did you call just now?

418
00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:43.847
Grandma's place in Tottori.

419
00:23:43.847 --> 00:23:46.347
Tottori?

420
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:03.047
"Next Episode"

421
00:24:03.047 --> 00:24:04.147
Ran!

422
00:24:10.447 --> 00:24:11.947
Who the heck is he?

423
00:24:12.947 --> 00:24:15.247
Darn, where'd they go?

424
00:24:19.847 --> 00:24:22.147
What with this siren?

425
00:24:22.147 --> 00:24:24.047
Maybe...

426
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:25.647
Next Conan,

427
00:24:25.647 --> 00:24:29.635
"Time Limit 15:00"

428
00:24:30.174 --> 00:24:33.374
Next Conan's Hint:

429
00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:34.574
"Tent"

430
00:24:34.574 --> 00:24:36.274
It's time limit for Saturday's homework.

431
00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.574
Hey, it's already Monday night.

432
00:24:37.574 --> 00:24:39.478
-I've got to watch Detective Conan. -It just ended.
