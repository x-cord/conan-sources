1
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.824
Just as expected of a great detective,

2
00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:12.724
"Eisuke Kataoka (54)" -figuring out the hide-out of Thief K!

3
00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:15.724
So, you've finally appeared, Thief K!

4
00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.524
"Makoto Sada (57)" -Master, it's dangerous!

5
00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:20.024
Please come down!

6
00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:21.724
Shut up, Sada!

7
00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:24.724
Don't call me master! I'm Thief K!

8
00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.324
Master!

9
00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:31.524
That's the guy who invited us over for dinner, right?

10
00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.224
What is this about?

11
00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:36.124
You didn't know?

12
00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:38.524
My father loves detectives so much.

13
00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:44.424
"Seiya Kataoka (20)" -And Detective Mouri is his favourite detective.

14
00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:46.024
Come to think of it,

15
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:49.424
-there was a statue of him. -This is cool!

16
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.124
That's why sometimes my father urges Detective Mouri to challenge him,

17
00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:57.024
-pretending to be a thief. -Get down now, you thief!

18
00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.824
What a weirdo.

19
00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:02.724
Gosh.

20
00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:07.824
"Yurie Kataoka (29)" -Men really are stupid creatures.

21
00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:10.824
The time limit is 30 minutes!

22
00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:13.424
Try and catch me!

23
00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:18.024
If you manage to catch me before that grand clock strikes 6pm,

24
00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:20.824
I shall give you a fantastic reward!

25
00:01:20.824 --> 00:01:23.724
I wish you all good luck!

26
00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:40.124
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

27
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:42.124
are slashed by the light of deduction.

28
00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.024
A large premise full of tricks.

29
00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:46.124
The shocking reason why Kogoro was targeted.

30
00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:47.724
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:49.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:52.124
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:30.196
"The Secret of the Kogoro Mouri Statue"

34
00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.196
As always, what a magnificent yard.

35
00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:40.196
That's true. It looks like an entire town is included in the yard.

36
00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:44.596
Actually, we call it a town instead of a yard.

37
00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:47.396
It's great for playing hide-and-seek.

38
00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.896
We've got him! That supposed to be a dead end!

39
00:03:59.196 --> 00:04:01.496
Mr. Kataoka disappeared.

40
00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:03.496
Impossible.

41
00:04:12.396 --> 00:04:13.896
This is...

42
00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:19.096
Did you figure something out, Conan?

43
00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:22.996
Don't you think this clock is strange?

44
00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.196
The position of the clock is too low

45
00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:28.796
and the hour hand and the minute hand are both pointing at six.

46
00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:30.196
That is strange, isn't it?

47
00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:32.496
That makes sense.

48
00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:34.796
Could it be...

49
00:04:43.196 --> 00:04:45.896
You were right, this is the entrance to the underground passage!

50
00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.896
It hurts...

51
00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:53.496
Thief K!

52
00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:54.796
Hold it!

53
00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:59.696
-I'm sorry, dad. -I'll head over to the exit!

54
00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:01.096
We can trap him in from both sides!

55
00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:02.196
-Okay! -Okay!

56
00:05:12.096 --> 00:05:13.896
These are...

57
00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:16.896
These footprints in the mud are still new.

58
00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:18.696
No doubt he went this way.

59
00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:24.396
Ran, over there!

60
00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:26.196
We found him!

61
00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.796
Master, we got you!

62
00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:39.796
I'm sorry, how awkward of me.

63
00:05:39.796 --> 00:05:41.496
Hurry up and get down, then!

64
00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:43.496
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:48.596
What? If we go this way...

66
00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:50.596
Yes, it leads to the point where we started from,

67
00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:52.596
the front of the residence.

68
00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:01.096
It seems that he is heading to the backyard!

69
00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:03.896
You two go around from that side!

70
00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.796
We can trap him for sure this time.

71
00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:07.396
Okay!

72
00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:16.496
Gosh! This residence is too large!

73
00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:19.496
He went to your way! Catch him!

74
00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:27.796
Conan, let's go!

75
00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:28.896
All right!

76
00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.396
Watch out!

77
00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:44.396
Isn't it against the rules to ride a bike?

78
00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:45.796
Well, sort of...

79
00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:54.796
This place is like a maze!

80
00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:56.696
How can we tell where he went?

81
00:06:58.396 --> 00:06:59.596
This way!

82
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.496
It hurts...

83
00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.196
Are you all right?

84
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.396
Yes, I happened to bump into him all of a sudden,

85
00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:14.096
I just tripped out of surprise.

86
00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:15.596
Where is Mr. Kataoka?

87
00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:18.696
He probably headed over to the main residence.

88
00:07:18.696 --> 00:07:20.396
7 minutes to go.

89
00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:25.896
Ma'am!

90
00:07:25.896 --> 00:07:27.396
Did you hear that voice just now?

91
00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.796
Yes! What happened?

92
00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:32.096
I only just got here too!

93
00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:34.696
Don't tell me that something happened to Mr. Kataoka!

94
00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:36.696
Master!

95
00:07:41.596 --> 00:07:43.796
Ran! What about over there?

96
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.496
No, nobody here either!

97
00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:49.896
Gosh. Where on earth is he?

98
00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:51.396
What happened?

99
00:07:51.396 --> 00:07:53.496
I heard a loud noise.

100
00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:55.796
Seiya, where were you all this time?

101
00:07:55.796 --> 00:08:00.396
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

102
00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.496
Master!

103
00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:03.596
Sada?

104
00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:05.396
It's from the backyard!

105
00:08:07.796 --> 00:08:10.796
Master, get a hold of yourself!

106
00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:12.996
Master!

107
00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:16.596
What's the matter? Did something happen?

108
00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.896
Well...

109
00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:26.896
Move!

110
00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:31.196
This is bad. He's dead.

111
00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:48.746
The deceased is the master of this residence,

112
00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:52.546
a man of great wealth, Eisuke Kataoka, age 54.

113
00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:55.546
There's been a great impact to his back.

114
00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:58.546
The most severe wound was on the back of his head,

115
00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:00.746
which we believe to be the fatal wound.

116
00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:04.946
The time of his death can be determined to be 5:55pm.

117
00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:11.746
Everyone here heard Mr. Kataoka's scream and the ladder falling.

118
00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:15.946
Mr. Kataoka was in the middle of playing a game with all of you?

119
00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:18.546
Yes, we were playing hide-and-seek.

120
00:09:18.546 --> 00:09:20.246
We were chasing him.

121
00:09:20.246 --> 00:09:23.146
What a thing to do at your age.

122
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.746
Well...

123
00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:30.746
Was it an accident?

124
00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:34.746
Yes. Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints were found on the ladder.

125
00:09:36.246 --> 00:09:39.646
Mr. Kataoka probably lost his balance

126
00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:43.046
when climbing the ladder and fell off.

127
00:09:43.046 --> 00:09:45.446
I expect that's how it happened.

128
00:09:45.446 --> 00:09:47.246
The bruise on his cheek

129
00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:51.646
probably got there when he fell off the ladder too.

130
00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:53.746
He asked for it!

131
00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:57.346
It's because he never outgrew playing such a game.

132
00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:59.246
She is Mr. Kataoka's wife.

133
00:09:59.246 --> 00:10:01.746
It seems that he remarried three years ago

134
00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:03.746
after his previous wife passed away.

135
00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:09.546
What? You're not wearing your wedding ring, ma'am?

136
00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:13.446
I haven't been wearing it for some time because it's too trouble.

137
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.446
But, why is there a trace of a ring...

138
00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:21.146
Is he the son of the previous wife?

139
00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:23.946
Yes. It seems that he had a grudge against Mr. Kataoka,

140
00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:28.646
saying that his father's reckless ways killed his mother.

141
00:10:28.646 --> 00:10:31.046
Well, it's a very appropriate way for him to die like this.

142
00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:32.646
What?

143
00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:36.046
Seiya, what happened to your hand?

144
00:10:36.046 --> 00:10:40.246
What? Oh, I hurt it with a guitar string a while ago.

145
00:10:41.246 --> 00:10:43.746
What? But back then, didn't he say...

146
00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:45.046
What happened?

147
00:10:45.046 --> 00:10:47.346
I heard a loud noise.

148
00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.746
Seiya, where were you all this time?

149
00:10:49.746 --> 00:10:52.746
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

150
00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:59.446
I'm sorry for causing all of you trouble.

151
00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:02.246
But I wonder if this is really an accident.

152
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:03.246
What?

153
00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:07.246
Is anything bothering you, Mouri?

154
00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:09.946
When Mr. Kataoka challenges me,

155
00:11:09.946 --> 00:11:12.846
he always sets up a lot of tricks.

156
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:16.446
But all he did this time was run and flee.

157
00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:18.646
Aren't you overthinking this?

158
00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:22.646
He's an amateur, that would happen too.

159
00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:25.046
Well, I guess so.

160
00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:27.046
So, this really was an accident.

161
00:11:27.046 --> 00:11:29.046
I guess so.

162
00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:31.746
No, he is right.

163
00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:34.746
There are several points that are strange to be an accident.

164
00:11:34.746 --> 00:11:38.046
First, the corpse hadn't been sweating.

165
00:11:38.046 --> 00:11:41.946
Despite the fact that he should've been running until just before he died.

166
00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:43.446
Besides that...

167
00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:51.346
Don't tell me this place...

168
00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:57.746
If so... over there?

169
00:12:01.446 --> 00:12:04.446
It should be somewhere around here.

170
00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:10.346
As expected, this is...

171
00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.146
What's with you?

172
00:12:14.146 --> 00:12:16.046
Looking at me like you saw a monster or something.

173
00:12:16.046 --> 00:12:18.746
Everyone's been shouting and looking for you!

174
00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:21.646
What? Then why back then...

175
00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:26.646
This is the favourite song of the late Mr. Kataoka.

176
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:29.346
I guess someone's playing it at the main residence

177
00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:31.346
to mourn his death.

178
00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:34.346
Pops, can you try moving this statue?

179
00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:36.246
What? It's a statue.

180
00:12:36.246 --> 00:12:37.746
What makes you think I can move it?

181
00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:41.146
Don't you think there's something strange about this statue?

182
00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.446
What?

183
00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:45.346
Your mustache that's not supposed to be connected

184
00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:46.746
is actually connected.

185
00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.946
It looks like it's a fake.

186
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.646
What?

187
00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.246
Is this it?

188
00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.746
What? There's nothing here.

189
00:13:03.946 --> 00:13:06.046
That sound...

190
00:13:06.046 --> 00:13:07.046
I get it!

191
00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:08.246
What?

192
00:13:10.546 --> 00:13:12.246
Lend this to me for a while, okay?

193
00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:18.046
I see, so that's what happened.

194
00:13:18.046 --> 00:13:19.446
What?

195
00:13:19.446 --> 00:13:22.446
What're you doing here, Conan?

196
00:13:22.446 --> 00:13:27.046
Officer Takagi, Pops asked me to do this.

197
00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:30.146
What? But Mr. Mouri's over there.

198
00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:32.146
It's okay...

199
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.946
Pops! I brought everyone over just like you told me to.

200
00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:41.246
What on earth is this about, Mouri?

201
00:13:41.246 --> 00:13:43.246
I've finally figured it out.

202
00:13:43.246 --> 00:13:47.646
The truth behind this murder disguised as an accident.

203
00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:53.346
But the crime scene has all the signs of an accident!

204
00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:55.746
Why do you think it was murder?

205
00:13:55.746 --> 00:13:56.846
The bruise.

206
00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:00.046
The bruise? Do you mean the bruise on the corpse?

207
00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:03.346
He got it when he fell off the ladder, isn't it?

208
00:14:03.346 --> 00:14:05.646
That's what I thought at first.

209
00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:09.446
But this statue helped me get at the truth.

210
00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.346
Please take a good look.

211
00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:13.246
Its nose is chipped, you see that?

212
00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:15.746
It certainly is. But...

213
00:14:15.746 --> 00:14:17.746
The nose is chipped not long ago.

214
00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:22.246
It's as if something hit it with a lot of force recently.

215
00:14:22.246 --> 00:14:23.446
It couldn't be...

216
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:27.346
Yes. Everything should come to light after re-investigation.

217
00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:29.046
The bruise on the corpse's cheek

218
00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:32.046
was made after it hit the nose of the statue.

219
00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:34.546
But the corpse was found...

220
00:14:34.546 --> 00:14:35.746
Yes.

221
00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:39.346
If Mr. Kataoka really fell off the ladder,

222
00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:43.046
he couldn't have hit this statue that is so far away.

223
00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:47.746
Exactly. Mr. Kataoka didn't fall off the ladder.

224
00:14:47.746 --> 00:14:52.446
First, he was struck and passed out by the killer here.

225
00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:55.046
Then, he was carried over to the place where his body was found.

226
00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:58.346
And the killer murdered him by hitting his head and body

227
00:14:58.346 --> 00:15:00.546
against the stone paving.

228
00:15:00.546 --> 00:15:04.546
After that, the killer put Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints on the ladder

229
00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:06.946
and put the ladder beside the corpse

230
00:15:06.946 --> 00:15:10.746
to make everyone believed that Mr. Kataoka fell off the ladder.

231
00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.346
But who would do that?

232
00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:17.046
There's something I'd like to confirm before that.

233
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:19.346
Officer Takagi!

234
00:15:19.346 --> 00:15:23.246
Was the edge of Mr. Kataoka's cape torn?

235
00:15:23.246 --> 00:15:25.246
No, it wasn't.

236
00:15:25.246 --> 00:15:28.746
Don't you think it's strange, Ran?

237
00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:29.746
I get it!

238
00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:31.646
What do you mean?

239
00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:34.946
Mr. Kataoka's cape was supposed to be ripped!

240
00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:36.046
Watch out!

241
00:15:42.046 --> 00:15:45.446
But, the cape the corpse was wearing wasn't torn.

242
00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.446
But why?

243
00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.346
The answer is simple.

244
00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:53.346
It's because the person you were going after wasn't Mr. Kataoka!

245
00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:55.246
-What? -What?

246
00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:59.846
Of course, the first Thief K that we were chasing was Mr. Kataoka.

247
00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:03.446
But, someone took over his place part way,

248
00:16:03.446 --> 00:16:05.846
the killer switched with Mr. Kataoka.

249
00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:09.146
Isn't that right? The other Thief K,

250
00:16:09.146 --> 00:16:12.946
as well as the one who killed Mr. Kataoka...

251
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:15.346
Mr. Makoto Sada!

252
00:16:15.346 --> 00:16:21.646
But Mr. Sada was with us while chasing after Mr. Kataoka.

253
00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:23.646
I don't think he had time to switch with Mr. Kataoka.

254
00:16:23.646 --> 00:16:26.646
No, you weren't always with him.

255
00:16:26.646 --> 00:16:28.946
There was one time you parted ways,

256
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.346
just before you came to this backyard.

257
00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:35.346
You two go around from that side!

258
00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:37.046
We can trap him for sure this time.

259
00:16:37.046 --> 00:16:38.746
Okay.

260
00:16:38.746 --> 00:16:42.046
This was probably Mr. Kataoka's idea to begin with.

261
00:16:42.046 --> 00:16:46.546
He probably had that switching plan for our game.

262
00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:49.346
But, Mr. Sada's purpose

263
00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:54.446
was to take advantage of this trick and kill Mr. Kataoka.

264
00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:55.946
After watching Ran and Conan go off,

265
00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:57.946
he took a short cut into the residence

266
00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:02.446
and wore the outfit of Thief K that he had prepared beforehand,

267
00:17:02.446 --> 00:17:08.046
then attacked Mr. Kataoka who was waiting for him from behind

268
00:17:08.046 --> 00:17:10.246
and hid him in the shade of the statue.

269
00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:13.446
After that, Mr. Sada appears before Ran and Conan as Thief K!

270
00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:16.546
Then, the one we were chasing after...

271
00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:19.746
It wasn't Mr. Kataoka but Mr. Sada.

272
00:17:19.746 --> 00:17:22.046
I confirmed with the kid a while ago.

273
00:17:22.046 --> 00:17:24.346
Thief K's shoes were supposed to be muddy

274
00:17:24.346 --> 00:17:25.746
because he ran through the underground passage,

275
00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:29.846
but the pedal of the bike was clean.

276
00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:32.946
Then, Mr. Sada removed that outfit

277
00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:35.446
and act as if nothing had happened.

278
00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:38.746
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten something very important!

279
00:17:38.746 --> 00:17:40.946
I heard Mr. Kataoka's scream

280
00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:45.446
and the sound of the ladder falling together with Ran and Conan.

281
00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:48.746
Are you referring to this?

282
00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:49.946
Officer Takagi!

283
00:17:49.946 --> 00:17:51.346
Yes, sir!

284
00:17:57.946 --> 00:18:01.946
No doubt about it. That's the voice and noise we heard!

285
00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:04.746
It was the sound from the stereo.

286
00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:08.146
Mr. Sada recorded Mr. Kataoka's voice

287
00:18:08.146 --> 00:18:11.246
and the sound of the ladder falling into a CD beforehand

288
00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:15.646
and used a timer to set it so that it would play

289
00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:17.646
at that time at top volume.

290
00:18:17.646 --> 00:18:22.946
But, Mr. Kataoka was still alive at the time.

291
00:18:22.946 --> 00:18:25.246
He is hidden in the shade of this statue.

292
00:18:25.246 --> 00:18:27.946
Don't tell me that it was when we went into the residence

293
00:18:27.946 --> 00:18:30.146
to look for Mr. Kataoka...

294
00:18:30.146 --> 00:18:35.146
Yes, Mr. Sada came to the backyard and killed Mr. Kataoka.

295
00:18:35.146 --> 00:18:39.246
Then he schemed a plan to deceive everyone.

296
00:18:39.246 --> 00:18:41.446
He also carried Mr. Kataoka's corpse

297
00:18:41.446 --> 00:18:42.746
because he wanted to deceive everyone

298
00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.446
about the blood that had splattered on his clothes.

299
00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:45.946
Isn't that right?

300
00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:52.746
Mr. Sada, your mistake is by setting the stereo volume too high.

301
00:18:52.746 --> 00:18:56.746
The sound was so loud that it reached us, who were at a distance,

302
00:18:56.746 --> 00:18:59.946
as well as Seiya who was listening to music using headphones.

303
00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:03.446
In fact, the voices of people are not audible at such distance.

304
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.346
But what are you trying to imply?

305
00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:08.546
That doesn't serve as proof.

306
00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:11.446
You are right. So, let me show you something now.

307
00:19:11.446 --> 00:19:15.346
A conclusive proof that you are the killer.

308
00:19:17.246 --> 00:19:19.746
After you had finished your act,

309
00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:23.546
I'm sure you had to hide your outfit

310
00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:25.746
somewhere at the crossroad with a bronze statue.

311
00:19:25.746 --> 00:19:29.546
In fact, a hidden hole was found in the pedestal of the statue,

312
00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:31.646
but it was empty.

313
00:19:31.646 --> 00:19:33.046
Of course.

314
00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:35.046
Yes, because that place was used only

315
00:19:35.046 --> 00:19:39.746
to hide something that you needed in order to hide your outfit.

316
00:19:39.746 --> 00:19:46.346
Back then, you hid your outfit in the thing you took out of the hole!

317
00:19:59.946 --> 00:20:02.446
Don't you think this ball is strange?

318
00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:06.746
It seems a bit too large and it's making a strange sound.

319
00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:13.646
This is...

320
00:20:15.946 --> 00:20:18.046
A piece of cracked marble.

321
00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:20.446
Although slight, there's blood on it.

322
00:20:20.446 --> 00:20:22.746
There's gray hair on the wig too.

323
00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:26.446
What is this, Mr. Sada?

324
00:20:28.446 --> 00:20:30.046
Back then,

325
00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:32.046
you took that ball out of the hole of the pedestal,

326
00:20:32.046 --> 00:20:35.046
hid the outfit in it

327
00:20:35.046 --> 00:20:38.346
and threw it in a blind spot from Ran and Conan.

328
00:20:38.346 --> 00:20:42.246
You were probably planning to retrieve it later.

329
00:20:42.246 --> 00:20:44.446
But, you miscalculated two things.

330
00:20:44.446 --> 00:20:50.346
The first was the stray cat rolled the ball somewhere.

331
00:20:50.346 --> 00:20:55.346
And the second was the chipped piece of the marbled nose

332
00:20:55.346 --> 00:21:00.046
that you had to hide was making strange noises from the ball.

333
00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:03.346
No, my biggest miscalculation was

334
00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.746
underestimating your deduction skills, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:21:06.746 --> 00:21:07.746
You mean...

336
00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:11.746
Yes, I'm the one who killed Mr. Kataoka.

337
00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:13.646
-But... -Why?

338
00:21:13.646 --> 00:21:16.746
I couldn't forgive him.

339
00:21:16.746 --> 00:21:20.246
He lived a capricious life

340
00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:25.346
as if he had forgotten all about his late wife.

341
00:21:25.346 --> 00:21:27.946
I felt sorry for his late wife.

342
00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:29.246
You're wrong.

343
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.446
What?

344
00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:35.646
The only things he loved were detectives and his late wife.

345
00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:39.446
Although it seemed he married me to get rid of his sadness,

346
00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:43.046
I couldn't fill his empty space no matter how much I tried.

347
00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:46.646
I only just realised the truth recently.

348
00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:50.646
That's why you took off your marriage ring.

349
00:21:50.646 --> 00:21:53.446
It was just an act of slight protest.

350
00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:57.446
But, he didn't even notice it.

351
00:21:58.446 --> 00:22:00.346
I see.

352
00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:03.746
Master did love his wife.

353
00:23:25.846 --> 00:23:27.046
"Mouri Detective Agency"

354
00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:31.646
So, is this the reward that Mr. Kataoka had ready?

355
00:23:32.646 --> 00:23:37.946
I guess he truly was a fool to make something like this!

356
00:23:37.946 --> 00:23:43.046
I just enjoyed taking on his challenges.

357
00:23:43.046 --> 00:23:45.446
Dad.

358
00:23:45.446 --> 00:23:48.446
So...

359
00:23:48.446 --> 00:23:50.746
What're you going to do with this?

360
00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:53.246
"Next Episode"

361
00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:56.046
Hey... Don't tell me...

362
00:23:56.046 --> 00:23:57.146
Conan?

363
00:24:00.546 --> 00:24:03.046
I told you, we came to get Conan's clothes,

364
00:24:03.046 --> 00:24:06.446
and found that Matsunosuke asleep!

365
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:08.946
Everybody's made a mistake.

366
00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:12.046
Even the witness and the murderer too.

367
00:24:12.046 --> 00:24:13.946
I see!

368
00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:16.446
I get the picture.

369
00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:17.946
Next Conan,

370
00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:19.946
"Promenade"

371
00:24:37.446 --> 00:24:39.746
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:42.046
"Walking the dog"

373
00:24:42.046 --> 00:24:44.646
-Hey, let's get a dog. -No, dad is a good enough guard dog already.

374
00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:46.946
-Woof! -Good boy... Get back in your kennel.
