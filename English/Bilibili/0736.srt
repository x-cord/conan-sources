1
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:08,824
Just as expected of a great detective,

2
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:12,724
"Eisuke Kataoka (54)" -figuring out the hide-out of Thief K!

3
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:15,724
So, you've finally appeared, Thief K!

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,524
"Makoto Sada (57)" -Master, it's dangerous!

5
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:20,024
Please come down!

6
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:21,724
Shut up, Sada!

7
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:24,724
Don't call me master! I'm Thief K!

8
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,324
Master!

9
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:31,524
That's the guy who invited us over for dinner, right?

10
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,224
What is this about?

11
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:36,124
You didn't know?

12
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:38,524
My father loves detectives so much.

13
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:44,424
"Seiya Kataoka (20)" -And Detective Mouri is his favourite detective.

14
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:46,024
Come to think of it,

15
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:49,424
-there was a statue of him. -This is cool!

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,124
That's why sometimes my father urges Detective Mouri to challenge him,

17
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:57,024
-pretending to be a thief. -Get down now, you thief!

18
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,824
What a weirdo.

19
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:02,724
Gosh.

20
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:07,824
"Yurie Kataoka (29)" -Men really are stupid creatures.

21
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:10,824
The time limit is 30 minutes!

22
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:13,424
Try and catch me!

23
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:18,024
If you manage to catch me before that grand clock strikes 6pm,

24
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:20,824
I shall give you a fantastic reward!

25
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:23,724
I wish you all good luck!

26
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:40,124
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

27
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:42,124
are slashed by the light of deduction.

28
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,024
A large premise full of tricks.

29
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,124
The shocking reason why Kogoro was targeted.

30
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:47,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:52,124
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:30,196
"The Secret of the Kogoro Mouri Statue"

34
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:37,196
As always, what a magnificent yard.

35
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:40,196
That's true. It looks like an entire town is included in the yard.

36
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:44,596
Actually, we call it a town instead of a yard.

37
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:47,396
It's great for playing hide-and-seek.

38
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,896
We've got him! That supposed to be a dead end!

39
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,496
Mr. Kataoka disappeared.

40
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,496
Impossible.

41
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:13,896
This is...

42
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,096
Did you figure something out, Conan?

43
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:22,996
Don't you think this clock is strange?

44
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,196
The position of the clock is too low

45
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:28,796
and the hour hand and the minute hand are both pointing at six.

46
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,196
That is strange, isn't it?

47
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,496
That makes sense.

48
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,796
Could it be...

49
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,896
You were right, this is the entrance to the underground passage!

50
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:48,896
It hurts...

51
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,496
Thief K!

52
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,796
Hold it!

53
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,696
-I'm sorry, dad. -I'll head over to the exit!

54
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:01,096
We can trap him in from both sides!

55
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:02,196
-Okay! -Okay!

56
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,896
These are...

57
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,896
These footprints in the mud are still new.

58
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,696
No doubt he went this way.

59
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,396
Ran, over there!

60
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,196
We found him!

61
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,796
Master, we got you!

62
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,796
I'm sorry, how awkward of me.

63
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,496
Hurry up and get down, then!

64
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,496
I'm sorry!

65
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,596
What? If we go this way...

66
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,596
Yes, it leads to the point where we started from,

67
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,596
the front of the residence.

68
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:01,096
It seems that he is heading to the backyard!

69
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,896
You two go around from that side!

70
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,796
We can trap him for sure this time.

71
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,396
Okay!

72
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,496
Gosh! This residence is too large!

73
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:19,496
He went to your way! Catch him!

74
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:27,796
Conan, let's go!

75
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:28,896
All right!

76
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,396
Watch out!

77
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:44,396
Isn't it against the rules to ride a bike?

78
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:45,796
Well, sort of...

79
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:54,796
This place is like a maze!

80
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,696
How can we tell where he went?

81
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,596
This way!

82
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,496
It hurts...

83
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,196
Are you all right?

84
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,396
Yes, I happened to bump into him all of a sudden,

85
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:14,096
I just tripped out of surprise.

86
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,596
Where is Mr. Kataoka?

87
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:18,696
He probably headed over to the main residence.

88
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,396
7 minutes to go.

89
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,896
Ma'am!

90
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,396
Did you hear that voice just now?

91
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,796
Yes! What happened?

92
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,096
I only just got here too!

93
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:34,696
Don't tell me that something happened to Mr. Kataoka!

94
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,696
Master!

95
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:43,796
Ran! What about over there?

96
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,496
No, nobody here either!

97
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:49,896
Gosh. Where on earth is he?

98
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,396
What happened?

99
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,496
I heard a loud noise.

100
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,796
Seiya, where were you all this time?

101
00:07:55,796 --> 00:08:00,396
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

102
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,496
Master!

103
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,596
Sada?

104
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,396
It's from the backyard!

105
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,796
Master, get a hold of yourself!

106
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:12,996
Master!

107
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:16,596
What's the matter? Did something happen?

108
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,896
Well...

109
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:26,896
Move!

110
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:31,196
This is bad. He's dead.

111
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,746
The deceased is the master of this residence,

112
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:52,546
a man of great wealth, Eisuke Kataoka, age 54.

113
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:55,546
There's been a great impact to his back.

114
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:58,546
The most severe wound was on the back of his head,

115
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,746
which we believe to be the fatal wound.

116
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:04,946
The time of his death can be determined to be 5:55pm.

117
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:11,746
Everyone here heard Mr. Kataoka's scream and the ladder falling.

118
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:15,946
Mr. Kataoka was in the middle of playing a game with all of you?

119
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,546
Yes, we were playing hide-and-seek.

120
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,246
We were chasing him.

121
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:23,146
What a thing to do at your age.

122
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,746
Well...

123
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,746
Was it an accident?

124
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:34,746
Yes. Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints were found on the ladder.

125
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:39,646
Mr. Kataoka probably lost his balance

126
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,046
when climbing the ladder and fell off.

127
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,446
I expect that's how it happened.

128
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,246
The bruise on his cheek

129
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:51,646
probably got there when he fell off the ladder too.

130
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,746
He asked for it!

131
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:57,346
It's because he never outgrew playing such a game.

132
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,246
She is Mr. Kataoka's wife.

133
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,746
It seems that he remarried three years ago

134
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:03,746
after his previous wife passed away.

135
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:09,546
What? You're not wearing your wedding ring, ma'am?

136
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:13,446
I haven't been wearing it for some time because it's too trouble.

137
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,446
But, why is there a trace of a ring...

138
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,146
Is he the son of the previous wife?

139
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,946
Yes. It seems that he had a grudge against Mr. Kataoka,

140
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:28,646
saying that his father's reckless ways killed his mother.

141
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,046
Well, it's a very appropriate way for him to die like this.

142
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,646
What?

143
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:36,046
Seiya, what happened to your hand?

144
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:40,246
What? Oh, I hurt it with a guitar string a while ago.

145
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,746
What? But back then, didn't he say...

146
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,046
What happened?

147
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,346
I heard a loud noise.

148
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,746
Seiya, where were you all this time?

149
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:52,746
What do you mean? I was listening to music in my room all this time.

150
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:59,446
I'm sorry for causing all of you trouble.

151
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,246
But I wonder if this is really an accident.

152
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,246
What?

153
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:07,246
Is anything bothering you, Mouri?

154
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,946
When Mr. Kataoka challenges me,

155
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:12,846
he always sets up a lot of tricks.

156
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:16,446
But all he did this time was run and flee.

157
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,646
Aren't you overthinking this?

158
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:22,646
He's an amateur, that would happen too.

159
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,046
Well, I guess so.

160
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,046
So, this really was an accident.

161
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,046
I guess so.

162
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:31,746
No, he is right.

163
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:34,746
There are several points that are strange to be an accident.

164
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:38,046
First, the corpse hadn't been sweating.

165
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,946
Despite the fact that he should've been running until just before he died.

166
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:43,446
Besides that...

167
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:51,346
Don't tell me this place...

168
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,746
If so... over there?

169
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:04,446
It should be somewhere around here.

170
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,346
As expected, this is...

171
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,146
What's with you?

172
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:16,046
Looking at me like you saw a monster or something.

173
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:18,746
Everyone's been shouting and looking for you!

174
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,646
What? Then why back then...

175
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:26,646
This is the favourite song of the late Mr. Kataoka.

176
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,346
I guess someone's playing it at the main residence

177
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,346
to mourn his death.

178
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:34,346
Pops, can you try moving this statue?

179
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:36,246
What? It's a statue.

180
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,746
What makes you think I can move it?

181
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:41,146
Don't you think there's something strange about this statue?

182
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:42,446
What?

183
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:45,346
Your mustache that's not supposed to be connected

184
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,746
is actually connected.

185
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,946
It looks like it's a fake.

186
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,646
What?

187
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,246
Is this it?

188
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,746
What? There's nothing here.

189
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,046
That sound...

190
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,046
I get it!

191
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:08,246
What?

192
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,246
Lend this to me for a while, okay?

193
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:18,046
I see, so that's what happened.

194
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,446
What?

195
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,446
What're you doing here, Conan?

196
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:27,046
Officer Takagi, Pops asked me to do this.

197
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:30,146
What? But Mr. Mouri's over there.

198
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,146
It's okay...

199
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,946
Pops! I brought everyone over just like you told me to.

200
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:41,246
What on earth is this about, Mouri?

201
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:43,246
I've finally figured it out.

202
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:47,646
The truth behind this murder disguised as an accident.

203
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:53,346
But the crime scene has all the signs of an accident!

204
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,746
Why do you think it was murder?

205
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:56,846
The bruise.

206
00:13:56,846 --> 00:14:00,046
The bruise? Do you mean the bruise on the corpse?

207
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:03,346
He got it when he fell off the ladder, isn't it?

208
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:05,646
That's what I thought at first.

209
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:09,446
But this statue helped me get at the truth.

210
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,346
Please take a good look.

211
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,246
Its nose is chipped, you see that?

212
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,746
It certainly is. But...

213
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,746
The nose is chipped not long ago.

214
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:22,246
It's as if something hit it with a lot of force recently.

215
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:23,446
It couldn't be...

216
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,346
Yes. Everything should come to light after re-investigation.

217
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:29,046
The bruise on the corpse's cheek

218
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:32,046
was made after it hit the nose of the statue.

219
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:34,546
But the corpse was found...

220
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:35,746
Yes.

221
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:39,346
If Mr. Kataoka really fell off the ladder,

222
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:43,046
he couldn't have hit this statue that is so far away.

223
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:47,746
Exactly. Mr. Kataoka didn't fall off the ladder.

224
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:52,446
First, he was struck and passed out by the killer here.

225
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:55,046
Then, he was carried over to the place where his body was found.

226
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:58,346
And the killer murdered him by hitting his head and body

227
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,546
against the stone paving.

228
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:04,546
After that, the killer put Mr. Kataoka's shoe prints on the ladder

229
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,946
and put the ladder beside the corpse

230
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:10,746
to make everyone believed that Mr. Kataoka fell off the ladder.

231
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,346
But who would do that?

232
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,046
There's something I'd like to confirm before that.

233
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,346
Officer Takagi!

234
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:23,246
Was the edge of Mr. Kataoka's cape torn?

235
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,246
No, it wasn't.

236
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:28,746
Don't you think it's strange, Ran?

237
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:29,746
I get it!

238
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,646
What do you mean?

239
00:15:31,646 --> 00:15:34,946
Mr. Kataoka's cape was supposed to be ripped!

240
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,046
Watch out!

241
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:45,446
But, the cape the corpse was wearing wasn't torn.

242
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,446
But why?

243
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
The answer is simple.

244
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,346
It's because the person you were going after wasn't Mr. Kataoka!

245
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,246
-What? -What?

246
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,846
Of course, the first Thief K that we were chasing was Mr. Kataoka.

247
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:03,446
But, someone took over his place part way,

248
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,846
the killer switched with Mr. Kataoka.

249
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:09,146
Isn't that right? The other Thief K,

250
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:12,946
as well as the one who killed Mr. Kataoka...

251
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:15,346
Mr. Makoto Sada!

252
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:21,646
But Mr. Sada was with us while chasing after Mr. Kataoka.

253
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,646
I don't think he had time to switch with Mr. Kataoka.

254
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:26,646
No, you weren't always with him.

255
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:28,946
There was one time you parted ways,

256
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,346
just before you came to this backyard.

257
00:16:32,546 --> 00:16:35,346
You two go around from that side!

258
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,046
We can trap him for sure this time.

259
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,746
Okay.

260
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:42,046
This was probably Mr. Kataoka's idea to begin with.

261
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:46,546
He probably had that switching plan for our game.

262
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:49,346
But, Mr. Sada's purpose

263
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:54,446
was to take advantage of this trick and kill Mr. Kataoka.

264
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,946
After watching Ran and Conan go off,

265
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,946
he took a short cut into the residence

266
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:02,446
and wore the outfit of Thief K that he had prepared beforehand,

267
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:08,046
then attacked Mr. Kataoka who was waiting for him from behind

268
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:10,246
and hid him in the shade of the statue.

269
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,446
After that, Mr. Sada appears before Ran and Conan as Thief K!

270
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:16,546
Then, the one we were chasing after...

271
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:19,746
It wasn't Mr. Kataoka but Mr. Sada.

272
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,046
I confirmed with the kid a while ago.

273
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:24,346
Thief K's shoes were supposed to be muddy

274
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,746
because he ran through the underground passage,

275
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:29,846
but the pedal of the bike was clean.

276
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,946
Then, Mr. Sada removed that outfit

277
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:35,446
and act as if nothing had happened.

278
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,746
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten something very important!

279
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,946
I heard Mr. Kataoka's scream

280
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:45,446
and the sound of the ladder falling together with Ran and Conan.

281
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:48,746
Are you referring to this?

282
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:49,946
Officer Takagi!

283
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,346
Yes, sir!

284
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:01,946
No doubt about it. That's the voice and noise we heard!

285
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,746
It was the sound from the stereo.

286
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:08,146
Mr. Sada recorded Mr. Kataoka's voice

287
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:11,246
and the sound of the ladder falling into a CD beforehand

288
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:15,646
and used a timer to set it so that it would play

289
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:17,646
at that time at top volume.

290
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:22,946
But, Mr. Kataoka was still alive at the time.

291
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,246
He is hidden in the shade of this statue.

292
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:27,946
Don't tell me that it was when we went into the residence

293
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:30,146
to look for Mr. Kataoka...

294
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:35,146
Yes, Mr. Sada came to the backyard and killed Mr. Kataoka.

295
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:39,246
Then he schemed a plan to deceive everyone.

296
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:41,446
He also carried Mr. Kataoka's corpse

297
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:42,746
because he wanted to deceive everyone

298
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,446
about the blood that had splattered on his clothes.

299
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,946
Isn't that right?

300
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:52,746
Mr. Sada, your mistake is by setting the stereo volume too high.

301
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:56,746
The sound was so loud that it reached us, who were at a distance,

302
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:59,946
as well as Seiya who was listening to music using headphones.

303
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:03,446
In fact, the voices of people are not audible at such distance.

304
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,346
But what are you trying to imply?

305
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,546
That doesn't serve as proof.

306
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:11,446
You are right. So, let me show you something now.

307
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:15,346
A conclusive proof that you are the killer.

308
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:19,746
After you had finished your act,

309
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:23,546
I'm sure you had to hide your outfit

310
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,746
somewhere at the crossroad with a bronze statue.

311
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:29,546
In fact, a hidden hole was found in the pedestal of the statue,

312
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,646
but it was empty.

313
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,046
Of course.

314
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,046
Yes, because that place was used only

315
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:39,746
to hide something that you needed in order to hide your outfit.

316
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:46,346
Back then, you hid your outfit in the thing you took out of the hole!

317
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:02,446
Don't you think this ball is strange?

318
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:06,746
It seems a bit too large and it's making a strange sound.

319
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,646
This is...

320
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:18,046
A piece of cracked marble.

321
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,446
Although slight, there's blood on it.

322
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:22,746
There's gray hair on the wig too.

323
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:26,446
What is this, Mr. Sada?

324
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,046
Back then,

325
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,046
you took that ball out of the hole of the pedestal,

326
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:35,046
hid the outfit in it

327
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:38,346
and threw it in a blind spot from Ran and Conan.

328
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:42,246
You were probably planning to retrieve it later.

329
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:44,446
But, you miscalculated two things.

330
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:50,346
The first was the stray cat rolled the ball somewhere.

331
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:55,346
And the second was the chipped piece of the marbled nose

332
00:20:55,346 --> 00:21:00,046
that you had to hide was making strange noises from the ball.

333
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:03,346
No, my biggest miscalculation was

334
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,746
underestimating your deduction skills, Mr. Mouri.

335
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:07,746
You mean...

336
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:11,746
Yes, I'm the one who killed Mr. Kataoka.

337
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:13,646
-But... -Why?

338
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:16,746
I couldn't forgive him.

339
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:20,246
He lived a capricious life

340
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:25,346
as if he had forgotten all about his late wife.

341
00:21:25,346 --> 00:21:27,946
I felt sorry for his late wife.

342
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,246
You're wrong.

343
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,446
What?

344
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:35,646
The only things he loved were detectives and his late wife.

345
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:39,446
Although it seemed he married me to get rid of his sadness,

346
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:43,046
I couldn't fill his empty space no matter how much I tried.

347
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:46,646
I only just realised the truth recently.

348
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:50,646
That's why you took off your marriage ring.

349
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:53,446
It was just an act of slight protest.

350
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:57,446
But, he didn't even notice it.

351
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,346
I see.

352
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:03,746
Master did love his wife.

353
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,046
"Mouri Detective Agency"

354
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:31,646
So, is this the reward that Mr. Kataoka had ready?

355
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:37,946
I guess he truly was a fool to make something like this!

356
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:43,046
I just enjoyed taking on his challenges.

357
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,446
Dad.

358
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,446
So...

359
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,746
What're you going to do with this?

360
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,246
"Next Episode"

361
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:56,046
Hey... Don't tell me...

362
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:57,146
Conan?

363
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:03,046
I told you, we came to get Conan's clothes,

364
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:06,446
and found that Matsunosuke asleep!

365
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,946
Everybody's made a mistake.

366
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:12,046
Even the witness and the murderer too.

367
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:13,946
I see!

368
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:16,446
I get the picture.

369
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,946
Next Conan,

370
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,946
"Promenade"

371
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,746
Next Conan's Hint:

372
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:42,046
"Walking the dog"

373
00:24:42,046 --> 00:24:44,646
-Hey, let's get a dog. -No, dad is a good enough guard dog already.

374
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:46,946
-Woof! -Good boy... Get back in your kennel.
