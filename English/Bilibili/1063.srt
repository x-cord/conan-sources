00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,208
We received a request

00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,050
( Hitoshi Nanba (45) )
from national champion chick appraiser,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,850
( Hitoshi Nanba (45) )
Hitoshi Nanba,

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:17,410
and arrived here
at Kusano Chicken Eggs' factory.

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,420
You're moving at incredible speed.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,223
I observe the tiny details
in a chick's bottom

8
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,025
and determine whether it's male or female.

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:31,331
So, what business does
a chick appraiser like you have with me?

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,800
To tell the truth,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,003
it seems that my life is in danger.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,509
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,310
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,312
Every second counts for
the appraiser's skilled hands.

15
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,415
Every moment matters
when a life is in danger.

16
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,116
He sees through the one and only truth.

"The Chick Appraiser In Danger"

20
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,930
In the last few weeks,

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,833
strange things keep happening around me.

22
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,604
A rubber shot flew towards me
when I was walking outdoors.

23
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,009
My hand was burned with
a magnifying glass or something

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,810
while I was asleep.

25
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,612
And I left my phone somewhere,

26
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,714
only to find it exploding all of a sudden.

27
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,017
A rubber shot...

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,818
A magnifying glass...

29
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,421
And an exploding phone?

30
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,724
Detective Mouri, I would like for you
to be my bodyguard

31
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,827
while investigating
the cause of these incidents.

32
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,931
Do you have an idea
why your life is in danger?

33
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,933
No, I don't.

34
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,403
But that's why I wanted you
to investigate first.

35
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,106
(President's Office)
A grudge?

36
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,211
( Saburo Kusano (61) )
Nanba is the star of our industry.

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,813
He has an excellent reputation
and a great personality,

38
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,416
so I can't imagine his life being in danger.

39
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,919
Could someone have
an unjustified grudge against him?

40
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,624
No. I've never heard of such a thing.

41
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,126
Someone has a grudge against Nanba?

42
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,460
I don't know about that.

43
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,900
( Takashi Nakamura (29) )
But I can't exactly comment
if he's someone to be respected.

44
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
But I can't exactly comment
if he's someone to be respected.

45
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,202
He seems to be a good guy on the outside.

46
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,805
You're also an appraiser, right?

47
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,306
Yes. But to be honest,

48
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,209
I'm looking to take his place.

49
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:10,717
Nanba? He's a great guy.

50
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,190
( Mamiko Hirasawa (22)
At the very least, he's always nice to me.

51
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:20,709
But I only started working here recently.

52
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,329
So, you're a new employee.

53
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,031
What made you decide to work here?

54
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,701
I wanted to become
a chick appraiser myself.

55
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:33,806
The way he handles the chicks so skillfully
is just so cool.

56
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,110
Did you start working for this company

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,411
because you admired Mr. Nanba,
Miss Hirasawa?

58
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,513
That's right.

59
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,015
Uncle Kogoro.

60
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,019
Shouldn't we ask
people outside the company, too?

61
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,220
What?

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,522
Well, you may be right.

63
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,726
In that case, someone else is here to
interview the company.

64
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,031
So, you're that famous detective.

65
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,801
I work for a magazine called
Monthly Chick Appraiser World.

66
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,904
I do the reporting, camera work,
and all sorts of errands.

67
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,507
( Kazumasa Kitazawa (29) )
My name's Kazumasa Kitazawa.

68
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,208
Pleased to meet you.

69
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,711
Thank you. Let's get right to it.

70
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:16,516
Do you have an idea of who
would have a grudge against Nanba?

71
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,817
I'm not sure.

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,821
It's not like he and I are close friends.

73
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,624
I heard that Mr. Nanba is a champion.

74
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,527
Is he such an amazing person?

75
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,929
Well, it's not like he's bad at it,

76
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,200
but he doesn't compare to Master Okabe
in his heyday.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,802
Master Okabe?

78
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,305
You don't know Master Yuji Okabe?

79
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,109
( Yuji Okabe (52) )
He won the national competition seven years running.

80
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,111
( Yuji Okabe (52) )
He didn't make any mistakes four years in a row

81
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,213
and had broken records in no time.

82
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,916
Those were some intense years.

83
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,360
I see.

84
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,720
Detective Mouri!

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,621
So this is where you are.

86
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,325
Let's go. I've been asked to
lecture this afternoon.

87
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,326
Lecture?

88
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,728
(Lecture: On the Future of Chick Appraisers
by Hitoshi Nanba)

89
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,396
(Lecture: On the Future of Chick Appraisers
by Hitoshi Nanba)
There are a few ways to tell chicks apart,

90
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,131
(Lecture: On the Future of Chick Appraisers
by Hitoshi Nanba)
There are a few ways to tell chicks apart,

91
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,401
but the method of
observing the anus originated in Japan.

92
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,204
Because it demands delicate handling,

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,605
it can be said that

94
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,307
it suits the Japanese
since we have smaller hands.

95
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,809
It's quite a profound field, isn't it?

96
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,111
Yes.

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,914
I have added
an original method to the technique,

98
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,618
which improves the speed
while preserving accuracy.

99
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,721
The technique is...

100
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,822
Look out!

101
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,209
What was in that liquid?

102
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,211
According to forensic analysis,

103
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,614
it was a chlorine-based cleaning agent.

104
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,616
It could cause blindness
if it enters the eyes,

105
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:01,220
and there's a danger of serious chemical burns
if it gets on the skin.

106
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,826
Getting doused in cleaning agents
isn't exactly deadly,

107
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,929
but this proves that you're being harassed.

108
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,531
It seems to be the case.

109
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,705
Anyway, I hope you will investigate the matter.

110
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:24,010
I'll be returning to my workstation, so this is goodbye for now.

111
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,912
Okay.

112
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,915
I told him that I'd listen, so I did.

113
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,416
Detective Mouri!

114
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,120
This may seem sudden,
but I just found out something new.

115
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,123
(Kusano Chicken Eggs)
I'll provide the information for free,

116
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,324
(Kusano Chicken Eggs)
but I'd like to ask for an exclusive interview

117
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,827
(Kusano Chicken Eggs)
after the case is solved.

118
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,050
Sure thing.

119
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,132
The information is about none other than

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,503
Mr. Nanba and Mr. Kusano's
financial troubles.

121
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,907
Mr. Nanba helped improve
the company's performance

122
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,810
by appearing on billboards,

123
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,515
so he's been pressing Mr. Kusano
for half of the profits.

124
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,718
Wouldn't he be fired
if he asked for that?

125
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,421
But he hasn't been fired because...

126
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,423
It's probably because
what Mr. Nanba is saying

127
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,126
isn't entirely wrong.

128
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,331
Well then, let's find out for ourselves.

129
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,402
Well, of course, I don't agree.

130
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,105
We're currently negotiating terms

131
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,207
that both of us will find agreeable.

132
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:33,582
So it's true, then,
that he asked for half of the profits.

133
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,582
Well...

134
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:40,019
Financial trouble would make a good motive
for targeting Mr. Nanba.

135
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,722
How rude! I would never...

136
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,925
Then, why didn't you fire Nanba

137
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,227
even though he made
such a threatening demand?

138
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,129
That's because...

139
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,932
Could it be because he has something on you...

140
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,500
Leave me alone!

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,904
We have our own way of doing things here!

142
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,605
Just leave already!

143
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,350
Miss Hirasawa!

144
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,618
You're an accountant here, right?

145
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,520
Yes, I am.

146
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,622
Is this company a good one to work for?

147
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,224
Of course!

148
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,725
I see.

149
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,930
By the way, do you think
Master Okabe is number one too?

150
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,231
Sorry?

151
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,502
You see, I don't know much about
what happened back then.

152
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,508
Kusano Chicken Eggs
was established 24 years ago.

153
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,611
Six years ago, Hitoshi Nanba appeared
on the company's billboards,

154
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,814
and the company gradually
saw increased performance.

155
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,418
Saburo Kusano, the company's president and CEO.

156
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,819
He has been involved in
the chicken egg industry

157
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,200
since graduating from university.

158
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,080
He founded Kusano Chicken Eggs

159
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,626
after resigning from Miura Foods.

160
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,820
He's on the judging committee for
the national competition?

161
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,333
Isn't this...

162
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,104
What are you doing here?

163
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,606
Detective Mouri has been looking for you

164
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,308
because he hasn't seen you around.

165
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,210
Mr. Nakamura.

166
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,714
In all the competitions
that Mr. Nanba has been in,

167
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,217
was there any that you thought was unusual?

168
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,119
A competition I thought was unusual?

169
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,220
Yes.

170
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,522
Come to think of it...

171
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,125
I didn't think anything was unusual
with Mr. Nanba himself,

172
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,927
but there was one.

173
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,329
It was at the national competition
seven years ago.

174
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,840
That was the one he won
and became champion.

175
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,601
The battle was decided

176
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,004
when the previous champion self-destructed.

177
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,606
I thought it would be
more of a close contest,

178
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,809
but a new champion was quickly crowned.

179
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,013
By the way, what was
the name of the previous champion?

180
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,914
You don't know?

181
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,916
It was Master Yuji Okabe.

182
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,750
He's a legend in the world of chicken eggs.

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,621
Is something the matter?

184
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,425
Is it possible for me to watch the battle?

185
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,427
(Kusano Chicken Eggs)

186
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,030
I see.

187
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,532
(Yuji Okabe, Hitoshi Nanba)
This was certainly a strange battle.

188
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,701
(Chick Appraiser World, Special Issue)

189
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,804
Hello, is this Officer Takagi?

190
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,507
There's something I need you to investigate.

191
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,511
Is that so?

192
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,314
I see.

193
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,620
All right. Thanks.

194
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,323
So that's how it is.

195
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,327
I'm starting to see the whole picture.

196
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,504
This is the recording of
the National Chick Sorting Competition

197
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,108
that was held seven years ago.

198
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:53,813
The finals put Master Okabe,
the defending champion,

199
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,117
against up-and-coming Hitoshi Nanba.

200
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,022
Let's have a fair match.

201
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,026
I heard you're rather talented.

202
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,127
Well, then...

203
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,629
The two gentlemen will now battle to see

204
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,432
who can sort 100 chicks faster
and more precisely than the other.

205
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,501
That's Mr. Kusano!

206
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,403
What's going on?

207
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,904
The adjudicator and the contestant

208
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,407
are now working in the same company.

209
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,309
Don't you think it's too good to be true?

210
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,311
We shall now begin

211
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,414
the final of
the National Chick Sorting Competition.

212
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,416
Ready... Go!

213
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,619
Everyone expected

214
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,223
Master Okabe to
have an overwhelming advantage.

215
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,627
I will now announce the results.

216
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,131
Mr. Nanba measured 4 minutes and 50 seconds

217
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,000
with an accuracy of 100%.

218
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,405
Mr. Okabe measured 4 minutes and 36 seconds

219
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,409
with an accuracy of 83%.

220
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,112
The result was
an overwhelming victory for Mr. Nanba.

221
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,515
The winner is Mr. Nanba!

222
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,519
Give a round of applause for the new champion!

223
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,920
Hold on a second!

224
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,922
There must be something wrong!

225
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,223
He...

226
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,828
If the referee was on his side,

227
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,031
he wouldn't lose no matter who he was up against.

228
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:24,203
Assuming that is the case,
Master Okabe would have a motive.

229
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,605
But why would he wait seven years?

230
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,708
No, that wouldn't have been possible.

231
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,811
Master Okabe made a fuss

232
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,114
about the unfair judging
after the competition,

233
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,217
but instead, it made him unpopular
among the public

234
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,520
and he was forced to
exit from centre stage.

235
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,625
He committed suicide six months later.

236
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,027
No way.

237
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,930
In that case, that leaves us back at square one.

238
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,530
I don't think that's true.

239
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:58,304
Don't we have someone
who's been lying to us all this time?

240
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,805
Lying?

241
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,507
Do you mean Mr. Kusano?

242
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,309
That's not it.

243
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,911
What are you talking about?

244
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,816
When people lie,
they're usually under intense stress.

245
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,300
(Cross their arms)
They tend to make unconscious gestures or defensive poses

246
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,020
(Look away)
They tend to make unconscious gestures or defensive poses

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,770
(Cross their legs again)
that can signal the fact they're lying.

248
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,926
Defensive poses?

249
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,431
That's what Shinichi told me not long ago.

250
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,900
He did?

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,202
That's why I checked.

252
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,806
There's someone here
who tends to hide her weak point,

253
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,308
which is her throat, when she lies.

254
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,818
That's right. The culprit is...

255
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,524
Mamiko Hirasawa.

256
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,529
The number you are trying to call
is out of range...

257
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,731
Darn it.

258
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,733
I can't reach his phone.

259
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,302
He should still be around here.

260
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,504
Let's search the area.

261
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,605
Conan!

262
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,322
You will pay for what you've done.

263
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,826
Dad, isn't this Mr. Nanba's phone?

264
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,828
This is bad.

265
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,832
I found it
in an inconspicuous patch of grass over there.

266
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,703
I think we can assume
that Miss Hirasawa took him away somewhere.

267
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,605
But where could they be?

268
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,907
We won't find him
if we look for him randomly.

269
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,511
Let's call the police
and have them search for the car.

270
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,015
But wouldn't that take a lot of time?

271
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,718
What do you say we do instead?

272
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,022
I wonder
what Miss Hirasawa wants to do to Mr. Nanba.

273
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,627
Since she went all the way to kidnap him,

274
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,531
she would've taken him somewhere
people won't see them.

275
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:10,350
She did say she started working
at the company recently.

276
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,205
If she's unfamiliar with the area,

277
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,630
she should've taken him somewhere
he has a connection with.

278
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,811
And that means...

279
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,018
I think I've got it after listening to
your deduction, Uncle Kogoro!

280
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,019
What is it?

281
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,821
Maybe it's this place.

282
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,150
This must be it.

283
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,030
This was where it all started.

284
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,005
This was where the final of
the National Chick Sorting Competition

285
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,008
took place seven years ago.

286
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,515
Stop!

287
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,220
Stop it, Hirasawa!

288
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,123
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge!

289
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,164
I wouldn't take a step closer if I were you.

290
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:09,164
As expected of a famous detective.

291
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:12,836
How did you figure out I would be here?

292
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:15,358
Why? Well...

293
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,164
If you had to ask me why...

294
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:21,358
- Dad?
- Why?

295
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:27,012
It's because this was where it all began,

296
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,516
and where your father chose to die.

297
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,822
Your life was ruined by that man.

298
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,024
Your father fell into his trap

299
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,926
and killed himself out of despair.

300
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,530
It seems that you were put
in an orphanage after that.

301
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,101
That's right. Your family name
was originally Okabe.

302
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,104
You were Master Yuji Okabe's beloved daughter.

303
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,908
How did you figure it out?

304
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,109
I suspected it

305
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,412
from the way you talked about
a chick appraiser's hands.

306
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,614
From your expression,

307
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,919
I thought you must've been involved with
a chick appraiser in some way.

308
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,622
I also observed that
one of your hands was injured.

309
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,627
I saw a tub of hand cream
and a steroidal ointment on your desk.

310
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,329
There was also that attack

311
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,032
with the chlorine-based cleaning agent
not long afterwards.

312
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,801
My hand?

313
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,004
That's right.
There was also the lie you told us.

314
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,509
You clearly held Nanba in disgust.

315
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,314
Not only that, you lied about
not knowing about your father.

316
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,116
The gesture you made while lying

317
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,319
was exactly the same as his.

318
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,322
That was why I had someone look into it.

319
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,924
After being taken in by an orphanage,

320
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,627
you were adopted by the Hirasawa family.

321
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,932
But why did you have to work for
the same company as Mr. Nanba?

322
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,603
It's because you wanted to confirm the fact

323
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,305
that Nanba won the competition
in a fixed match.

324
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,007
Am I wrong?

325
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,410
That's right. We went out for a meal together.

326
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,215
And the moment he was given a chance to drink,

327
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,719
I didn't even have to ask for him
to blab on and on about it.

328
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,020
Is that why...

329
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,923
Were you going to say
that I wanted to kill him?

330
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:22,227
No, you aren't planning to kill him.

331
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,730
Everything you did from the rubber shot

332
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,332
and the magnifying glass

333
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,202
to tampering with his phone

334
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,704
and attempting to douse him
in cleaning agents...

335
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:36,909
It was all so that you could harm his hands.

336
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,810
But why would you do that?

337
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,313
For a chick appraiser,
hands are one's lifeblood.

338
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,814
The job demands a delicate touch

339
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,218
and subtle movement of the fingers.

340
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,519
If one were to hurt his arms

341
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,821
in a way that leaves any lingering effects,

342
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,025
life as a chick appraiser might as well be over.

343
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,426
No way.

344
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,727
That's right!

345
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,031
I want to steal everything he has,

346
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,000
just as he stole everything my father had!

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,201
Just stop!

348
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,205
I'm sure your father wouldn't be happy
with what you're doing!

349
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,708
If you analyse the recording of
the final competition,

350
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,412
it's obvious
that Nanba and Mr. Kusano are guilty.

351
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,114
I can guarantee it.

352
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,517
Still, it's too late now.

353
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,518
It's not too late!

354
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,919
Leave me alone!

355
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,723
He should be punished for what he did!

356
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,224
Stop it!

357
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,828
Didn't you want to be
a chick appraiser as well?

358
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:35,500
An excellent chick appraiser,
just like your father.

359
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,803
Up you go!

360
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,807
Daddy, your hands are so nice.

361
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,309
Your hands are nice too, Mamiko.

362
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,413
So, I'm sure you'll be a chick appraiser
when you grow up.

363
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,116
Yes! I want to be a chick appraiser, too.

364
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,918
The best one in Japan?

365
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,820
No, I want to be the best in the world.

366
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,723
Then, I want to be the best
in the whole universe!

367
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,930
Dad...

368
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,650
Police soon came and took Hirasawa away.

369
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,319
Nanba and Kusano's wrongdoings
were brought to light

370
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,310
with help from Nakamura and Kitazawa.

371
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,228
Nanba was stripped of his title
and his appraisal permit

372
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,530
while Kusano was removed from
his position as company president.

373
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,401
And as a result of
the two exposing each other's wrongdoings,

374
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,002
they were both arrested on suspicion of

375
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,605
corporate embezzlement and tax evasion.

376
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,922
Are we meeting
a guinea pig appraiser this time?

377
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,725
I've never heard of one before.

378
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,370
Are you sure
it's not a request from a caretaker?

379
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,731
It's a request to find a guinea pig

380
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,230
that has snuck in among all these guinea pigs.

381
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,003
Its name is Mofuo.

382
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,505
We have to find it...

383
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,806
Among all these guinea pigs?

384
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,310
Hold on!

385
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,114
Hey, let's all become
excellent guinea pig appraisers!

386
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,116
Hey!

387
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,018
We can do it if we all work together.

388
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,921
Don't leave me alone here!

389
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,022
Hey!

390
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,125
(Next Episode)

391
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,828
This is Joji Kazama.

392
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:54,080
We met at a date party,
and he's my boyfriend now.

393
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,102
Just give it up already.

394
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,103
Sorry?

395
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,406
He's definitely dating you for the money.

396
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,209
I'm Yuki, his daughter.

397
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,212
I'm sure you found my father a scary man.

398
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:15,020
Next Conan,
"The Dreaming Lady And The Last Love"

399
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,604
Next Conan's Hint:

400
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,900
"A limousine"

401
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,908
Did you find Mofuo?

402
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,109
If I sleep, then maybe...

403
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,411
You know you can't find it
if you fall asleep.
