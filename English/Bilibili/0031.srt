1
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:06,503
Difficult cases increase
in number as time progresses.

2
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:09,513
High school student Shinichi
took a drug that shrunk him

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:11,013
and became Conan Edogawa!

4
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:14,013
Today's stage is a TV station!
Be wary of live broadcasts!

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,023
He looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:18,063
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,078
The TV Station Murder Case.

8
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:01,548
Nichiuri TV

9
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:04,518
Nichiuri TV
programming department.

10
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:06,428
One moment, please.

11
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:08,268
Hey, Suwa-chan!

12
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,228
Call on Line 4
from Matsuo Takashi-san.

13
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,428
What do want?
I already told you no.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,818
The announcement's
gonna be next week.

15
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:22,818
No, I have this idea
for a show I want you to hear...

16
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:24,808
I was hoping we could meet alone

17
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:27,888
in the usual room when
tomorrow's live show is over.

18
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:31,748
It'd really help me if you could
drive people away right after it's done.

19
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:34,598
Ugh. All right.

20
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:35,958
This is the last time.

21
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:40,598
Detective Station

22
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,228
You're right, Suwa-chan.
Detective Station

23
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,338
Detective Station

24
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,158
This really will be--

25
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:47,718
--the last time!

26
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:01,948
Welcome to this week's edition of
"Japanese See-All Detective Station"!

27
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:05,468
I'm your host, Matsuo Takashi,

28
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:08,908
and I'm his assistant, Nagai Ayako!

29
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:13,828
Our staff sorts through
all your rare and difficult cases

30
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,928
for us to solve on air!

31
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:19,258
Today, we welcome
a very reassuring guest:

32
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:23,178
the great detective,
Mori Kogoro-san!

33
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:25,468
Thank you! Thank you!

34
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:31,428
Tell us, what was the most difficult
case that you've ever worked on?

35
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:37,268
Actually, whenever I'm done solving a case
I'm always overcome with drowsiness...

36
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,648
...so I never remember a thing!

37
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:42,988
Dad's such a clown!

38
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,198
Naturally.
He really does go to sleep.

39
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,158
Alright! Commercial!

40
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:51,768
Ow...

41
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,038
Is something wrong?

42
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:56,138
My stomach's been hurting
since this morning...

43
00:03:56,138 --> 00:04:00,638
Say. Could you tell me
where Suwa-chan is?

44
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:01,758
Of course!

45
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:04,718
Yeah, I'm in the
4th-floor meeting room.

46
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,268
Don't worry.

47
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:08,808
I'm checking the show out
on the monitor.

48
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,178
Oh, and tell Matsuo-kun
something for me.

49
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,178
Tell him to come here
right after the show.

50
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:18,608
I used to be a police detective,
but I'm not very good with guns...

51
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:21,598
Aren't guns your specialty,
Matsuo-san?

52
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,518
Didn't you train overseas
and become a pro?

53
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,928
No, I'm not that good...

54
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:28,068
...I'm great!

55
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:32,808
His character is funny
and he draws in steady numbers,

56
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:35,138
but only so much.

57
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:38,078
If I switched the host
to the prettiest newscaster

58
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:43,138
and included lots of naughty segments,
the ratings would double! No, triple!

59
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:45,258
I'd eventually be promoted--

60
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:47,468
--to department head!

61
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:50,268
Eavesdropping is a hot topic lately!

62
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,928
It's not strange for bugs
to be planted anytime, anywhere.

63
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,768
That's why I switched to a cell phone!

64
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:00,818
That shows what you know.

65
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:04,968
Analog cell phones
transmit electronic signals,

66
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:08,568
so you don't even need bugs
to listen in on conversations!

67
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,778
Wow, he actually knows something!

68
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,618
Therefore--

69
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:19,538
Oh, Izumi-chan!
It's me, Kogoro-chan!

70
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:22,998
Would you like to have dinner tonight?!

71
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,308
My wife?

72
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,808
It's alright!
We don't live together!

73
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:29,928
Let's have a passionate
night tonight!

74
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,008
--such dangerous conversations
can be easily listened to.

75
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:37,388
Attention, all adulterers!

76
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,688
Make sure you don't
let your guard down!

77
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:44,268
Now for the next segment
of our show, "You Did It!"

78
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,058
We're going to play
a four-minute video clip,

79
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,158
and it's up to you
to determine the culprit!

80
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:54,118
My name is Kirishima Joji.
I'm a private eye.

81
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:57,828
I can't believe he spent money
on this lousy clip...

82
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:03,848
Yeah?

83
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,638
It's me, Suwa-chan.

84
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,768
Matsuo-kun?! What're you doing?!

85
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,268
The show's still on!

86
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,768
I wanted you to hear my last words!

87
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,638
Last? What do you mean?

88
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:17,768
I'm going to die.
I'm going to jump off the roof!

89
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,888
What?!

90
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:21,558
Have a good look at my death!

91
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:24,018
O-Okay! I'll do something
about your host job!

92
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,768
Just don't be rash!

93
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:28,238
It's too late.

94
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:34,408
So, do you know who did it?

95
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:37,808
This drama is excellent, as always!

96
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:40,328
Do you think them up each time?

97
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:41,928
Yeah...

98
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,128
Why are you sweating?

99
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:48,098
It's my stomach today...

100
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,088
The clip's about to end!

101
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,138
I wonder who did it?!

102
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:54,048
The victim's sister.

103
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,308
So who did it?

104
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,018
The victim's sister!

105
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,268
Really?!

106
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,138
Did you know, Conan-kun?

107
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,978
I had no idea who it was!

108
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,648
See you again next week!

109
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,268
Your frankness
really saved the day!

110
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,368
Matsuo-san! Suwa-chan
seems to have disappeared!

111
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:25,458
He isn't answering the meeting
room phone or his cell phone!

112
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:29,388
What's gotten into him?
Go and see if he's there.

113
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:30,298
Yeah.

114
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:34,468
Eh? Why the meeting room
and not somewhere else?

115
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:39,678
Suwa-san! Are you in there?!

116
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:40,518
Suwa-sa--

117
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,938
What?! He's covered in blood?!

118
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:46,518
Alright! I'll be there right away!

119
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,318
The elevator's in use!
Let's take the stairs!

120
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,038
These stairs end at the 7th floor!

121
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,038
This way! Hurry!

122
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,328
It's like a maze!

123
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:10,958
Move, please!

124
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:23,918
It was him!

125
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:32,738
The victim is this TV station's producer,
Mr. Suwa Michihiko, 37 years old.

126
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,568
The murder weapon was a handgun.

127
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:37,968
The bullet pierced his head,
shattered the glass,

128
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,388
and exited outside...

129
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:42,288
Inspector. There are other
bullet holes in the wall.

130
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,868
Two behind this poster,

131
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:47,038
and one by the clock.

132
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:49,998
Inspector.
I found shells in the corner.

133
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,708
Four in all.

134
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,378
That matches the number
of bullet holes.

135
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:57,598
And there's only one way
in and out of here.

136
00:08:57,598 --> 00:09:00,638
Which means it's simple.

137
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:03,968
The killer most likely
barged in through the entrance

138
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,598
drove the victim to the window,

139
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,478
then shot wildly
and killed Suwa-san.

140
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,478
The killer tossed the gun
by his feet and escaped.

141
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,518
Has anybody seen someone
who might be the killer?

142
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:20,308
Suwa-san drove
everyone out, so...

143
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,968
He drove everyone out?

144
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:23,618
He was waiting for me.

145
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:28,078
He said he had something important
to discuss after the show.

146
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:30,268
No eyewitnesses, huh...

147
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,878
But someone might've heard!

148
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,468
See! It looks like
he was on his cell phone!

149
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:39,928
If so, then the other person
might've heard something!

150
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,888
Right, old man?

151
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,388
Yeah...

152
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:44,888
You're right...

153
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:48,888
Okay! Figure out who he knows
and who he talked to!

154
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,808
Yes, sir!

155
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,018
Matsuo-san!

156
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,468
Matsuo-san! What are your
thoughts on this?!

157
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,988
Rumor has it you were
going to be replaced as host!

158
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,388
Could one of your fans
have done this--

159
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:02,408
Stop it!

160
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:07,558
Yes, there was talk
of me being replaced.

161
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:12,538
But Suwa-san said he wanted me
to remain the host!

162
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:14,888
But I will say this now!

163
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:17,798
I will carry on Suwa-san's
wishes and continue hosting!

164
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:22,928
And I'll put this case on the show
and work my hardest to find the killer!

165
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:26,028
I won't stop until I find the
monster that killed Suwa-san!

166
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:30,018
Oh? You called Suwa-san?

167
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:33,768
Yes. He picked up
when I called at 8:15,

168
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:36,778
but there was no answer
when I called at 8:55.

169
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:41,218
So the murder took place
within that 40-minute period...

170
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:42,988
But why did you call him?

171
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:46,908
I asked him to find out
where Suwa-san was.

172
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:52,288
I was on the air and I didn't
know his cell phone number...

173
00:10:52,288 --> 00:10:57,378
That reminds me, I hear you're
well-trained with handguns...

174
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,888
You think I did it?!

175
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:03,338
I was hosting a live
TV show from 8:00 to 9:00!

176
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,678
So you had no chance to slip out...

177
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:11,268
No, there was a 4-minute
video clip during the show.

178
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,808
During those four minutes--

179
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:16,518
Yes, I did leave the studio,
but I went to the restroom!

180
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:22,138
Are you sure you didn't take a gun
and come into this room instead?!

181
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:26,068
Come on, now!
If you think I'm lying,

182
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:31,098
then try running from the studio
to this 4th-floor room and back!

183
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,668
It would take at least six minutes!

184
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,588
I mean, I think it would...

185
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:41,628
Alright, Mori-kun. Give it a run.

186
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,838
Me?!

187
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,468
Why do I have to do this?!

188
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:55,808
Six minutes,
forty-seven seconds.

189
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:58,268
Can't you run
any faster than that?

190
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:02,028
No! My heart's about to explode!

191
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:02,928
Inspector!

192
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:07,738
We checked the security tapes but
we didn't see Matsuo-san on them.

193
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,698
It would seem my
innocence is clear now.

194
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:15,098
No! Matsuo-san is the killer!

195
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:19,958
But how did he go to that room
and back in four minutes?

196
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,678
Ran-neechan!

197
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:24,088
Where did you go?
I was looking all over for you!

198
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,638
I was with the old man
the whole time.

199
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,548
Where did you go?

200
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:31,638
Don't tell me you got lost...

201
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,638
I guess you could say that.

202
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:38,728
It's like a maze in here...

203
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:43,938
TV stations are built all complex-like
to prevent guerrilla takeovers.

204
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,278
You certainly know a lot...

205
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,678
A TV station person
told me earlier!

206
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,768
Yes, it is a maze!

207
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:57,428
But there has to be
a shortcut hidden within it!

208
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,598
A secret path that takes you from
the studio to that room and back

209
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,468
in under four minutes!

210
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:07,678
Oh? There aren't any
downward stairs here!

211
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,158
Only the stairs
from the 9th to the 7th floor

212
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:13,638
can be used to avoid
the security cameras.

213
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,958
It would be possible to make it
here and back in two minutes...

214
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:19,468
A storage room...

215
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:25,488
Wait, Conan-kun!

216
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,828
This window's right above that
room!

217
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:35,928
That's it! Rope!

218
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,268
If you used rope to rappel down!

219
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:42,308
No. If the killer
entered through the window,

220
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:45,348
the victim would have been
driven to the door.

221
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:48,548
But the victim was driven
to the window.

222
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:49,798
Huh?

223
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,758
That blood splatter...

224
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,178
It stops at the window's edge!

225
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:58,228
And there's no blood
on the window frame!

226
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:01,768
Have you still not found
who the victim was talking to?!

227
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:02,938
No, sir...

228
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:06,888
What?! It's been an hour
since the incident!

229
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,928
Which means there's only
one possibility I can think of...

230
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:11,868
The person on the
phone was the killer!

231
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:17,408
But why would the culprit call the person
he was looking at and about to kill?!

232
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:19,118
What if--

233
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:20,578
Conan-kun!

234
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,888
Here it is!

235
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,928
The fact that this is here
means there's no doubt about it!

236
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:40,808
That's where the secret path is!

237
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:48,358
But I still have no proof!

238
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:52,028
Clear proof that
Matsuo-san was the killer!

239
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:56,868
Whoops, I left my cell phone on...

240
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,428
Hello? Oh, hi.

241
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:03,708
Aha! There's the definitive proof

242
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,958
that you're the killer!

243
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,278
Come on, hurry up!

244
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,568
Who's in there?!

245
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:24,278
Your favorite idol, Okino--

246
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,738
Yoko-chan?!

247
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:31,578
Hey, now.
Is Yoko-chan really in here?

248
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,718
Alright! Now to--

249
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,648
I don't know what to say!

250
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,758
These things don't do the job!

251
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,098
Mister!

252
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:51,308
Could I borrow that
paint gun and TV camera?

253
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:54,098
Eh? What for, little boy?

254
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:58,908
The live broadcast of "Mori Kogoro's
Real-Life Detective Show!"

255
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,778
Excuse me, Inspector.

256
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,488
Might I be allowed to leave?

257
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:05,698
Yeah... You can go for today--

258
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,568
Not so fast, Matsuo-san!

259
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,528
I must ask you to remain there.

260
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:12,158
Mori-kun?!

261
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:15,818
I wouldn't want
the criminal to leave

262
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,248
when the detective show's
just about to begin...

263
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:22,008
And that criminal is you,
Matsuo-san!

264
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:24,198
How can that be, Mori-kun?!

265
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,718
Inspector!

266
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,138
Detective Mori asked
for an AV feed from in here...

267
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,888
Eh?! Just a second!

268
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,488
I'm a bit fat!

269
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:34,558
There! All set!

270
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,198
Think carefully, Mori-kun!

271
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:42,778
The culprit fired wildly in this 4th-floor
room and killed the victim!

272
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,238
But Matsuo-san was hosting
a live television show

273
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,738
in the 9th-floor studio
at the time of the murder!

274
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:52,198
How could he possibly
have done it?!

275
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:55,158
It is indeed impossible.

276
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:58,328
But it would become possible
if he used the window

277
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:04,028
in this 7th-floor storeroom
that's three floors above you.

278
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:08,258
Yes. It is possible to go from the studio
and back in under two minutes!

279
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:10,218
By using this room!

280
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:11,598
What?!

281
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,368
Camera! You're too close
to the Inspector!

282
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,698
I wonder if they'll get mad that we're
using equipment without permission...

283
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:21,148
It's just an internal broadcast.
They'll never find out.

284
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:22,068
Alright, now!

285
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,028
Sir!

286
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,198
Sorry! We'll stop them right away!

287
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,528
Who said to stop?!

288
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,238
I'll take full responsibility!

289
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,988
Broadcast this to the
whole country right now!

290
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:36,158
Allow me to shed
some light on the subject!

291
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:36,958
Hey, Conan!

292
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,068
Leave it to me!

293
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,668
Conan-kun!

294
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:45,238
Matsuo-san most likely stuck
himself out this window,

295
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:48,718
aimed down three floors
to the room in question--

296
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,818
The victim was shot
in the head here.

297
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:54,068
And the window
was practically closed,

298
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:57,978
so unless he flew,
it wouldn't be possible to--

299
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,858
Hey, Mori! What are you doing?!
I'm gonna fall!

300
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,188
Hurry and save him!

301
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:09,698
After Matsuo-san shot him like so,

302
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:14,238
he dropped the gun into the room.

303
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,068
But Mori-kun.

304
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:23,028
How did the killer get the victim
to look upwards from the window?

305
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,248
The cell phone.

306
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:29,028
The person who called the victim
right before he was shot

307
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,468
was the killer!

308
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,488
The caller probably said he was
going to jump off and commit suicide!

309
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,738
Troubled by this, the victim
quickly opened the window.

310
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:41,348
Oh? Does that
expression mean I'm right?

311
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:45,158
Then what about the bullet
holes and shells in the room?

312
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,948
Matsuo-san prepared them
in advance, of course.

313
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:50,568
If you want proof
he shot from above,

314
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,408
there's a bullet hole on the
ground beneath the window.

315
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,698
Confirm this at once!

316
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,738
Yes, sir!

317
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,118
Matsuo-san.

318
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:01,738
You left the studio
just as the video clip began

319
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,698
and came to this
7th-floor storage room.

320
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:09,718
After using said trick to kill Suwa-san
in the room three floors below,

321
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:13,618
you returned to the studio
before the video clip ended.

322
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,988
Am I right?

323
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:22,438
Do you have definitive proof
that I used this trick of yours?

324
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:23,698
Matsuo-san.

325
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:26,358
You've made one little oversight.

326
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:31,398
In your haste,
you most likely forgot to turn it off.

327
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:34,618
Yes. Your cell
phone is the proof!

328
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:40,828
I assume you know that the redial
button works if you don't turn it off!

329
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:43,538
Inspector. Give it a try.

330
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,868
It called Suwa-san's phone!

331
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:53,988
Matsuo-san.

332
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:58,638
I thought you said you didn't
know Suwa-san's number?

333
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:04,198
I put this phone on my desk
before the show!

334
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:06,188
Somebody must have used it then!

335
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,648
I'm afraid not.

336
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:11,108
I used that phone
during the show.

337
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,198
Assuming you hadn't called
anybody else afterwards,

338
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:17,158
it would've connected
with the bar I called.

339
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:21,618
Who else but yourself
could possibly use the phone

340
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,748
you put in your jacket
after I used it?!

341
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,358
Matsuo-san!

342
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:31,458
I failed.

343
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:36,678
I guess having you as today's
guest was a mistake, Mori-san.

344
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:40,448
Matsuo-san!
So you really did kill him?!

345
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,028
Yeah.

346
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:46,688
I didn't want to give up my role as the
host of the show we thought up together.

347
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,818
Suwa-san said
he thought it up himself...

348
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,528
That was the agreement.

349
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,948
He got credit for coming up
with the show's idea,

350
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:00,988
and I got to be the host.

351
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:04,178
But then he suddenly
told me to step down!

352
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:09,558
That was the last straw.

353
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,738
Looking back,
before the program began,

354
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:19,488
I had the most fun when we were
planning it out together.

355
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,618
It's like they say--
getting ready for the festival

356
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:27,068
is more fun than
the festival itself.

357
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:34,138
I guess it's too late
for that now...

358
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,538
A camera?

359
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:16,538
Well done, Mori-kun!

360
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,138
Way to go, Dad!

361
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:21,728
You truly are a great detective!

362
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:23,918
What are you talking about?

363
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:26,828
Yeah! That was brilliant reasoning!

364
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:29,248
I'll just be going now...

365
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,108
Not so fast!

366
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,168
Alright, kid, what's going on?

367
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:35,528
Yoko-chan isn't in here!

368
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:38,988
And for some reason I get sleepy
whenever I'm around you.

369
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:43,288
Come with me! You're going
to explain everything today!

370
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,208
Mori-san!

371
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,978
Yoko-chan!

372
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:49,378
I saw your incredible
detective work on the monitor!

373
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,498
I was in the middle
of taping a drama,

374
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,218
but I was so moved
I rushed right over here!

375
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,168
Uh... Err...

376
00:23:58,168 --> 00:23:59,868
That was nothing at all!

377
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:09,738
No idea what happened,
but I'm saved!

378
00:24:12,108 --> 00:24:14,608
Ran sure is dressed up...

379
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:18,408
Is she really that happy
to go on a date with me?

380
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:21,458
She can't do that!

381
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,868
I'm Kudo Shinichi!

382
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:26,118
What the--?!

383
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:31,998
A murder?

384
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:36,088
Don't tell me
that person was involved?!

385
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:38,418
On the next Conan--

386
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:42,098
The Coffee Shop Murder Case.

387
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,238
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:00,245
Next Conan's Hint:
Bathroom stall.

389
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,189
Bathroom stall.
