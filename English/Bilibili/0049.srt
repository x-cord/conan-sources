1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,590
As times change, difficult cases
will increase in number!

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,840
Shinichi's finally back today!

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
But something's not quite right!

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
He sees the single truth
for what it is,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,140
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,600
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:34,999
A high school detective from Kansai,
Hattori Heiji, suddenly appeared.

8
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,969
Seems he wants to
challenge me, Shinichi.

9
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:42,389
Just then, a diplomat's
wife showed up

10
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,559
and asked for a background
check of her son's girlfriend.

11
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:51,719
At her home, we found the diplomat
poisoned to death in his study!

12
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,939
What's more, it was
a locked room murder!

13
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,489
Hattori finds evidence
and figures out tricks,

14
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,049
but my cold and the alcohol Hattori

15
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,039
gave me caused me to collapse!

16
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,429
But there's something
not right about this fever!

17
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,669
Something's wrong!

18
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,719
I'm burning up!

19
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,879
My heart feels like it's gonna burst!

20
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:16,679
Well, Kudo?

21
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,139
If you got any problems
with my theory, show yourself!

22
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,719
Better hurry before I solve it all!

23
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:28,929
The Diplomat Murder Case (Part 2).

24
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,739
So who...

25
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,149
Who's the killer, Hattori-kun?!

26
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,019
Not so fast!

27
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,719
What's the deal, Kudo?
Forfeiting the match?

28
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,119
Fine by me...

29
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,949
C'mon! Hurry!

30
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,549
It'd take at least five or six minutes

31
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,299
to kill the victim
and pull off this trick.

32
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,919
The murder took place in

33
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,499
the thirty minutes between 3:30 and 4:00.

34
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,469
The doctor's here!

35
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,429
Conan-kun?

36
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,299
His wife is in the clear,

37
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,219
as she was with us the whole time.

38
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,229
Similarly, the butler is in the clear,

39
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,719
as he spoke with neighbors

40
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,229
the whole time at the front door,

41
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,149
and then greeted us all.

42
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,989
Hey, where are you, Conan-kun?

43
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,699
The son and girlfriend are suspicious,

44
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,299
since they arrived before
the wife and left when we arrived,

45
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,929
but they were gone
for only a minute or two.

46
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,039
Not enough time.

47
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:38,759
Where did Conan-kun run off to?

48
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,399
Conan-kun! Where are you?

49
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,139
Which leaves just the old man

50
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:52,309
who arrived after 2:00 and
watched TV in the next room over!

51
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,969
I found proof in the
Japanese-style room...

52
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:57,899
...the fishing line!

53
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:03,359
This is the latest and
strongest type of fishing line!

54
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:06,319
You're a fisherman;
don't pretend to play dumb!

55
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:12,249
Plus, on our way to this room,
we ran into you at the stairs...

56
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,749
Please wait in the
Japanese-style room.

57
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:20,799
In short, you were in the
Japanese-style room after the murder.

58
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:26,179
The fact this fishing line was
in the garbage is immutable proof!

59
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,299
Conan-kun!

60
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,759
Well?! Am I wrong?!

61
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,929
Excuse me,
but has Conan-kun been here?

62
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:33,719
No...

63
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,819
Old man!

64
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:40,269
Yes. It was me...

65
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,529
I win!

66
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:48,699
I was the one who killed my son Isao--

67
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,029
Nope, I'm afraid not.

68
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:51,619
What?!

69
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:59,749
You got it all wrong!

70
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:01,709
Kudo!

71
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,669
Shinichi...

72
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,129
Shinichi...

73
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:10,089
So this is Kudo...
Kudo Shinichi!

74
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:15,449
It's... It's really Shinichi...

75
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:18,429
Shinichi...

76
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:19,849
Where were you?!

77
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,819
You suddenly disappear
and then reappear!

78
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,719
I was... I was so worried!

79
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:27,929
Quit cryin, dummy.

80
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:28,779
Gimme a break!

81
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,969
She's right!

82
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:33,759
You show up now and say I'm wrong?

83
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,499
Are you suggesting
my theory is faulty?!

84
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,399
Hold on, Ran.

85
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,999
Eh?

86
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,419
You're sweating...

87
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,339
It'll be over soon...

88
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,169
Shinichi?

89
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:55,349
What's wrong with my theory, Kudo?!

90
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,139
The trick you just explained
is armchair theory.

91
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,649
It's 100% impossible!

92
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,429
S-Say what?!

93
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,009
Hold on, Kudo-kun.

94
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,969
I hate to interrupt,

95
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,359
but his locked room
trick works perfectly!

96
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:13,159
We even tested it
out with my own pants!

97
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,469
You take a needle-ended line,

98
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:20,289
tape the other end to the key holder,

99
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:24,679
and put the needle end through
the pants pocket from the inside.

100
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:30,469
Then you pull both ends
outside the room, lock the door,

101
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,179
and by pulling the needle end...

102
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:39,179
...the key will enter
the pocket on its own!

103
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,519
One last tug and the
line breaks free of the tape.

104
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,049
Then, by simply winding it up,
the evidence disappears

105
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,149
and creates a locked room!

106
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:53,109
Is the key really in your pocket,
Inspector Megure?

107
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,679
I heard the key was in a
double pocket in the victim's pants...

108
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:00,889
Y-Yes...

109
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:01,829
Of course it is!

110
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,799
If you think we're lying,
see for yourself!

111
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,339
See?! It's in his double--

112
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,629
That... can't be!

113
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,389
I'm certain I put the line
through his double pocket!

114
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,099
It was because Inspector Megure
was sitting when you put the key in.

115
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,229
What?!

116
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:22,969
Because he was sitting,

117
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:26,179
the pocket folded
and blocked the key's path,

118
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:31,439
and the tape came off before
it could get into the double pocket.

119
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,869
Plus the victim was heavyset,
just like Inspector Megure.

120
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,969
Now that you mention it,

121
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,249
when I put my hand
in the victim's pocket...

122
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,539
Damn, his pants are tight.

123
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:49,509
But it could happen 1 in
10,000-- no, 1 in 10 times!

124
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,009
The result would always be the same.

125
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:58,429
Recall the key's direction when
it was in the victim's double pocket.

126
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,639
The key's direction?

127
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:08,679
Yes. Even if it did get in his
double pocket 1 in 10,000 times,

128
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,569
it would only be the key holder.

129
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,389
The key couldn't possibly flip over
to join the key holder in the pocket.

130
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,199
The fact the key was fully inside

131
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:26,119
means the killer put it in
the double pocket beforehand.

132
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,589
Then what about this
needle-ended fishing line I found?!

133
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:36,299
Another trap set by the killer
to place the blame on the old man.

134
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,309
I found a handful of
others all throughout the house.

135
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,219
The killer planted
them in other rooms, too.

136
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:50,229
So that it wouldn't matter where
the old man was during the murder.

137
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,689
But he admitted to the crime!

138
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,159
He simply stepped
into the killer's trap, knowingly.

139
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,619
Though I don't know why.

140
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:05,299
This room was completely locked!

141
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,079
You're not suggesting it was suicide?!

142
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,139
No, it wasn't suicide.

143
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,009
Plus the killer's real trick is still here.

144
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,009
Real trick?

145
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:17,679
Have you forgotten?

146
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,639
When you discovered the victim,

147
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,009
an opera was playing in the room

148
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:23,809
and there were books
stacked next to the victim.

149
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,799
The opera was to drown out
the victim's possible screams

150
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,809
after being poisoned with the needle.

151
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,229
The books were to hide
his possibly-contorted face.

152
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,069
Yeah, right!

153
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:42,029
Whose eyes and ears
needed to be fooled?!

154
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:45,489
Hattori... Yours!

155
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:46,689
Say what?!

156
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:49,299
Not just you.

157
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:54,839
None of the others who came
in with you noticed, either.

158
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,959
Wait, you don't mean--!

159
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,299
When you entered the study,

160
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,929
the first one to approach the victim...

161
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,559
Yes! The killer... was you!

162
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,874
Yes! The killer...

163
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,564
...was you, Madam!

164
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,834
She killed her husband?!

165
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,484
You can't be serious!

166
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:30,424
You mean the victim
was still alive then?

167
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:35,454
Yes. She had only knocked
him out with drugs or something.

168
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:39,914
Then she poisoned him with the
needle when pretending to wake him.

169
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,924
But it was only natural
that no one noticed.

170
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:46,844
If the sleeping drug and the
poison were both powerful enough...

171
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:51,304
...the victim would die immediately
after being pricked, as if asleep.

172
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:56,644
She set up the opera
and the books just in case.

173
00:10:56,644 --> 00:11:01,174
But if this sleeping
drug turned up in an autopsy,

174
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,084
this trick would've...

175
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,174
No, we wouldn't know.

176
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:07,754
We assumed he was
dead before we entered.

177
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:12,794
We only would've known he
was knocked out before he was killed.

178
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:18,034
In other words, this was a
psychological locked room murder,

179
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:22,214
based on our assumption that
no one would ever invite a detective

180
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,624
to a locked room
and then kill someone in it!

181
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,074
That what you wanna say, Kudo?

182
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,424
Yeah...

183
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:31,004
Then let's see some proof!

184
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:35,114
Plus, I didn't see her
pull out a poisoned needle!

185
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:41,434
Yes. She took out the needle

186
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,354
in a way that
no one would notice.

187
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,794
Together with her key!

188
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:47,624
H-Her key?!

189
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:54,344
Yeah. Her key holder is of
the same design as the victim's.

190
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:59,974
Naturally,
hers should also split in two.

191
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,394
Now then,

192
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:05,934
please show us your key and
the inside of your key holder!

193
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,894
If you don't mind, Madam...

194
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:16,114
W-What is this groove?!

195
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,974
The poison needle was
likely stored in it.

196
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:24,854
She customized it so she could pull
it out right after entering the room.

197
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:28,934
In short, that very key holder

198
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,544
is definitive proof
that she is the killer!

199
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,054
But why would she kill her husband?!

200
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,774
If my hunch is correct,

201
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:43,394
her motive is in this photograph.

202
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,024
This is from when
she was still young...

203
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,814
Look closer, Inspector.

204
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:53,774
Doesn't she look like someone?

205
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,734
She looks just like Yukiko-san!

206
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,314
That's absurd!

207
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:01,364
See? Only her
hair is a different color!

208
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,934
Of course she looks like me.

209
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:07,704
I'm... Yukiko's mother!

210
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:09,084
Eh?!

211
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,204
What?!

212
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,674
T-That can't be!

213
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,354
Then you had her
with your husband, Isao-san?

214
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:19,594
No. Yukiko is my daughter
from my previous marriage.

215
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,814
Yes! She's the daughter of
Yamashiro Kenji, a diplomat outcast

216
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:31,394
from society by my current husband
Tsujimura Isao twenty years ago!

217
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,194
Yamashiro Kenji?!

218
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:36,684
Yes, the man who died
in prison twenty years ago.

219
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:40,434
Tsujimura's goal was to get rid of him,

220
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,654
since he was a rival diplomat!

221
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:46,914
And then to obtain me as his wife!

222
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:49,604
My husband was arrested,

223
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,224
and Yukiko was adopted by his family.

224
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:55,524
Having hit rock bottom mentally,

225
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,714
I... I broke up with my wife just for you.

226
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:03,604
Tsujimura cajoled me,

227
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:07,224
and I wound up
wife to that devilish man!

228
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:14,354
I realized it all when Takayoshi-san
brought home a photo of Yukiko.

229
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:19,324
At first, I thought it was just an
uncanny resemblance, but Tsujimura...

230
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:26,534
Never! I refuse to let him
be with the daughter of that man!

231
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:29,894
Shocked, I continued to press him,

232
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:35,254
and he started to talk about how
he framed Yamashiro for corruption.

233
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:40,214
And that his father had assisted with it.

234
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,104
I'm sorry, Kimie-san.

235
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:45,934
I wasn't thinking
straight back then...

236
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,604
I see.

237
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:56,564
You purposely took her bait
to try to make up for your past...

238
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,984
There is no use in
pretending to be good, Father.

239
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:05,994
Because he left this life as
an innocent man who was framed.

240
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:11,784
Takayoshi-san.

241
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,704
Y-Yes?

242
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:18,934
I know I'm not fit to say this now,

243
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,714
but please take care of Yukiko.

244
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,134
Y-Yeah...

245
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:29,144
Ah. So she was
harsh with her daughter

246
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:33,304
so that she wouldn't realize.

247
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:35,524
Hey, Kudo!

248
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,314
Shinichi!
Hey, Kudo!

249
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:37,374
Kudo!

250
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:38,694
Are you okay, Shinichi?!

251
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,904
Yeah, it's just my cold...

252
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:46,974
But how'd you know all
those details about the case?

253
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:49,074
You had to have
been spying from nearby...

254
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:53,954
Get real. That kid with the
glasses told me on the phone.

255
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,684
You mean Conan-kun?!

256
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:56,374
Yeah...

257
00:15:56,854 --> 00:16:01,184
Said there was a weird detective
from Osaka and to come right away.

258
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:07,684
S-S-So I finished up the case
I was on, hopped on a train--

259
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,184
Liar!

260
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:14,934
He told me it's weird that you
don't ask how I am on the phone!

261
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,854
You were actually
nearby, weren't you?

262
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,564
I bet you were watching
how worried I was and laughing!

263
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,774
Hey, now, Ran!

264
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,734
Why would you do that?!

265
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:30,244
I'm this... this...

266
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:32,204
Don't underestimate me, now.

267
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,204
I'm a detective.

268
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,164
I can tell plenty
just from your voice.

269
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,394
Shinichi! Hold on!
I'll go get the doctor!

270
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:53,184
So my reasoning was
wrong from the very start...

271
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:56,014
I lose in every which way this time.

272
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,934
You're good, Kudo.

273
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,184
Your logic's one level above mine.

274
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:00,944
Don't be dumb.

275
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:05,904
There's no winning, losing, above,
or below when it comes to logic...

276
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:14,104
After all...
there's always only one truth...

277
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:20,334
That's true.

278
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:25,294
Guess I was so focused
on our match that I lost my cool.

279
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:30,214
Hey, Kudo!
Are you sure it's just a cold?!

280
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:31,484
Kudo!

281
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,304
Hey, Kudo! You alright?!

282
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,054
Hurry, Doctor!

283
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,854
N-Not good...

284
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:39,934
Hey, Kudo!

285
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,684
My heart again!

286
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,904
I'm burning up!

287
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,854
It's like my bones are melting!

288
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,364
Hey! Kudo!

289
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:57,274
Don't tell me I'm turning back...

290
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,454
After I finally returned to normal!

291
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:04,424
Am I turning back into that kid...
into Conan again?!

292
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:07,464
Shinichi!

293
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:08,684
R-Ran!

294
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:11,434
You know you shouldn't
be moving around!

295
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:12,304
You're sick!

296
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:16,604
Oh no! If I turn into Conan now,

297
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:19,024
Ran will discover my identity...

298
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,434
Shinichi!

299
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:30,324
It's just his coat! Shinichi!

300
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:34,284
Please! Don't make me turn back!

301
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:35,814
At least let me tell Ran...

302
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,204
Shinichi!

303
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:38,704
...with my real mouth

304
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,914
and my real voice...

305
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:46,004
...just one last thing!

306
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:53,464
Shinichi?!

307
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:55,304
From in there?!

308
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,934
Shinichi!

309
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,644
Conan-kun?

310
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:10,024
Where were you?! I looked all over!
And where'd you get that shirt?

311
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,434
Oh, I was all sweaty,

312
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,074
so I borrowed this from that room...

313
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:17,034
Say, have you seen Shinichi?

314
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:21,704
Shinichi-niichan said he
remembered a new case and...

315
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:22,684
Eh?

316
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:25,644
He changed clothes
and went out the front door.

317
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:26,624
That jerk!

318
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:35,854
And he also said not to tell
anyone he was involved with this case...

319
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:40,514
H-Hey! Conan-kun!

320
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:42,684
Conan-kun?!

321
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:19,444
After that, I was in
bed for three days straight.

322
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:22,574
During that time,
Hattori Heiji went back to Osaka,

323
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,624
and thanks to my request
to Ran right before I fainted,

324
00:21:25,624 --> 00:21:29,544
Kudo Shinichi's name
didn't appear in the papers.

325
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:36,574
Now the men in black who
shrunk me won't find out I'm alive.

326
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:42,064
But how did I turn back
into my high school form?

327
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:47,264
Wait a minute! As I recall,
he showed up, and then...

328
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:51,854
And then I drank that
alcohol he brought!

329
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,734
That's it!

330
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:00,604
That's gotta be it!

331
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:03,034
I turned back by drinking that alcohol!

332
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,824
Alright! There's still a lot left!

333
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,104
One drink caused that!

334
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:12,104
If I drink this all,
I can turn back completely!

335
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:13,964
Hey, you!

336
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,604
What're you drinking, Conan-kun?!

337
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:21,184
Just as I thought! Alcohol!

338
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:27,314
You know kids aren't
supposed to drink alcohol!

339
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,104
Don't be stupid!
I'm a 2nd-year high schooler!

340
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:32,314
Wait, that's still underage...

341
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:34,234
Hurry and change your clothes.

342
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,024
Huh?

343
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:37,024
Your friends are here!

344
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,014
Conan-kun!

345
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:41,184
Conan!

346
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:42,274
Conan-kun!

347
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:44,654
Not you guys again...

348
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,604
We were so worried!

349
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:49,124
You were sick for three days!

350
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:52,434
You're so lucky you could skip school.

351
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:53,644
Maybe I'll catch a cold, too!

352
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:56,184
You'll never catch a cold, Genta-kun!

353
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:57,184
Why's that?

354
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:59,714
It's like they say,
"Stupid people don't catch--"

355
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,924
It's good that you're
back to normal now!

356
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,554
Man, I'm back to how I was...

357
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:10,524
So why do we have
to go to the library now?

358
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:16,394
You're the only one who hasn't
turned in a book report for class!

359
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:20,024
So we figured we'd help you out! Right?

360
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:20,984
Yeah!
Yeah!

361
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:27,524
Whatever. Genta and Mitsuhiko
are just sticking with Ayumi-chan...

362
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:29,704
But I guess I should go with 'em.

363
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,104
Once I drink that alcohol and
turn back into a high school student,

364
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:41,004
I might never get to
hang out with them again...

365
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:47,474
Actually, Tamada-san has
been missing since two nights ago.

366
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:55,604
I-Idiot! Don't turn the lights on!

367
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,654
That's it! I know where
the body is hidden!

368
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:09,604
On the next Conan--

369
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,231
Next Conan's Hint:
"The Library Murder Case."

370
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:16,237
Next Conan's Hint:
"The Library Murder Case."
Backwards Book.

371
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,812
Backwards Book.
