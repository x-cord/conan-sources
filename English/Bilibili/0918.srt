"Naeko Miike, Yumi Miyamoto, MPD Traffic Department"

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.070
The city's so peaceful.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.370
It really is.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.470
Maybe there will be some really big case,

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.270
like in a drama.

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.170
Don't say such ominous things.

7
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.570
I was joking.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.470
Besides, we'd never get the chance

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.870
to participate in a case that big.

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.470
You're right.

11
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
The man you love might, though.

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.970
Hey, it's a food festival!

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.770
"Dominating the nation!" -It's almost lunch.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.270
"Food festival!" -Why don't we stop by?

15
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.770
We can't.

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.170
We still have lots to do once we get back to the station.

17
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.170
A short stop wouldn't hurt.

18
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.170
Cheapskate.

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.970
Wait!

20
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.270
What are you shouting about?

21
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.070
-Did something happen? -I'm glad you're here!

22
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.570
Chase that car that just left!

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.970
-Genta has been kidnapped! -Genta has been kidnapped!

25
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.670
-What? -What?

26
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.970

How will they handle this shocking case?

He sees through the one and only truth.

"The Mini-Patrol Car Police's Big Chase"

34
00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:28.727
You came to the department store to go shopping at the food festival,

35
00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:30.627
and Genta went missing?

36
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.027
-Yes. -Yeah.

37
00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:34.827
While we were looking for him...

38
00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:36.827
Hey, Genta!

39
00:03:36.827 --> 00:03:38.627
Where are you?

40
00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:42.027
Genta, where did you go?

41
00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:43.927
Genta!

42
00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:50.827
He doesn't seem to be here.

43
00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:55.827
What's this?

44
00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:02.827
Genta!

45
00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:06.127
And that was the car that just left?

46
00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:09.827
Yeah. We found this on the ground.

47
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:11.527
What is that?

48
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:13.127
There's blood on it.

49
00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:16.027
-What? -Maybe Genta...

50
00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:18.027
Got stabbed.

51
00:04:18.027 --> 00:04:21.227
That reminds me of those historical dramas.

52
00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:25.627
Like, "It's nothing to do with me".

53
00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:31.227
Yumi, don't scare the children.

54
00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:34.427
Oh, sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood.

55
00:04:34.427 --> 00:04:36.027
You're not lightening anything.

56
00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.327
Really?

57
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.927
And she's mixing up her references.

58
00:04:39.927 --> 00:04:42.827
Ms. Yumi, please save Genta!

59
00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:45.627
-Please! -Leave it to me.

60
00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:50.627
No one's escaped from my mini-patrol car on these streets before!

61
00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:53.427
Yumi, let's contact HQ.

62
00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:55.427
We can do that later.

63
00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.727
Genta. Can you hear me, Genta?

64
00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:00.027
If you can hear us, say something, Genta!

65
00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:03.027
The kidnappers will hear you.

66
00:05:06.327 --> 00:05:08.027
I heard something.

67
00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:13.327
What is that?

68
00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:17.727
I recognize that sound.

69
00:05:17.727 --> 00:05:19.727
Could it be...

70
00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:22.027
I know! It's his stomach growling!

71
00:05:22.027 --> 00:05:25.127
You're right. It's the sound of Genta's stomach growling.

72
00:05:25.127 --> 00:05:27.627
He's probably responding

73
00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.327
with his stomach's growls because he can't speak.

74
00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.127
His stomach's growls?

75
00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.527
I'm glad he seems to be doing fine.

76
00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:41.427
I'm hungry.

77
00:05:41.427 --> 00:05:43.527
This brat.

78
00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:46.527
He's so carefree, his stomach's growling.

79
00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:48.127
More importantly,

80
00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:53.127
once we finish this job, they said we'd be paid out generously.

81
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:55.627
Yeah, real generously.

82
00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:58.627
I'm excited. What should I buy?

83
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:02.727
"Mitsuo Kawamata (35)" -But what are we going to do with this kid?

84
00:06:02.727 --> 00:06:04.627
He's a nuisance.

85
00:06:04.627 --> 00:06:06.927
"Sho Iguchi (24)" -He overheard us talking,

86
00:06:06.927 --> 00:06:08.227
and he's seen our faces.

87
00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:11.327
We can't just let him go alive.

88
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:12.727
Nope.

89
00:06:15.127 --> 00:06:19.427
Darn. We're supposed to clean up on diamonds today, too.

90
00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:20.427
Wait.

91
00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:23.327
Did he just say they're cleaning up on diamonds?

92
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:25.227
Could it be...

93
00:06:25.227 --> 00:06:27.727
They're jewel thieves!

94
00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:31.127
Genta's been kidnapped by thieves?

95
00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:32.527
I see.

96
00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:34.527
They kidnapped Genta

97
00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.327
because he overheard them plotting to steal diamonds.

98
00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:39.627
Then we should hurry.

99
00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:43.027
They said they couldn't let him go alive.

100
00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:46.527
Genta's car is heading towards Teitan Elementary School.

101
00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:49.627
All right. We'll cut them off and arrest them!

102
00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:51.627
Miike, take that left!

103
00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:53.227
What? Yes, madam.

104
00:06:56.827 --> 00:06:58.627
Next right!

105
00:06:58.627 --> 00:06:59.627
Yes!

106
00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:09.527
Can we make it through here?

107
00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.527
It'll be fine. Trust me.

108
00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:13.727
Take that right!

109
00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:19.827
Hey, you're right. It's Teitan Elementary School.

110
00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:23.927
That was amazing.

111
00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:25.727
What did I tell you?

112
00:07:25.727 --> 00:07:26.727
That car!

113
00:07:28.727 --> 00:07:30.227
Full speed ahead!

114
00:07:30.227 --> 00:07:31.727
Got it!

115
00:07:34.027 --> 00:07:35.827
Emergency vehicle coming through.

116
00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:37.527
Please clear the road.

117
00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:39.127
Emergency vehicle coming through.

118
00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:40.827
Please clear the road.

119
00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:45.727
That mini-patrol car isn't coming after us, is it?

120
00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:51.427
It's got nothing to do with us.

121
00:07:51.427 --> 00:07:54.727
Some idiot must've been caught speeding.

122
00:07:54.727 --> 00:07:56.227
Emergency vehicle coming through!

123
00:07:56.227 --> 00:07:58.327
Clear the road!

124
00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:00.427
We're not making any progress.

125
00:08:02.227 --> 00:08:06.627
Hey! Get out of the way!

126
00:08:08.027 --> 00:08:10.227
We appreciate your cooperation.

127
00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:13.527
Her voice is louder than the siren.

128
00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:17.827
You in the gray van! Stop!

129
00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:19.727
They are after us!

130
00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:21.027
Run!

131
00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:26.527
You can't escape.

132
00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:27.527
Go!

133
00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:42.127
Farewell.

134
00:08:42.127 --> 00:08:43.827
Make a u-turn!

135
00:08:43.827 --> 00:08:44.827
Got it!

136
00:08:49.627 --> 00:08:51.427
You're mine!

137
00:08:55.127 --> 00:08:57.727
-Drive across! -Got it!

138
00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:01.827
We can't do that.

139
00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:07.427
But we almost caught them!

140
00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:15.027
How long are they going to make us wait?

141
00:09:15.027 --> 00:09:16.427
Hurry...

142
00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:21.027
Go!

143
00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:26.627
Where did they go?

144
00:09:26.627 --> 00:09:28.227
We lost them.

145
00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:30.027
Conan, which way?

146
00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:32.727
Right. They're heading towards the harbor.

147
00:09:32.727 --> 00:09:34.327
Got it.

148
00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:37.227
All right. We'll catch up before long.

149
00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:39.927
I hope Genta's okay.

150
00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:42.227
Genta! Genta!

151
00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:44.927
-Genta! -Guys, be quiet.

152
00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:48.527
Genta?

153
00:09:57.027 --> 00:09:58.727
I got it off.

154
00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:00.127
Genta.

155
00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:01.727
You're all right.

156
00:10:01.727 --> 00:10:06.427
Yeah. I thought we were going to eat some good food.

157
00:10:07.527 --> 00:10:09.527
Why are you talking to yourself?

158
00:10:17.427 --> 00:10:18.827
What's this?

159
00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.527
Genta, help is on the way.

160
00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:22.727
You just wait.

161
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.927
Hey, what's going on?

162
00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:26.627
Crap. They noticed.

163
00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.427
Do you think we're idiots?

164
00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:33.127
Don't!

165
00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:48.794
What's this?

166
00:10:48.794 --> 00:10:51.394
Genta, help is on the way.

167
00:10:51.394 --> 00:10:52.694
You just wait.

168
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.294
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:10:56.694 --> 00:10:59.594
Do you think we're idiots?

170
00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:04.494
-Don't! -Genta!

171
00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:06.294
-Genta! -Genta!

172
00:11:07.594 --> 00:11:09.694
Genta. Hey, Genta!

173
00:11:09.694 --> 00:11:11.594
Genta. Genta!

174
00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:13.994
Genta, are you okay?

175
00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:15.294
Darn.

176
00:11:15.294 --> 00:11:17.394
My tracking glasses aren't working.

177
00:11:17.394 --> 00:11:19.494
His badge must be broken.

178
00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:20.794
What should we do?

179
00:11:20.794 --> 00:11:22.794
What can we do?

180
00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:25.994
Now we don't know where Genta is.

181
00:11:25.994 --> 00:11:29.094
We need to save him soon. Otherwise Genta...

182
00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.294
That cooler.

183
00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:40.794
What about the cooler?

184
00:11:40.794 --> 00:11:43.594
While we were searching the department store for Genta,

185
00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:45.894
I saw two men transporting coolers

186
00:11:45.894 --> 00:11:48.894
that looked just like the ones in that car.

187
00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:51.594
They were an unusual color, so I remember them well.

188
00:11:52.594 --> 00:11:55.994
Those men kidnapped Genta.

189
00:11:55.994 --> 00:11:58.994
And? Do you know where they're going?

190
00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:02.494
They were using hand signals to communicate with each other.

191
00:12:02.494 --> 00:12:05.394
I think they looked like this.

192
00:12:12.694 --> 00:12:16.494
Doesn't that mean "gun"?

193
00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:18.994
What?

194
00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:22.494
Wait, they have guns?

195
00:12:22.494 --> 00:12:23.594
What should we do?

196
00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:25.694
Are they going to shoot Genta?

197
00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:29.994
No, they were probably communicating the location of the job

198
00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:31.594
to the person standing next to me.

199
00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:34.894
I see. So that's where it is.

200
00:12:34.894 --> 00:12:37.794
"Shintaro Horikawa (43)" -Got it.

201
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.694
He's probably working with them.

202
00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:46.494
Then if we figure out what these signals mean,

203
00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:48.794
then we might know where they're headed.

204
00:12:48.794 --> 00:12:51.094
Yeah. And before we lost sight of them,

205
00:12:51.094 --> 00:12:54.094
their car was heading towards the harbor.

206
00:12:54.094 --> 00:12:55.794
-Which means... -I've got it!

207
00:12:55.794 --> 00:12:58.494
This means two, and this means one.

208
00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:00.394
Two and one?

209
00:13:00.394 --> 00:13:03.294
Isn't this two and one?

210
00:13:03.294 --> 00:13:05.394
That's it. It's Conan style.

211
00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:08.194
Yes.

212
00:13:08.194 --> 00:13:10.294
When using your fingers to count,

213
00:13:10.294 --> 00:13:13.794
in Japan we start with the index finger and raise one at a time.

214
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:17.194
But in Europe, they start with their thumbs.

215
00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:18.494
Right?

216
00:13:18.494 --> 00:13:19.794
Yeah.

217
00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:22.594
I see. It's those fingers.

218
00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.794
That's exactly what a certain someone

219
00:13:25.794 --> 00:13:28.494
influenced by his Gallicized mother does.

220
00:13:28.494 --> 00:13:31.394
This gesture means three, right?

221
00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:34.894
Yeah. That's three, but this is two.

222
00:13:35.894 --> 00:13:37.594
But...

223
00:13:37.594 --> 00:13:40.994
In other words, those signs meant "two" and "one."

224
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:43.194
They're referring to 21.

225
00:13:43.194 --> 00:13:44.594
Combine that with the fact

226
00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:47.594
that the car is heading towards the harbor, and...

227
00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:51.894
That's it. The number 21 in the direction of the harbor means...

228
00:13:51.894 --> 00:13:53.094
I get it now.

229
00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:57.394
They're heading towards warehouse 21 at the harbor.

230
00:13:57.394 --> 00:13:59.294
That's right.

231
00:14:00.394 --> 00:14:02.394
Their thinking's not wrong,

232
00:14:03.394 --> 00:14:04.794
but there's still something...

233
00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:06.894
Come to think of it, at the department store...

234
00:14:09.194 --> 00:14:11.394
I see. So that's where it is.

235
00:14:12.694 --> 00:14:14.094
Got it.

236
00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:18.894
The smell of fish?

237
00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:24.294
"Eel" -It's the smell of eel.

238
00:14:25.294 --> 00:14:27.194
I see. Then this must be...

239
00:14:28.194 --> 00:14:29.894
Ms. Yumi, hold on!

240
00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:30.894
What?

241
00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:34.994
What is it, Conan?

242
00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:36.794
It's not the number 21?

243
00:14:36.794 --> 00:14:41.794
No. Those hand signals aren't the European style of counting.

244
00:14:41.794 --> 00:14:45.194
They're the secret hand signals used at auctions.

245
00:14:45.194 --> 00:14:46.594
Secret hand signals?

246
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.794
Those signals used to indicate prices at auctions?

247
00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:54.894
Yeah. When the man they were signaling walked past me,

248
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.994
I caught a faint whiff of eel.

249
00:14:56.994 --> 00:14:59.994
Does that mean he was eating eel?

250
00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:02.394
Not the smell of broiled eel.

251
00:15:02.394 --> 00:15:03.894
A fishy smell.

252
00:15:03.894 --> 00:15:07.594
And this is a punch that's used for butchering eels.

253
00:15:07.594 --> 00:15:10.894
Does that mean they're eel vendors?

254
00:15:10.894 --> 00:15:12.894
-Yeah. -I see.

255
00:15:12.894 --> 00:15:15.794
Eel vendors would know the secret hand signals of auctions.

256
00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:18.394
So, what number do those signals mean?

257
00:15:18.394 --> 00:15:22.794
The hand signals differ slightly between markets,

258
00:15:22.794 --> 00:15:25.894
but in Tokyo, one through five

259
00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:28.294
are expressed normally with your fingers.

260
00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:31.194
This is six, and this is seven.

261
00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:34.594
Got it. So it's 76.

262
00:15:34.594 --> 00:15:37.594
Miike, head to warehouse 76 immediately.

263
00:15:37.594 --> 00:15:38.594
Got it.

264
00:15:43.094 --> 00:15:45.594
-Genta. -Genta.

265
00:15:46.594 --> 00:15:48.494
We'll rescue you soon.

266
00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:05.394
Okay.

267
00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:08.994
"Shunpei Matsuno (38)" -I accept your white diamonds.

268
00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:09.994
Here.

269
00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:10.994
Thanks.

270
00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.594
That concludes our deal.

271
00:16:20.594 --> 00:16:22.494
I'll let you know if I need anything else.

272
00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:23.594
Sure.

273
00:16:23.594 --> 00:16:26.894
Now what should we do about him?

274
00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:36.394
Hey, I'm hungry.

275
00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:38.294
Feed me.

276
00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:40.794
What are you talking about?

277
00:16:40.794 --> 00:16:44.194
Do you not understand the position you're in?

278
00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:46.194
What are you doing?

279
00:16:46.194 --> 00:16:48.994
There's only one thing for us to do.

280
00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:51.594
Haven't you ever seen one of these

281
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.294
in a police drama before?

282
00:16:55.194 --> 00:16:57.394
No hard feelings.

283
00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.894
Genta!

284
00:17:11.894 --> 00:17:13.794
-Conan! -What?

285
00:17:18.094 --> 00:17:19.894
Jewel thieves!

286
00:17:19.894 --> 00:17:21.994
Don't attempt to resist arrest!

287
00:17:21.994 --> 00:17:23.094
What?

288
00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:25.994
You're not making any sense.

289
00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:28.394
The jig's already up.

290
00:17:28.394 --> 00:17:29.394
Darn.

291
00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:31.894
It's just a couple of women and some kids.

292
00:17:31.894 --> 00:17:32.994
Get them!

293
00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:35.894
Don't underestimate the police!

294
00:17:40.594 --> 00:17:41.794
Darn it.

295
00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:45.894
I learned this from Miwako!

296
00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:47.194
German...

297
00:17:48.894 --> 00:17:50.394
You're too fat.

298
00:17:53.894 --> 00:17:56.694
German suplex!

299
00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:01.994
Got them.

300
00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:03.594
Got them?

301
00:18:04.694 --> 00:18:06.094
That was so cool.

302
00:18:08.894 --> 00:18:14.094
There. Speeding, illegal passing, illegal crossing,

303
00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:16.194
and entering a closed railway crossing.

304
00:18:16.594 --> 00:18:18.794
-What? -You're arresting us for that?

305
00:18:18.794 --> 00:18:21.894
That's just for now.

306
00:18:21.894 --> 00:18:23.894
Division one will show up soon.

307
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.194
They'll put you through the wringer then.

308
00:18:29.694 --> 00:18:31.794
Genta, you're okay.

309
00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:34.294
Yeah, thanks.

310
00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:35.294
What's that?

311
00:18:37.494 --> 00:18:39.394
Those are whitebait eels.

312
00:18:39.394 --> 00:18:42.094
What? Whitebait eels?

313
00:18:42.094 --> 00:18:43.794
They're juvenile eels.

314
00:18:43.794 --> 00:18:46.994
They grow up into regular eels.

315
00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:51.394
There are all eels?

316
00:18:56.294 --> 00:18:59.294
Why don't you let those two go?

317
00:18:59.294 --> 00:19:01.994
There he is. The final boss of the jewel thief gang.

318
00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:04.694
Hey, you! Division one is on its way!

319
00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:06.394
You won't be able to escape!

320
00:19:06.394 --> 00:19:09.894
Don't you care what happens to him?

321
00:19:15.394 --> 00:19:16.694
-Genta. -Genta.

322
00:19:37.394 --> 00:19:39.494
-Genta! -Are you okay?

323
00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:42.394
Yeah. I thought I was going to die.

324
00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:45.094
I'm glad you're okay.

325
00:19:45.094 --> 00:19:47.394
The eels are okay, too.

326
00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:49.394
But why eels?

327
00:19:49.394 --> 00:19:53.794
Where are the diamonds?

328
00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.694
Apparently, they're part of an organization

329
00:21:29.694 --> 00:21:32.194
that smuggles protected whitebait eels

330
00:21:32.194 --> 00:21:35.194
that are illegal to export overseas.

331
00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:38.094
So they weren't jewel thieves.

332
00:21:38.094 --> 00:21:41.494
But didn't they say they'd clean up on diamonds?

333
00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:44.194
Come to think of it, they did.

334
00:21:44.194 --> 00:21:47.094
The number of whitebait eels has declined sharply recently.

335
00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:49.794
Since they're traded at such a high price,

336
00:21:49.794 --> 00:21:52.094
they're referred to as white diamonds.

337
00:21:52.094 --> 00:21:54.294
White diamonds?

338
00:21:54.294 --> 00:21:57.294
The diamonds they were talking about

339
00:21:57.294 --> 00:21:59.794
were whitebait eels.

340
00:22:02.294 --> 00:22:05.994
And I stopped that deal from happening.

341
00:22:05.994 --> 00:22:07.594
I knew I could do it.

342
00:22:07.594 --> 00:22:08.694
What?

343
00:22:08.694 --> 00:22:10.494
What are you talking about?

344
00:22:10.494 --> 00:22:13.494
You thought they were jewel thieves.

345
00:22:13.494 --> 00:22:14.894
Yeah!

346
00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:17.694
And this only happened because I got kidnapped?

347
00:22:17.694 --> 00:22:19.394
Because you got kidnapped?

348
00:22:19.394 --> 00:22:22.094
Well, I'm the one who arrested them.

349
00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.894
You were really cool.

350
00:22:24.894 --> 00:22:26.194
Right?

351
00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:28.994
I'm just glad things turned out okay this time.

352
00:22:30.694 --> 00:22:32.294
Hello, Dr. Agasa?

353
00:22:33.594 --> 00:22:35.794
Yeah, we saved him.

354
00:22:36.894 --> 00:22:38.994
Yeah. Yeah, got it.

355
00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:43.394
Dr. Agasa said he'll treat us to eel

356
00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:46.394
since we didn't buy anything at the food festival.

357
00:22:46.394 --> 00:22:48.394
All right!

358
00:22:49.394 --> 00:22:50.594
I'm hungry.

359
00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:52.794
I'm starving.

360
00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:55.094
I'm so hungry I could die.

361
00:22:55.094 --> 00:22:57.394
Hey, make sure you savor the taste.

362
00:22:57.394 --> 00:23:00.394
Japanese eels are an endangered species.

363
00:23:00.394 --> 00:23:02.194
An endangered species?

364
00:23:02.194 --> 00:23:05.394
You mean they might go extinct?

365
00:23:05.394 --> 00:23:07.094
What?

366
00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:11.394
Are the eels gone because you ate too many of them?

367
00:23:11.394 --> 00:23:12.694
That must be it.

368
00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:14.094
Seriously?

369
00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:18.094
I doubt that.

370
00:23:18.094 --> 00:23:21.794

00:23:21.794 --> 00:23:23.994
Is Genta "availabeel"?

00:23:23.994 --> 00:23:26.494
Eel...

373
00:23:26.494 --> 00:23:28.394
Genta is "availabeel".

374
00:23:28.394 --> 00:23:30.394
In English, the word for unagi is eel.

375
00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.294
Genta is "availabeel".

Gosh. Some old men can't resist "deelivering" stupid jokes.

Yumi, we still have work to do!

00:23:46.094 --> 00:23:48.294
And what's manyu?

381
00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.894
Why'd she switch to Chinese?

382
00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:57.594
"Next Episode" -I'm so excited.

383
00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:03.794
She took a book from the shelf.

384
00:24:09.094 --> 00:24:11.394
What was that scream?

385
00:24:13.194 --> 00:24:15.394
What's going on?

386
00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:20.394

00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:24.294
"The High School Girl Trio's Secret Cafe (Part 1)"

388
00:24:24.837 --> 00:24:27.237

Try not to kill them off.
